"By . Andy Hampson . Scotland's Kirsty Gilmour fell short in her quest for gold at the Commonwealth Games as she lost 2-0 to Canada's Michelle Li in the women's singles final. Glasgow-based Gilmour, the second seed, was unable to impose herself on the third seed at the Emirates Arena and had to settle for silver as she went down 21-14 21-6. The match, between the players ranked 17th and 19th in the world, was expected to be evenly contested but it proved anything but as Gilmour was outplayed. Contrasting emotions: Michelle Li (left) beat Kirsty Gilmour to win gold in their women's badminton singles final . The 20-year-old Scot slumped to the ground after losing the final point - handing Canada a first gold in women's singles - after 38 minutes. Afterwards Gilmour admitted her emotionally-draining semi-final win over Jing Yi Tee, which she finished in style by reeling off 10 successive points, had taken its toll. Gilmour said: 'I'm trying to be disappointed but everyone's being so positive. 'It's not that I don't care, but I've got a silver medal round my neck and I'm delighted. Second best: Scotland's Gilmour celebrates her silver medal in front of her home crowd at the Emirates Arena . History maker: Li's win was Canada's first Commonwealth gold in a badminton women's singles final . 'Obviously I wanted to go one better but Michelle was on fire and I had no answer. 'I gave so much concentration-wise yesterday for those last 10 points - probably the most I have ever concentrated in my whole life - to have to knuckle down and reproduce it was a bit of an ask. 'I gave my best but maybe I was just not 100 per cent there.' Despite Gilmour's defeat, Scotland can still reflect on their most successful badminton showing at a Commonwealth Games, in terms of medals, since 1986. Imogen Bankier and Robert Blair were the other pair to register on the medal table after taking bronze in the mixed doubles. In terms of legacy there will also be high hopes for the future after 11 days of competitive action in the city in front of enthusiastic crowds. Outclassed: Gilmour was beaten 21-14 21-6 in 38 minutes by her opponent . Gilmour now returns to normality and an essay she has to write as part of her screenwriting and film course at the West of Scotland University. She said: 'It's a film pitch - I don't actually have to make the film - and it's on the effects of the referendum on Scottish sport. 'It's due in on the 14th, and then I think we leave for the World Championships on the 21st. 'So, no rest for the wicked. I'll just try to enjoy this for the next few days.'","Scotland's Kirsty Gilmour won silver in the women's badminton singles final .

"By . Mark Staniforth, Press Association . Antony Fowler is convinced his concussive charge to Commonwealth Games boxing success in Glasgow will help him step out of the shadows of his more famous cousin. The 23-year-old is related to former Liverpool footballer Robbie but is quickly making a name for himself after rounding off a dominant campaign in the 20,000-capacity Hydro. Fowler dominated his middleweight final against India's former Olympic bronze medallist Vijender, flooring his opponent on his way to a wide points win. Clincher: Antony Fowler beat India's former Olympic bronze medallist Vijender . Easy: A flurry of sharp hooks dumped Vijender on the canvas midway through the opening round . He said: 'I want to be my own man. Football has 11 players but I'm doing it all my own - I'm my own person.' A flurry of sharp hooks dumped Vijender on the canvas midway through the opening round, with the Indian complaining he had been hit while on the deck. A right hook on the bell to end the round underlined Fowler's dominance, and although Vijender drew on his experience to drag himself back into the fight his moments of success were too fleeting to seriously threaten to turn the fight around. The final minute of the third arguably proved Vijender's most successful as he rammed home a straight left, but there was never any doubt that the Liverpool fighter would get the unanimous verdict. Lapping it up: Fowler was all smiles when collecting his gold medal on Saturday evening . Fowler made no excuses for his combative style which is already stirring the interest of professional promoters although the 23-year-old is intent on crowning his amateur career with gold in Rio in 2016. Fowler added: 'When I was an 11-year-old boy I saw guys winning the Commonwealth bronze and thought they were superstars - 12 years later I'm here winning gold and I'm so proud of myself. 'I might have looked like I was trying to knock him out but that was me trying to coast - he hit me with some of his big shots and I thought 'no way'. 'It's been nine months work - I didn't drink over Christmas and I was in the gym Christmas Eve. I've had two weeks off since then. 'I was levels above the people here and this is just the start for me - I'm a man on the mission and I'm going to the Olympics.'","Robbie Fowler's cousin is insistent he can kick on .

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . Stuart Broad admitted he had never seen anything like it as India collapsed to a sensational eight for four on the first morning of the fourth Investec Test in Manchester. The Indians were eventually skittled for 152, with a Test-record six batsmen making ducks and Broad taking six for 25. England closed on 113 for three, having lost Gary Ballance in the final over of a pulsating day. Broad, who confirmed he will have an operation on his right knee — either at the end of this series or the one-dayers which follow — said: ‘It felt like we could get a wicket any ball. To have them eight for four — I can’t remember when we’ve knocked over a top order like that. VIDEO Scroll down for Stuart Broad's six-wicket blitz puts England in command . Six-wickets: Broad enjoys the adulation of the Old Trafford crowd after walking off with the match ball . Enthusiastic: Jimmy Anderson screams in appeal during England's brilliant bowling performance on Thursday . ‘We got lucky with the overheads in the morning, when it became quite cloudy and heavy. But we weren’t lucky when it came to the skills we produced. With the nicks carrying, it was a huge advantage for us.’ Broad and Jimmy Anderson — who finished with three for 46 and barely said a word all day after the sledging rumpus ahead of this game — struck twice each as India lost their first four wickets without adding a run in the space of 13 scarcely believable deliveries. ‘When it’s swinging like that, Jimmy’s got it on a string both ways. He bowled beautifully and looks in great rhythm. And lots of his runs came from nicks to third man.’ Ducks: Murali Vijay, left, and Cheteshwar Pujara, right, leave the pitch after scoring 0 runs for India . VIDEO India can still comeback - Ashwin . Broad has faced speculation all summer about the tendinitis of the patella he has been suffering, and a specialist will arrive from Sweden at the end of next week’s final Test at The Oval to determine the precise date of the operation. He may be out for anything up to three-and-a-half months, but insisted he would be fit for the World Cup early next year. On Thursday, he bowled as if surgery was the last thing on his mind, and sang the praises of the Old Trafford pitch. ‘It was brilliant to challenge the batsmen on the front foot knowing the nicks would carry,’ he said. Bowled: India batsman Bhuvneshwar Kumar looks on after he is bowled by Stuart Broad in the fourth Test . ‘The top order didn’t get time to settle, and the bouncer went through pretty well too. When we lost the toss, I was a bit disappointed, but it turned out to be a fantastic toss to lose.’ Ravichandran Ashwin, one of only three Indians to make double figures, said: ‘I’m pretty blank at this point in time. But if we get some helpful conditions tomorrow and a couple of early wickets, we’re right back in this game.’","The visitors were on eight for four at the beginning of day one in Manchester .

"By . Nasser Hussain . The combination of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad is a fabulous one for England. The way they complement each other is quite superb and they will go down as one of the great fast bowling partnerships. Clearly they have learnt from Lord’s in the second Test where their bowling was a bit short. On Thursday, as at Southampton, they pitched the ball up and allowed it to swing but provided different challenges for the Indian batsmen. It might sound obvious but if they were similar bowlers they would not be as successful as a duo. As a captain you want variety and these two are like gold dust for Alastair Cook. Blistering attack: Stuart Broad was in sublime form at Old Trafford on day one of the fourth Investec Test . Sultans of swing: Jimmy Anderson and Broad wreaked havoc on India's batting order at Old Trafford . When the conditions suit and it is swinging you go to Anderson and when you need something to happen and have to think outside the box — maybe when the ball has stopped swinging — you go to Broad. If the game drifts or you need a magical spell, Broad is the man. He’s a very clever cricketer, as he showed yesterday by the way he used the short ball to push batsmen back before then getting them out to the fuller delivery. Anderson is the fitter bowler and can bowl longer spells and I think it’s best to use Broad in short, sharp spells, certainly with the way his body is at the moment. They can be stubborn with their fields but they know their game. You have to manage the pair and keep an eye on them. You need to make them think that any change of field is their idea but you have to be strong with them. You don’t have to talk them through what you are doing. Top of his game: Anderson appeals to the umpire as MS Dhoni gets a quick single in India's first innings . Anderson might have been trying to bowl too quickly at the start of this season. After what happened in Australia people were saying he might have lost his nip and he came back fitter and might have stretched a bit too much for pace. But the biggest difference since Lord’s, when England did not take full advantage of perfect bowling conditions on the first day, is that the ball has consistently swung both here at Old Trafford and at the Ageas Bowl. When it swings there is no-one better in the world than Anderson. You could say Dale Steyn is in the same category but I would always go with Jimmy because of the way he goes from inswing to outswing so effortlessly. Morale: England were in a jubilant mood as they tore through India's side, with the tourist finishing on 152 . The old-fashioned way would be to bowl five outswingers and then an inswinger — as Bhuvneshwar Kumar did to bowl Sam Robson on Thursday — but Anderson can go from one to the other at will. The four deliveries he bowled at Ravindra Jadeja here are about as good as it gets. It must have been an absolute nightmare to face. It is a skill he has and he does it with aggression. One thing I will say: these two really need looking after. We have highlighted in Sportsmail this week how much cricket England will play in the next 18 months and Cook will have to resist the temptation to over bowl them because the step down to the supporting cast is a big one at the moment. Time to step up: Chris Jordan, left, and Chris Woakes need to improve to take pressure off Broad and Anderson . A lot of people felt Steven Finn should have played here but there is no guarantee he would have bowled well and I am pleased England stuck with Chris Jordan. Batsmen seem to get chance after chance but as soon as a bowler puts in one indifferent performance there are calls to bring in someone else. Give Jordan a full go — and Robson — and then decide at the end of the series if there is a need for change. We have to remember that Jordan and Chris Woakes are not yet the finished article — Anderson and Broad most certainly are.","Stuart Broad finished with six wickets for 25 runs at Old Trafford .

"By . Steve Keating, Reuters . Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga continued to play giant killer at the Rogers Cup, upsetting Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov 6-4 6-3 on Saturday to storm into the final of the Canadian hard court event. After knocking off world number Novak Djokovic in the third round and taking out twice champion and eighth seed Andy Murray in the quarters, the muscular Frenchman pushed the seventh seeded Dimitrov on a steaming centre court to reach his second final of the season. The 13th seeded Tsonga will now face 17-time grand slam champion and twice Canadian champion Roger Federer in the final. Giant killer: Jo-Wilfried Tsonga added Grigor Dimitrov to his list of recent high profile victims in Canada . Wave to the crowd: Tsogna acknowledges the Canadian crowd which also saw him beat Andy Murray . 'I'm waiting for this moment since a couple of years now,' said Tsonga, who has always enjoyed success on the Canadian hard courts, reaching the semi finals in three of four visits but advancing to the finals only once. 'It's good because I always believe in myself during all these years and all this week where I lost against those guys and finally I get a little reward. 'It will for sure make me stronger, keep my motivation at the highest level and it's great.' Dimitrov, rated one of the rising young talents on the ATP Tour, had lost all three head-to-head meetings with Tsonga but with three titles under his belt this season stepped onto a sunny centre court as the favourite. Powerful: The Frenchman enjoyed a close first set before a more comfortable second winning 6-4 6-3 . Getting into the groove: Tsonga is enjoying the form of his life at the Rogers Cup and will play in the final . The scrappy Bulgarian traded punches with the Frenchman in a tight opening set but could not convert any of his four break opportunities against an opponent, whose looks are often compared to a young Muhammad Ali. Tsonga, also has a well-earned reputation as a battler on the court, and showed his willingness to fight right from the opening serve, his determination rewarded with the only break of the first set to go up 5-4 then holding serve for a 1-0 lead. The second set was not as close, Tsonga breaking the Bulgarian in the third game to gain control and then again to clinch the match, raising his fist into the air and shadow boxing his way out to centre court where he acknowledged the crowd. Easy does it: Tsonga has reached the semi in three of his last four visits to Canada - this is his second final . 'It's not an easy loss for me,' said Dimitrov. 'I thought he played a good match but I think I didn't raise the bar, didn't raise up the level the way I wanted to. 'Still, I have to take the positive side of the week. I don't put my head down for a second here, because it's a good progress for me. 'But I'm still disappointed with the loss. I'm not going to hide that. 'I have to think positive. There is a lot of tournaments coming ahead. U.S. Open is around the corner.' Shame: Dimitrov is building a big reputation on the tour but he couldn't beat the in-form Frenchman .","Frenchman has already beaten Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray .

"By . Marcus Townend . Estimate, one of the best horses ever owned by the Queen, could have run her last race after trailing home last behind Cavalryman in the Artemis Goodwood Cup. Nine days after making global headlines when it emerged she was one of seven horses to test positive to Morphine — a case linked to contaminated feed which means she will be disqualified from her second place in the Ascot Gold Cup in June — the Sir Michael Stoute-trained mare, ridden by Ryan Moore, appeared ill-at-ease on Goodwood’s gradients and never looked like justifying her position as 2-1 favourite. It was a second career defeat at the track, with Estimate (below) having finished third in the 2012 Lily Langtree Stakes. It is understood the horse was one of the runners in the Goodwood Cup line-up subject to a post-race dope test. Given the backdrop to the race, the BHA had little option. It was entirely a cosmetic but necessary procedure to head off any conspiracy theorists. Emotional: Ryan Moore (right) had to be consoled by his trainer Sir Michael Stoute after last-place finish . With running options now thin on the ground, retirement is now a big option. That would be a sad end to a career for a mare who gave her owner one of her most joyous days on a racecourse with victory in the 2013 Ascot Gold Cup. Certainly plans for an exciting potential swansong in Australia’s Melbourne Cup in November look certain to be shelved. Stoute said: ‘Ryan said she wasn’t letting herself down and I wasn’t happy from a long way out.’ Royal racing adviser John Warren added: ‘We were hopeful that if she did well that we would be brave enough to go to the Irish St Leger to sharpen her up and see if she had enough toe for Melbourne. Now we are back to the drawing board. The option are so limited. We will have to see what the Queen thinks.’ A second shot at the Melbourne Cup is a possibility for Godolphin-owned Cavalryman, who finished a neck in front of Saeed Bin Suroor-trained stablemate Ahzeemah. Back of the pack: The Jockey was riding the Queen's horse Estimate at The Artemis Goodwood Cup on Thursday . Third, four and a half lengths further back in a race run at an uneven tempo, was Michael Owen-owned 2013 winner Brown Panther. Definitely retired is Michael Winter-trained Missunited. The Irish mare, who was third in the Ascot Gold Cup, sustained a suspensory ligament injury when bravely winning the Lily Langtree Stakes under Jim Crowley. A sense of excitement swept the track when it emerged film star Tom Cruise was a guest of Goodwood’s owner Lord March. He generated a frenzy of attention when presenting model Edie Campbell with her prize for winning the charity Magnolia Cup. Cruise is best known for his Mission: Impossible films and trainer Richard Hannon must have felt that finding a winner was getting that way after five seconds on the opening two days. But the tide turned as his two-year-olds Shagah and Ivawood scored under Richard Hughes. The latter, impressive in the Group Two Richmond Stakes, is 8-1 favourite for next year’s 2,000 Guineas with Ladbrokes.","Ryan Moore finished last in Artemis Goodwood Cup .

"By . Ben Spencer . Britain has become so reliant on imports that the country would run out of food today if we only had UK-grown produce to eat. Our farmers now produce just 60 per cent of the total food we consume - meaning that if our import supply was cut off we could only feed the nation until August 7 each year. Agricultural self-sufficiency has fallen 15 percentage points from 75 per cent in 1991, according to Government figures. UK farmers now produce just 60 per cent of the total food consumed in Britain - meaning that if our import supply was cut off we could only feed the nation until August 7 each year (file picture) Farming leaders insist they have the capacity to boost production, but they say they need the support of politicians, retailers and consumers to ensure increasing demand. The National Farmers Union last night called for a coherent plan to boost agriculture, including better promotion of homegrown food, more tax breaks for farmers and better support from supermarkets. NFU president Meurig Raymond said last night: ‘If we were completely reliant on British food the larder would be empty tomorrow, that is a quite scary thought and should be a wake-up call for society. ‘Farmers react to markets, they react to confidence levels, they are willing to invest in the future if they have that confidence. ‘Otherwise we will end up with 70 million people in the UK, only able to produce half of the food we need. ‘We need to ratchet up our ability to produce. ‘We need to sit down and develop a growth plan because the industry is going to require a huge level of investment in the years to come.’ Successive Governments have tried - and failed - to tackle the slide in farming production. Ministers are worried not only about the impact on UK agriculture, but also about being too reliant on inconsistent foreign food supplies and turbulent prices. With a growing global population, the problem is only going to get worse as more people compete for resources. NFU president Meurig Raymond called  for a coherent plan to boost agriculture. He said: ‘We need to sit down and develop a growth plan because the industry is going to require a huge level of investment in years to come' Mr Raymond said: ‘Even though the latest figures are startling, British farming is a sector we can be proud of. It produces the raw ingredients for the £97billion UK food and drink industry. ‘But the trade gap is widening – while our export performance has doubled in the last decade, we are spending £21.3billion more on imports than we are receiving from exports – up from £10.2billion in 1991. ‘What needs to happen now is for us as a country is to give farmers the green light to produce more food for us. ‘Our aim is to ensure the country - consumers, politicians, retailers and the wider food industry - is backing British farming, and within this, a solid plan for agricultural growth to ensure the current self-sufficiency trend is reversed and long-term food security is supported.’ The British record is poor when compared to other nations. While we produce just 60 per cent of our needs, other developed nations manage to feed their populations while maintaining high exports. Australia, for example, produces more than 170 per cent of the food it needs, the US about 120 per cent and France 110 per cent. Part of the problem is that Britain does not just ship in exotic produce such as bananas and pineapples, but also buys in cheaper varieties of food we could produce perfectly well in this country. It means that food such as French apples, Spanish cucumbers, Danish bacon and Mexican runner beans fill our supermarket shelves, even in the spring and summer months. Last year we imported 27 per cent of food that could have been produced domestically, up from 23 per cent the year before, and 13 per cent in 1991. In a bid to tackle the problem, the Government last month announced that the Armed Forces and all Whitehall departments will now buy British food where possible, even if it is more expensive, and schools and hospitals will be expected to follow suit. Successive opinion polls have shown that shoppers would prefer to buy British where possible, but farmers complain that unclear labelling and marketing makes it difficult for them to do so. Last month, for example, Tesco was criticised for promoting New Zealand lamb at the very time when British lamb is at its very best. The NFU wants to see a plan which will include financial measures to boost on-farm investment in machinery and infrastructure such as water storage and buildings. It would also include measures to improve access to new crops, biotechnology and growing systems, and for fair, transparent supply chains and secure returns from processors, retailers and caterers. A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ‘We continue to work with industry and support UK producers to help boost food production - this includes our £160 million Agri-tech Strategy, driving innovation in farming and developing new resilient varieties of crops, and our plan to see the public sector sourcing £400 million pounds worth of food from the UK that they currently import.’","UK farmers now produce just 60 per cent of the total food British consume .

Amazingly, after fifty turbulent years - there have been punch-ups, fall-outs and even affairs with each other’s lovers - the Rolling Stones remain tight. So as unlikely as it might sound - perhaps there’s some truth in an unusual theory from Dr Ruth Blatt, a doctor of organisational behavior in the US, that within The Stones ' bond lies many of the qualities to making relationships last.

Her . theory, which appeared in American magazine Psychology Today, even sites . the band's many acrimonious moments as being key to their strength. 'They’re . like brothers who will always be there for each other and at times of . tragedy that’s when you really see them stepping up and expressing that . love,’ Dr Blatt tells Femail. 'They haven't always been an example for marital bliss, but couples have a lot to learn from the Rolling Stones when it comes to how the band members conduct their professional relationships,’ she says of the rockers now into their sixth decade together. ‘The secret ingredient that’s helped them stay bonded is a priceless lesson for marriage.’ Mick Jagger and L'Wren Scott before her recent tragic death. The rocker's band-mates have rallied around him in his hour of need . And luckily Dr Blatt has discovered exactly what that secret ingredient is. ‘It's about prioritising commitment above all else,’ she explains. ‘The Rolling Stones are a perfect example of how you can make a relationship work -- despite anything -- if you are totally committed.’ And in their case ‘despite anything’ encompasses a fair few misdemeanours. They've slept with each other’s girlfriends – Mick Jagger famously had an affair with Keith Richard's long-term girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, then Richards slept with Jagger's lover Marianne Faithful, which Richards admits in his memoir Life, was pure retaliation. ‘While you’re missing it, I’m kissing it,’ he poetically puts it. ‘There’s been violence and verbal abuse too -- Charlie Watts punched Mick Jagger for calling him “my drummer” and Keith Richards and Watts called Jagger “that bitch Brenda”,’ says Dr Blatt. 'There were other hurtful moments too. Mick did a solo deal with their label without telling the band. He went on the road on his own and played Rolling Stones songs, which they saw as riding on the band's success without them.' 'That was really hurtful to the others. And when I researched it further I found there was often a clash of egos and a battle for attention and credit. 'In Richards book, Life, he's quick to point out that he created the riff in certain songs and Mick just wrote the words. He's constantly trying to even out the perception.' ‘Any one of these incidents would be enough to tear most bands apart,’ Dr Blatt points out, but it’s their ‘for better or for worse’ commitment that’s kept them together. ‘They made a choice…Are we going to let these differences break us up? But they decided “no”. They’re totally bonded to each other.’ As Richards once said, ‘The Stones are bigger than any of us.’ ‘They may have arguments but they know that nothing compares to the magic they create when they’re together, which none of them could do alone,’ says Dr Blatt. Famous bust-ups: Mick Jagger had an affair with Keith Richard's girlfriend Anita Pallenberg, (pictured above right with Richards and their son Marlon,) and Richards retaliated by sleeping with Jagger's girl Marianne Faithfull (above left with Jagger) -- but despite it all the band have remained committed to each other . In fact, Dr Blatt says the ageing rockers' many indiscretions have ironically been a source of relationship strength. ‘Their continual blow-ups have given them countless opportunities to assess and ultimately reaffirm their commitment to each other, which in the long-run has made them stronger,’ she explains. ‘Every time their relationship was tested, they remade that choice to stay together.' Blatt’s theory is backed up by a study in the Journal of Marriage and Family, which found commitment, is more important in a marriage than doing or saying the right thing. The Rolling Stones have stood the test of time and according to Dr Ruth Blatt are a great role model for romantic relationships . 'The study found that commitment on its own is the number one predictor of marital success. If you’re not committed, you're not going to do what it takes -- which can mean forgiving and moving on even in the toughest of times. 'When you’re committed you need to forgive and forget. It's the strongest predictor of longevity. ‘If you don’t have that commitment, there will always be an easier option. When relationships get complicated it takes less effort to leave than to stay. 'But if you have that commitment ingrained then you'll do what's necessary to save it.' ‘What The Stones have is like a family love,’ she explains. At times they’ve driven each other nuts but when it comes to it they’d do anything for each other. As Dr Blatt concludes, 'If all married couples shared their attitude, we'd see a lot more marriages lasting.'","Dr Ruth Blatt says married couples have a lot to learn from the  rockers .

"By . Rob Waugh . Updated: . 16:58 EST, 6 January 2012 . An exhibition in Dresden, Germany has used forensic technology to recreate some of the most distant members of the human evolutionary 'family' - ancestors stretching back seven million years. The 27 model heads were created using fossil remains, and includes a glimpse of sahelanthropus tchadensis, an ancestor dated to about seven million years ago, when our 'hominid 'ancestors' first originated in Africa. Sahelanthropus tchadensis lived seven million years ago - before the divergence of man and our closest evolutionary cousins, chimpanzees . Homo rudolfensis lived around two million years ago. The remains were found in Kenya - it's still not entirely clear where this ancestor fits into human evolution . Paranthropus boisei lived 2million years ago and had a skull highly specialised for heavy chewing. The species is known as 'Nutcracker man' as it had the biggest cheek teeth and thickest enamel of any known hominin . Forensic anthropologists use similar . computer-assisted techniques to police teams attempting to reconstruct . human remains - and the near-complete skulls of ancestors such as . sahelanthropus tchadensis have allowed researchers to reconstruct . lifelike faces of what out ancestors might have looked like. Salhelanthropus tchadensis dates to a time before humans and chimpanzees, our closest evolutionary cousins, became genetically separate. 'Using forensic anthropological methods, the various hominids were . recreated not as characteristic ideals, but as individuals,' says the museum. 'Each one . tells its own story: where they lived, what they ate, their likely cause . of death and much more.' Some of the oldest spears ever found are also on display - dating back 400,000 years. Australopithecus Africanus lived around two milion years ago. The hominid is thought to be one of our direct ancestors - already showing a larger brain . A skull of Australopithecus africanus found in South Africa was used to rebuild this face of an ancestor who lived around two million years ago, known as Plesianthropus transvaalensis ('near man from the Transvaal') Homo erectus lived one million years ago. One theory is that the species originated in Africa and migrated to India, China and Java. Another holds that they evolved in Asia and migrated to Africa . 'There is little doubt that Africa is the cradle of humanity: this is where the most ancient remains of our ancestors were unearthed,' says the museum. 'The exhibition introduces you to the . excavation sites in Africa where scientists are conducting research into . the origins of mankind. 'Every step in the scientific . process is clearly explained, showing exactly how conclusions are . reached.' Homo ergaster lived 1.5million years ago. Very similar to Home erectus, it originated in Africa. Ergaster is from the Greek word 'workman' Homo neanderthalensis lived 60,000 years ago. Probably our closest relatives, neanderthals were humans but were a different species to us, Homo sapiens. They evolved in Europe and Asia while we did in Africa .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Fighting the flab might not be down to what you eat, but to how you eat it, according to new research. Scientists say the secret to beating a bulging seasonal waistline is to chew each mouthful of lunch for 30 seconds before swallowing. New research shows this has a powerful effect on appetite later in the day, curbing the desire for the chocolates, sweets and snacks that can pile on the pounds over the Christmas break. Scientists say the secret to beating a bulging seasonal waistline is to chew each mouthful of lunch for 30 seconds before swallowing, rather than what you eat . Volunteers who chewed their lunch in this way during a recent experiment carried out by psychologists at the University of Birmingham, ate half as many snacks in the afternoon as those who ate normally. Although previous studies have shown chewing for longer curbs calorie intake during a meal, the latest research, published in the journal Appetite, shows it can also have a significant impact on snacking habits later in the day. The findings come during a period when Britain indulges in what is traditionally the biggest gastronomic blow-out of the year. Research suggests a traditional Christmas lunch of roast turkey, roast potatoes, stuffing, sausages wrapped in bacon, bread sauce and vegetables totals just over 1,000 calories. By the time you have also got through some Christmas pudding, biscuits and cheese, Christmas cake, chocolate and mince pies, most adults will have taken on between 3,500 and 4,000 calories. The daily allowance for men is 2,500 calories and for women just 2,000. The actress Gwyneth Paltrow has famously spoken of chewing each mouthful of food several times before chewing, in a bid to control her weight . The Birmingham team wanted to assess how chewing for longer at lunchtime affected ‘grazing’ habits later in the day. They recruited 43 students, mostly female, and asked them to refrain from eating for two hours before the test. Each student was then presented with a plate of smoked ham and cheese sandwiches, all identical in size and shape. A third of the students were told to eat as they normally would, another third to pause for ten seconds between swallowing each mouthful and the last group to chew each bite for 30 seconds before swallowing. Two hours after the experiment, the students were handed a small bowl of Skittles - chewy, fruit flavoured sweets - and a bowl of Minstrels, the candy-coated chocolate treats. During the procedure, volunteers were asked to rate their appetite and enjoyment of the food. The results showed students who ate at their normal speed and those who stopped for ten seconds between bites ate the same amount of sweets.But those who chewed each mouthful of lunch for 30 seconds ate half as many. Yet the benefits came at a price, the researchers said. ‘Participants in the prolonged chewing group were less happy after lunch and had reduced ratings of lunch enjoyment, and pleasantness of the texture of lunch, compared with others,’ they said in a report on their findings. ‘These effects may be due to the novelty of prolonged chewing, or reduced palatability of the food.’ One reason it works may be that, by concentrating so much on the process of eating, the brain ‘remembers’ lunch for longer and is less likely to signal the need for more food so soon afterwards. But the Birmingham team think it may also be that chewing for longer is so unpleasant that it dampens down cravings for snacks. ‘Because the participants did not particularly enjoy the lunch experience, this may have affected decisions about how many sweets to eat later.’ In a study last year, scientists in China found chewing each mouthful of food 40 times led to a 12 per cent drop in calorie intake during a meal. A 2010 survey of 1,000 British people most chew their food just six times before swallowing it. Catherine Collins, chief dietician at St George’s Hospital, London, said chewing for longer forms the backbone of an increasingly popular approach to weight loss known as ‘mindful eating’. ‘That’s where you deliberately think back to the last meal you had and the whole process of eating it. As a result, you snack less because the brain is telling the body it does not need more food. ‘If you are taking longer over lunch, it means you are more mindful of what you are eating and you are more likely to remember it later. This has a positive effect on your calorie intake. ‘The simple message here is if you concentrate more on what you are eating, it will help to reduce your food intake later.’","Birmingham researchers found this reduces appetite later in the day .

"By . Daniel Mills For Daily Mail Australia . Two female teachers have taken stress leave as while an investigation into the allegations is ongoing . Five boys from a prestigious Catholic college in Sydney are being investigated by police for sharing sexual images of two female teachers on social media. The students, who attend St Augustine's College at Brookvale on city's northern beaches, allegedly used iPhones to photograph and video up teachers' skirts before uploading the content to a specially created thread on Facebook, Fairfax Media reported. While the principal of the college, Tim Cleary, would not comment on disciplinary matters involving students, it is understood the boys received suspensions only to be allowed back after taking re-enrollment interviews. It is understood the female teachers implicated in the criminal activity are on stress leave. One parent, who wished not to be identified, said she felt 'totally disgusted' that the students were allowed to take re-enrollment interviews as part of their return to school. Five year nine boys from St Augustine's College at Brookvale, in Sydney's north, are under investigation by police for filming up teacher skirts . She said: 'I do not want my year nine son at school with these sorts of boys.' 'I am outraged that these boys have returned to the school.' Head of school at St Augustine's College, Matthew Hutchison, said the behaviour of the students was 'calculated', and in a statement said the teachers had been 'betrayed' by the boys' criminal activity. Fairfax Media reported that the students had been capturing the images for several months. 'This incident has caused a great deal of hurt for everyone involved and I imagine all of you are extremely angered with the ill-treatment of your colleagues,' Mr Hutchison's statement said. He said that upon discovering the 'critical incident', the college immediately contacted police to seek advice. A police spokesperson has confirmed with Daily Mail Australia that an investigation is underway. 'Police are investigating an incident at a school on Sydney's northern beaches. As the investigation is ongoing it is inappropriate to comment further.' Mr Hutchison said the boys' actions had caused the teachers 'incredible hurt and distress'.","Five students are under investigation at St Augustine's College, Sydney .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A brother and sister searching for scrap metal on the train tracks on Chicago’s West Side were struck and killed by a Metra train Thursday. According to the victims’ relatives, Barry Huddleston, 57, who was visually impaired, and his 54-year-old sister, Margaret, likely did not see the approaching BNSF Line locomotive in time. The family believe that the woman died trying to push her sibling out of the way. Scroll down for video . Double tragedy: This BNSF Line Metra train in Chicago struck and killed Barry and Margaret Huddleston, a brother and sister in their 50s, on Chicago's West Side . Dangerous job: The unemployed siblings were walking the tacks looking for scrap metal when the inbound train surprised Mr Huddleston, who was partially blind . ‘He couldn't see, he was partially blind, and he stood on the track and he didn't see the train and Margaret ran over there to help him,’ said Gloria Huddleston, victims' younger sister. The deadly accident took place at around 4.45pm Thursday when an inbound BNSF train traveling to Chicago's Union Station struck the Huddlestons. Meg Reile, a spokeswoman for the Metra commuter rail service, said the incident occurred after the train running on the Burlington Northern-Santa Fe line left the La Grange station and was a mile west of the Western Ave. station. The tracks at that point are elevated. ‘We were on the train, and everyone thought that something broke off the train on the bottom,’ Metra passenger Anthony Lozaro told ABC 7 Chicago. Traffic on the BNSF line, Metra's busiest, was suspended for three hours in both directions, affecting about 25,000 commuters. On Friday, the medical examiner performed an autopsy on the victims, which determined that the Huddlestons died from multiple injuries caused on impact. Ultimate sacrifice: Margaret Huddleston's boyfriend (pictured) believes she died trying to protect her brother . Family in mourning: The victims' many relatives rushed to the tracks when they heard the news that someone had been killed by a train . Speaking to the Chicago Tribune, the siblings' relatives said Margaret and Barry have been inseparable since childhood and looked out for one another growing up in the Lawndale section of Chicago. When Mr Huddleston lost his vision in one eye due to glaucoma a few years ago, his protective sister stepped in serving as his guide. Both Huddlestons were unemployed and relied on scrap metal collection to scratch out a meager living. Speaking of her aunt and uncle's dangerous occupation, Tracy Huddleston said the two would walk the streets and scour vacant lots in search of morsels of aluminum and metal. Margaret Huddleston was remembered as a small woman with a big heart who spent her days caring for her four children and eight grandchildren, as well as for her elderly mother. Disruption:Traffic on the BNSF line, Metra's busiest, was suspended for three hours in both directions Thursday evening . When on Thursday evening the Huddleston clan heard the news that someone had been struck by a train nearby, they feared the worst knowing the siblings' tendency to wander the tracks. The Gloria Huddleston, who was at the scene, saw a passerby carrying a dirty blue Nike sneaker and knew at once her brother Barry was dead. Larry Jackson, Margaret Huddleston’s boyfriend, dropped down to his knees and sobbed watching work crews covering the bodies of his girlfriend and her brother with tarp sheets.","Barry Huddleston, 57, and Margaret Huddleston, 54, identified as victims of Metra train accident on Chicago's West Side Thursday .

"By . Lucy Thackray . For years, New York has had a reputation for questionable coffee standards. But a new movement is creating a cafe revolution in the Big Apple - and it’s all thanks to Aussie expats who are bringing a little bit of home to the concrete jungle. The New York Times say Australian cafes have stamped their identity on the New York food scene. 'What started as an expedition a few years ago has become an invasion: like the French bistro, the British pub and the Californian juice bar.' Bluestone Lane cafe mastermind Nick Stone (left) and social media manager Alexandra (and fiance) Alexandra Knight (right) in one of their 'quintessentially Australian' cafes in New York . They may be run-of-the-mill menu items for Aussies, but a Flat White and Avocado Smash are a revelation for New York residents! The Bluestone Cafe is decorated with Australian memorabilia, to bring a little bit of home to New York . One of these pioneers is 32-year-old Melbournian Nicholas Stone, who in August 2013 opened the first of his ‘quintessentially Australian’ cafés in New York. One year on, and Mr Stone will soon have five cafes located all over New York, with Americans embracing the Australian coffee experience. ‘Coffee in Australia is about finding your local and becoming so loyal to the café that you feel like you’re cheating if you go anywhere else! 'That didn't really happen in New York but I think these Australian cafes are creating that ‘loyalty’, because customers get to enjoy a unique, personal experience.’ Mr Stone says his line of ‘Bluestone Lane’ cafes have quickly gathered notoriety. ‘Our café in West Village opened in June this year and it’s created a lot of buzz. Taylor Swift has come to visit three times, Susan Sarandon’s come… In a year, it has already been so successful, the New York market love it.’ Nick Stone says the aesthetic of the cafes is essential, to create an escape from the New York 'concrete jungle' Mr Stone came to New York four years ago to study business at university. He immediately missed the Australian coffee back home. This was catalyst for his new business venture; his ‘Bluestone Lane’ cafes, named after the paving stones on a street in Melbourne. ‘I wanted to create something like the coffee culture in Melbourne, where you feel connected to the coffee shop.’ Aussies in New York are trying to replicate the Australian 'cafe experience', seen her at the Bluestone Lane Cafe in New York . ‘I didn’t just miss the quality of coffee, I also missed the ambiance of those cafes. You feel an intrinsic connection when they know your name, know your order, have a routine…  I knew I needed to hire a team that didn't just create a quality product, but also really care about interacting with people. 'Australians produce the café and coffee experience at such a pristine level so we’re trying to replicate that here.' When recruiting his café team, Mr Stone literally wanted to bring Australia to New York. ‘We sourced our team from Australia. Our baristas, servers… We recruited people from Australia who were passionate, energised and professional to come and work for us.' Mr Stone says that the aesthetic of the cafe is crucial. The interior of one of the Bluestone Lane cafes in New York . 'You have to think carefully about the space to create an escape from the concrete jungle. One of our cafes is on Wall Street, literally right next to the stock exchange. You want to create a getaway!' Mr Stone says Australians don't just drink coffee for the caffeine, unlike Americans. Australians are teaching Americans how to drink coffee for the experience. 'In New York, they have a very high level of coffee consumption. But coffee was just about getting as much caffeine into you as you could, like a liquid drug. We Australians care about the artisan beverage.'

"By . Binky Felstead . While some brunettes may favour the Snow White beauty formula – with ivory skin, ebony lashes and scarlet lips – I'm definitely a golden girl. Bronzer, glitter and glistening gold-hued products will always catch my eye. Beauty purists may claim 'golden goddess' make-up is really for blondes, but I say, heck, if it works, wear it! SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Binky has never kept her love for bronzer quiet and now that it's summer it's her time to shine . I've never made any secret of my passion for bronzer, and now summertime is here, it's my moment to shine. Shimmering golden make-up really enhances a suntan and it looks dazzling by night. So this week, I asked my beauty guru – top celebrity make-up artist Daniel Sandler – to help me create a 24-carat look. Step One: Glisten . Apply your normal base, to create an even canvas for your golden sheen. According to Daniel, the secret with this look is to use colours that are a little warmer than your natural skin tone - I like using Guerlain's Terracotta Skin Healthy Glow Foundation in Brunettes. Make-up artist Daniel Sandler helps Binky to achieve her sunkissed look . Using your fingertip, blend Daniel Sandler Watercolour Crème Bronzer in Riviera over the apples of your cheeks, adding warmth and subtle shimmer to your face. Next up, smooth the same product across your eyelids and lips – it's so versatile and easy to apply, and it instantly adds a gorgeous sexy shimmer. Step Two: Shimmer . Using a small eyeshadow brush like Daniel Sandler Blending Brush, apply Too Faced Glamour Dust Glitter Pigment in Nude Beam to your eyes, blending a light wash of shimmer above the lashes, across the centre of your lids and at the inner corners. This gorgeous peachy shade contrasts beautifully with the bronzer, shaping and adding depth to your eyes. Then, using a bigger brush, dust a hint of this glam glitter across your cheekbones, to highlight the contours of your face and catch the light as you move. These are some of the products that Binky recommends in order to achieve the ultimate gorgeous glow . Step Three: Bronze . You've added plenty of shimmer already, so stick to a matt bronzer next, dusting it under your cheekbones with a fluffy brush to shape your face - one I recommend is the Real Techniques Blush Brush. Build the colour up slowly across your cheeks and, if you're after a really pro finish, along each side of your nose and at your temples. Step Four: Finishing Touches . A slick of Daniel Sandler Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet, lashings of Daniel Sandler Jumbo Jet Mascara, and a brow pencil like Too Faced Brow-Nie Brow Pencil will complete your eyes. Finally, slick Daniel Sandler Luxury Lip Gloss in Skinny Dip across your lips, slicking it over the top of the gilt shimmer you applied at the beginning. Binky says it's best to build the colour up slowly across your cheeks to avoid it looking to heavy . This luscious, cinnamon-flavoured gloss is the perfect nutty-nude shade – subtle, yet super-glam. Another great alternative is the gorgeously nude Michael Kors Sporty Lip Luster in Muse. Step Five: The Body Beautiful . Why stop at your face? If you want to glow from head to toe, smooth Rimmel Sunshimmer Instant Tan over your limbs and torso. This is one of my favourite summer products – it's so easy to apply, it blends in smoothly and is water-resistant, giving your body an instant healthy colour all over. Now there's no point having a glowing bronzed bod if you're not going to show it off! I'm very happy with my body at the moment as I've been working out and eating well, alongside taking Forza Raspberry K2 supplements. These Forza pills helped me get the sculpted physique of my dreams and even gave me the confidence to pose for my first lingerie shoot with Bluebella. They're my dieting Holy Grail! You'll find all the beauty products I used at online beauty boutique Escentual.com. I love this look - it's a really easy one to achieve, and one that suits every skin tone – so give it a try.

"By . Bianca London . Many of us spend hours - and a small fortune - fretting over acne, but would you ever pay the same attention or shell out as much money on hiding your freckles? A new trend, which sees women using laser treatments to banish the small pigmentation spots, is sweeping the beauty world. While the average Brit has around 35 freckles on their body, some people have a lot more and it seems to be wreaking havoc with their self-confidence. Before and after: A new craze for having freckles removed is sweeping the beauty world. Sally Whittle, pictured left, before, and after, paid £700 to get rid of hers and says she couldn't be happier with the results . While the likes of Gisele Bündchen, Olivia Munn and Rachel Bilson embrace their freckles, for one woman, they were the subject of years of bullying and insecurity. Speaking about her self-consciousness, Sally Whittle, 21, from Cardiff, Wales, said: 'I would pile on foundation, it always looked thick and cakey. 'I would hate going on holiday where it was too hot to cover up my face, and swimming would make me paranoid as I knew it would wash off. To be honest, I would just look like a walking freckle on holiday! I hated it.' Insecurities: Sally, pictured before, left, and after, said she would hate going on holiday where it was too hot to cover up her face, and swimming would make her paranoid . Famous freckles: The likes of OC actress Rachel Bilson, left, and Olivia Munn, right, happily embrace their freckled faces but for some people, they have a lot more and it leaves them feeling insecure . Sally decided to shell out £700 to banish her freckles once and for all. She underwent RevLite - a laser treatment that promises to help with skin lightening and treating difficult conditions including acne and acne scarring, fine lines and wrinkles, hyperpigmentation and melasma. How does it work? The treatment, which costs £175 a pop, uses a pulsed beam of light and optimum power to shatter dark skin particles . The . procedure uses a pulsed beam of light and optimum power to shatter dark . skin particles, which are gradually removed by the body’s natural . processes. The . machine’s flat-top beam distributes the energy evenly over the . problematic skin area or dark pigmentation encouraging it to fade and . disappear over time. Doctors say three to four treatments are enough to sort the problem and claim that the procedure has minimal downtime thanks to how quickly the energy is pulsed through the skin, which minimises redness and recovery. Speaking about the treatment, which costs £175 per session, Dr Maria Gonzalez, who offers it at her Cardiff clinic, said: 'This treatment is a newcomer on the market as most patients have heard of Fraxel or CO2 lasers for pigmentation. 'However, even though I have a CO2 laser I believe the RevLite treatment provides a superior result with less pain and less downtime. 'It is . also much safer in patients with pigmented skin in whom we do a less . aggressive treatment known as laser toning providing safe and effective . rejuvenation and improvement in pigmentation.' After one treatment, Sally noticed a . dramatic difference in the appearance of her freckles, and by the second . the difference was significant, she said. She added: 'Four treatments later and I no longer . wear foundation and I am confident within my new freckle-free skin. 'My . friends have all commented on how flawless my skin is, I still find it . weird considering I have hated it for so long.'","Sally Whittle paid £700 to have the freckles on her face removed .

"By . Kieran Corcoran . A dedicated gardener has spent a quarter of a century turning his 'blank canvas' of a garden into an exotic jungle. Tim Wilmot, who runs a software firm, has spent £10,000 and 25 years of his life transforming the back of his suburban Bristol property into a lush paradise of foliage. It boasts more than 80 species of plants, including bamboo, banana trees and palms hailing from as far as South Africa. Scroll down for video . Unlikely location: Tim Wilmot's home in Bristol is actually home to more than 80 species of tropical plant . Extensive: Much of the garden, pictured in the height of summer, is packed away in colder months . Mr Wilmot, 56, spends between three and four hours a week in the garden, helping the plants to grow in the colder British weather. He said: 'When I first bought the house the garden was a blank canvas - it was just a lawn with a few old trees but now it completely been transformed and it's totally exotic. 'In my previous house I had the ambition to transform it but I just didn't have the space. 'I've always wanted to create my own little paradise, and I've spent 25 years doing it. I've got about half a dozen palm trees, all of which are hardened to survive in the UK. There's also a number of different bamboo plants and some ferns. Far from home: Mr Wilmot poses above with a banana tree, which grows huge leaves every year, and sometimes even fruit - though it cannot grow to ripeness in the English climate . 'There are a few banana plants that flower and produce fruit every few years. Obviously it is difficult in the UK so you have to have a hot summer followed by a mild winter. 'The rest of the family have to suffer! They aren't big gardeners but they have to put up with what I've done to it, but actually they really like it and they love spending time in it.' Tim, who lives in a modern detached house with his wife Sheila, 60, and their two children, brought the property in 1989 and decided to turn the empty garden into a vibrant jungle. He began planting a number of different palm trees in the garden, all of which are hardened to survive the colder climates of the UK. His impressive collection of plants include a variety of different bamboos, ferns, ornamental cacti and even banana trees. He also grows a number of unique Yuccas, as well as succulents such as Puya alpestris, a member of the pineapple family, and rice paper plants. Conspicuous: This aerial view of Mr Wilmot's garden dating from 2004 shows how his tropical project was well underway even a decade ago . Vibrant: Mr WIlmot's plants, such as this golden bamboo, are usually found thousands of miles away . Maintaining the garden takes around three to four hours a week, with an extreme watering regime in the summer and construction in the winter. In winter months Mr Wilmot, a father of two, builds shelters to protect the plants, enabling them to survive the cold temperatures. He said: 'In the summer the majority of my time is spent water the plants, that's all you have to do to maintain them. 'It's a bit different in the winter, I spend quite a few weekends working, constructing shelters over plants and making DIY poly-tunnels. 'I also buy about ten bales of straw which needs to be scattered around some of the more vulnerable plants to protect them from the wet, cold weather. 'Then when it gets to spring I have to allocate time to do the reverse process - taking off all the covers. 'This is normally a good few hours a week worth of work. I probably spend a little longer than your average gardener in the back garden. 'The biggest thing for me now is pruning - just making sure things don't get out of control.'. Carefully-cultured: The exotic blooms in Mr Wilmot's garden need careful tending, and some spend the winter in a greenhouse . Humble roots: Mr Wilmot's gardening ambitions began with a few humble palm trees, but became more audacious over time . Exotic: The puya plant, pictured, originally comes from the mountainous Andres, but can survive in Bristol . Lengthy . labour: Mr Wilmot (pictured next to a Chilean puya plant), a . 56-year-old businessman, started transforming his garden 25 years ago . Mr Wilmot said the £10,000 cost of his paradise was made up of  composts, fertilisers, and materials to build his shelters - as well as the plants themselves. He said: 'I would say I've probably spent about £10,000 on the garden all things considered. 'When you think about it I don't think that's too bad though. I think you can justify spending that on a hobby.' Every year Mr Wilmot opens up his garden under the National Garden Scheme raising funds for charity. He has also won a number of accolades for his paradise, including runner-up spot in The Times's back garden of the year competition in 2004. Mr Wilmot's garden will next be open to the public on Saturday 14 September. Mr Wilmot's dazzling array of flora which have adorned his garden over the years number in the dozens and hail from all over the world. Here are a selection of the most exotic: .

"By . Stephanie Linning . 'Poignant': The body of army cadet instructor Arthur Jones was found near a memorial dedicated in Crete dedicated to Greek cadets who were killed in the First World War . A former army sergeant 'died of heat exhaustion' while paying his respects at a remote war memorial in Crete that he had hiked to in temperatures of 35C. The body of 73-year-old Arthur Jones, an army cadet instructor, was found on Monday near a war memorial dedicated to the Greek cadets killed as they fought against the Nazi invasion. His family added that it was 'very poignant' that he was discovered on . the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the First World War. The grandfather, from Denbigh, North Wales  – described as a veteran . adventurer by his family – went missing on June 19 after going into the . Crete hills on the Greek holiday island. He had sent his family a postcard in the first few days of his holiday, saying he was planning a walking trip. He was last seen by staff at the resort in Chania where he was staying as he set out on what was to be the hottest day of the year in Crete - with temperatures reaching 35C. The father-of-four had been been walking as a hobby for 30-40 years and . had previously trained army cadets mountaineering and hill-climbing. After a six-week air and land search led by the Greek Army, in which helicopters scoured the area near the resort where Mr Jones was last seen, his body was found slumped against a tree near the memorial. His son Jeff, speaking from Crete, said: 'He was found near to this memorial, erected for the cadets which is something my dad was involved with for 30 years. 'He trained army cadets back in Wales. It’s extremely poignant for us. 'My father was obviously looking for this memorial and got lost either on the way there or back. It’s just a very nice last memory for us. 'It seems he passed away in a peaceful and dignified way. As far as we know, he’s been like that for six weeks. It was so hot, that day.' Six-week-search: The Greek Army launched a land and air search after Mr Jones went missing on June 19. Helicopters scoured the area near the resort in Chania, where Mr Jones was last seen by staff . Experienced walker: Grandfather Arthur Jones was last seen setting off into the mountains near Chania, pictured. His son said that it is presumed that he was dehydrated and suffered heat exhaustion . His son said a post-mortem examination revealed no medical episode and it is presumed, based on the remote location and temperature, that he was dehydrated and suffered heat exhaustion. The family has thanked the public and authorities for their support. Adventurer: The father-of-four had been been walking as a hobby for 30-40 years and had previously trained army cadets mountaineering . Jeff added: 'We as a family would like to thank everyone for their support, help and contribution to our quest in finding our father since he went missing six weeks ago. 'The last six weeks have been terribly stressful and difficult to cope with, but we would ask that we have the time, peace and privacy we need to mourn our father.' Arthur’s daughter Angela Jones thanked the public for their 'incredible' support and said she took comfort from the fact her father, who was a keen walker, had been 'doing something he loves'. The mother-of-two added: 'My father has been the best grandfather in the world - and it’s my two girls that it breaks my heart for. They are both under three and he’s been wonderful for them. 'The support we’ve had has been incredible - we couldn’t have asked for any more, it’s meant we have been able to keep going.' Following the disappearance of the former army sergeant  June 19, the community of Denbigh united in support of the family and raised more than £20,000, which helped send a local search team out to the Mediterranean island. Mr Jones family members also flew out to help with the search, with relatives bringing with them 1,000 leaflets in Greek and . English, featuring the grandfather's picture, to hand out in the area. People around the world got behind the #FindArthur and #CameronPromised campaigns on Twitter to show their support.","Army cadet instructor Arthur Jones was last seen leaving hotel on June 19 .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . NHS waiting lists will continue to grow for several months, the government admitted today after again missing targets for treatment. The health service in England missed the target that 90 per cent of people should receive treatment within the 18-week period. With more than 3million people now on waiting lists, Labour said it marked a return to 'that old Tory choice of suffering in silence or paying to go private'. In June the NHS in England missed the target to treat 90% of patients within 18 weeks . Since April there have been 3million on the waiting lists, levels not seen since early 2008 . Pressure in the NHS has been growing in recent months, and has seen a steady increase in the numbers on waiting lists. In June, patients referred to hospital for operations or other treatment waited for an average of 9.4 weeks, up from 8.8 weeks in March. It meant that 89.7 per cent of the 282,000 patients were treated within the 18-week window, missing the 90 per cent target. Amazingly, 12,444 had been waiting for more than six months and 189 for more than a year. Overall 521 people have been on waiting lists for a year or more, although this figure was 18,400 when the coalition was formed. The government insists it does not want to pressure hospitals into meeting the targets, because it could mean people with complex health problems get pushed to the bottom of the waiting lists. This week Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced £250million for the NHS to clear a massive backlog of knee, cataract and hip replacement operations. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused David Cameron of breaking promises to keep waiting times down . But a Department of Health spokesman said: 'We know parts of the NHS are under pressure – that's why we've given the NHS support to do 100,000 extra operations this summer. 'By prioritising those who have waited the longest the NHS is likely to miss the target for a while but we expect it to get back on track later in the year.' The total number of people on waiting lists has been higher than 3million since April, the highest figures seen since early 2008. Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: 'The Prime Minister promised to keep NHS waiting times down but these figures show he has failed the test he set himself. 'There are more people on NHS waiting lists and those patients are waiting longer for treatment. 'Under David Cameron, people are seeing a return that old Tory choice of suffering in silence or paying to go private.' But a Government spokesman said: 'We are carrying out 850,000 more operations every year than in 2010, eliminating the scandal we inherited from Labour of more than 18,000 people being forced to wait over a year for their operation. Now, only 574 patients do. 'We're investing £250million this summer to clear the backlog of patients who have waited more than 18 weeks - and despite having a million more people starting treatment every month, waiting times remain low and stable.'","Health service in England misses target to treat 90% within 18 weeks .

"By . Ryan Lipman . Kit Kats, Tiny Teddies, Smarties and Coco Pops are being classified as healthy foods by food companies' standards so they can bypass regulations to be advertised to young children. A NSW Cancer Council study found food companies were setting their nutrition criteria low enough to sidestep non-mandatory codes regulating advertising junk food to kids. Coco Pops uses a 30 gram serving as the basis for its sugar content - a portion much less than what most people would consume in a normal breakfast bowl, reported the Sydney Morning Herald. Kit Kats and Coco Pops are among the junk foods being classified as healthy by food companies . The analysis found 63 per cent of food advertised on TV was classed as unhealthy by Food Standards Australia New Zealand. Researchers looked at TV food advertisements aired between 6am and 9pm over two weeks. Study author Clare Hughes said 39 per cent of food advertisements that met the companies' own criteria for healthy food failed the government's criteria. Fast foods including McDonald's Chicken N' Cheese burger and KFC's Mint Choc Krusher are being advertised to children despite not being children's meals. A study has found food companies set their nutrition criteria low enough to sidestep non-mandatory codes regulating advertising junk food to kids . The findings, published in industry journal Nutrition and Dietetics, showed companies which signed a voluntary industry-regulated marketing code breached this by showing foods classified as unhealthy by government standards. But companies which had not signed the code tended to advertise healthier foods. The Responsible Children's Marketing Initiative is a voluntary system which many food companies also follow. The initiative allows food companies to create a nutrition criteria to work out which foods should be advertised to kids. Unhealthy foods are prevented from being advertised to children from 7am to 8.30am and 4pm to 8.30pm from Monday to Friday and 7am to 8.30pm on weekends, by the Australian Communications Media Authority. The study has sparked calls for mandatory regulation in line with government standards . The findings have sparked calls for mandatory regulation in line with government standards. Ms Hughes said this would be more effective in stopping high-sugar and fat foods being marketed to children rather than relying on food companies to comply with voluntary codes and self-regulation. 'The voluntary initiatives can be a bit of an advertising spin in themselves,' Ms Hughes said. 'Children are watching television at times when these initiatives don't apply.' Yet Australian Food and Grocery Council spokesman James Mathews said advertising bans overseas had not shown any drop in childhood obesity rates. He questioned the basis of the research looking at advertising during all shows between 6am to 9am, including Law and Order and movies featuring sex and violence, which are not targeted at children. The NSW Cancer Council campaigns against junk food advertising to children because of the associated cancers linked with obesity, such as kidney, bowel, pancreas, post-menopausal breast, endometrial and esophegal cancer.","Food companies are classifying junk foods such as Smarties as healthy .

"Apple's plans to take on TV with a gadget capable of showing live TV and on demand shows has been delayed until next year. Apple engineers working on the gadget has been told not to expect it to launch until 2015. Cable companies refusing to do deals have been blamed for the constant delays to the product - which co-founder Steve Jobs boasted about before his death. Apple's current $99 TV box, which the firm revealed today has made it over $1bn . Rumours claim that Apple's TV set will use a 4K screen making is four times sharper than even current HDTV pictures. The firm is also rumoured to be working with cable firms to allow it to show live TV as well as but films ans TV shows. It is also expected to be able to run apps, and work with an iPad or iPhone as a remote control. It may also include gesture controls after after bought Israeli firm PrimeSense. 'Those waiting for Apple to start selling its long-discussed, all-in-one box for accessing live and on-demand television are going to have to keep waiting,' technology blog The Information claimed. 'Apple engineers who are working on aspects of the device have been told by their bosses not to expect a launch this year and are working off timelines that assume a launch next year, according to a person familiar with the plans,' it said. The blog also claims Apple employees have cited cable companies 'dragging their heels' and the pending Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger as reasons the device and accompanying TV service haven’t launched. Earlier this week the firm added two new channels, a CNBC channel with live broadcasts and FOX NOW, the on-demand app for the network that includes episodes of Glee, Family Guy and more. Both channels need a cable subscription to unlock completely, but offer some content free. On FOX NOW, for all returning FOX series, full episode are accessible the day after they air with a participating provider credential. All new series entering their first year offer full episodes are available on an “unlocked” basis for all FOX NOW users, regardless of whether they hold cable or pay TV subscriptions. Apple sold more than $1 billion of Apple TV set-top boxes in 2013 and is investing heavily in the next generation of products, boss Tim Cook said at the company's annual meeting earlier this year. The firm is believed to be working on a range of TV sets alongside an improved version of its current $99 TV box. Future versions are expected to include apps and the ability to watch live TV as well as buy movies and TV shows. Cook shed some more light on the Apple TV business, which executives have long referred to as a 'hobby' for a company expected to chalk up some $181 billion in sales this fiscal year. CEO Tim Cook also slammed Android for security problems, and warned short term investor not to buy stock . The $99 Apple TV set-top box, which streams content from Netflix and other video sources to a TV, had racked up $1 billion in sales in the past year, he said. 'It's a little more difficult to call it a hobby these days,' Cook said. Google also has its eye on the TV market, and recently launched the Chromecast, a $39 dongle to give any TV online capabilities . Cook took pot shots at Google, saying that most users of its Android mobile operating system are using older versions, presenting a security threat. In contrast, he said, 89 percent of users of devices based on Apple's iOS operating system have the most recent version of the software. Previously, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities said that a new Apple TV with motion controls would play a 'key role' for the company this year. He had predicted that the upgraded hardware would arrive this fall, leveraging the technology Apple acquired from its acquisition of PrimeSense, which also powered the tech behind Microsoft's first-generation Xbox Kinect gaming peripheral.","Engineers working on the project have been told it has been delayed utnil next year .

"By . Sally Lee . Australia's very own Jennifer Tang and Jarrel Seah celebrate their victory as they hold up Microsoft's prestigious Imagine Cup . Two Australian medical students have won a global competition after inventing an app that uses a selfie to detect if someone is anaemic. Jarrel Seah and Jennifer Tang, both 22, of Melbourne's Monash University, were crowned winners of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle on Friday after their entry beat 34 other teams from around the world. By following their passion of using technology to solve medical problems, the duo were awarded $US50,000 and a private mentoring session with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. They won over the judges with their revolutionary phone app - called Eyenaemia - which screens for anaemia, or low red blood cell levels, when a user takes a selfie of their eye. Mr Seah and Ms Tang developed the project while they were on a placement in rural Victoria last year and saw a need for an easier way to detect the life-threatening condition. 'Both of us were doing placement out in Mildura [northwestern Victoria] when we found that anaemia was a common problem but people in these remote and rural areas had to travel hours just to get a blood test,’ Ms Tang told Daily Mail Australia. 'We both like to find solutions where we see a gap and that's what we saw with this particular project.' Eyenaemia identifies the user's risk for the condition by taking a photo of a person's eye, which then analyses the conjunctiva. The results can then be sent to doctors. The Melbourne medical students won over the judges with their phone app - Eyenaemia - which asses the risk of anaemia by taking a selfie . The app identifies the user's risk for the condition by taking a photo of their eye which then analyses the conjunctiva . As part of their prize, the pair will meet with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates for a mentoring session . 'We developed an idea where the processing is done online and would take one to two minutes, depending on how good you are at taking selfies,' Jennifer said. 'Through the app, we hope it detects the condition early on and helps prevent it. 'We're both very interested in technology and how it can improve health. 'We believe it can change the way of the future.' As well as winning the Imagine Cup, the pair also won the World Citizenship Championship in Seattle, a competition with the premise: Imagine a world where technology helps solve the toughest problems. ‘We're thrilled to have this kind of opportunity because both of us are so passionate about improving the world as it stands,' Ms Tang said. 'We knew there was a problem and wanted to solve it with a clear plan to achieve it. 'So we're not stopping here. We’re going to continue on with the project and see where it goes.' Mr Seah said that he hopes the project will expand worldwide, particularly in developing countries. (from left) General manager of Reddit.com Erick Martin, co-founder of Code.org Hadi Pavarti, Australian winning team Eyenaemia and . Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella . 'We basically want the app to be accessible to developing countries and rural areas of Australia so we can reach out those who are more disadvantaged,' he said. 'So we aim to have the app available at no cost for these areas.' They said the prize money will go towards further development of the app with the hope that Eyenaemia will be released in the next six to 12 months. It is currently being trialed at Mildura Base Hospital and Cabrini Hospital in Malvern, southeast of Melbourne. But just hours after their win, the two have one particular concern on their minds. 'We weren't expecting it, we were both so surprised,' Jennifer said. 'It's very exciting and it’s finally starting to sink in a little. 'But we've got three pretty big and glass trophies to take back with us - one which is the Imagine Cup and the other two which are the World Citizenship Champions. 'The problem is that we packed so light so now we really don't know how we're going to bring them back home.'","Melbourne students Jarrel Seah and Jennifer Tang crowned the winners at the Imagine Cup World Finals in Seattle on Friday .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Although smartwatches are a relatively new tech trend, Apple was working on a version as far back as 2011, according to its latest patent. The files detail a wristband fitted with a detachable electronic touchscreen device. The shape and size of the device in the patent images resembles a sixth-generation iPod Nano and in one design, the word iTime is written on its face. Apple's latest patent was filed in 2011 and awarded today. It details a wristband (pictured) fitted with a detachable electronic touchscreen, which resembles the shape and size of the sixth-generation iPod Nano . Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the end of 2013. Speculation . around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release . date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013. Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It was said to have a 1.5-inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other . rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let . users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. Last year the firm was awarded a patent for the name 'iWatch', but it’s still unclear what Apple’s much-rumoured wristband will be called. The latest patent was filed almost three years ago to the day, on 20 July 2011. Called ‘Wrist-worn electronic device and methods therefor’, the patent said: ‘An electronic wristband to be worn on a wrist of a user, comprising a central portion having a receptacle area configured to receive and electrically connect to a mobile electronic device, the mobile electronic device including a display and being independently useable, and at least one band portion coupled to the central portion.’ Put more simply, this means the device could be used in its own right, even when not connected to the wristband. Images also reveal the electronic device could slot in, and out, of the band similar to the Fitbit or Withings Pulse O2 activity trackers. One image reveals the name 'iTime' (pictured left), although an 'iWatch' patent was filed in 2013 so it's still unclear what the device will be called when it's eventually released. The patent images resemble the iWatchz Kube band sold as an official accessory on the Apple store, fitted with an iPod Nano (pictured right) Images also reveal the electronic device could slot in, and out, of the band similar to the Fitbit or Withings Pulse O2 activity trackers (pictured) The square shape of the device looks like the iPod Nano, released by Apple in 2010, and the whole watch resembles the iWatchz Kube band, sold as an official accessory on the Apple store. Embedded into the strap would be sensors, according to the patent, as well as a ‘vibration module.’ The module would alert wearers to notifications, for example, while the sensors would respond to hand and wrist gestures. The patent explained these could then be used to answer or reject calls and texts. ‘Another aspect of invention pertains to use of gestures with one's arm or wrist to provide a user input to an electronic wristband,' explained the patent. Embedded into the strap would be sensors, according to the patent, as well as a 'vibration module.' The module would alert wearers to notifications, for example, while the sensors could be used to detect hand and wrist gestures. The patent explained these could be used to answer or reject calls . Reports have previously claimed Apple's iWatch could double up as an activity tracker. This concept image reveals how the rumoured device and health tool might look. Dubbed the Diet Watch, it could track calories and steps as well as heart rate . ‘For example, once a notification request is received, the electronic wristband can notify its user. The wristband can also seek a response to the notification. Sensors including an accelerometer and a gyroscope will then correspond to specific movements. Examples detailed in the patent include ‘a horizontal movement for one user input option (e.g., decline incoming call), and might be a vertical movement for another user input option (e.g., accept incoming call).’ Alternatively, the gesture might be a single shake, bounce or tap, or a combination. Earlier this month, Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty claimed Apple’s iWatch is expected to cost around $300 and will sell between 30 and 60 million units. She believes it could sell as many units as Apple's iPad, and far more than the iPhone in its first year.","The patent was filed in 2011 but only awarded earlier today .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . A 3D-printed replica of King Richard III’s remains have been unveiled, ahead of the opening of a museum honouring the king tomorrow. The centre tells the story of his rise to power, his death in battle and the discovery of his bones. And curators hope that the museum will attract up to 100,000 visitors in its first year. A replica of the skeleton of King Richard III (shown), created using 3D printing, has gone on display in a new visitor's centre on the site where his remains were discovered in Leicester. The centre, opening on 26 July, tells the story of his rise to power, his death in battle and the discovery of his bones . The exhibits include a remarkably detailed facial reconstruction and the replica of Richard’s skeleton. Such is the detail of the replica that it clearly shows his curved spine, as well as his battle injuries, including the fatal blow that felled him. The centre entitled ‘King Richard III: Dynasty, Death and Discovery’ will also raise questions about how his disability should be portrayed in theatre and film. Other notable features include a new courtyard garden, glass entrance hall and cafe. The exhibition will also include a glass balcony that will use technology to show visitors how the modern day view compares with that of the city in the Middle Ages. Richard III's body received an unceremonious burial and the original tomb is believed to have been destroyed during the Reformation, with the remains being lost for more than five centuries. A workman applies last minute touches to the area around the actual location of the grave of Britain's King Richard III beneath the new visitor's centre, in Leicester. The centre will raise questions on how his disability should be portrayed in theatre and film . In 2012, an archaeological excavation was undertaken on a city council car park in Leicester using ground-penetrating radar on the site. The University of Leicester confirmed in February 2013 that all the evidence pointed to the skeleton that had been found in the excavation being that of Richard III (3Dreplica shown) In 2012, an archaeological excavation was undertaken on a city council car park in Leicester using ground-penetrating radar on the site once occupied by Greyfriars. The University of Leicester confirmed in February 2013 that all the evidence pointed to the skeleton that had been found in the excavation being that of Richard III. The skeleton of the last of the Plantagenet kings was identified by DNA analysis after researchers traced his living descendants. The scientists concluded it was the . remains of the King who had died in 1485 using a combination of the . radiocarbon dating, a comparison with contemporary reports of his . appearance, and a comparison of his mitochondrial DNA with that of two . matrilineal descendants of Richard III's eldest sister, Anne of York. The centre entitled 'King Richard III: Dynasty, Death and Discovery' exhibition will also include a glass balcony that will use technology to show visitors how the modern day view compares with that of the city in the Middle Ages.  Richard III's original tomb is believed to have been destroyed during the Reformation . Investigators from the University of Leicester revealed that the remains bore the marks of ten injuries inflicted shortly before his death. More gruesome, however, was evidence of ‘humiliation’ injuries, including several head wounds - part of the skull was sliced away - a cut to the ribcage and a pelvic wound likely caused by an upward thrust of a weapon, through the buttock. The skeleton was described of that of a slender male, in his late 20s or early 30s. Richard was 32 when he died. The skeleton also had a distinctive curvature of the spine synonymous with the hunchback king immortalised by Shakespeare. The university’s lead archaeologist Richard Buckley described the identity of the remains at the time as ‘beyond reasonable doubt.' ‘It is the academic conclusion of the University of Leicester that the individual exhumed at Greyfriars in August 2012 is indeed King Richard III, the last Plantagenet King of England.’ Richard was born in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. Richard was born on in 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire. Scientists found he had a curved spine and was riddled with roundworm . During the War of the Roses, . Richard's father, Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York was killed and in . 1470, Richard and his brother Edward were exiled when Henry VI, from the . rival house of Lancaster, took back the throne. Henry's reign was short lived and during a battle the following year, Edward became king. In 1483, Edward died and Richard was named as protector of the realm for Edward's son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Edward . V and his brother Richard were placed in the Tower of London and after a . campaign to condemn the deceased king's marriage to Elizabeth . Woodville, the princes were declared illegitimate. Richard III took to the throne the following day. He . was crowned in July and in August that year, the two princes . disappeared. Rumours spread the king had killed them to remove any . threat they may have posed to his reign. In 1485, Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond launched an attack on Richard III on Bosworth Field in Leicestershire. Many of Richard III's key lieutenants defected and he was killed in battle. Henry Tudor took the throne as Henry VII. It . has been confirmed that Richard III had a curvature of the spine, . although rumours of a withered arm appeared to be unfounded. Scientists also discovered the king was riddled with roundworm after . finding large numbers of the parasite’s eggs in soil taken from Richard . III’s pelvic region. The find suggests that the king’s intestines were . infected with roundworm during his life. Richard, depicted by William . Shakespeare as a monstrous tyrant who murdered two princes in the Tower . of London, died at the Battle of Bosworth Field, defeated by an army led . by Henry Tudor. According to historical records, his . body was taken 15 miles (24 kilometres) to Leicester where it was displayed as proof of . his death before being buried in the Franciscan friary. The team from Leicester University . set out to trace the site of the old church and its precincts, including . the site where Richard was finally laid to rest. They began excavating the city centre . location in August last year and soon discovered the skeleton, which . was found in good condition with its feet missing in a grave around 27 inches (68 centimetres) below ground level. It was lying in a rough cut grave with the hands crossed in a manner which indicated they were bound when he was buried. To the naked eye, it was clear that the remains had a badly curved spine and trauma injuries to the rear of the head. But archaeologists were keen to make no official announcement until the skeleton had been subjected to months of tests. As they were found: The remains of King Richard III were found in a hastily dug grave beneath a council car park in Leicester last September, in what were once the precincts of Grey Friars church . The skull of the king as it was found by archaeologists: Trauma to the skeleton showed the king died after one of two significant wounds to the back of the skull - possibly caused by a sword and a halberd . Hunched in death as he was in life: The skeleton was found in good condition with its feet missing . The Battle of Bosworth: Richard, pictured on the . white horse, was killed in battle more than 500 years ago at Bosworth . field, in a battle which marked the end of his line and the rise of the . Tudors . Speaking at a press conference after the discovery, . University of Leicester geneticist Dr Turi King described how . researchers had traced Richard’s descendants to confirm the body was . indeed that of England’s last medieval king. These were Canadian born furniture . maker Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of the Richard’s sister Anne of . York, and a second person who has asked to remain anonymous. Dr King said: ‘The DNA sequence . obtained from the Grey Friars skeletal remains was compared with the two . maternal line relatives of Richard III. ‘We were very excited to find that . there is a DNA match between the maternal DNA from the family of Richard . III and the skeletal remains we found at the Grey Friars dig.’ The king's actual remains are due to be sealed in a tomb at Leicester Cathedral next year.","A new centre has opened in Leicester to tell the story of King Richard III .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . For some people, a holiday is a chance to expand their horizons – or shake off the working world with a week of fun, activities and exploration. But for Britons, it seems, a trip away is about doing as little as possible. A new survey has found that British . travellers are among the laziest on the planet when it comes to . holidays, preferring lethargy and relaxation to any sort of exercise. This will do me nicely, thanks: More than nine in ten Britons just want an easy life while on holiday . The Flip Flop Report – an annual survey compiled by travel booking company Expedia – has revealed that the UK is the third least active nation on the planet when it comes to time off. Citizens of only two other countries – Japan and Thailand – rank as less likely to do anything constructive with their place in the sun according to the research, which looked at the travel habits of people in four different continents to provide a worldwide picture. And, according to the results, over nine out of ten Britons – 92 per cent – just want an easy life when they go on holiday, and will pick a quiet destination. Perhaps surprisingly, only 13 per cent of British holidaymakers say they feel excited at the thought of partying while on their big summer break. This is in stark contrast to Brazilians – 87 per cent of those questioned from South America’s biggest country say they expect big nights out during their break. Blissful immobility: Britons just want to do nothing while away - but Brazilian travellers can't resist a lively party . Less than one in five Britons – 19 per cent – say they can be bothered to go swimming or surfing, or take part in other watersports when they are on the beach. Other countries ‘outed’ as lazy travellers include South Korea, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Ireland and Singapore, which help make up the top ten. The survey also reveals the top ten most energetic nations when it comes to travel. India, Mexico and Malaysia form the top three on this score, with honourable mentions for Austria, Brazil, Germany, Canada, New Zealand, Spain and Hong Kong. The study took in the opinions of 11,165 respondents, aged 18 or over, in Europe, North America, South America and Asia. All respondents had taken a beach holiday in the last 12 months – or are planning to take one in the next year.","New research assesses which nations are the laziest when on holiday .

"By . Larisa Brown . A teenager has told how her mother must feed her through her heart every night just to keep her alive. Jodie Vasquez, 18, has a connective tissue disorder that means she faces constant pain and needs a wheelchair as her joints dislocate easily. Her mother, Maxine Farish, has the daunting task of drip feeding vital nutrients through a tube going directly to her daughter's heart. She knows that every time she administers the nutrients, one mistake could be fatal. Inspirational: Teenager Jodie Vasquez, 18, from Carlisle, is fighting the rare condition Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and can only be fed through a tube into her heart . Jodie, of Carlisle, Cumbria, has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Hypermobility Type III (EDS), a disorder that affects the collagen in the body and can also interfere with the way internal organs, nerves and muscles work. Since her diagnosis three years ago, the teenager's life has been turned upside down and, as she watches her twin sister, Emma, live life to the full, Jodie knows her time may sadly be limited. Jodie has been in and out of hospital and has had to undergo more than a dozen operations and has not eaten since 2009, instead taking nutrients via an intravenous drip. Every day she deals with intense pain and needs a wheelchair to get about as her joints dislocate easily and she suffers from chronic fatigue. But the inspirational teenager today said she refuses to let the illness take over her life and revealed she is determined to remain positive and raise awareness. 'I don't know how long life will be, but I have got the condition for a reason and I just have to fight it and keep happy,' she explained. 'My family have been amazingly supportive and they have really helped me all the way. 'It can be difficult to watch my sister do things I should also be doing as an 18-year-old, but I'm glad it's me that has EDS so Emma doesn't have to go through what I do.' Proud: Jodie, right, and her mum Maxine Farish, left. Jodie's mother said her daughter is an inspiration . From the age of 14 it started to become clear that something was seriously wrong with Jodie's health. She began to suffer severe cramping pains, sickness and a loss of appetite. However, it took a year before a definitive diagnosis was made. The youngster was seen by medics at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary and, following a series of tests and examinations, Jodie was transferred to experts at the Royal London Hospital where she was told she had EDS. It is estimated the illness affects one in every 5,000 people in the UK. No two cases of EDS are the same and the type Jodie has is unusual and serious as it damages internal organs. EDS is often an inherited disease and research shows that around three quarters of sufferers have a family history of the illness. Jodie needs a wheelchair to get about as her joints dislocate easily and she suffers from chronic fatigue . Rare: EDS affects one in every 5,000 people in the UK. The type Jodie has is unusual and serious as it . damages internal organs . Jodie said: 'When I was diagnosed with the condition it was such a relief to finally know what was wrong with me and have some answers. 'It was upsetting when I was told the condition couldn't be fixed, but I feel it's important to look forward and remain positive.' Jodie has severe complex intestinal failure, has had her large bowel removed and a permanent stoma bag fitted, her small intestine has stopped working, her stomach doesn't function and her bladder has failed. It was hoped she would be able to get a five-organ transplant but doctors have said she would not survive the surgery. As the teenager cannot tolerate food she has not eaten since 2009 and is fed intravenously into the heart by a Total Parental Nutrition tube (TPN), however, this comes with serious risks including septicaemia and liver disease. 'It is really scary to get the TPN and each time it's terrifying to think what could happen,' explained Jodie. Mother Maxine, left, must drip feed vital nutrients through a tube going directly to her 18-year-old daughter Jodie's heart . 'It is hard not to eat - I do miss chocolate and pasta and I get weird cravings. But the pain I get with the illness is worse than the not eating.' Her mum Maxine, 47, who is married to Stephen, 44, an HGV driver, said: 'Jodie's diagnosis was life-changing and our whole world revolves around her illness and the care she needs. 'She is the epitome of courage in the face of adversity. Jodie is a true inspiration and I am so proud of her and how well she copes with everything. 'Every day it's heartbreaking as I'm always checking on Jodie, just as you would a baby. But you have to live life and make the most of it.'","Jodie Vasquez has not eaten since 2009 .

Camilla has already forged a career as a talented musician after being spotted by Take That star Gary Barlow in 2009.

"By . Wills Robinson . Police were put on high alert after a 6ft crocodile was reported to be on the run in Bristol city centre. The reptile was allegedly spotted by a bus driver underneath a bridge which runs over the River Avon in Bedminster. It was reportedly seen lurking in the river which is around 500ft away from a nursery and 1,000ft away from a secondary school. Disappeared: Avon and Somerset Chief Constable Nick Gargan wrote on Twitter that officers 'can't find it' after Mr Rea reported the 'sighting' Safety: The senior officer then told a follower there was 'no need to stay indoors' but advised her not to go water-skiing along the river . The six-foot reptile was reportedly seen lurking in the river which is around 500ft away from a nursery and 1,000ft away from a secondary school . It is unknown where the animal could have came from, but Bristol Zoo, which is two miles away, say no crocodile or alligator has escaped from any of its enclosures. Nick Gargan, the Chief Constable of Avon and Somerset Police, first raised the alarm when he reported the sighting on Twitter. 'One of our officers was flagged down by a bus driver today, claiming to have seen a 6ft crocodile under Coronation Bridge. We can't find it,' he wrote on the social media site yesterday. When asked by one Twitter user whether there was a crocodile on the loose, Mr Gargan replied: 'it may mean precisely that, madam. No need to stay indoors - but you may want to think twice before you go water-skiing.' Today, officers in Fishponds posted a photo of the river on Twitter and said: 'We have seen the reports & searching Eastville Park and Snuff Mills in full riot gear as we speak.' A mock account for the animal has since been started on the microblogging site. Chris the Croc - with the Twitter handle @TheBristolCroc - already has more than 900 followers. Sighting: The reptile was reportedly lurking below Bedminster Bridge in the city centre . Raising the alarm: Nick Gargan wrote about the alleged sighting on Twitter. He advised people against 'water-skiing' A leading reptile expert has revealed that a crocodile could survive in Bristol's waterways but it would be a struggle. Dr Adam Britton, is an English zoologist who works in Darwin, Australia, home to some of the world's largest saltwater crocodiles. The scientist, who studied for his pHD in Bristol, said a number of people in the UK do keep the deadly predators as pets, but while it could survive in the wild in Britain, it wouldn't last for long. He said: 'Assuming it is a genuine sighting it would almost certainly have to be an escaped or released pet. Quite a few people in the UK keep crocodilians. 'Let's say it was a crocodile. Crocodiles are resilient creatures, they can tolerate a wide range of temperatures, and can even survive brief periods of freezing temperatures. 'Some species like alligators can find shelter to stay warm when it freezes, or even remain underwater to act as a temperature buffer. 'The animal would be extremely lethargic under those conditions. It's a challenge for any crocodile to survive those conditions and it's unlikely to last long. 'In terms of food, if it's stressed it probably won't eat very much, especially not when it's so cold, but if it were to survive into the warmer months it would take a variety of small mammals, fish, amphibians, even birds. I don't rate its chances though.' Dr Britton revealed that if it was a six-foot crocodile, it would only be a few years old. But a six-foot caiman, which is a species of alligator, would be closer to full size. He added: 'Another possibility is that it was misidentified, in which case it could have been something like a monitor lizard or possibly even an iguana, which to the untrained eye could look a bit crocodile-like. 'Both monitors and iguanas can swim to add to the effect. It's also possible of course that it was nothing of the sort, but you'll have to speak with the guy who spotted it to learn more about that. At large: Staff at Bristol Zoo confirmed the animal had not escaped from one of their enclosures . Mr Rea first spotted the creature under Coronation Bridge, in Bristol, at around 9.05am at the beginning of February (stock picture) Even though the animals are normally found in warmer climates such as Australia and Africa, it is not there has been an alleged siting of a crocodile or alligator in the UK. In 2000, people walking in a park in Newcastle upon Tyne reported spotting a large reptile. Visitors were convinced they saw a six foot alligator lurking beneath the water of a boating lake and police were called in to investigate. In 2008, there was a sighting of a creature in the Lake Morfa area of Swansea. And just over 12 months ago Richard Smith, a pensioner from Reading, claimed to have seen a crocodile swimming in the Thames. He said: 'I was cycling on my own and I saw what I thought was a bough of a tree with four stubby branches on it close in to the bank. 'As I got closer I saw it was a crocodile. It was about 4ft long. It had a 2ft tail and 2ft body.' In 2011, police in Corydon, South London, were called in after they discovered that three-feet crocodiles were being kept as pets. A spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said they would not be commenting any further on the issue.","Six-foot reptile was reportedly first spotted by a bus driver yesterday .

Venice and Ibiza make up the top five destinations where holidaymakers are most likely to part with too much cash. Scroll down for video . Overspend capital: Brits are more likely to blow their budget in Vegas than anywhere else in the world . 1. Las Vegas, US2. Paris, France3. New York, US4. Venice, Italy5. Ibiza, Spain . The new research discovered that 57 per cent of Britons have blown their holiday budget while abroad - with 6 per cent even having to return home early after running out of finances while away. Asked why they had spent too much while on a break, 55 per cent said they had been ‘caught up in the excitement of being on holiday’, while 33 per cent said that they ‘had not budgeted well’ for their trip. The research, conducted by www.vouchercloud.com, surveyed 1,973 UK over 18s who had been on holiday in the past five years. The survey also quizzed travellers on how they managed to get hold of extra cash while away. Some 45 per cent stated they had to draw more money out whilst abroad, incurring bank charges, followed by 32 per cent that said they had been forced to put items on their credit cards and 20 per cent who had called upon family members and friends at home. Paris was ranked in second place in a survey of where Brits would be most likely to blow their holiday budget . Brits ranked New York as the third destination in the world which they'd be most likely to blow their budget . A further 6 per cent had to call their holiday short in order to come home early after running out of money. Matthew Wood, a spokesman for vouchercloud.com, said: ‘It’s easy to see why people overspend on holiday. ‘You’re often caught in the moment and just want to enjoy yourself, leaving all the financial constraints and worries at home. ‘Plus, in the back of your mind, you know that you may only get one chance to see, do and buy these things; you might never go back to that destination again! ‘The best way to get round this, which is often overlooked during the planning process, is to do a bit more research into what the destination and local area has to offer before you step foot anywhere near a plane. ‘There is plenty of information on the net and in travel guides, which will mean you can budget effectively with a level head and avoid any unexpected expenditure whilst enjoying your holiday.’","Paris and New York make up the three most expensive destinations .

Greek Island hopping has traditionally been the preserve of those willing to jump on ferries to sail between different outposts, but one Greek aviation company is hoping to change all that. Hellenic Seaplanes is hoping to launch a service as early as next year, allowing tourists to hop between different Greek islands by seaplane. There are currently just 50 airports across the country's 6,000 islands, meaning travellers rely on a ferry service to explore the Mediterranean, but the airline hopes to create affordable flights and offer a whopping 100 connections by 2016.

Romanian nightclub bouncer called Leon took exception to Kyle's 'commercial rubbish' - and decided to take matters into his own hands. The man last night revealed how he carried out the attack outside Bonkers . Bar because Kyle was 'making Magaluf look s***' - when it is 'actually a nice place to live'. Leon - who said he would happily spray Kyle again - told the Tab: 'He was walking down the strip with camera making it look sh*t. He wasn't showing the good side of Magaluf. 'I don't like that sort of publicity - it's not good. It's been happening for a while now and it's definitely not the way to promote a place. He ran away behind the corner. 'I don't like the way he portrays the place. We're like family here - we clean everything and keep it that way. 'It's actually a nice place to live which is why you find lots of families here with their kids being raised here.' One witness said: 'Kyle was on the island filming God knows what. Suddenly outside of the window of my DJ booth I see a mass crowd and chanting going up the street. 'I look outside, and there's a camera with a light facing someone and I realise its Jeremy Kyle. Kyle, best known for his daytime TV show, says he was not hurt in the incident but decided to 'vacate the area' The 40-year-old bouncer said he would happily spray Kyle again because of the way he made Magaluf look bad when it was actually a nice place to live . 'He's being mobbed, then suddenly everyone disperses and I see people running away towards me and in all directions crying and coughing and saying it was tear gas. Then when I clarified with Leon, he said it was pepper spray.' The incident was also witnessed by Scarlett Moffatt, star of TV show Gogglebox, who was visiting the resort. She wrote in the Daily Star: 'It was clear to all that [Kyle] wasn't making a show to promote ""Maga"" and wanted to dish the dirt in the name of shock entertainment where his viewers can judge what they don't understand. 'It ended with Jezza being pepper-sprayed by the bouncer and the poor fella was as confused as one of his show guests getting a full-house on the lie detector machine.' A spokesman for Jeremy Kyle last night played down the incident, claiming the TV presenter was not the main target of the pepper-spray. The spokesman said: 'Jeremy was walking around the strip with his film crew on Friday night when someone in the busy crowd sprayed the spray above their heads. A teen (left) was filmed performing sex acts on 24 men, in a further blow to the reputation of the resort (right) 'They decided to vacate the area to be on the safe side, as the spray was starting to have an affect on the eyes. 'Jeremy wasn't trying to get into the nightclub and wasn't refused entry by a bouncer. 'He is filming in Magaluf for an upcoming series which is expected to run next year and one episode will focus on the youth culture in the area.' The resort's reputation has sunk even lower this summer, after video footage emerged of a girl performing sex acts on 24 men for a free drink. It is believed the Northern Irish teen had been told she would win a 'free holiday' for the performance, but a 'holiday' turned out to be the name of a cocktail at the bar. The head of Carnage Events Magalluf, who organised the bar crawl on which the incident happened, then caused outrage by blaming the girl. Paul Smith insisted he bore no 'moral responsibility' for the girl's actions, adding: 'She should be spoken to by her parents. It's something to do with her upbringing.' A girl passes out on Magaluf's infamous Punta Bellena strip. The resort's reputation has crashed this summer . The bar crawls also hosted Benefits Street star White Dee, who was seen downing beer and shots . Earlier this year, Benefits Street star White Dee was photographed hosting the bar crawl while still claiming she was 'too depressed to work'. The 42-year-old mother-of-two, who rose to fame on the Channel 4 documentary examining the lives of the unemployed, was pictured kissing a young man and clutching bottles of champagne. She later denied she had been drinking and said taking part in the events was part of her rehabilitation back into work. But the photos caused anger back in Britain, with one MP branding Dee a 'poster girl' for people who think they can become 'famous for doing nothing'. The pub crawl scandal has led two other reality TV stars, James 'Arg' Argent and Dan Osborne from The Only Way is Essex, to pull out of hosting the event. A spokesman for the pair said today: 'Arg and Dan Osborne won't be going to the pool parties because they started filming a couple of weeks late and are behind schedule. 'Whether they take part in the pool parties in future is something we will look at, but they definitely won't be going on the pub crawl, which is what the public has a problem with. 'They were only ever booked to go to the pool party and we are now considering whether to reschedule that.'","Talk show host sprayed while filming documentary about Majorcan resort .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . France is so worried about its culinary reputation that authorities are set to introduce a 'homemade' logo to menus to prove to diners that food is freshly prepared. The rise of microwaved and prep-prepared food being served up in French restaurants has prompted the move in a bid to safeguard the country's reputation as a gastronomic great. From tomorrow, French restaurants will be able to use a specially-designed 'homemade' logo if the in-house chef has made everything from scratch. Dining out: French restaurants are famed for their culinary expertise, but there are fears that standards are declining . Alternatively, the logo can be placed on the menu next to specific dishes that are made in-house to reassure diners that food is fresh. An official government publication announced the change to secure France's culinary reputation, amid fears that pre-packaged food is diminishing the quality of dishes served in restaurants. Consumer affairs minister Carole Delga said: 'The aim of this decree is to recognise the act of cooking, recognise a know-how... by giving the consumer simple and reliable information.' And while frozen meat, delivered to restaurants to be used in homemade dishes will be allowed to use the logo, other frozen items may not. High standards: The new 'homemade' logo will only apply to dishes created completely in-house . Ms Delga explained: 'Frozen chips for example are not part of this decree. That means that those used by fast-food restaurants will not be considered homemade, just like sauces that arrive ready-made will not be considered homemade.' However, other pre-prepared foods will be allowed to be included in 'homemade' dishes, such as pasta, bread, cheese and wine. The new legislation is a bid to improve what many say are declining standards in French restaurants. Going gourmet: The idea is to celebrate the best of French cooking and combat declining standards in restaurants . In recent months, France has taken various steps to encourage more tourists to visit. Ministers have told French citizens to be 'nicer' to tourists, while Chinese police have also been draughted in to help big-spending Chinese tourists in Paris. Legislation to force certain shops to open for Sunday trading is another way France is attempting to make itself more appealing to travellers - particularly those from China and Russia.","French restaurants fear declining standards could damage their reputation .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . BBC Sport’s hold on live television rights to The Open for more than half a century could end in 2016 when their contract expires. Tournament organisers the R&A, who have not considered any other TV partners for most of their 59 years with the Beeb, are now more open to accept an offer from Sky, who dominate golf coverage for the rest of the year. R&A chief executive Peter Dawson left the door ajar for Sky at Royal Birkdale two years ago when he declared it was not a foregone conclusion that the BBC would win the next TV contract. VIDEO Scroll down to see the stunning preview of the Hoylake course . Bye, bye Beeb? Rory McIlroy takes a shot from the bunker at practice at Hoylake . And certainly R&A opinion has shifted a lot further towards a subscription TV partner with the astonishing deal done in America by Fox Sports who, with no previous golf experience, have paid more than $1billion over 12 years for US Open rights. This is regarded as a game-changer on both sides of the Atlantic, with the USGA prepared to relinquish their long partnership with NBC in return for a mountain of dollars. And the R&A will not want to fall behind the money invested in the other three majors. Sky, who have shored up their golf contracts after arch-rivals BT Sport made a bid for the PGA tour, are certain to want to add to their portfolio a flagship event such as The Open. And if they put enough money on the table, the likelihood is that they will. The Open is no longer protected as a listed event that has to be shown live on terrestrial television. It is rated the same as home Test cricket, which moved to Sky in 2006, meaning live Open golf can be sold to the highest bidder provided there is provision for a terrestrial highlights show. Those intending to visit IMG House near the entrance to Royal Liverpool Golf Club should be warned that Ari Emanuel, highly volatile new boss of the sports management giants, is due in Hoylake to watch The Open. Emanuel chucked out former IMG executive Andrew Croker from a Wimbledon hospitality area despite Croker having been invited in. Strumming away: Jake Bugg will perform at the Ryder Cup 2014 in September . Coincidentally, Ari’s brother Rahm, the mayor of Chicago, made a mediocre speech at the gala function in his city where the 2012 Ryder Cup teams were introduced with the entertainment provided by Justin Timberlake and the band Chicago. The mixed bag of acts for the Glasgow concert at the Hydro Arena ahead of the Gleneagles match in September includes Jake Bugg, Texas, Twin Atlantic and Nina Nesbitt. Graham Brown, former captain of Royal Liverpool and holder of the amateur course record, has had a difficult time during the long fall-out from his horror speech at the annual golf writers’ dinner at Carnoustie in 2007. Brown, an R&A rules official at that tournament, made highly derogatory remarks about Japanese golfers and black caddies. There is still enough sensitivity surrounding Brown’s racist comments for Hoylake members to be wary of the AGW event. Brown has kept a low profile since 2007 but turned up for Sunday lunch in the Hoylake clubhouse wearing a pair of swimming trunks. The next day all Hoylake members received a curt email reminding them of the dress code. One positive for Brown is that he is due to re-marry soon. It is hard to believe after those . damning Las Vegas holiday pictures, but FA officials considered Jack .

Puffing away: But FA officials believed Jack Wilshere had grown up on England's World Cup campaign . BBC Radio 5 Live, who didn’t cover the World Cup third-place play-off for cost reasons, were due to make England commentary a one-man job following Mike Ingham’s retirement. But Alan Green, having signed a two-year contract, will still be doubling up with new football correspondent Jon Murray next season. Return of the legend: BT Sport may well take up Alan Hansen on his request to cover Liverpool . Meanwhile, expect BT Sport to take up retiring Alan Hansen on his wish to do occasional guest pundit appearances on Liverpool games in the Champions League if the Reds qualify for the 2015-16 competition. It’s refreshing that forklift driver John Singleton, who qualified for The Open with the help of a couple of wedges he’d never used before, doesn’t believe in too professional a preparation for the event.

"By . Ray Massey . Tourists were astonished to see the Fab Four belting out their most famous songs at some of the capital’s most famous landmarks on top of a bright red open-topped London double-decker bus. But for the cast of the hit West End Beatles musical ‘Let it Be’ it almost became ‘let’s be having you’ as the long arm of the law took exception to their antics outside the Broadcasting House headquarters of Britain’s BBC. Scroll down for video . The Let It Be band in front of Big Ben, from left to right: James Fox, Luke Roberts, Paul Canning, John Brosnan . The mobile open air concert which included stops at Trafalgar Square and the palace of Westminster which houses ‘Big Ben’ was to promote the first night of the musical’s summer run at London’s Garrick Theatre in Charing Cross Road where the Beatles bus tour came to its final stop attracting hundreds of fans, many singing along. A production is also underway this week in Monaco, home of the super-rich with show producer Jamie Hendry said at the ‘Let it Be’ after-show party: ‘I thought at one stage we were going to get arrested. It was a bit tense. I think they were going to call the police if we hadn’t moved along.’ He said: ‘Obviously we were careful to make sure we had all the right paperwork and permissions to perform where we did, but we may have been pushing it a little when we tried to play an impromptu gig in the foyer of Broadcasting House – their security people very politely but very firmly made it plain that we should clear out before we were thrown out.’ Come together: The open air concert included stops at Trafalgar Square and the palace of Westminster . But he added generously: ‘We’d like to offer all the security staff who were on duty that day a free pair of tickets to the show so they can see what they were missing out on!’ The Fab Four cast’s run in with the law had echoes of the real Beatles’ final public performance  on the  open roof of the  Apple offices of London’s Savile Row on January 30, 1969. The 42 minute set which included ‘Get Back’ ended when police arrived to stop the performance. John Lennon declared to watching office workers, media and police officers: ‘I’d like to say thank you on behalf of  the group and ourselves and I hope we passed the audition.’ Iconic: James Fox and Paul Canning from the Let It Be band performing in Piccadilly Circus, London . Playing the Fab Four on Thursday night’s Let it Be’ opening performance which brought the house down were Michael Gagliano (John),  Emanuele Angeletti (Paul), Liverpudlian Paul Mannion (George) and Luke Roberts (Ringo). The ‘Let it Be’ musical showcases the music of the world’s most successful rock’n’roll band which sparkd ‘Beatlemania’ . It charts the band’s meteoric rise from their humble beginnings in Liverpool’s Cavern Club, through to breaking into America at the Shea Stadium, and Sgt  Pepper and the psychedelic flower power era. Big hitters: The show is packed with over forty of The Beatles' best songs including Twist and Shout, I Wanna Hold Your Hand and Hard Day's Night . The production originally opened at the Prince of Wales Theatre in September 2012, before transferring for a year-long run at the Savoy Theatre from January 2013  to  February 2014, and then a UK and worldwide tour. It has been  seen by more than 700,000 people worldwide  and recently delighted audiences in Germany, Japan, Moscow, and on Broadway in New York. The show is packed with over forty of The Beatles’ greatest hits including Twist and Shout,  I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Help, Hard Day’s Night, Day Tripper, Sgt.

"By . Phil Casey . The Scottish golfer Alastair Forsyth defended the decision to finish the Madeira Islands Open after his caddie died on the course on Sunday. Forsyth was playing the ninth hole on the steeply undulating Santo da Serra layout - when 52-year-old Zimbabwean Iain McGregor collapsed on the fairway and suffered a fatal heart-attack. Frantic attempts to revive him failed and an indefinite suspension of play was initially announced. However the decision was later taken to resume play at 6pm, with England's Daniel Brooks eventually beating Scotland's Scott Henry on the first play-off hole. Warning: Graphic Content .

'Everybody is in shock,' Forsyth said. 'To see that happen to someone in front of your eyes - I don't know how or when you get over that. 'Myself and playing partners Adam (Gee) and Tano (Goya) met tournament officials and spoke to (European Tour chief executive) George O'Grady on the phone before taking the decision to play on, because we felt that was what Mac would have wanted. 'He was a guy I've known for 15 years and was very popular amongst the caddies. Obviously my thoughts go out to his family at this time. For something like this to happen so suddenly is so sad. 'He's was far too young for this to happen. He was the life and soul of the caddies' lounge and a nice guy who will be sorely missed. I'm absolutely numb.' The decision to finish the event was criticised by a number of players, including Sweden's Joel Sjoholm who had previously worked with McGregor. 'Can't believe that they are sending out players to finish the 2nd and final round when someone just died on the course!!!,' Sjoholm, who missed the 18-hole cut in Madeira, wrote on Twitter. 'R.I.P my dear Mac! Way too young! This going to be a tough evening!' Spain's Gonzalo Fernandez-Castano wrote: 'Really sad news from Madeira. We are going to miss you Mac.

Tragic: Competitors walk back to the clubhouse after hearing of the death of  MacGregor . And in reply to a post saying it was 'a pity' the tournament had continued, Fernandez-Castano added. 'I can't agree more #shame.' A statement from the European Tour read: 'It is with great sadness and deep regret that we report the untimely passing of caddie Iain McGregor during play on the final day of the Madeira Islands Open - Portugal - BPI. 'Everyone at The European Tour extends our deepest sympathies to the friends and family of Iain at this time. Following consultation with the players and caddies involved, however, it has been decided that play should continue and the tournament should finish. 'A minute's silence has taken place at the clubhouse and play resumed at 6pm local time. All administration will be taken care of by The European Tour and we will help in any way possible.' The European Tour's 1,500th tournament had been reduced to 36 holes due to numerous lengthy delays caused by fog, with Brooks and Henry eventually finishing tied on nine under par. Henry birdied the last three holes to force a play-off but then three-putted the first extra hole, the 18th, as Brooks secured the title with a par.","WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES .

"By . Thomas Neal . As she strides purposefully through an African forest in leopard-print Wellingtons, Essex girl Rachael Murton is pursued by six excitable elephants. Together, the lumbering animals weigh a combined 500 stone, but Chelmsford-born Rachael retains her composure. For these young orphaned elephants, this devoted young British woman is their surrogate mum, and each wants to be first for a cuddle. Tenderly, these colossal beasts — years from being fully grown — raise their trunks to 33-year-old Rachael's face, seeming to wrap her in an embrace. Scroll down for video .

Drink up: The baby elephant guzzles down a couple of litres of milk. Their mothers usually suckle them until they are two or three . When adult females are killed for their tusks, their babies quickly become emaciated because they need maternal milk to grow until the age of two or three . A biology graduate who left the UK after university, Rachael has dedicated her life to saving baby elephants left without their real mums by poachers killing indiscriminately for ivory and bush-meat in Zambia. Not only does she nurse the severely traumatised animals back to health, she is also on 24-hour call to mount dangerous rescue operations to bring abandoned elephants to safety. 'I've always loved animals and I left my white stilettos in Essex,' jokes Rachael, who came to Zambia in 2008 after working on animal conservation projects around the world. She manages the Lilayi Elephant Nursery, the only orphanage of its kind in southern Africa, for anti-poaching organisation Game Rangers International, which has links to the International Fund For Animal Welfare. The orphanage, near the capital Lusaka, performs a vital role in a country where ivory poachers who sell tusks to dealers for the Far East market are unlikely to be arrested. When adult females are killed for their tusks, their babies quickly become emaciated because they need maternal milk to grow until the age of two or three.

Stepping out: Rachael dons her leopard-print boots to lead the parade . Rachael, who studied at Royal Holloway College, near Egham, Surrey, is the woman park rangers turn for help . Forlorn and confused, they are shunned by their herds because their weak state means they are more likely to attract lions. Without human intervention, orphaned elephants would quickly die. Rachael, who studied at Royal Holloway College, near Egham, Surrey, is the woman park rangers turn for help, even going up in a microlight on one dramatic rescue when two baby elephants came close to plunging over Victoria Falls. Until 2012, when the orphanage was opened, she was based in the bush, living without modern conveniences for many months of the year. Her passion to help was fuelled after she found two-year-old female Suni, who was attacked with an axe when her mother was poached. Rachael and her Zambian keepers now dote on the young elephant who had horrific injuries. To save Suni's limp leg, Game Rangers International commissioned a special metal boot so she can walk. She also has acupuncture. The Lilayi orphan herd also includes young bull Zambezi, who has an astonishing rescue story. A barman at a safari lodge spotted what he thought was a rather portly guest splashing about in the swimming pool. Looking closer, he realised it was actually a one-month-old baby elephant. Separated from his mother, he was desperate for water and had tumbled into the pool as he tried to drink. Once sufficiently recovered, the orphans will be returned to the wild in Zambia's Kafue National Park. In this gigantic wilderness the size of Wales, they are initially kept safe from harm in a controlled area. But eventually they will be free to roam with the herds. While the international ivory trade continues to kill thousands, it is left to brave animal lovers like Rachael to pick up the pieces.

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . The first Test at Lord’s provided plenty of material for both sides of the Great Divide. If you think the new era is a land of milk and honey, you’ll have gone home cuddling your positives. And if you regard the ECB and Alastair Cook as devils incarnate, you’ll be smugly shaking your head. The truth is somewhere in the middle. For while there were moments when Cook’s captaincy reverted to the type we winced at in Australia, the fact remains that England almost took seven wickets after tea on one of the flattest surfaces in the world game. Oh, and it turned into an amazing game of cricket – a nine-down special which England, as if attempting to keep Test cricket alive all by themselves, seem to produce about once a year. Can't believe it! Stuart Broad and England came within a whisker of winning the first Test against Sri Lanka . Contrast: Nuwan Pradeep (left) and Shaminda Eranga fist bump after guiding the tourists to a draw at Lord's . Of course, some perceptions refuse to be altered by the facts. England’s first innings rattled along at 4.4 runs an over, their fastest run-rate in a Test innings of 40 overs or more since India’s bowlers kept laying out buffets in 2011. Yet still some called it boring. Then there was England’s second innings, condemned in some quarters as the period of the game which cost them the chance of victory. Arriving at the ground that day, Kevin Pietersen tweeted his wish: a lead of 380 by stumps. He got 389. Despite this, others argued that England should have declared earlier, and that Cook’s desire to allow Gary Ballance to complete a maiden Test hundred obscured the team goal. It is an argument that ignores a couple of important points. The first is that England spent much of the fourth afternoon trying to prevent their collapse of 6 for 75 from turning into something terminal. Shaminda Eranga’s probing spell earned Sri Lanka the right to scupper an early declaration. It wasn’t until the final few overs of the day that Ballance felt comfortably about hitting out. If Cook had given himself half an hour to bowl at Sri Lanka on the fourth evening, the target would have closer to 330 – not inconceivable on a surface that remained flat and with Kumar Sangakkara batting like Superman. The chances are that Sri Lanka would have been only three down at tea on the final day in any case. And it was a minor miracle that England came so close to forcing a win. But, yes, there were issues too. Cook’s field placings on the fourth morning, when England needed three quick wickets to cement their huge first-innings advantage, smacked of a team that had not yet got the Ashes whitewash out of their systems. Cook began with four men on the fence for Angelo Mathews, and later increased that to five. As Nasser Hussain pointed out, boundary fielders are not necessarily a problem – so long as attacking fielders are in place too. Yet Mathews twice nibbled Anderson between keeper and a floating slip for four. The field was not so much in-out as shake-it-all-about. The last hour also included a couple of curious calls. Why give an over to Joe Root, which for a minute or two took the sting out of the situation? And why bring on Liam Plunkett for the ante-penultimate over when this was precisely the kind of scenario beloved of Stuart Broad? We shouldn’t be shocked by these quibbles (though the over-rate from both sides was appalling): Cook will never wake up to discover he is Mike Brearley. And at least he showed willing while setting an 8-1 off-side field on Monday afternoon – even if he later admitted the idea was Jimmy Anderson’s. Pumped up: James Anderson was in devastating form for England in the final session on the fifth day . For more cricket-related snippets, feel free to go to twitter.com/the_topspin . Besides which, there was plenty at Lord’s to enthuse about. Ballance conveyed a rare kind of calm for a 24-year-old in only his second Test, and Moeen Ali batted with assured elegance in the first innings. Joe Root’s double-hundred, meanwhile, has glossed over his winter travails. Yes, the attack lacks a proper spinner - England must hope Monty Panesar gets his act together for the arrival of India - but Chris Jordan took five wickets in his first Test, and Plunkett’s impression of a battering ram ought to receive its due on a more conducive pitch. England began the Test ready to be written off as a rabble, and came within an inside edge of pulling off one of their most memorable wins for years. It’s not a bad start. That's better: Alastair Cook tried to think up some more imaginative fields as the hosts searched for wickets . THAT WAS THE WEEK THAT WAS . Everyone knew what he meant, but that didn’t stop Moeen Ali’s assessment of Sam Robson, his fellow Test debutant, making an early bid for Freudian slip of the year. ‘I don’t think of Sam as an Australian,’ said Moeen of the Sydney-born opening batsman ahead of the Lord’s Test against Sri Lanka. ‘I just think of him as a normal person.’ It’s the kind of accommodating approach England’s new era is crying out for. He's a... person! Moeen Ali (right) claimed he doesn't see Australian debutant Sam Robson as an Australian . Alex Hales should be careful. Not only is he in danger of getting picked for the one-day series against India later this summer on account of being one of the cleanest hitters in the land, but he has also been shredding his reputation as a white-ball specialist. Sent to Coventry (and, briefly, Worcestershire) after averaging under 14 in the 2013 County Championship, Hales has been causing a stir back in Nottinghamshire’s first-class colours, smashing 167 off 133 balls against Sussex, then 96 off 110 against Middlesex. Much more of this and the selectors may be left with no choice but to accept he is indeed capable of batting in innings that last more than 20 overs. Blasting: Alex Hales has been in sensational form for Nottinghamshire in all formats of the county game . A fortnight at the World Twenty20 not so long ago provided a reminder that no cricket nation lives in hope so eternally as Bangladesh. The expectations are so very real – and the inevitable disappointment is so utterly crushing. Many would give up. But captain Mushfiqur Rahim is made of sterner stuff, subjecting his troops to classes from a ‘life success coach’ and calling for more eloquent ‘body language’. And what have his team learned? ‘We have learned that in ODIs, you have to play good cricket for 100 overs. You can't win by just playing well for two hours.’ There should be no stopping them now. Cricketers, heal thyselves . Do the players know the laws? Sri Lanka’s captain Angelo Mathews felt Rangana Herath didn’t realise he was not out after the ball cannoned off a glove unattached to the bat handle and was caught down the leg side by Matt Prior in the final over of last night’s thriller at Lord’s. This is amazing on two counts. One, it’s hardly one of cricket’s more obscure laws. Two, it suggests he doesn’t own the DVD of the 2005 Ashes, in which Michael Kasprowicz is given out by Billy Bowden at the end of the Edgbaston nail-biter in the same circumstances. A couple of winters ago, Jonny Bairstow trudged off in a Test in Mumbai after he was caught by Gautam Gambhir at silly point. But the ball had nestled in Gambhir’s grasp only after ricocheting off the helmet – not out, in other words. Yet neither men knew the law. Is it time Test cricketers were given a crash course?

"By . Claire Bates . A young mother-to-be who developed agonising blisters all over her body was shocked to discover she had a rare allergy to her own baby. Zuleika Closs, 26, developed a burning, itchy rash all over her body when she was 20 weeks pregnant with her son Emmanuel. The mother, from Falmouth, Cornwall, said: 'At first, it felt like something was crawling on my skin but then it became unbearable. The blisters looked like nettle rash at first but spread really fast and became dark and red. 'My feet were the worst. I scratched so hard that large chunks of skin kept falling off. It was peeling off like orange peel.' On the mend: Zuleika Cross with son Emmanuel.  She said the red blisters were unbearably itchy during her pregnancy (right) Doctors thought that Ms Closs was suffering from scabies and told her to boil all her clothes . After antibiotics and calamine lotion didn't help to ease the itch, doctors wrongly diagnosed her with a severe case of scabies and gave her insecticide to use. She was also told to boil wash all her clothes and put her shoes in the freezer, but to no avail. 'I was so itchy, I was scratching myself in my sleep. I was exhausted and couldn't cope. 'I remember standing in the doctors waiting room in floods of tears wishing someone would help me. I felt like I was banging my head against a brick wall because nothing was working. 'I think they thought I was a hormonal pregnant woman but it really was that bad.' Her partner Nathan Darbyshire, 23, a . care worker, lost shifts at work because he didn't want to pass the . scabies on to colleagues and patients. At 38 weeks, Ms Closs went into labour . but says she was scared to hold her baby because she thought she might . pass the rash onto him. She said: 'Skin to skin contact is really important with newborns but I didn't want him to catch it. I blamed myself and thought it was something I'd done.' After Emmanuel was born, the rash died down but then days later it flared up again. Zuleika said: 'I sometimes have flash backs to the pregnancy but I only have to look at Emmanuel (pictured at two-days-old) to know all the pain is worth it' Happy family: Zuleika with partner Nathan Darbyshire and son Emmanuel. Nathan turned down work during her pregnancy through fear he could catch and pass on on scabies after Zuleika was wrongly diagnosed . Ms Closs's blister marks are now fading (right) but she will still be scarred for life. She wants to find a wedding dress that will cover her reaction . This time, she saw a locum doctor who . said he believed an auto-immune pregnancy disorder was to blame and put . her on a strong dose of anti-histamines. She said: 'I couldn't believe what he was telling. I was allergic to my pregnancy. It just sounded bizarre. Zuleika said she was considering having more children as she would like to have a sibling for Emmanuel . 'It was a relief because sometimes I felt the doctors thought I must be doing something to my skin.' Four months on, the rash is now fading but she will be scarred for life. Ms Closs is thought to have Pemphigoid gestationis, which is caused by placenta tissue entering the mother's blood stream and reacting with her immune system. The condition is in remission but she has been left with dark scars because of the extensive blistering. Pemphigoid gestationis is believed to affect one in two million pregnancies worldwide and is likely to be more severe in future pregnancies. Zuleika said: 'We're getting married in May but I'll have to find a dress that will cover my scars.Thinking about having another baby in the future terrifies me. 'My body is already in a mess but I'd love Emmanuel to have brothers and sisters to grow up with. 'I sometimes have flash backs to the pregnancy but I only have to look at Emmanuel to know all the pain is worth it. 'I also couldn't have done it without Nathan and my mum. They were fantastic.' According to Nina Goad, of the British Association . of Dermatologists: . 'Pemphigoid gestationis is a rare disorder . that occurs in pregnant women after 13 weeks gestation. It appears with an itchy rash that . develops into blisters. This means that the mother's immune system . starts reacting against her own skin causing it to split and form . blisters. We think that some of the placenta . tissue enters the mother's blood stream and causes her immune system to . become activated and cross react with her skin, causing the blisters. Female hormones, particularly oestrogen, are thought to aggravate the . reaction. This may be why it often occurs during pregnancy, when oestrogen levels rise. It usually recurs in subsequent pregnancies. Unfortunately PG can't be cured, but it can be suppressed with treatment. Symptoms often improve towards the end of pregnancy but 80% of women . will experience a flare of the rash around the time of delivery. In most cases symptoms resolve days or weeks after giving birth, but in . some women the disease can remain active for months or years and may . require continued treatment.'","Zuleika developed a burning, itchy rash when she was 20 weeks pregnant .

"By . Brendan Carlin . European human rights judges have been accused of ‘alerting’ radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada to the fact he still had time to lodge a last-ditch appeal against deportation. Furious Home Office sources last night claimed that it was the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) itself that privately told Jordanian-born Qatada that there was still the possibility of an appeal . But they say there was no similar attempt by the Strasbourg-based court to warn Home Secretary Theresa May of the impending deadline. Tip-off: Was Abu Qatada (right) told about his right to appeal? Senior sources in Mrs May’s department told The Mail on Sunday that the ECHR had reminded Qatada last Monday that he still had the option to appeal. One said: ‘They took it upon themselves to go to Qatada’s legal team and say, “You haven’t appealed yet. Are you likely to appeal?” ’ Last night, the ECHR, headed by British judge Sir Nicolas Bratza, declined to comment on the claim. But Tory MPs denounced the court for ‘an outrageous and partisan’ interference with the UK’s internal affairs and called on the Government to demand  a ‘detailed explanation’ of the court’s actions. Home Secretary Theresa May was trying to look on the bright side yesterday as she stepped out in a vivid checked jacked. She . wore the Vivienne Westwood creation – a favourite item she has been . seen in before – as she ended a bad week with a day at the races . alongside the Queen. They . were marking the start of the flat racing season at Newbury Racecourse, . which was hosting a free meeting for NHS staff and emergency services . workers. The . under-pressure Minister complemented her vivid ensemble with  a red . fake crocodile-skin handbag and brown patent leather shoes. Mrs . May is known for her bold fashion taste, including leopard-print kitten . heels and a pale blue jacket likened to a Thunderbirds uniform. Qatada’s late-night appeal last Tuesday – . just hours after he was arrested and detained as part of plans to . deport him to Jordan – stunned Mrs May, who thought the deadline had . fallen at midnight on Monday. The Home Secretary, who still insists her interpretation was correct, was branded incompetent by critics and ridiculed for ‘not knowing what day it is’. The source added: ‘It’s extraordinary that they decided to alert his team that the appeal deadline was coming up. But they did not bother to remind us.’ Mrs May last night declined to comment on the claims. To add further embarrassment, it emerged today that efforts to remove Qatada from the UK could take up to 18 months as the government faces becoming snarled up in complex legal arguments. The cleric's fate currently rests with a five-strong panel of senior judges who will decide within the next three months whether to pass his case to the ECHR's highest body, the 'Grand Chamber'. If this happens, legal experts warn it could take 12-18 months before a decision on his status is made. Qatada's lawyers are believed to be planning a two-pronged bid to keep him in the country. First, they would look to revoke the deportation order while preparing an appeal through the immigration courts if this failed. If Mrs May intervened, it is understood they would then seek a judicial review of her actions. Proceedings will be further complicated by their attempts to contest four aspects of his deportation. In the meantime, his lawyers will attempt to have him released from a high-security unit in Belmarsh prison. Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary of probation union Napo, told The Observer: 'There are four major problems that need addressing by the Home Office before any deportation can be made. 'This will see the process take many months to resolve if not longer.' But Justice Secretary Ken Clarke has brushed off the delay as 'no big deal'. 'The key thing is when do we get the decision which we want,' he said. Fiasco: Home Secretary Theresa May explains to MPs in the Commons the latest delay in the decade-long effort to deport Qatada earlier this week . Tory MPs, who have already demanded the UK pulls out of the ECHR regime, said the court’s behaviour in tipping off Qatada was ‘the final straw’. Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the party’s powerful backbench 1922 committee, said: ‘If it is the case that the ECHR alerted Qatada he could still appeal, it is disgraceful. ‘It would amount to a partisan interference suggesting that the ECHR’s sympathies lie with Abu Qatada – not with the  British people. It really does demonstrate what a morally bankrupt outfit this court is.’ False: Abu Qatada's lawyer, Gareth Peirce, insists there was no 'tip-off' Fellow Tory Rob Wilson said: ‘It . would be extraordinary if human rights judges in Strasbourg had tipped . off Qatada’s legal team. ‘It should never be the . business of a court to prompt one side of a legal dispute. It brings . into question the court’s neutrality and independence. ‘It could severely compromise the ECHR and its future determinations both in this case  and others. ‘The . Government must immediately seek a detailed explanation of what has . happened, what and when interactions with Qatada or his team took place, . and reassurance that the court has not behaved improperly.’ A spokeswoman for the ECHR yesterday said she was unable to comment on any ‘alleged contacts’ between the court and Qatada’s team. Qatada’s lawyer Gareth Peirce last night denied they had been tipped off by the ECHR. An Islamist terror group has threatened a wave of attacks in Britain if Qatada is deported to Jordan, where he was convicted in his absence of involvement in terrorist attacks in 1998. The cleric’s fate now rests with a five-strong panel of judges in Strasbourg who will decide whether to pass his case to the court’s ‘Grand Chamber’, the ECHR’s highest body. If they accept his appeal, there are fears it would undermine the prospects of sending 14 other terrorists home. Tim Farron, the Liberal  Democrat party president, last week said he was ‘absolutely certain’ Qatada should be put ‘on a plane as soon as possible’. But the MP added: ‘I take the view there’s been an Olympic-standard screw-up here, whether it’s with the European Court, or with Theresa May.’","Home Office livid it was not given same warning .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . It is obviously the week for Britain's colourful politicians to come clean about their ambitions. First Boris Johnson revealed he will stand for election as an MP next year, after years of prevarication. Now it seems UKIP leader Nigel Farage is about to take the plunge and name the Kent seat of Thanet South as his target to get a foothold in the Commons. UKIP leader Nigel Farage is the frontrunner to be the party's candidate in Thanet South, it emerged today . The UKIP association in the seat could confirm Mr Farage as its candidate as early as this weekend, the Financial Times reported. He is said to be on a shortlist of two or three candidates to be chosen by local activists. Last month an opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft named Thanet South as one of just two seats where UKIP is already in the lead. It put UKIP on 33 per cent, ahead of Labour and the Tories tied on 29 per cent and the Lib Dems trailled 4 per cent. Rozanne Duncan, the local party secretary, told the FT: 'It is the worst-kept secret in town. 'We now have two names on the list and one of them is Mr Farage. Whether he will get selected or not is another matter... although I'd be surprised if he doesn't.' The seat is considered vulnerable after sitting Tory MP Laura Sandys announced she would stand down in 2015, after being an MP for only five years. A UKIP spokesman said: 'The branch are starting to receive nominations from people interested in standing, but there's no shortlist of candidates yet. 'Even when there is a shortlist of candidates finalised for hustings, that list will be kept confidential. We are still a long way off announcing a candidate for Thanet South.' Mr Farage stood in the in 2005 but came a distance fourth. Since then he has seen a surge in support for his party, culminating in coming first in the European Parliament elections in May. Mr Farage hopes to build on the electoral success of the party in the last two years, including winning the Europe Parliament elections in May . Last month an opinion poll by Lord Ashcroft showed Thanet South top be one of just two seats where UKIP was already ahead . Mr Farage tried unsuccessfully to become an MP in 2010, standing against Commons Speaker John Bercow in Buckingham. But he was defeated, after suffering serious injuries when a light aircraft he was flying in crashed on polling day. Since then there have been several by-elections in which UKIP has been tipped to perform well, but Mr Farage ducked the chance to stand in. After dodging Eastleigh and Rotherham, he had been expected to the throw his hat into the ring for Newark. After mulling the idea for some time, Mr Farage was accused of 'bottling it' after deciding not to stand himself. The news that Mr Farage has selected a seat comes after London Mayor Mr Johnson ended years of speculation and finally confirmed he will also make a bid for Parliament in 2015. Boris Johnson finally confirmed this week that he would also be standing for election in 2015, and is hunting for a seat . Speaking at Bloomberg in London on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said: 'I have danced around it for an awfully long time. The Prime Minster said ages ago that he would welcome me back. 'It is also been pretty clear I cannot endlessly go on dodging these questions as I have tried to do. 'Let me put it this way. I haven't got any seat lined up yet. But I do think that in all probability, since you cannot do these things furtively, in all probability I will try to find somewhere to stand in 2015.' He is yet to find a seat, but is widely expected to opt for Uxbridge where the Tories have a majority of 11,216 and sitting MP Sir John Randall is standing down.","UKIP leader is said to be on the candidates list for key target seat in Kent .

"By . James  Nye . and Associated Press . The home of New Hampshire Declaration of Independence signer Josiah Bartlett is up for sale after being in the family for seven generations. The 18-acre property in Kingston offers a white 4,600-square-foot, four-bedroom farmhouse that was built in 1774 and has been updated through the years, plus open pasture and woods. The front yard has a linden tree Bartlett brought back from Philadelphia as a sapling after signing the Declaration of Independence in order after John Hancock. Sale: Ruth Albert, the great-great-great-great-granddaughter of Josiah Bartlett, the  former New Hampshire governor, and signer of  the Declaration of Independence poses in her home on Wednesday July 16, 2014 by the desk and under the portrait of Bartlett in Kingston, New Hampshire . 'It's thriving on its own very nicely,' said Ruth Albert, the current homeowner and Bartlett's great-great-great-great-granddaughter. The home's asking price is $849,900. It's the first time the home, added to the National Registry of Historic Places in 1972, is for sale. No other family members are available to purchase the property. 'It's very bittersweet,' said Albert, 63. 'I'm hoping that someone who loves history will like the house.' She had hoped that a historic preservation society might take it over and turn it into a museum, but after meeting with representatives from various historical groups in the state, she realizes the funding for such a project is scarce. Signatory: An historic marker is seen in front of the home once owned by Josiah Bartlett, Wednesday, July 16, 2014 in Kingston, New Hampshire . Relic: A linden tree planted as a sapling by Josiah Bartlett after signing the Declaration of Independence is seen on the front lawn of his home Wednesday July 16, 2014 in Kingston, New Hampshire . Historic figure: The home of New Hampshire Declaration of Independence signer Josiah Bartlett is up for sale after being in the family for seven generations . Little has changed in the house since the 1850s, when renovations were done to the kitchen. More recently, the couple added an upstairs bathroom. Albert, who recently retired from her job with the U.S. Postal Service in Kingston, grew up in the house and has had fun through the years picturing her ancestors there. She has lived in the home since the 1950s, but with no one able to take care of it she has had to make the decision to sell. 'I feel like it's my responsibility to make sure it goes forward with the best stewardship possible, and I feel like I have a little bit of say in the matter,' Albert said to WMUR.

Basic: A commode and hand pumped bath tub are seen on the second floor of the Josiah Bartlett home, Wednesday, July 16, 2014, in Kingston, New Hampshire . She remembers her grandmother telling her she was lucky to have electricity as she did her homework; in her grandmother's day, it was candlelight and lanterns. Albert and her husband, Dale, are planning to move to Florida, his home state, and live in a much smaller house. Bartlett, a doctor and later governor of New Hampshire, moved from Amesbury, Massachusetts, to Kingston in 1750 to set up practice. He married his cousin Mary Bartlett and they had 12 children. Inspiration: Aaron Sorkin - who created the West Wing used Bartlett's name for his own character played by Martin Sheen . A plaque in front of the home describes Bartlett as a doctor, a statesman, a governor of New Hampshire and founder of the state's medical society. One of his sons, Dr. Levi Bartlett, lived in the house, and it has stayed in the family ever since. Josiah Bartlett's medical instruments are displayed in the parlor. His name might be recalled by fans of the TV series 'The West Wing': Martin Sheen played President Josiah Bartlet from New Hampshire.","The home has been in the Bartlett family for seven generations and never been on the market .

"By . James  Nye . CNN's International correspondent Diana Magnay has been removed from covering the Israeli-Palestinian conflict after she branded a group of Israelis 'scum' on Thursday. Magnay had taken to Twitter to express her fury after a group of whooping Israelis watching missile strikes 'threatened to destroy' her team's car if the British reporter used negative language. Almost as soon as she posted the controversial comment, she deleted it - but not before it was retweeted more than 200 times. CNN said it has now assigned her to Moscow. Scroll Down for Video . Sent to Russia: Diana Magnay, who works for CNN, has been removed from Israel-Gaza after she branded a group of threatening Israeli's as 'scum' in a Twitter rant. CNN says she has been sent to Moscow . Deleted: This tweet from Magnay was quickly deleted from her account - clearly expressing her outrage at the reaction of Israeli bystanders watching the attack on Gaza . A CNN spokeswoman said in a statement to . The Huffington Post that Magnay had reacted on Twitter after being threatened and harassed by the group before filming. 'She . deeply regrets the language used, which was aimed directly at those who . had been targeting our crew,' the statement said. 'She certainly meant no offense to anyone . beyond that group, and she and CNN apologize for any offense that may . have been taken.' Earlier, during her live report, the braying Israelis on the hill could be heard as Magnay described the scene from the border overlooking Gaza. The incident came after Hamas vowed that Israel will 'pay a high price' for their 'foolish' actions after their military began a ground invasion of Gaza on Thursday evening. Thousands of troops from the Israel Defense Force backed by tanks launched amphibious, air and ground incursions into the narrow Gaza strip after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ordered the military action in a bid to stop rockets being fired from Gaza. The assault, which began at 10pm local time, followed a heavy barrage of rockets fired at Tel Aviv by Hamas militants from Gaza who have promised 'dreadful consequences' for Israel in the aftermath of the invasion. Heavy attack: An Israeli rocket is fired into the northern Gaza Strip on July 17, 2014 as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday instructed the military to begin a ground offensive in Gaza .

'The prime minister and defense minister have instructed the IDF to begin a ground operation tonight in order to hit the terror tunnels from Gaza into Israel,' the official statement said as military officials announced that  an additional 18,000 reservists have been called up to bolster the 48,000 already summoned. The operation will include 'infantry, armored corps, engineer corps, artillery and intelligence combined with aerial and naval support', a statement from the Israeli military added. The army said the aim of the operation is to protect Israeli lives and crush Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip. The objective was 'to establish a reality in which Israeli residents can live in safety and security without continued indiscriminate terror, while striking a significant blow to Hamas's terror infrastructure'.","Diana Magnay became infuriated by the attitude of Israelis watching invasion of Gaza and tweeted that the crowd had threatened her .

"By . James  Nye . Questioned: Ryan Block was confused by the unyielding attitude of a Comcast employee who refused to let him cancel his service with the cable giant unless he gave him a good reason . It seems that one Comcast rep has decided on a brilliant new way to retain customers - never let them leave. That would most likely be confirmed by Ryan Block, the co-founder of tech site Engadget, who found himself enduring a torturous 18 minute interrogation of a phone call with a barking Comcast employee who demanded to know why he wanted to choose another cable provider. Astounded by the rep who simply and rudely would not take no for an answer, Block shared eight minutes of the infuriating conversation online for all to hear - which prompted an 'embarrassed' Comcast to issue a full and unreserved apology. All Block wanted to do was cancel, but the as-yet unidentified Comcast rep flat-out refused to go-ahead with the AOL Product manager's disconnection unless he got a reason - which Block was not obliged to give. 'Why is it that you don't want the faster speed? Help me understand why you don't want faster Internet?' demands the Comcast rep in one portion of the call after Block asks to cancel his service. Even though technically it is a sales rep's job to stop a customer leaving, bluntly questioning them when they clearly want to is not wise. Scroll Down for Audio . Normal procedure? Ryan Block took to Twitter on Monday to ask whether he should post the partial recording of the 18 minute phone call he and his wife had with the Comcast employee . Here he goes: Block decided that he was going to shame the Comcast employee but was careful to leave out any means of identification via his name or ID . 'My job is to have a conversation with you about keeping your service,' the Comcast employee can be heard to say on the eight-minute recording which Block first uploaded to SoundCloud on Monday. Despite Block being adamant that he wanted to cancel, the employee told him that he had to be given a good reason or he wouldn't do it. This 'rude, unhelpful and condescending' behavior was 'straight up belligerent' according to a stunned Block. Indeed, only eight minutes were recorded because Block's wife was on the phone to the rep for the first ten, during which he acted in the same way to her. 'I started the call by (very nicely) saying that we were moving, and that we needed to cancel our service,' Block's wife, Veronica Belmont, wrote in the description of the recording on SoundCloud.com. 'He asked if we wanted to move our current service. I said no, thank you, but we’ve already signed up for Astound.' Overwhelmed: Ryan Block was quickly told by the online community that he was not overreacting to the attitude of the Comcast rep . Sympathy: Ryan Block acknowledged that as a member of the tech community he understood that it was sometimes hard to get the right tone over the phone . 'The representative continued aggressively repeating his questions, despite the answers given, to the point where my wife became so visibly upset she handed me the phone,' Block wrote in the audio description. 'Overhearing the conversation, I knew this would not be very fun.' 'What I did not know is how oppressive this conversation would be. Within just a few minutes the representative had gotten so condescending and unhelpful I felt compelled to record the speakerphone conversation on my other phone. 'This recording picks up roughly 10 minutes into the call, whereby she and I have already played along and given a myriad of reasons and explanations as to why we are canceling (which is why I simply stopped answering the rep’s repeated question — it was clear the only sufficient answer was ‘Okay, please don’t disconnect our service after all.’).' Response: Comcast replied to Ryan on Tuesday that they were mortified and embarrassed by the conduct of their staff member . Exasperated, Block's conversation goes from frustrating to weird, to surreal. 'Why is it you don't want faster speed? Help me understand why you don't want faster internet?' the rep asks. 'Help me understand why you can't just disconnect us?' Block answers. Block then tries to tell the rep repeatedly that he has no intention of giving him a reason and does not owe Comcast any explanation. To that, the rep tries a different tact and claims that he only wants to help. 'The way you can help me is by disconnecting our service,' Block said. 'But how is that helping you though?' the rep  replies. 'That's what I want,' Block replies. 'OK, why is that what you want?' the employee counters with. Block tries one more time, demanding to know one thing: 'Are you capable by phone of disconnecting our service?' 'It's something we can do. I mean, very rarely do we do it,' the rep says. Cable and Internet giant Comcast is apologizing after a tech-savvy California customer posted eight minutes of telephone conversation online in which he tried repeatedly to get a customer service representative to disconnect his service . Bigger man: Ryan Block accepted their apology and told them not to fire the person responsible . After the rep started quizzing Block about his new provider like a jealous partner, Block suddenly thinks something might not be right. 'Am I being punked?' askes Block - meaing is the whole thing a joke? After six minutes of conversation the rep relents and claims he will disconnect the service, but not before the damage had been done. Comcast's senior vice president of customer experience, Tom Karinshak, issued a statement on Tuesday to apologize after the company was 'embarrassed by the way our employee' spoke to Block. 'The way in which our representative communicated with him is unacceptable and not consistent with how we train our customer service representatives. We are investigating this situation and will take quick action,' the statement said. 'While the overwhelming majority of our employees work very hard to do the right thing every day, we are using this very unfortunate experience to reinforce how important it is to always treat our customers with the utmost respect.'","Ryan Block, founder of tech site Engadget and AOL product manager endured nightmare phone call .

Poulter took to Twitter to complain, writing: 'Booked 6 business seats for my wife & nanny to fly home and British Airways downgrade my nanny so katie has no help for 10 hours with 4 kids.' He then added: 'Amazing how British Airways have downgraded a full fare ticket when you buy 6 seats together in 1 booking. Just doesn't seem right.'

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . An employee at a Massachusetts Taco Bell reportedly shot at a customer with a BB gun who was enraged when no one came to the drive-thru window to take his order. The incident took place early Sunday morning, Springfield police Sgt. John Delaney said in a release. A 26-year-old man 'told the officers that he went to the drive-thru to get some taco’s and waited at the window to give his order for a very long time,' Delaney said. 'This male victim stated that he banged on the window and yelled but nobody would help him.' Arrested: Taco Bell employee Steven Noska allegedly shot at an angry customer with a BB gun .

"By . Snejana Farberov . 'Broken man': Gus Yiambilis, 30, has been charged with killing his mother with carbon monox0de in April - but his lawyer insist the two had made a suicide pact because they could not deal with their financial and medical problems . A 30-year-old Pennsylvania man has been charged with murder in the carbon monoxide death of his mother back in April - but his attorney insists that the mother and son had made a suicide pact. Koustantinos 'Gus' Yiambilis, of Bensalem, and his mother, 59-year-old Karen Yiambilis, left several suicide notes before the son allegedly powered on an electric generator inside their apartment, filling the rooms with noxious fumes that quickly overcame the two. When police were called to the home by concerned neighbors, they discovered Mrs Yiambilis unconscious on the floor and her son confused and listless, but awake. The 59-year-old married mother of two later died, but Gus Yiambilis survived and was charged with murder and aiding a suicide. During a hearing scheduled for later today, Yiambilis ' attorney will try to convince a judge to drop the murder charge against the 30-year-old suspect. ‘I can't state emphatically enough that this was not murder,’ William Goldman told Philadelphia inquirer. ‘His mom left notes to donate her hair to Locks of Love. She said she was taking Gus home to God.’ Scroll down for video . Wife and mother: Karen Yiambilis, 59, pictured with her son on Mother's Day a few years ago, passed away from exposure to noxious fumes produced by a portable generator . Final farewell: The mother and son left behind seven suicide notes, one of which (pictured) stated that they could no longer deal with the negativity in this world and wanted to go 'home to God' According to the lawyer, the mother and son had lost the will to live because they were both unemployed, burdened with debt, on the verge of eviction and suffering from medical problems. Yiambilis was fired from his job at a bank just days earlier and was in needed of a brain surgery he could not afford, NBC 10 reported at the time. His mother, an out-of-work artist and designer, was suffering from a painful condition called fibromyalgia. ‘She was tired of being cold and hungry, and Gus felt like a total failure. He was a broken man,’ Goldman said. ‘They turned to each other.’ On the evening of April 7, Mrs Yiambilis left a heart-breaking note blaming 'the negativity in this world' for her and Gus' decision to end their lives. ‘We are sorry but we wish to not deal with it anymore. We are going home to God,’ she stated. Death trap: Gus Yiambilis turned on a gasoline-powered portable generator inside their apartment in the 3000 block of Bristol road in Bensalem (pictured), which quickly filled with fumes . Out of options: Mrs Yiambilis, pictured with her daughter, was unemployed and suffering from chronic pain when she allegedly made a suicide pact with her ailing and out-of-wok son . At around 8pm that night, police say the 30-year-old Mr Yiambilis turned on a gasoline-powered portable generator inside their apartment in the 3000 block of Bristol road in Bensalem, where cracks and vents had been sealed with duct tape to prevent carbon monoxide fumes from escaping. According to her obituary, Mrs Yiambilis had a husband, George, but it appears that the couple had been living apart. Their daughter, Eleni, works in Philadelphia. When interviewed by police later, Gus Yiambilis admitted that he was the one who switched on the generator. Speaking from his hospital bed with detectives, the 30-year-old also allegedly stated: 'I can't believe I killed my mother. She's the only thing i got.' Buck County prosecutor Alan Garabedian wrote in a recent court filing that they had enough evidence to charge Yiambiis with murder - and in May a judge ruled that the case against the son was strong enough to go to trial.","Gus Yiambilis, 30, charged with murder and aiding suicide in the April death of his mother, 59-yer-old Karen Yiambilis .

"By . Associated Press . and Zoe Szathmary . A transgender girl who allegedly assaulted two people on Saturday night at a psychiatric center was transferred to a juvenile home for boys. The 16-year-old girl, known only as Jane Doe, assaulted another youth and a staff member at Children's Psychiatric Center in Middletown, Connecticut, the Department of Children and Families said Sunday. The girl also destroyed property, the agency said. Officials said there is no 'suitable place' at the psychiatric facility 'that can ensure the safety of youths and staff.' She is now in a single room at the Juvenile Training School - the only secure facility for delinquent boys - which is also located in Middletown. Assault: The Department of Children and Families says a transgender girl assaulted a youth and a worker at Children's Psychiatric Center, pictured . Gary Kleeblatt, a spokesman for the agency, said the unit at the psychiatric center where the girl had been held is the only secure, all-female facility run by the agency. He said he could not release details of the alleged assault. The DCF statement said state police had been notified. 'We are confident they will take whatever action they deem is appropriate,' the agency said. Her lawyer, Aaron Romano, criticized the agency and Commissioner Joette Katz for issuing a news release rather than notifying him or other lawyers representing the girl. 'I am shocked and disappointed at the commissioner,' he said. 'I question whether the commissioner should continue to be in her position if she believes in this litigation in the press.' Transfer: The girl was moved to Juvenile Training School, a facility for boys . Romano accused DCF of breaking promises to get therapy for his client and seek foster care. 'Nothing has materialized,' he said. Romano earlier said the girl had been physically and sexually abused throughout her life. The girl had been detained in the Connecticut adult women's prison without criminal charges and was moved last month to the psychiatric center. The Hartford Courant reports the girl earlier assaulted two workers at other facilities - one in Connecticut and one in Massachusetts - and that assault charges were filed in the former. She had been in DCF custody before being sent to jail. DCF officials said she was too violent for them to handle and asked a state judge to transfer her into Department of Correction custody as authorized by a seldom-used state law. The judge approved the request in April.","The 16-year-old girl, known only as Jane Doe, assaulted another youth and a staff member at Children's Psychiatric Center in Connecticut, the Department of Children and Families said .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . An elderly Florida woman tried to smuggle to the Philippines thousands of dollars by hiding the cash in her undergarments and secret pockets sewn into her purse. Federal officials say that Victoria Faren, 78, hid $21,000 of the money just in her girdle when she was trying to board a Delta flight out of Detroit Metropolitan Airport in April, court records filed on Friday show. Along with her daughter, Cherryn Faren, 48, she tried to take nearly $41,000 in currency. Federal law requires travelers to declare cash amounts worth more than $10,000. US Customs and Border Protection officers first became suspicious of the elderly traveler when she told them she was carrying $200 — despite filling out a written declaration form indicating she had $1,200. Caught: Federal investigators say that a 78-year-old woman stashed some $21,000 inside her undergarments, plus another 20 grand in her purse (stock photo) Suspicious, the officer searched the elderly woman's handbag and found $12,977 in a series of wallets and improvised cloth pockets sewed the purse, court records show. Once again, the officer asked if that was all the cash she had. 'No, this is all the money,' Faren said, according to court records. Officers kept searching and found another $3,000 inside her blouse and $2,000 that had been sewn into the strap of her bra. She once again told officers that was all the money. But a pat-down search revealed a bulge near her buttocks, and officers found another $5,000 in the back of the woman's girdle. Faren broke into tears and eventually confessed to carrying as much as $21,000 in her girdle alone. She told Customs officers that the money came from selling her home for $120,000. Although she knew it was illegal to carry unreported cash, Faren said she didn't wire the money to the Philippines because she thought it would be safer to carry it, court records show. Federal prosecutors have filed paperwork in Michigan to keep the $40,977.","Victoria Faren, 78, was searched at the Detroit Metropolitan Airport after giving conflicting accounts of how much cash she was carrying .

The reasons for his sartorial choice . remained unclear. Obama's Secret Service agents seemed to keep a close . eye on him as he shook hands with the man. Obama also apparently laughed off an offer of marijuana during the visit. A video uploaded to Instagram by user manton89 shows Obama smiling as a man appears to say 'You want a hit, man?' In an apparently reply, Obama just tilts his head back and laughs. Laughing it off: Obama smiled and laughed as a crowd member reportedly asked if he wanted a hit of marijuana . Recreational marijuana became legally available for purchase in Colorado in January. Tuesday night's escapades were part of Obama's continuing quest to break free from the constraints of the White House - and they brought him to a crowded pizza restaurant and a pool bar. Shortly after arriving in Denver, Obama headed to the Wazee Supper Club for dinner with local residents who had recently written him letters. It was a carefully orchestrated event aimed at projecting an image of the president connecting with real Americans. But after his meal, Obama decided to break from the script : he took off by foot down 15th Street, a cadre of anxious Secret Service agents by his side, and started shaking hands with the dozens of people who had gathered on the sidewalks.

In recent weeks, he's been hitting restaurants in Washington and vowing to spend more time with the public outside of the nation's capital. After his 10-minute stroll, Obama hopped back into his armored limousine for a short drive to his next destination, Wynkoop Brewing Co., which was founded by Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper. As Obama walked inside and said 'How's it going guys?' someone inside said 'Get that man a beer!' according to ABC News. Inside the pub, Obama was also photographed posing for pictures with a giant gorilla statue. On a more serious note, Obama was seen inside the pub presenting a challenge coin to Kalynne May Arrick. Her older brother Sgt. Kenneth May died while serving as a Marine in Afghanistan. The governor — a Democrat facing re-election this fall — was waiting for Obama inside. They headed to the bar where they ordered two Rail Yard Ales, then headed upstairs for a game of pool. Obama enjoyed his beverage, and said 'That's some tasty beer,' according to ABC News. As Vanilla Ice's classic song 'Ice Ice Baby' played in the background, Obama sank the eight-ball to claim victory over Hickenlooper.

"Ryan Seacrest has been a fixture on the red carpet and on the small screen for years but now he's landed hosting deals on all four major networks and is successfully expanding his ever-growing lifestyle brand. The American Idol host turned 'every show' host signed a deal with CBS on Tuesday to host a show called Fashion Rocks. Seacrest already has deals to host New Year’s Rockin' Eve with ABC, American Idol with FOX, and has a long running deal with NBC. American Idol host Ryan Seacrest (pictured here hosting American Idol in May) signed a deal with CBS on Tuesday marking an affiliation with all four major networks . CNN reports that CBS was one of the only English speaking networks left Seacrest didn't have a deal with yet. The Hollywood Reporter states that NBC also extended Seacrest's deal with them for one more year. 'This new deal will include hosting and producing 2015 Live from the Red Carpet events for E! contributing to E! News, as well as hosting and producing specials for E! and NBC,' said a network spokeswoman. The Hollywood Reporter said that rumours circulated claiming Ryan would stop hosting shows on the red carpet but such is not the case. Ryan reportedly felt as though he'd outgrown hosting the red carpet shows and that he wanted to move on to other ventures. 'I felt like I had been there for a long time, and I wanted to think about whether or not it fit into the full scope of what my focus was going to be in the years to come,' he told The Hollywood Reporter. How's my hair?: Ryan signed a deal to host the CBS show Fashion Rocks and along with the title as host, Seacrest will have his own fashion line at Macy's . What are missing from Ryan's new deal are offers to host NBC News' Today show or to host a show on NBC Sports. Seacrest has expressed interest in both the news and sports divisions and said that he's been conversing with NBC sports about possibly covering the Olympics in Rio in 2016. The Today Show is a less likely position for Ryan as he has a morning radio schedule that keeps him in LA while the NBC show broadcasts out of New York. One of the reasons Seacrest decided to continue his red carpet reporting is because of his long standing friendship with NBCU executives Steve Burke and Bonnie Hammer. 'They've been very good to me,' Seacrest told The Hollywood Reporter. The deal to host Fashion Rocks on CBS was born out of a similar friendship with CBS' music and specials chief Jack Sussman, Richard Beckman of Three Lions Entertainment, and producer Don Mischer. Ryan Seacrest has spoken highly of the chemistry he has with his fellow American Idol hosts Billy Ray Cyrus (left), Jennifer Lopez (second left), and Harry Connick Jr (far right) Not only will Seacrest get hosting credits from his new wardrobe driven show, Macy's Department Store will sell a collection in Seacrest's name which will add more to his lifestyle brand. 'I'm certainly not a designer, but I do enjoy the process of picking out a great suit and putting a tie with it, and then adding cufflinks and the tie clip,' he told the Hollywood Reporter. 'This is a chance to curate some cool, classic styles that start with suits and accessories but could eventually grow into other lifestyle opportunities, he added. Seacrest is reportedly planning a live radio broadcast from Herald Square in Manhattan just before Fashion Week to promote his Macy's lifestyle line as well. Not only is Seacrest hosting on all the big networks, he's investing in companies like the YouTube event  group  called DigiTour, the marketing company Civic Entertainment Group, along with start-ups like Pinterest, Flightcar, and TYPO. Despite moving forward on all fronts Seacrest still loves hosting the music competition American Idol and says that those types of competitions are 'part of his DNA.' He's commended the strong relationship and chemistry he has with his fellow Idol hosts Billy ray Cyrus, Jennifer Lopez, and Harry Connick Jr. Seacrest is also still committed to his $25 million radio deal with Clear Channel. Seacrest has called his routine morning radio deal, 'the engine that drives everything else.'","Ryan Seacrest signed a deal with CBS on Tuesday to host a show called Fashion Rocks .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A lawyer from Oakland California faces legal issues of her own after being found guilty of failing to properly care for her 93 cats and her two dogs. Jan Van Dusen, 62, was found guilty on Thursday of letting her cats suffer from starvation, diarrhea, parasite infections and other diseases. Some of her many cats, a bunch of whom were once stray, had to be euthanized. Jan Van Dusen, 62, was found guilty on Thursday by of letting her 93 cats (not pictured) suffer from starvation, diarrhea, parasite infections and other diseases . Van Dusen will be sentenced on July 25 an could face up to three years in prison. SF Gate reports that Van Dusen's attorney Frank Often doesn’t believe his client should serve jail time. 'It's my belief that she should get probation,' said Offen. Van Dusen's felony conviction means she could serve time behind bars and that she could be suspended or disbarred from her job as a lawyer. When Oakland Animal Control officers went to Van Dusen's home in October 2011 they found 93 cats and two dogs in less than suitable conditions. 16 of the felines had to be put down because they suffered from incurable diseases and 77 other cats were treated by veterinarians at a shelter and were later put up for adoption. Animal Control euthanized 16 of the cats (not pictured) because they were ill and they put the 77 other cats up for adoption . 'Things were mostly under control,' she told SF Gate in 2012. 'They killed some of my favorites, which they had no right to do.' Van Dusen has said in the past that she is a great animal caretaker and that all her cats had been neutered and spayed. Van Dusen was known to take in stray and wild cats and later find homes for them. She socialized in cat enthusiast circles and was a popular member of several. She started collecting cats in the mid-1990s and worked with several animal non-profit groups. Back in 2011 Van Dusen actually found some success in the court room when she won a precedent setting case against the Internal Revenue Service, reported SF Gate. Van Dusen claimed that her cat rescue dollars were a donation to an IRS approved charity and that they should be deductible. Luckily for her that time, a Tax court judge was swayed.","Jan Van Dusen, 62, will be sentenced on July 25 and could face up to three years in prison .

Universal Pictures and the filmmakers behind the planned N.W.A. biopic 'Straight Outta Compton' are distancing themselves from an offensive casting announcement for the film. The company said in a statement late Thursday that 'the filmmakers ... did not approve and do not condone the information in this casting notice. We regret and sincerely apologize for being in any way associated with the offensive descriptions it contained.' Silver screen adaptation: This photo released by Universal Pictures shows the cast and filmmakers of 'Straight Outta Compton,'  clockwise, from top left, producer Ice Cube, director F. Gary Gray, producer Dr. Dre, Corey Hawkins (as Dr. Dre), Jason Mitchell (as Eazy-E) and O'Shea Jackson Jr. (as Ice Cube) Sande Alessi Casting posted an open call earlier this week that sought women in four categories.'A girls' were described as 'the hottest of the hottest' and could be of any ethnicity. 'B girls' were to be 'fine girls, long natural hair, really nice bodies,' the open call said. 'Small waists, nice hips. You should be light-skinned. Beyonce is a prototype here.' 'D girls,' however, were to be 'African-American... Poor, not in good shape. Medium to dark skin tone.' Gawker.com quoted the casting call in an article Thursday. The casting company has since removed the announcement from its Facebook page. A woman who answered the phone at Sande Alessi Casting on Thursday declined comment to the Associated Press and would not identify herself. Universal has not said if it is still working with the casting company. Casting: Company Sande Alessi Casting says it's looking for 'an excellent twerker' for the N.W.A. biopic 'Straight Outta Compton' Seeking: Part of the company's listing on its website says it seeks male 'gang member types, family members and guys with street swag' Sande Alessi Casting's Kristan Berona described the casting notice as 'just an unfortunate mistake in the lettering that has caused us backlash' while speaking to JET Magazine. '[The lettering system] is not by any means a ranking of 'A’ is better than ‘B.’ There are notices for hot girls that are the letters 'G' and 'H,'"" Berona also said. 'We obviously don’t want to leave anything up that’s offensive to people…I’m obviously going to use a different system now.' The Sande Alessi Casting website shows it is still inviting African-American men and women to audition as extras for 'Straight Outta Compton' at an open call later this month. Part of the company's listing on its website says it seeks male 'gang member types, family members and guys with street swag.' For women, 'We are also seeking all types of African American women' which include 'hot models, sassy around-the-way girls, moms, aunts, neighbors.' A Friday listing on Sande Alessi Casting's Facebook page says it is also looking for a young woman from any ethnic background who 'must be an excellent twerker.'","Universal Pictures and the filmmakers .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . Dogs are stepping in to find birds that may be severely injured at a California solar power plant. 141 birds were found dead between July 2012 and December 2013 at Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, according to an April report by the National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory obtained by KCET. 47 of those birds were killed by solar flux while 24 birds were killed by impact trauma. Temperatures at Ivanpah's 'power tower' reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit, the report said. As part of its multiple suggestions, the report encouraged using dogs to better report the number of birds that died or suffered injuries at the plant. Burned: A Yellow-rumped Warbler, part of the National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory report, is seen with some of its flight feathers affected because of solar flux . Curled: A Peregrine falcon's wing, also part of the report, is damaged by solar flux . At Ivanpah, birds that suffered solar flux experienced 'feather curling, charring, melting and/or breakage and loss' and 'flight feathers of the tail and/or wings were invariably affected,' the report said. The Office of Law Enforcement, part of the Fish and Wildlife Service, noticed 'streamers' at Ivanpah. 'Indeed OLE staff observed birds entering the solar flux  and igniting, consequently becoming a streamer,' the report said. The solar power plant was also deemed a 'mega-trap' for multiple species by the report's authors. '[Ivanpah attracts] insects which in turn attract insect-eating birds, which are incapacitated by solar flux injury, thus attracting predators and creating an entire food chain vulnerable to injury and death,' the report said. A report filed by energyservices with the California Energy Commission in May and obtained by KCET reported 80 dead birds at the power plant in May. Many of the birds were listed in the report as suffering burn injuries. The suggestion to use dogs has so far proven successful, based off a report submitted to the California Energy Commission in June and obtained by Takepart.com. That . report, written by H.T. Harvey and Associates, said 91 birds died and . five more were found injured at the solar power plant between October . 2013 and March 2014. Humans recovered dead 35.7% of small bird species and 42.8% of dead large bird species in a trial, the report found. Birds are seen with varying degrees of solar flux damage . Damaged: A Peregrine falcon wing is seen with evidence of solar flux . Helpers: Eight dogs are currently working at Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, pictured, to find the birds . However, researchers found that dogs, when paired with handlers, were able to find 68% of dead small bird species and 71% of dead large bird species. In the wake of the findings, eight dog teams are currently being used at Ivanpah, PE.com reported. 'The dogs do love their work,' Brian Boroski of H.T. Harvey and Associates told the website. 'Their reward is play. So we keep it fun for them.' 'If you have [a dog] in your home, it would be the one who is bringing you a ball all of the time,' he added.","Birds whose wings have been burned at Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System have been found dead and injured on the grounds .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . Police at a California concert venue claim a woman was asked to move to a different area because her baby was at risk in the pit with her - though the woman claims it was because she was breastfeeding in public. A video taken at a Brad Paisley concert on Thursday shows Chula Vista police speaking to 30-year-old mother Megan Christopherson, NBCLosAngeles reported, who was there with her baby and another daughter. 'My child that is actually sleeping and I'm getting escorted by police,' she says through tears as she is led out of the pit. Scroll down for video . Mother: Megan Chistopherson, pictured, said the issue on Thursday night was really because she breastfed her baby daughter in public . Incident: A Chula Vista police officer, left, tells Christopherson her location in the pit puts her baby at risk. Christopherson, right, is seen upset in the video . 'Having your child where you are at, when the next bands start coming out, they're going to be even louder than what was already down there, okay?' the officer says to her in the video. 'You're child doesn't have hearing protection on,' he continues. 'The crowd is going to start surging forward. Where you're at your child could get crushed, so we're afraid of your child getting crushed and we're afraid of your child's eardrums being hurt, okay? That is borderline, probably child endangerment. 'You have two options, okay? They can re-seat you somewhere else, they can put you in another seat where you can be safe, or you can get a refund on your tickets. It's up to you; it's your call.' In the video, Christopherson tells police she was at the same venue for a Tim McGraw concert in the pit with her baby and wasn't told to move. Christopherson also says that security guards photographed her breastfeeding and told her to stop - though the police officer claims 'this has nothing to do with the breastfeeding part.' Witness: Carmen Cooley-Graham, pictured, claims the incident was about other concert-goers in the pit upset Christopherson was in public breastfeeding . Christopherson tells police she wants her tickets refunded and turns down the offer to be moved to a different area. The officer tells Christopherson that if she refused to leave the pit, she would have been charged. He says they contacted the District Attorney's Office - and that she cannot receive officers' badge numbers unless she identifies herself. She told 10News the incident 'was completely a cop-out.' 'They're trying to cover this up because they know they legally cannot remove me for nursing,' she said. The statement from Chula Vista police says officers spoke with Christopherson after security had already asked her to move and cited safety concerns. Witness Carmen Cooley-Graham, who also spoke to 10News, wrote on the Chula Vista police Facebook page 'I don't know mom but I stood next to her for 2 hours and saw everything first hand- This is about BREASTFEEDING!! they had no issue-security guard was 2 people down from her and never once said anything until breastfeeding which no one could see. 5 girls tried to cut in front of her and when we all said no they texted a Elite security friend- then it became a breast feeding issue.' var p = new anv_pl_def(); p.config = {}; p.config.width = 634; p.config.height = 400; p.loadVideoExpressV3('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|1000011|SPS'); .","Chula Vista police spoke to mother Megan Christopherson during a Thursday Brad Paisley concert .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . The wife of former New York Giants player Luke Petitgout has filed for divorce following a recent alleged assault at a swanky New York City lounge. The New York Post reports that Jennifer Marino Petitgout filed for divorce in New Jersey on Tuesday to end a 13-year-marriage from which she has three children. She's also allegedly trying to make her current temporary restraining order permanent. Jennifer Marino Petitgout pictured here with her three daughters allegedly filed for divorce from her husband Luke Petitgout on Tuesday . Luke Petitgout is a former football player on the NFL team The New York Giants . A source told The Post that Jennifer, 'changed the locks on their marital home and has new codes on her alarm system.' The source also told them that cops will be escorting Luke to the house on Friday so that he can gather his possessions. The couple live in Woodcliff lake, NJ. and together they have three young daughters. The most recent alleged assault took place on June 5 when Jennifer was partying with two friends at 48 Lounge in Manhattan. Jennifer and her friends were speaking to two men, one of whom the women knew. At around midnight, Luke allegedly stormed into the lounge in a fit of rage and reportedly attacked one of the men in the right eye, John Constantinides, 43, before slapping his wife. He allegedly had to be restrained by the bouncers until the cops arrived to arrest him. Jennifer Marino Petitgout was allegedly attacked by her husband Luke Petitgout at 48 Lounge (pictured) on June 5 . Luke Petitgout (pictured here in 2005) also allegedly attacked his wife almost a year ago in August on their wedding anniversary .

Almost a year ago in August the ex-Giants tackle was charged with misdemeanor assault after he allegedly smashed Jennifer in the head and threw her out of the car on their wedding anniversary. They had been celebrating out that night in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan. Jennifer was treated at New York Downtown Hospital for bruises following the attack. Cops say she told them she 'feared fro her life.' Petigout was charged with misdemeanor assault but Jennifer dropped the charges against her 6-foot-6, 310 pound husband-not this time, however. Jennifer's lawyers will try to have a judge order Luke to go through anger management and drug testing. 'This was the last straw,' a source told Page Six. 'He thinks this is all going to go away and they’ll reconcile. It’s not going to happen,' he added.Jennifer's adviser Nicole Noonan, the president of National Divorce Capitol, told reporters she is most concerned with her client's safety and the safety of her children. 'My paramount concern is the safety, health and well-being of my client and her children. Therefore, precautions have been taken,' said Noonan.

"By . Alexandra Klausner . and David Wilkes . American Apparel decided to fire their controversial CEO based on new information saying he  allowed an employee to impersonate and post naked photos online of an alleged victim of his sexual abuse who filed a case against him in 2011. The New York Post reports that the clothing company is investigating the alleged misconduct against Irene Morales, now 21. The clothing company fired Dov Charney at a Wednesday meeting based on his list of taboos they found were a liability to the company. This week, the board at American Apparel accused Charney of allowing and employee at one of his Los Angeles stores to post naked photos of Morales on a blog that was meant to appear as though it belonged to Morales, Insiders told the post. CEO Dov Charney holds the company title no more after he allegedly allowed an employee in Los Angeles to impersonate his alleged victim Irene Morales online . The blog not only allegedly broke a California law that forbids people from falsely impersonating someone online, it also 'harassed and defamed Morales.' The board at American Apparel says that since Charney allegedly knew the blog was posted and didn't do anything to stop it that he was exposing the company to a liability. The $260 million lawsuit filed against Charney in 2011 by Morales was tossed by a Brooklyn Judge in 2012 and instead brought into arbitration. The lawsuit was complicated by a report from March 25, 2011 that said Morales allegedly sent nude photos of herself to Charney after she stopped working at the store. The photos allegedly were paired with titillating come-ons like, 'Daddy’s got a little naughty girl waiting for him,' which Morales supposedly wrote, said Charney’s lawyer Stuart Slotnick. Even though the case was tossed, the blog posts exposed American Apparel to more recent damages. Irene Morales, 21, said that Charney allegedly made her his sex slave and new information states Charney may have allowed an employee to impersonate her online . A source told The Post that a settlement 'in the low six-digits' was underway but it wasn't clear if the settlement had been finalized or not. Despite the previous case being sent into arbitration, Charney lost his title of chairman and he's been suspended from his post as CEO of American Apparel for 30 days. The post spoke with the American Apparel co-chairman Allen Mayer on Friday who said the board got new incriminating information on Charney but said that they refused to discuss it any further. 'We have heard for years allegations and rumors in newspaper stories that were not sufficient to take action,' Mayer told The New York Post. 'But what came to our attention was not allegations and rumors but established fact.' The board also mentioned that certain severance payments were made to some female employees without consent from the board. The board also said that Charney used company funds to arrange travel plans for his mother. To add to his string of taboos, a video of Charney dancing naked in front of two female employees. Pictured dancing naked around his office, this is the boss of fashion brand American Apparel who was sacked over alleged misconduct. Dov Charney founded the firm in 1989 but has been accused of sexual harassment by at least eight of his staff – and was kicked out of the company this week. The video of the businessman gyrating in the nude in front of two women emerged 24 hours after he was fired. Scroll down for video .

The short clip of the . 45-year-old Canadian businessman shows him dancing naked to upbeat music . while talking on his mobile phone. ‘I’m dancing right now for . Daisy,’ he informs someone on the other end of the line. Naked truth: The women in the video have been identified by a one-time American Apparel staffer as current of former employees of the retailer . One of the . women off-camera is heard telling him to shake his ‘booty’, and he then . scuttles away with his hands covering his modesty. It was not clear last night when the video was taken or whether its discovery had contributed to him being fired. But . a former model for American Apparel has confirmed that the man in the . video is ‘100 per cent’ Charney. Ousted millionaire: Dov Charney, 45, has been fired as president and CEO of American Apparel for cause amid allegations of misconduct . Mad genius? Dov Charney, 45, a Canadian national, started American Apparel in 1991 as a humble wholesale T-shirt manufacturer . Another former staff member at the . fashion retailer claimed the women in the footage both worked for . American Apparel. Born in Montreal, Charney started American Apparel while he was still a student. The . business now has 10,000 employees and 249 stores in 20 countries, . including the US and the UK – but the brand has faced criticism for . using overtly sexual images in some of its advertisements.And . Charney, who once described himself as ‘a bit of a dirty guy’, has faced . repeated accusations of sexual misconduct from female employees. Big business: American Apparel currently employs 10,000 employees and operates 249 retail stores in 20 countries . Courting controversy: The retailer has repeatedly come under fire for using young models dressed in sexy clothes to promote the brand . In . one, former saleswoman Irene Morales claimed she was held as a sex slave . for eight months just after she turned 18, when she was forced to . perform sexual acts in Charney’s Manhattan apartment. In a separate . claim, Miss Morales and several other woman said they were forced to . pose nude in a series of pictures which later surfaced on the internet. All the cases have been either dismissed or settled, but the company . announced Charney’s departure on Wednesday. Explosive allegations: In 2011, Irene Morales (left) sued Dov Charney (right) accusing him of treated her as a 'sex slave' Weakened: Morales's claims were later  undermined by a trove of explicit pictures and messages she allegedly sent her boss . Legal victory: Two years ago, a New York judge tossed Morales' $260million lawsuit against Charney . Chairman Allan Mayer, who . has been on the board since the company went public in 2007, said: ‘We . take no joy in this, but the board felt it was the right thing to do. ‘Dov . Charney created American Apparel, but the company has grown much larger . than any one individual and we are confident that its greatest days are . still ahead.’ American Apparel’s share price rose by more than 20 . per cent after the announcement. But at 40p a share, the firm’s value . has dropped dramatically since 2008, when it could command more than £8 a . share. Master of his domain: Dov Charney, then-chairman and chief executive officer of American Apparel Inc., stands for a portrait in a company retail store in New York in 2010 . Unexpected dismissal: Charney reportedly did not see his termination coming and will fight to regain control of American Apparel . As a teen growing up in Montreal, Canada, Dov Charney was obsessed with American culture. He has described his early envy of the choice available in America as compared to Canada in terms of how many 'hundred' different breakfast cereals teenagers south of the border could have. He adored the simple fashions of classic, bargain brands such as Hanes and Fruit of the Loom and began importing them and selling them to classmates while in High School. His early entrepreneurial spirit is evidenced by his claims to have sold 10,000 t-shirts while still a student, buying and transporting his stock himself in a rented U-Haul truck. Charney launched American Apparel in 1991 with a $10,000 loan from his father while still attending Tufts University. The company was originally conceived as a wholesale business manufacturing basic T-shirts, allegedly inspired by Charney's ex-girlfriend. By 1997, the humble sewing operation cranking out T-shirts has grown significantly, moving first to Charleston, South Carolina, and then to its now famous seven-story 800,000-square-foot Los Angeles factory. In 2003, American Apparel expanded into the retail market, with stores popping up from coast to coast and beyond. American Apparel has built a large fan base thanks to its commitment to manufacturing all its clothing in the U.S. instead of outsourcing the work to other countries. The company also prides itself on paying employees fair wages and providing health insurance, which is uncommon in the garment industry. Charney claimed to have the 'highest earning apparel workers in the world.' By 2005, Charney was looking at over $200million in annual revenue and in 2014, he had more than 260 stores worldwide, with revenue in excess of $500million. A year later, the prosperous business was sold for more than $380million to Endeavor Acquisition Corporation, but Dov Charney stayed on as president and CEO. Beginning in early 2000s, the fashion mogul has faced accusations of sexual misconduct, with as many as nine former employees suing Charney for alleged harassment. However, all the cases have been either dismissed or settled out of court. In 2009, things took a turn for the worse for American Apparel when the company found itself teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, which was narrowly avoided thanks to an $80million loan. Six months later, American Apparel was forced to fire 1,800 workers after federal agents raided its factory and discovered that many employees were in the U.S. illegally. The once-thriving retailer continued struggling, and three years after American Apparel went public the New York Stock Exchange threatened to remove its listing because of delayed quarterly filings. In a bid to turn the company around, Dov Charney went on the offensive, closing several dozen stores, focusing on efficiency and harnessing the power of Groupon to sell clothes at a discount. The past two years have been a roller coaster ride for American Apparel, with strong quarters followed by losses and more bankruptcy talk. With Dov Charney’s firing, the company is once again looking at an uncertain future.                                                                                                                         Source: Business Insider .","Dov Charney was fired at a Wednesday Board meeting after the company learned new allegations against the former CEO .

"By . Associated Press . and Alexandra Klausner . The episode isn't among Spider-Man's biggest hits: the superhero versus the snow-wielding mom. One of the costumed characters who roam Times Square went on trial today in New York. Philip Williams is accused of hitting a passer-by who didn't tip him for posing for a photo with her children on February 10, 2013. Williams' lawyer Rachel Black argued that even though Williams may have been 'obnoxious' towards the mother by calling her a 'piece of crap' for not tipping him, that he acted in 'self defense.' Philip Williams, 35, the Times Square Spider Man, gets arraigned for punching a woman when she didn't tip him but claims it was 'self defense' Victoria Goreaciuc says Williams cursed at her and later punched her in the temple. She acknowledges confronting him and flinging a handful of snow at him. Williams says he reacted in self-defense after a cold, hard chunk hit his head. The defense had questioned whether Williams was actually the costumed figure who allegedly insulted Goreaciuc. But he later acknowledged in testimony that he was. 'Saying you’re a piece crap is a really obnoxious thing to do and unfortunately in New York we have to deal with stuff like that. It’s actually not a crime to be a jerk, unfortunately or fortunately,' said Black in a statement in court today. The New York Daily News reports that Black called Goreaciuc 'the initial aggressor in a confrontation with a confused and bewildered Mr. Williams, who had been struck in the back of a head with not a snowball but an ice block.' 'He turned and acted in self-defense because he reasonably believed that Ms. Goreaciuc was going to use physical force against him because she had just used physical force against him,' Black added. The plaintiff Victoria Goreaciuc says Phillip Williams (not pictured) cursed at her and later punched her in the temple . Goreaciuc’s husband allegedly also targeted Williams by stealing his backpack during the fight. A character dressed as Batman then apparently stepped in to ask Goreaciuc’s husband to return the knapsack. Goreaciuc’s 5-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son whose birthday they were celebrating were nearby. Prosecutors argue that even though Goreaciuc threw snow at Williams, a punch in the head was not an appropriate response. 'Admittedly this is not Ms. Goreaciuc’s proudest moment … but [WILLIAMS’]response was to punch Ms. Goreaciuc’s on the side of her face,' said Assistant District Attorney Andrew Stengel. Williams is charged with attempted assault and harassment and faces up to 90 days if he is convicted. This case is among several criminal cases in recent years against Times Square's costumed characters.","Spider man Philip Williams' defense says that he was acting in 'self defense' when he allegedly hit Victoria Goreaciuc in the head .

"By . Alexandra Klausner . A 79-year-old Minnesota man is in tears after learning that his $24 million yacht caught on fire in the Chula Vista boat yard on Thursday. Larry Jodass, 79, a retired electrical engineer, entrepreneur, and the former chairman of a semiconductor company was heartbroken after watching footage of his beloved yacht the 'Polar Bear' burn to ash in footage posted online. 'It was my toy, my wonderful, beautiful . piece of equipment. I think it’s the most beautiful boat that ever has . been built,' Jodass told NBC. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A yacht in San Diego, California, went up in flames on Thursday, and a drone caught the dramatic scene on video . The $24 million dollar yacht the 'Polar Bear' is destroyed after it mysteriously burst into flames on Thursday . The yacht's owner and its builder, Larry Jodass, 79, wants answers as to why his precious boat caught fire in the shipyard where it was undergoing repairs . The $24 million dollar beloved yacht of Larry Jodass was only in the water for three years before it was engulfed in flames . Jodass told reporters that he isn't 'angry' about what happened but that he's devastated to lose the beautiful yacht that took him five years to build. Jodass told NBC that the yacht has been in the water for three years and that it was dry docked in Chula Vista after he took his boat on a winter vacation in Costa Rica. The vessel broke into flames at around 9:15 on Thursday morning at the dry dock in the 900 block of G Street. Smoke filled the air and dispatchers warned fire crews that there was a lot of fuel on board the boat which put the vessel at risk for an explosion. Fire fighters hosed down the flaming vessel from all directions. Because a yacht is built to keep out water, the fire team's effort did little to quell the monstrous flames. The yacht, pictured here before it was destroyed, was undergoing repairs in the shipyard after Jodass took it on a winter vacation in Costa Rica . All that remains of the 'Polar Bear' is a charred skeleton after it mysteriously caught fire on Thursday . The boat had a top of the line renovated control station and had only been on the water for three years before it was destroyed . Police were compelled to use high powered rifles to open the yacht so that the water could enter and calm the fire. The shipyard was evacuated as a per-caution and luckily the other boats did not catch fire. A Hazmat team, a group of personnel specifically trained to handle dangerous materials, was also brought to the shipyard. Now burnt and broken, the remains of the 'Polar Bear' don't even vaguely resemble the once opulent luxury vessel. The boat was once equipped with a large master bedroom with a widescreen television and the bathroom housed top of the line marble counter tops. 'The beautiful part with this piece of equipment was that no matter who looked at it, it was like, ""Wow, how in the hell could you have a boat like that? “'Jodass told NBC. Officials are still investigating the cause of the fire but confirmed that a welder was working on the boat at the time that it caught fire. Jordass wants answers and told reporters he will continue to pester the shipyard until he gets some kind of explanation. 'I don’t have enough data to make any positive or negative comment as to why somebody who’s doing their job obviously didn’t get it done because it would not have caught on fire,' he added. Jodsass said the fire took something away from him that he truly loved and valued and he wont stop asking questions until he gets answers and hopefully an apology. 'Do I love that boat? It’s a helluva boat, I just think it was wonderful, I enjoyed it tremendously and I think it was worth the money that I put into it,' he wept as he remembered the 'Polar Bear' in all its glory. The boat's interior resembled that of an upscale home and was approximately 110 feet in size . The boat housed luxury amenities like this master bedroom with a widescreen television . Larry Jodass wants answers as to why his beloved 'Polar Bear' is nothing more that soot and ashes .","Larry Jodass, 79, a retired electrical engineer, entrepreneur, and the former chairman of a semiconductor company is in tears after losing his boat .

"By . David Mccormack . and Associated  Press Reporter . With baseball players from Latin American dominating the MLB, teams are doing everything they can to ensure that prospective star players can adapt to a new country, culture and most significantly language. Hundreds of young Latin American players around the country are now speaking English with ease, thanks to greater resources devoted to teaching language skills and other day-to-day tasks in American life as part of the transition to baseball in the U.S. All 30 major league teams now have academies in the Dominican Republic, and a handful of organizations run similar operations in Venezuela as well. Hundreds of young Latin American players around the country are now speaking English with ease, thanks to greater resources devoted to teaching language skills and other day-to-day tasks in American life as part of the transition to baseball in the U.S. ‘There's no doubt it's different today than it was a generation ago for these players, with the media coverage, the impact of social media, the coverage, the television, everything,’ San Diego Padres manager Bud Black said. ‘These guys are exposed.’ The San Francisco Giants say they have increased spending by 400 percent over the past decade. ‘It has increased steadily each year as we have added more components to the assimilation program,’ said Alan Lee, Giants Director of Arizona Baseball Operations. The Giants estimate they have helped train 325 Latin players with English skills in the last 15 years, while also providing Spanish training for those seeking to learn. San Francisco Giants baseball prospects Jose Murel and Sandy Perez, right, read beginner English books in class in Scottsdale, Ariz. Roughly 200 players have taken Spanish courses in the past four years. Black and several other managers and GMs say there are fewer issues in which the language barrier causes their jobs to be more challenging than even five years ago. For example, most managers now make their pitching changes without the aid of an interpreter. Some still prefer an interpreter when sending a player down to the minors or explaining certain technical aspects of a swing, pitching motion or other instruction. ‘If there's something in particular that I need a player to understand and I can't have any confusion, I go through an interpreter with the player and I instruct the interpreter to tell him exactly what I say the way I say it,’ said Rangers manager Ron Washington, who speaks only the most basic Spanish.

If you change that effect, you just changed my interpretation.’ Hector Sanchez, the Venezuelan-born catcher for the San Francisco Giants made learning English as much a part of his job as studying his pitchers and their tendencies. He had to be able to speak with the pitchers, so he took classes on the computer via Skype before and after games. ‘It's not just for the position,’ Sanchez said. ‘You're in another country, a different country and this is like a challenge for you, so you have to take the challenge to survive.’ While Sanchez is proving a reliable option as Buster Posey's backup in the Bay Area, the future of the franchise - Latino minor leaguers - sits in classrooms at the team's training complex in Scottsdale, Arizona, taking evening English classes as their empty practice fields are watered outside in the desert heat. The San Francisco Giants is just one of many clubs putting a stronger emphasis on teaching English basics, including training as to writing checks, using a bank account or mailing a letter to young prospects from Latin America . The men walk past World Series logos on the walls as they arrive, a reminder of the team's championships in 2010 and 2012. The lessons include English basics, including training in how to write checks, use a bank account or mail a letter. There's even training on how to conduct a simple telephone call. ‘We didn't have that. We had to learn from scratch,’ said 76-year-old Hall of Famer Orlando Cepeda, a Puerto Rican among the first group of Latinos playing baseball in the U.S. ‘(Talking) with the players, that's what I did (to learn).’ Carol Gabb is the lead English instructor for the Giants' minor leaguers. She regularly fist-bumps players throughout a session to celebrate and encourage their progress. During one class this spring, everybody sang Happy Birthday to work on the simple meanings behind the tune. The San Francisco Giants estimate they have helped train 325 Latin players with English skills in the last 15 years, while also providing Spanish training for those seeking to learn . Players, much like school children, laugh, talk out of turn, stretch, kick off their flip flops, curl their toes when reading, make faces, or even smile sheepishly when they answer correctly and are given praise. A few years back, this was Sanchez. And he also carved out time in his busy baseball life to take one-on-one classes. He started the sessions during his first professional season, rookie ball in 2009, but took it to another level in 2012. ‘I get the opportunity to take English classes and I take advantage, and tried to learn every day,’ Sanchez said, his grammar still not perfect but close. ‘That's all about it, getting better, learning. That's how you survive in life.’ Longtime Giants equipment manager Mike Murphy has nicknamed the affable catcher after actor George Clooney, and Sanchez immediately plays along by pulling off his black Giants cap and rubbing his hair - which, while far darker, is almost a spitting image of Clooney's precisely groomed 'do. Carol Gabb is the lead English instructor for the Giants' minor leaguers and she regularly fist-bumps players throughout a session to celebrate and encourage their progress . On another day this spring near the dugout, reliever Santiago Casilla used a mix of English and Spanish to ask Giants athletic trainer Dave Groeschner for medicine to help alleviate a pregame headache. ‘I understand everything but it's a little bit difficult to speak it clearly. It doesn't scare me, but I understand more studying while I listen,’ he said. While Seattle second baseman Robinson Cano is at ease speaking fluent English, the Dominican star regularly can be seen razzing teammates while speaking Spanish a mile a minute. Cano briefly attended high school in New Jersey. ‘I went to school here, so I learned English,’ said Cano, who received a $240 million, 10-year contract to join the Mariners last off-season after nine years with the New York Yankees. ‘But it's hard speaking your second language.’","MLB teams are throwing resources at teaching .

"By . Robin Rayne Nelson . and David Mccormack . The wife of Justin Ross Harris, the Georgia man who faces a murder charge after leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a scorching hot SUV last month, has hired her own attorney. Leanna Harris, who has been the subject of much speculation since her son’s tragic death,  has hired Cobb County criminal defense attorney Lawrence Zimmerman, it was revealed on Thursday. ‘She needs advice from a trained professional ,’ said Philip Holloway, a criminal defense lawyer who comments regularly for cable news programming. Family: The Atlanta Journal Constitution claims there are discrepancies int he evidence in the case of Justin Ross Harris, pictured right with his wife and late son Cooper . ‘But the public shouldn't presume guilt because she has legal representation now. Innocent people are accused all the time, getting advice from an attorney is the prudent things to do,’ he said. Police have not named her as a suspect and she has not been charged with any crime. She was seen visiting the Cobb County jail where her husband is being held on Monday. The news come as her husband’s employer Home Depot confirmed that it has fired him from his job as a web developer. He had worked at the Atlanta-based home improvement company for two years. Company spokeswoman Catherine Woodling confirmed on Thursday that Justin Ross Harris no longer works for the company but wouldn't say when he was terminated. He had been on leave without pay since his arrest. Mom: Police have not named Leanna Harris as a suspect and she has not been charged with any crime . Earlier on Thursday, police said a toxicology tests on the body of 22-month-old Cooper had negative results, but they didn't say what substances they tested for. Toxicology tests typically are used to detect foreign substances such as drugs in a person's system. A growing number of questions are being asked about Leanna Harris' unusual behavior in the wake of young Cooper’s horrific death inside a sweltering SUV last month. Harris, a 30-year-old dietitian, expressed little emotion throughout her husband's preliminary hearing last week, despite a number of shocking allegations including that her husband had been sexting with six different women, some teenagers, on the day their young son had passed away. As prosecutors said her husband was practically leading a double life and should not be granted bond, Leanna Harris chewed gum and stared blankly ahead. During last Thursday’s proceedings, investigators described her own behavior on the day her son died as odd, if not suspicious. Investigation: Cobb County police investigate the SUV where toddler Cooper Harris died near Marietta, Ga., when his father Ross forgot to drop his child off at day care and went to work . When informed by workers at her son’s day care facility that Cooper had never been dropped off, she calmly responded, ‘Ross must have left him in the car. There’s no other explanation,’ according to Cobb County Police Det. Phil Stoddard’s testimony. Then, when reunited with her husband at police headquarters after he had been charged with murder, Leanna Harris asked him, ‘Did you say too much?’ according to Stoddard. When she called home June 18 with the grim news of Cooper’s death, her mother could be overheard on the phone saying: ‘Why aren’t you crying? Why aren’t you reacting?’ Her response, according to Stoddard: ‘I must be in shock.’ Police had previously disclosed that, like her husband, she had researched children dying in hot vehicles prior to her son Cooper’s death, telling officers it was her ‘worst fear.’ At Cooper’s funeral - and with her husband listening from jail on speaker phone - she said she held no anger toward him. ‘Ross is and was a wonderful father,’ she told mourners, before telling her husband of seven years: ‘I love you and I’m doing this for you.’ No bond: Justin Ross Harris, the Georgia man charged with murder after his toddler son died inside of a hot SUV, was refused bond on July 3 and will now remain in jail until he is tried . Some of Leanna Harris’ comments during her eulogy at Cooper’s funeral have also raised suspicions. ‘Some of you might wonder how I’m standing here today and I ask myself the same question,’ the deeply religious mother said. ‘I should be crumpled into a pile of tears and snot on the ground. (The Lord) is standing behind me, holding me up.' The 250 or so mourners who gathered at University Church of Christ gave her two rounds of applause as she said she wouldn’t bring her son back, even if she could. ‘He’s in the most peaceful, wonderful place there is.’ On Thursday, Cobb County District Attorney Vic Reynolds said the investigation continues and ‘much work remains.’ Many observers believe the police will be looking at Leanna Harris’ possible words and actions very closely. Heartbreaking details: Detective Stoddard testified that there was scratch marks on Cooper Harris' face and abrasions on the back of the toddler's head . Justin Ross Harris is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a scorching hot SUV on June 18 . Justin Ross Harris was denied bond on Thursday by a judge who called it a 'possible death penalty case.' He remains in jail on murder and child cruelty charges and prosecutors may seek to use Leanna Harris as a witness. In . Georgia, the spousal privilege shielding a wife from testifying against . her husband, doesn’t apply in cases of the death of a child. ‘She needs to make a deal before the state finds more evidence against her,’ criminal defense lawyer Esther Panitch told AJC.com. Thursday's preliminary hearing also featured disturbing . new details suggesting that 22-month-old Cooper may have tried to free himself before succumbing to the . heat. Detective Stoddard told the court that several injuries were found on the toddler’s body, including visible marks on his face. Aftermath: Guests leave the funeral for Cooper Harris after hearing an emotional call from father Ross from prison as he said goodbye last month . 'It would have come from the child or a scratch being made while the child was alive and then not healing or scabbing over or anything after that, soon after he passed away,' said the officer. There were also abrasions to the back . of Cooper's head suggesting that the toddler was rubbing his head . against the car seat in a desperate bid to get free. The . details that emerged from Stoddard's testimony paint a harrowing . picture of Cooper's final moments, which the little boy possibly spent . scratching his face with his nails and squirming to escape from the car . seat. Arrest warrants . released on Thursday shed additional light on what Cooper Harris must have . been going through inside his father's scorching SUV. According . to the documents, the boy’s car seat was set on the lowest level, which . means that Cooper was strapped in as tightly as possible. Justin . Harris allegedly knew the specific make and model of the car seat and . what the weight limit was for the child to be seated in it, the warrant . revealed. Leanna Harris listened intently to the evidence against her husband being presented by the prosecution and was later escorted to a waiting car after Justin Harris was denied bond . New documents released on Friday showed that Justin Harris had given his family grim instruction on what . they'd have to do to collect on an insurance policy on the boy's life . from his cell. 'Through the . investigation Harris has made comments to family members regarding a . life insurance policy that he has on Cooper and what they need to do in . order to file for it,' the paper reported. A Cobb County detective said there were two life insurance policies on the boy's life: one for $25,000 and one for $2,000. It's uncertain whether the family has actually attempted to claim the money. Stoddard described the evidence police . have suggesting Harris, who is charged with murder, killed his . 22-month-old son Cooper intentionally. Leanna Harris also told police the pair were having intimacy issues, according to . Stoddard. There are texts to indicate that she knew he was cheating on . her. 'We plan to show that he wanted to live a child-free life,' the prosecution told the judge. Stoddard . testified that before the boy died, Harris had visited the website . Reddit to search for articles on life without children, and viewed . videos on Reddit that showed people dying - by suicide or execution, in . some cases. Accused: Justin Ross Harris is facing additional charges of sexual exploitation of a minor as well as murder and child cruelty . Harris had also twice viewed a video that shows the painful death of animals left in hot cars, and had searched for 'how to survive in prison', according to searches of his laptop, Stoddard said. ‘I think the evidence now is . showing intent,’ Stoddard said. He said Harris should remain in jail . because he is a flight risk: There is evidence he was leading a double . life, he has family in Alabama, and the former 911 dispatcher has law . enforcement experience. Defense attorney Maddox Kilgore said that evidence had no bearing on Harris' intent. 'I think the real purpose of all that is to publicly shame him,' Kilgore said . Harris is a native of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and moved to Georgia in 2012 to work for Home Depot. He sat impassively in an orange jail jumpsuit during Thursday's hearing. Harris described Cooper as peaceful with his eyes closed, when this wasn't the case, according to Stoddard. He allegedly also told his wife: 'I dreaded how he would look' Cobb County Police Detective Phil Stoddard testified at a hearing that evidence showed Justin Ross Harris was practically leading a double life and should not be granted bond .","Justin Ross Harris is accused of leaving his 22-month-old son Cooper to die in a scorching hot SUV on June 18 .

"By . David Mccormack . and Lydia Warren . A photo of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, smiling and posing with a former senior Taliban official in Afghanistan has been posted on Twitter. The undated photo, likely taken during Bergdahl’s five years in captivity, was posted on the social media site on Wednesday by @khorasan3, an account associated with the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Along with the image were the words ‘#US Solider #Bergdahl with Martyr #Taliban Leader Badar'udin Haqqani(RH) S/O Shaykh Jalaludin Haqqani(HA).’ Scroll down for video . This photo of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, smiling and posing with a former senior Taliban official in Afghanistan, was posted on Twitter on Wednesday . The Middle East Research Institute has confirmed that the man in the photo is Taliban Commander Badruddin Haqqani, a senior member of the Haqqani network in Afghanistan. He was considered the organisation's day-to-day operations commander and was killed in a U.S. drone strike in August 2012. He was also the son of Haqqani head Jalaluddin Haqqani. The Haqqani Network is an Islamist insurgent group allied with the Taliban and using asymmetric warfare to fight against US-led NATO forces and the government of Afghanistan. Later @khorasan tweeted a series of messages in which they claimed Bergdahl was never tortured by the Taliban and only treated with kindness during his five years in captivity. The Middle East Research Institute has confirmed that the man in the photo is Taliban Commander Badruddin Haqqani, a senior member of the Haqqani network in Afghanistan . Former POW Bergdahl was controversially released by the Taliban in May in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay detainees. Since arriving back on American soil, he has been held at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio as part of his 'reintegration.' Last week it emerged that he is being allowed to wander off the Texas base and while under supervision he has visited a library, a supermarket, stores and fast-food chains near the camp. During the . trips, Bergdahl sometimes wears civilian clothing and other times . dresses in his military uniform, leading passersby to recognize him and . shake his hand, an Army spokesperson told CNN. The details have emerged as soldiers who served with Bergdahl before he left his post in Afghanistan in 2009 revealed they have still not been contacted by military investigators. Questions: A new investigation has been launched to determine whether Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, pictured, deserted his post or went AWOL when he was reported missing in Afghanistan in 2009 . The former . soldiers have said that they believe the Army has failed to contact them . because it has already made up its mind about how Bergdahl ended up in . the hands of the Taliban. Members . of Bergdahl's unit - including the platoon leader - have previously . said they believe he deserted his post in June 2009 before seeking out . the enemy. But when he was swapped for five Guantanamo Bay detainees on May 31, President Obama gave him a hero's welcome and said the switch had been prompted by Bergdahl's poor health. Two-star general Major General Kenneth Dahl is now conducting a new investigation to determine whether Bergdahl did desert his post or went AWOL, which would suggest he intended to rejoin. But for former platoon leader Army Sgt. Evan Buetow, who left the Army in 2012, the answer is the same as it always was. 'I think it's very clear he . deserted his post,' Buetow told FoxNews.com. 'He thought about what he . was doing, he mailed some things home, he walked away and we have . witnesses who saw him walking away. Left out: Former platoon leader and Army Sgt. Evan Buetow, pictured in a previous Fox interview, said he believes the investigators have already made up their mind about what happened . 'And if you’re walking away in one of . the worst, most dangerous areas of Afghanistan without your weapon and . gear, I don’t believe you’re planning on coming back.' Former Army Sgt. Evan Buetow . Of the investigation, he added: 'They've already concluded what they want to be said. They know exactly what happened.' Former Army Sgt. Matt Vierkant also said he had not been contacted by Army officials, but said there are probably still sworn statements by the unit's members made after he left the post. 'I have confidence that they're going to do what’s right,' Vierkant said. 'I just feel this should've happened a long time ago and it should've been public.' Vierkant also believes that Bergdahl deserted his unit, which means he should be court martialed. Speaking out: Former Army Sgt. Matt Vierkant, pictured in a previous interview on CNN, also said he had not been contacted by Army officials and believes that Bergdahl deserted the unit . Bergdahl is . now receiving outpatient care at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio and . has ventured off base to the library, a supermarket, stores and . restaurants as part of his reintegration process. After his reintegration process, he will be assigned to an Army unit, according to the official. But if Army officials determine that he did desert, Buetow said the one-time 'good soldier' should be court-martialed, demoted and dishonorably discharged . Army officials told Fox that the investigating officer will usually review any materials that are provided but said they could not contact of the specific soldiers.","Photo of Sgt.

Mohamed bin Hammam, chief of the Asian Football Confederation, denied fresh allegations of bribery after questions were raised over the integrity of choosing the emirate as tournament host . David Cameron hinted yesterday that England may again seek to host the World Cup, amid calls for Qatar to lose the tournament over corruption claims. Football’s world governing body, Fifa, is facing growing demands to re-run the bidding for the 2022 competition after allegations a top official spent millions ‘buying’ support for Qatar’s campaign. The 2018 tournament, which went to Russia, and 2022 were awarded at the same time, prompting commentators to suggest the voting process was tainted and should be repeated from scratch. Mr Cameron said Fifa investigator Michael Garcia should be allowed to complete his probe into whether corrupt payments influenced the selection. But appearing to open the door for England’s 2018 bid to be resurrected, he added: ‘Who knows what the chances may be for the future?’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg backed calls for Qatar to be stripped of the competition if allegations are upheld that Qatari former Fifa official Mohamed bin Hammam bribed African and Asian football bosses. He tweeted: ‘These are shocking allegations. If proven true, Fifa must rerun the contest fairly and openly.’ Mr Bin Hammam, 65, is accused of flouting Fifa’s bribery rules by using up to £3million to make payments to football officials from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. Qatar’s bid committee said Mr Bin Hammam played ‘no official or unofficial role’ in efforts to secure the competition and denied all wrongdoing.

Plans for an 80 seat restaurant at the 9/11 Memorial Museum have been scaled back in the wake of widespread criticism that it was crass and inappropriate to serve meals on the sacred site where so many had tragically lost their lives. The café was originally billed as serving a ‘subdued, seasonal, mostly vegetarian menu’ and ‘New York-made draft beers and American wines on tap’, but will now serve only pastries, tea and coffee when it launches later this month. Museum officials also confirmed that the mezzanine-level venue will now be simply named The Café, rather than The Pavilion Café, and will no longer have waiter service.

Famed New York restaurateur and Shake Shack mastermind Danny Meyer remains in charge of the simplified offering at The Cafe . The Cafe will open with about half of the 80 seats originally planned, although the rest will eventually be added. A portion of proceeds from the restaurant are going back to the museum. The café was one of several controversies that surrounded the opening of the 9/11 Memorial. The gift shop attached to the 9/11 Museum also provoked outrage after it emerged that it was selling items ranging from key chains to NYPD dog vests marketed off the tragedy. Jewelry, mousepads, magnets, flags, pins, stuffed animals, cellphone cases, toy firetrucks and much more are all originally available for purchase, although some of the contentious items have been ditched. According to the museum's website, the proceeds benefit 'developing and sustaining' the memorial which is run by executives with privately-funded six-figure salaries. However the idea of a gift shop alone was offensive to many as thousands of unidentified remains of victims had recently been moved to a tomb beneath the museum.

Matthew worked as a database administrator for Marsh & McLennan, an insurance firm which had offices in the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Matthew's remains were never recovered.

"By . Jaya Narain . and Daniel Martin . and Sam Marsden . and Michael Seamark . Predator: Cyril Smith is said to have abused boys for decades . The MP who blew the whistle on Sir Cyril Smith’s four decades of child abuse last night demanded a full public inquiry into the scandal. As police announced a probe into an alleged cover-up of Smith’s activities in Rochdale, Labour’s Simon Danczuk said a wider probe was needed to examine how far the network of paedophiles extended and how the political establishment kept it quiet. He said the Lib Dems must reveal all the information they had at the time about the abuse. The call for a public inquiry will put more pressure on Lord Steel – the party’s leader in the late Seventies and Eighties – who has claimed he knew nothing of the allegations. Mr Danczuk, whose book Smile For The Camera: The Double Life Of Cyril Smith was serialised in the Mail this month, said: ‘What we need is a much larger public inquiry that looks at what Smith was involved in, not just in Rochdale but the cover-up in London and elsewhere. ‘Look at what happened to Smith, what he was involved in. Look at who he was in networks with in terms of this type of abuse and also take evidence from elsewhere and look at the wider cover-up.’ Writing in today’s Mail, he adds: ‘Make no mistake: The identities of many of these men have long been known to the police. They must be made to face the law before, like Smith himself, death allows them to escape scot free. ‘Smith’s sphere of influence stretched far beyond Rochdale. I believe he was part of a VIP paedophile ring which was active in London and other parts of the country, with protectors at the highest level of the Establishment.’ Senior Lib Dems including Nick Clegg have said they knew little of the true extent of Smith’s abuse, except for a report in the Rochdale Alternative Press in 1979. Mr Clegg has said he sees no need for an internal inquiry, claiming it is a matter for police. Mr Danczuk’s book tells of appalling events at Knowl View residential school in Rochdale where boys say they were abused by Smith and other men. Scroll down for video . Accused: Sir Cyril Smith, who died at 82 in a nursing home in Rochdale in 2010, is also said to have abused boys at privately-run hostel Cambridge House . The school has closed but there have long been suspicions that the scandal of what happened there was suppressed, in part, to protect Smith. Nine men have come forward to tell police they were abused at Knowl View from the 1970s. Eight more claim they were abused in the 1960s at Cambridge House, a  privately-run hostel for boys. Sir Cyril, who died at 82 in a nursing home in Rochdale in 2010, is also said to have abused boys at Cambridge House, and was secretary of the association that ran it. Smith had links to several schools, including Knowl View, where he was said to hold a set of keys and could visit when he liked. Uncovered: Labour's Simon Danczuk blew the whistle on Sir Cyril's four decades of child abuse . During this time, three files about alleged child abuse were passed to the director of public prosecutions, but without result. Yesterday, Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, said his force would also conduct an inquiry into allegations that Rochdale Council, which had responsibility for Knowl View, had covered up sex abuse claims. He added: ‘As a result of the publicity and the discussion around the book recently published about child abuse in Rochdale, we are carrying out a review into those allegations and other matters of public debate around that book to see whether that justifies a criminal investigation into allegations of cover-up.’ Rochdale Council said it was also widening the scope of its own inquiry into Knowl View in light of Mr Danczuk’s book. But last night the care worker who blew the whistle on abuse at the school in 1994 condemned police and the council. Martin Digan, the school’s head of care, said: ‘Police and the council have had evidence of the abuse that went on for two decades but all they have done is cover it up. ‘They have documents that clearly show Knowl View was a sweet shop for paedophiles who would travel the country to come and abuse boys there, and yet 20 years later we are still waiting for these abusers to be brought to justice. It is not only an insult to the victims, it is an insult to society itself.’ In 2000, Manchester Police carried out a ‘comprehensive investigation’ into abuse claims at Knowl View which led to the conviction of one man for indecent assault and gross indecency. They said there was insufficient evidence to charge any others and no specific allegations were made against Smith. However, last year the Crown Prosecution Service said that under today’s guidelines Smith would have been charged. Mr Danczuk’s call came as victims of the sex-abuse scandal accused the police of ‘abandoning’ them. Despite having the names of 11 suspected child abusers for 18 months, Sir Peter admitted his force had failed to question any of them. Cyril Smith and his friend Harry Wild were among a gang of abusers who for years beat and raped boys at Knowl View, a residential school for vulnerable children. Both were school governors who had a set of keys and they would saunter around  eyeing up young boys and watching them as they showered. Smith and Wild, a 6ft 5in former Territorial Army officer who was a Tory councillor, attacked victims as young as seven. Abuse: Cyril Smith (pictured) and his friend Harry Wild were among a gang of abusers who for years beat and raped boys at Knowl View, a residential school for vulnerable children . The school for those with learning difficulties opened in 1969 and was described as a ‘sweet shop for paedophiles’. But when a whistleblower on the staff of the 50-bed facility in Rochdale raised concerns, he was threatened with the sack. According to Simon Danczuk’s book, head of care Martin Digan became aware of the visits by Smith and Wild, who died in  2001 aged 80. Mr Digan said he complained four times but his concerns were dismissed and he was threatened with the sack. Matters came to a head in 1992 when a ten-year-old boy,  shaking with fright, told Mr Digan he had been sexually assaulted. Visits: According to Simon Danczuk's book, head of care Martin Digan became aware of the visits by Smith and Wild, who died in 2001 aged 80 . The youngster started to describe Wild’s usual attire of a Crombie coat and black  polished boots. Mr Digan called the police, who arrived quickly but failed to take the matter further. In the headmaster’s unlocked office, Mr Digan found and copied a devastating report written by an HIV prevention officer which warned that pupils were at risk of Aids. This meant, Mr Digan said, that the boys had been abused by paedophile gangs. ‘They were like lambs to the slaughter,’ he said.Mr Digan said education and social services chiefs were made aware but ‘the action that was taken was zero’. The HIV report, not naming Smith or Wild, was later published and the scandal forced Knowl View’s closure in 1994. But Mr Digan then received phone calls threatening his children. He is adamant Smith – who had failed in a bid to run the school privately when it was closed by Rochdale Council – was behind it all.","Labour's Simon Danczuk demands full public inquiry into the scandal .

The three-year-old girl from Mississippi who gained national attention last month after her family claimed she was thrown out of KFC because her face scared customers has flown to Florida to meet with one of the doctors offering to help her. Victoria Wilcher captured hearts nationwide despite an independent inquiry finding no evidence to back up the claims made by the girl’s grandmother Kelly Mullins. The Wilcher family continue to stick to their story and last Wednesday they released a statement saying they won’t be accepting KFC's $30,000 donation, but want the money to be given to the foundation of the doctor who agreed to work on Victoria’s facial injuries for free.

More than $100,000 was donated via GoFundMe.com and that money will also go towards Victoria's medical care . It was Peters who reached out to Las Vegas plastic surgeon Dr. Frank Stile, who has offered to perform reconstructive surgery on Victoria’s extensive facial injuries and attach the prosthetic eye. Stile first offered to donate his services pro bono, but the family has now requested that KFC’s $30,000 donation should go direct to his foundation. The restaurant chain had pledged the money to help with Victoria’s medical bills, despite an investigation concluding that there was no proof that any employee had asked her to leave their Jackson restaurant. ‘The family didn't think it was appropriate to accept KFC's donation, but KFC is invited to make a donation to the Frank Stile foundation,’ Bill Kellum said in a statement on Wednesday.

"By . Ian Birrell . Outside the occupied Ukrainian police station, sandbags were being piled for protection as a car slammed to a halt. Out jumped four men, wearing military uniforms and carrying a range of weapons including rifles, pistols and knives. One held a Kalashnikov by the nozzle in each hand. Another had  an assault rifle slung over his shoulder, a pistol in his belt and a radio listening device in his right ear. Ian Birrell interviews a soldier in front of a Ukrainian government building occupied by pro-Russian forces . As the sun bore down on Slavyansk, a small industrial city emerging as a front line in the struggle convulsing this shattered country,  I persuaded this pair to talk. Who were they, I asked? ‘We are in the world army,’ said one, his eyes hidden by sunglasses. Cryptic conversations have been commonplace during this conflict between Moscow and Kiev – but he spoke with a strong Russian accent. Loosening up, he confessed to coming from Sevastopol – the Crimean city that is home to Russia’s Black Sea Fleet and which  was used as a launchpad for the region’s recent annexation. So what did he think would happen here? ‘There will be war,’ he said. ‘The West has invested too much  in Ukraine. Nato will end up fighting us so we must be ready.’ It was a chilling threat – not least since the man identified himself later as a marine officer who had served in Chechnya and a parachutist with more than 1,600 jumps. Hours earlier I heard self-styled separatist leaders in eastern Ukraine insist there were no arms at any seized buildings. Yet I had already watched eight more gunmen enter the station; another six arrived soon after with bed mats. A protestant minister leads prayers to pro-Russian activists who are occupying the Donetsk Regional Administration building in Ukraine . Moscow claims that pro-Russian activists such as this man (pictured) want a referendum on the future of Ukraine . These menacing forces undermine President Vladimir Putin’s claims that Russia is not involved in this insurgency. Yesterday, as they openly patrolled outside Slavyansk, Putin confirmed extra troops had been deployed on the border as a ‘precautionary’ measure. When I said the West did not  want war, the officer in sunglasses pointed out Britain had not wanted bloodshed in Afghanistan either. ‘But look what happened – you ended up fighting there for years.’ He pointed at the glinting golden domes of an Orthodox cathedral nearby when I asked why he would risk his life for this cause. ‘We are fighting for our religion like the Muslims,’ he said. Ukraine is divided not just by language but by two strands of Orthodox religion, with one looking to Kiev and the other to Moscow. Putin is stoking up deep-seated cultural, historic and religious divisions. Officially, there are no Russian forces in this part of the country –the president himself said so last week. But then he also finally ended his charade over the stealth invasion of Crimea, admitting all those silent troops in unmarked uniforms who popped up across the peninsula before annexation were Russian. Ukraine is a deeply divided country with many ethnic Russians who look towards Moscow . For one month, I watched that  slow strangulation of Crimea – and these events in eastern Ukraine seem to bear a startling similarity as separatists occupy key strategic sites, then demand a rapid referendum on ‘independence’. Some soldiers in Slavyansk even banter over being in Crimea. Ironically, both sides of this struggle really want the same thing: an end to the corruption and economic stagnation blighting Ukraine since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Amid the instability stirred up by Moscow’s machinations following the ousting of former president Viktor Yanukovych, the economy has crashed and Ukraine’s currency has lost two-fifths of its value. Some see hope for salvation in the fledgling democracy in Kiev – but others seek the old certainties of their Soviet past. ‘I want to rejoin Russia for a better life with stability and a more competent government,’ said Sergei Melnik, a miner whose salary has fallen 60 per cent. ‘I used to be paid on time but these days I do not know if I will be paid at all.’ Some pro-Russians resent that wealth created by east Ukraine’s mines and steel mills has been frittered away. ‘We give other regions so much money but they just look down at us like we are second-class citizens,’ said Emilia, a young mother volunteering as a medic on the Slavyansk barricades. ‘The truth is we speak Russian, think Russian and even dream in Russian.’ Yet recent surveys found two-thirds of the country’s Russian-speaking population want to remain in united Ukraine, while three-quarters say they do not feel under pressure because of their language. Only 27 per cent favour unity with Russia. ‘I have lived under Moscow before,’ one academic told me. ‘The last thing I want is to do it again and see my freedoms curtailed.’ On Thursday night, the Ukrainians fought back with a rally in a Donetsk park. Politicians promised to ‘eliminate the terrorists’ in their midst as couples danced to folk music. Afterwards, young men told me they were ready to die for their country – yet for all the impassioned bravado, there is naivety about their faith in the future, just as with their counterparts in Crimea. Ukraine is a weak nation run by an inexperienced interim government, with one of the world’s best equipped armies massed on its border. When its decrepit forces fought back last week, six armoured personnel carriers were seized instantly by pro-Russian militia. As the protest finished, news arrived of a deal to ‘de-escalate’ this volatile crisis following talks between Russia, Ukraine, the United States and the European Union in Geneva. But within hours, it seemed to be falling apart. It is feared that the conflict could quickly escalate as a large number of pro-Russian activists, such as these men pictured with black and orange ribbons, are heavily armed . On Friday morning, I passed through more barricades, noticing the usual piles of Molotov cocktails and anti-American posters, to a chaotic press conference in the captured regional government building. First speaker was a bearded man I had seen the previous day direct two busloads of supporters – some stinking of drink – to take over the airport after complaints Russian journalists were being barred entry. Denis Pushilin, chairman of the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic, said they would not leave the building as agreed under the deal until the ‘illegal’ government in Kiev quit. Putin’s popularity has surged during this crisis, despite economic wobbles. This pugnacious president has never hidden his desire to restore Russian hegemony over the former Soviet Union states. In 1999, in his first speech as prime minister, he said Russia was a great power with ‘legitimate zones of interest’ in former Soviet lands. Now we have a new Cold War with the first annexation of territory in Europe since 1945, followed by stirring of revolt in eastern Ukraine. This armoured vehicle patrolling Slovyansk, eastern Ukraine is under the control of pro-Russian activists . Putin has devised a new form of warfare fought with blatant lies, balaclava-clad stooges and a barrage of propaganda. The key question is whether a weak and divided West will prevent this expansionism or just abandon the people of eastern Ukraine as they did in Crimea. And then whether another nation – perhaps even a member of Nato – might be targeted next. ‘This all began when we asked to join Europe,’ said Maxim, a young engineer I met at the Ukrainian rally. ‘In return, Europe talks tough but will do nothing to help at our time of need.’ It was hard to disagree, watching as his homeland slides once again towards Russian subservience.","Pro-Russian forces in Ukraine claim 'there will be war' with the West .

"By . Dan Bloom . This is the part-time snake charmer who catches deadly species every day - despite being allergic to most anti-venoms. Humble taxi driver M.S. Balasubramaniam began catching the animals more than 30 years ago and believes he has now freed more than 40,000 from homes in Mysore city, southern India. The serpent-lover has only been bitten four times, but when he was, doctors discovered their treatments were prompting a severe allergic reaction which could kill him. That means Mr Balasubramaniam's next call-out could be his last - but despite the dangers, he refuses to give up. Scroll down for video . Passion: Humble taxi driver M.S. Balasubramaniam believes he has freed more than 40,000 snakes from homes in Mysore city, southern India - and refuses to quit his vocation despite being allergic to anti-venoms . 'I'll be there in an hour': The snake-catcher multi-tasking as he lures an animal out of a house in his home city . He says he carries out his work out of a love for the animals, which have been displaced by humankind. 'Snakes are not as poisonous as human beings,' he said. 'I do not fear getting bitten - snakes are our friends. 'Snakes . are everywhere here around Mysore. We are the trespassers - we take . away their homes and they have nowhere to go - so I help return them . peacefully to what's left of their habitat.' The snake-catcher believes there around 25 species in Mysore, including several non-venomous or near-harmless species like sand boas, tree snakes and rat snakes. But the city also has several highly dangerous animals. More than half his catches have been cobras, and he has encountered species including the saw-scaled viper - one of south Asia's most dangerous snakes. Safe: Mr Balasubramaniam keeps snakes in specially-adapted jars before releasing them into the wild . 'We are the trespassers,' said the snake-catcher, who had to prevent his son doing the same job. 'We take away their homes and they have nowhere to go, so I help return them peacefully to what's left of their habitat' Experienced: Mr Balasubramaniam has caught snakes for 30 years and has only been bitten four times . The animals often choose to live near human settlements, bury themselves in sand and are quick to bite when they feel threatened. Mr Balasubramaniam rounds up around 10 snakes per day from homes, schools and workplaces around the city. To demonstrate his fearlessness, he even kisses cobras' heads to prove they cannot harm him. His son also began catching snakes until he was discouraged by his father - who carries out his jobs in between ferrying children to school in his taxi. The snake-catcher added: 'I rarely take a day off. On . my busiest days I can attend as many as 20 calls and travel more than . 80km across the city. Character: He is well-known in the city of Mysore and attracts large crowds of onlookers wherever he goes . Records: Mr Balasubramaniam keeps a careful count of the number and species of snakes he catches . 'I rarely take a day off,' he said. 'On my busiest days I attend as many as 20 calls and travel more than 80km' Environmentalist: The snake catcher's cheery slogans on his taxi include 'we are all guests to nature' 'Some . days I may get only one call, others ten, but never a day goes by where I . do not get a call from distressed persons who need help removing a . snake.' And he refuses to charge his clients for removing snakes from their homes, cars, water tanks and workplaces, instead receiving donations of between 10 rupees (10p) and 100 (£1). 'I cannot charge because then people will kill the snake rather than pay,' he said.","M.S. Balasubramaniam catches 10 snakes a day in Mysore, southern India .

"By . Ian Birrell . Sweating in the spring sun, it took Sergei several trips to load all his bags and belongings on to the huge blue and white train. His wife Liubov tried to calm one of their young children who was screaming, while a second child stood watching beside their small dog. Finally, Sergei folded up a pushchair and with a quick glance towards a gang of pro-Russian militia in red armbands, boarded for Kiev. ‘When guns are pointed at you and your family, it does not feel wise to stay,’ said the hotel manager from Sudak, on the Crimean coast. No choice? Crimeans will not have the option to stay with Ukraine in the vote. The referendum asks: do they support joining Russia or do they support Crimea becoming independent from Ukraine? The family is fleeing the region following the Russian invasion and anticipated annexation, fearful of the future and potential for conflict. ‘We are being forced to become Russians,’ said Sergei, 40. ‘I worry for Crimea – there will be nothing here.’ He is not alone. With flights cancelled to everywhere except Moscow, the railway station has seen scores of these sad scenes in recent days as men send their families to safety. On Friday, I found oil company executive Vasyl waving off his wife and two children for the long trip across Ukraine to Lviv. ‘I wish I was not standing here,’ he said. ‘I have lived in Crimea for ten years and we have never had any problems. But now my children are being abused and I don’t like it.’ He spoke in Ukrainian – unusual these days on Simferopol’s streets, since such speakers say they are being threatened. So when would his family be returning? ‘If Crimea goes to Russia they will not come back,’ he said. ‘And I will have to go also.’ Sadly for Vasyl and many like him, the region does seem set to join Russia after a sham referendum set to be held today under the sinister shadow of an invading army. Indeed, even as Vasyl’s family boarded the train, a vast new Russian flag was being unfurled in front of the supposedly independent Crimean parliament ahead of the ballot. Although the voting paper contains two questions, it does not offer Crimeans the option to remain Ukrainian but asks them to choose from one of two other options. Firstly, it asks: ‘Do you support joining Crimea with the Russian Federation as a subject of Russia?’ 'The only people who will bother to vote want to join Russia,' says Ukraine-speaking Crimean man Vasyl . And secondly: ‘Do you support restoration of the 1992 Crimea Constitution, and Crimea’s status as part of Ukraine?’ The wording is clever since the 1992 constitution originally sought by all pro-Russian militants stated that Crimea is independent and not part of Ukraine. A reference to autonomy within Ukraine was inserted later at the behest of Kiev. So supporting option two is actually backing enhanced independence and the puppet government that would ensure this is under Russia. ‘I will not vote – there is no point,’ said Mikhail Melnikov, a 28-year-old charity worker. ‘The only people who will bother are those who want to join Russia.’ Many in the Ukrainian minority that makes up almost a quarter  of Crimea’s population say they will leave. 'If Crimea joins Russia, the only ones who will stay are those without the money to leave' ‘Yesterday, a woman who works for me called and said she could not come to work,’ said Oleg, the owner of a thriving agricultural business. ‘She had left and gone to Donetsk with her two children.’ Now Oleg, who spent three years of his life fighting for the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, says he will follow suit. ‘They have poisoned this place for us,’ he told me, as his two daughters arrived home from school. ‘Of course it would be very difficult to leave because we have a business, money in the bank, a nice home – but we will leave if the Russians take over even if we lose everything.’ Like many in Crimea, he has strong ties of family and friendship that cross borders. ‘But these are not the Russians we love – they are occupants of our country,’ he said. Galina Kiselyova, a 46-year-old paediatrician and mother-of-four, said she knew 15 families planning to leave. She has seen critics of Russia assaulted in the street and has been harassed at home by gangs of youths seeking her teenage daughter, a political activist. ‘I work with 200 children with HIV and it will be very hard to leave them,’ she said. ‘But if Crimea joins Russia, the only ones who will stay are those without the money to leave. Families are fleeing to avoid what they claim will be a form of oppression in Russia-run Crimea . ‘I don’t want to live in Russia but this vote has been decided already. It will ruin Crimea and a lot of my acquaintances are very scared – no one asked our opinion before bringing in these troops.’ Her daughter Valentina, 18, a student doctor who has been attacked at a protest, joined a 500-strong underground self-defence group. Its activities include stockpiling body armour and medical supplies in case of conflict and disseminating anti-Russian leaflets during the night. ‘I am not afraid because I love my country,’ she said. ‘I want to live in Ukraine. But if there is nothing we can do I will leave too.’ Andrey Yegorov was born in the Russian Urals yet joined a pro-Ukrainian demonstration last week. ‘I want Crimea to remain with Ukraine,’ he said. ‘No one is thinking about the repercussions. We are all afraid of war.’ Bizarrely, I have discovered that Moscow is carrying out market research into its incursion – which must surely be a first in the annals of invasion. All sides in Crimea are trying hard to avoid rash actions that could spark bloodshed but many Tartars – a Muslim minority deported by Stalin 70 years ago – are terrified by life under Russia. And the biggest concerns are over the roving bands of samoobrona – pro-Russian militia –  – that sprung up after the invasion. I spoke to the commander of one unit of 15 samoobrona standing outside the Ministry of Finance. A builder by trade, Igor admitted he had received no training and said the force – just three weeks old – was already 2,500-strong in  Simferopol alone. He claimed to be guarding the city against ‘fascists’ and ‘provocateurs’ – and said that they would stay as long as they were needed. ‘Little boys have come up to thank us for keeping them safe,’ he added with a smile. But as he talked, an elderly woman in a woolly hat and stained coat approached us. ‘Who are you protecting us from?’ she asked, ignoring his attempts to push her away. ‘I don’t see any of these provocations you all talk about.’ There are none, of course, but it is almost certainly too late. Vladimir Putin and his stooges are finalising their seizure of Crimea today and there seems little that Ukraine or its Western allies are able or willing to do to stop it.","Cleverly-worded referendum asks to join Russia or become independent .

"By . Dan Bloom . A poignant image of a mother cuddling her three-year-old son with cancer has touched hearts all over the world. Ariane Grabill's husband Zach took the photo of her and little Aiden last year after he had a kidney removed and underwent gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy. But now Aiden has turned five and is free of cancer - while the image of his mother's love has inspired tens of thousands of parents in the same position. A mother's love: This poignant image of Ariane Grabill cuddling her three-year-old son with kidney cancer has gone viral on Facebook, touching hearts all over the world. Aiden is now five, with a clean bill of health . Aiden was diagnosed in March last year with Wilms' tumour, a cancer which develops in a child's kidneys while they are still in the womb. By the time doctors caught the disease, the skinny three-year-old had a tumour weighing 2lbs and had to have his right kidney removed. Then it was up to medics to put him through intensive treatments of chemotherapy and radiotherapy which come with a long list of side effects even for the healthiest adults, let alone children. The treatment ended in October last year and since the Aiden's scans have been clear, to the joy of his parents. He turned five last Wednesday - prompting birthday messages from all over the world - and is due for his next check-up next week. When the treatment was at its most . intense, the family from Midlothian, Virginia, visited Boca Grande in . Florida where the photo was taken. Feeling better: Aiden as he is now, left, and right with his mother Ariane, father Zach and sister Caroline. Mrs Grabill said: 'If you didn't know Aiden had been sick you'd never know it now. He's just a happy five-year-old boy' Accompanied by their daughter Caroline, now nine, Mrs Grabill posed up as Mr Grabill, a 38-year-old attorney, took the now-famous shot. But it stayed confined to their friends and family until they posted it on the Facebook feed of NBC's Today Show as part of a set on '100 happy days'. Mrs Grabill, 36, told MailOnline: 'We . just went on holiday as a family to have a good time in the middle of what we . were going through. 'This has been mostly a positive . experience for me. We've come so far in a year and we can say to these . moms to just take it a day at a time and hang in there for good news' - Ariane Grabill, Aiden's mother . 'I'm . completely overwhelmed by the response. There are lots of moms who've . been in the same situation or are currently in it - that's the most . touching part, knowing how these people feel. 'I know it helped me at the time to know we weren't alone and there is a real community out there. 'This has been mostly a positive experience for me. We've come so far in a year and we can say to these moms to just take it a day at a time and hang in there for good news.' She added: 'If you didn't know Aiden had been sick you'd never know it now looking at him. He's just a happy five-year-old boy. 'He has no idea he's inspired so many people. He doesn't remember a lot which is good for him, but we remember every day.' Along with birthday wishes for Aiden, Facebook was flooded with personal messages from families going through the same experience. Debbie . Rosen Arky from Encino, California, wrote: 'My cousin, Corey is . undergoing brain surgery, as I write this, to remove another tumor. They . said he'd never make it to get married or have kids. 'He's married to a beautiful, very special lady & they have three adorable little girls who love their daddy so much.' Loving: The family as they are now. Aiden had to have a kidney removed, but so far has been recovering well . Another . Facebook user, Heather Wing Stallone, wrote: 'This is my sister and . niece over two years ago. She is now 11 and has been battling . neuroblastoma for 7 years! This was Laura's first visit to the Atlantic . Ocean!' The experience has affected the family deeply, and Mr Grabill is now a board member for the ASK Childhood Cancer Foundation in Richmond, Virginia. Since the photo garnered more than 60,000 'likes' and messages of thanks from far-flung corners of the globe, they have come up with a theory of why it was so popular. 'I think it helps that you can't really see our faces,' said Mrs Grabill. 'So you just look at it and you can see a mother's love - it's not necessarily my love for him. You can project yourself onto that situation and imagine how it would be for you.'","Zach Grabill took photo of his wife and son last year in Boca Grande, Florida .

Court documents say that on the day she disappeared three weeks ago, 20-year-old Erin Corwin had planned to meet with Christopher Brandon Lee to spend a day together on a hunting trip, according to an affidavit obtained by The Desert Sun. The detective's affidavit shows the investigation is focusing on married father-of-one Lee, 24, who may have been the father of Corwin's child. The affidavit also states Lee's wife, Nichole Lee, told a friend police 'would never find the body' and that she scolded her husband for 'not being able to keep his lies . straight when he was interviewed by detectives because he was dumb'. Still missing: Erin Corwin, 20, disappeared on June 28, two weeks after discovering she was pregnant. Married to a Marine, she was allegedly having an affair with a fellow marine who lived on the same military base in Twentynine Palms, California . Arrested but released: Christopher Brandon Lee, 24, a recently discharged marine, was allegedly having an affair with Erin Corwin. He was arrested earlier this month on suspicion of having a 'destructive device' but released two days later. He has reportedly moved to Alaska . Newlyweds: Erin married Marine Cpl. Jonathan Corwin (pictured) two years ago, and they found out Erin was pregnant two weeks before she went missing . Base: The couple live at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms. Christopher Lee also lived at the base. Erin's abandoned car was found outside the site two days after she was reported missing . Lee, who volunteered at a horse ranch . with Corwin, was arrested July 4 on suspicion of possession of a . destructive device. The device turned out to be a potato gun, but Lee was held for two days before being released on bail. Authorities wouldn't say if the two cases are connected. Lee maintains he was not with Corwin on the day she went missing, but confirmed he was hunting in Joshua Tree National Park. He also told police that he had kissed Corwin, but denied having a sexual relationship with her, according to the documents. Corwin was last seen on June 28 bound for Joshua Tree National Park while three months pregnant. Her husband, Marine Cpl. Jonathan Corwin, reported her missing the following day. Two days later, her car was found outside . the gate of the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine . Palms, where the couple and Lee live. Court documents show that Corwin had admitted to a friend she was having an affair with Lee in a series of text messages. Corwin said in the texts she had planned an outing with Lee for the day she disappeared. Lee was arrested earlier this month after a search warrant was served at a home in Yucco Valley. He was then released on bail two days later, the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department said in a statement. Wife: Nichole Lee (pictured), who is married to Christopher Lee, allegedly told a friend that police would 'never find' Corwin's body . Moved: Following his arrest earlier this month, Christopher Lee, 24, reportedly moved to Alaska . Family: Christopher and Nichole Lee have a daughter together . Ranch: Both Corwin and Lee kept horses at the White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch in Yucca Valley . Mystery: Erin Corwin was on her way to . Joshua Tree National Park (pictured) - about five miles from the Marine Corps base - . when she went missing three weeks ago . A day after that, he was honorably discharged after six years in the Marine Corps, the Desert Sun reported. While interviewing Isabella Megli, the owner of White Rock Horse Rescue Ranch, where Corwin and Lee keep horses, authorities learned that Lee's wife had made several comments to her about the investigation. 'Nichole told Isabella that without a body the detectives did not have a case against them and the detectives would never find the body,' the court document's said. Nichole also said investigators had searched her residence but 'missed something' because they didn't go through the garage. However Megli told The Desert Sun that her and Nichole were talking about something else. Megli owns the Yucco Valley home that the police searched. Lee, his wife and their daughter stayed at the home as they prepared to relocate to Alaska. They are believed to have moved last week. The affidavit says a rifle belonging to Lee was retrieved by police from a closet in the back of Megli's residence. Megli said she had no knowledge of the rifle. She added that she never suspected Corwin and Lee of having an affair. The court documents also say police found a single . set of shoe tracks at Corwin's abandoned vehicle at the marine base. The tracks led from . the driver side door of her Toyota and then disappeared next to a set of . tire tracks. The court document states that tracks found at the scene were 'consistent' with the tire tracks left by Lee's Jeep. Sweethearts: The married couple moved in . together for the first time only a few months ago after the husband . returned for serving overses. They have been together since they were teenagers (pictures) Sheriff's spokeswoman Jodi Miller said Lee was arrested as a result of a search warrant in an ongoing investigation, but would not give more details, nor say any more about the destructive device Lee is suspected of possessing. It was not immediately clear whether Lee had hired an attorney, and current contact information in his name could not be found. He was in the Marines for seven years, last serving as a rifleman in the Individual Ready Reserve. A number of people have been interviewed in Corwin's case, Miller said, but no person of interest or suspect has been named. Several law enforcement agencies and hundreds of volunteers searched a broad swath of desert for Corwin, but there have been no reported sightings. The search was significantly scaled back last week, but it continues, officials said. Corwin is still classified as a missing person. Police do not believe she ran away. Both Erin and Jonathan Corwin are from Oak Ridge, Tennessee. They have been together since they were teenagers.","Newly pregnant Erin Corwin, 20, was last seen leaving her home at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat .

"By . Joel Christie . A 22-year-old woman has been sentenced to three years in prison after admitting to her involvement in an upscale Orlando prostitution ring. Jennifer Helen Richmond, who reportedly told investigators she had earned so much cash - $500,000 - she had to find places to hide it, pleaded guilty to racketeering on Friday. Her sentence followed a years-long investigation into escort agencies operating in Central Florida and throughout the East Coast, with serious charges only recently being filed. The ring was allegedly run by Abdullah Hamid under company names such as Platinum Companions and Ashley's Playmates, according to The Orlando Sentinel. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Jennifer Richmond, 22, who told police she averaged $20,00 to $40,000 a month as a high-class escort, has been sentenced to three years in prison . Guilty: Jennifer Richmond admitted to working as an escort and plead guilty to racketeering . However Hamid has not been charged as part of the investigation. Investigators said 15 to 20 women worked for Hamid during the past five to eight years, said Metropolitan Bureau of Investigation Director Larry Zwieg. Advertisements appeared on dozens of adult websites and even Facebook, offering 'high class private incall and outcall service'. One hour with an escort ranged from $300 to $400. A dinner date for up to five hours ranged from $1,500 to $1,800. WFTV reports they would often work out of the Westgate Palace in Orlando, a major family-oriented resorts just down the road from Wet N' Wild. The MBI alleged that Richmond, Hamid and an accomplice, Christina Lynn Davis, had so much money they would hide it in the air vents of their apartment at the Lofts at SoDo in downtown Orlando . They stashed more of it in storage units, it was alleged. Davis, who told agents she made up to $80,000 a month as an escort herself, has not been charged. The 22-year-old said the group would stash cash in the air vents and under carpet at their apartment at the Lofts at SoDo in downtown Orlando . Cashed up: Richmond allegedly told police she would not tell them where she had hid the money she earned . Hiring: This document, which is dated June 4, 2012, is an advertisement for one of the escort agencies looking for women to employ . Her and Hamid have since moved away from the Orlando area. Richmond admitted to police she made $20,000 to $40,000 a month and admitted she hid about $500,000. However most of the money has not been seized. According to the MBI report, an agent who questioned Richmond after she was arrested asked where the money was hidden. 'I won't tell you,' Richmond said. 'I don't have to answer that.'","Jennifer Helen Richmond, 22, of Orlando, pleaded guilty to racketeering Friday .

"By . Joel Christie . A North Carolina woman says she has been receiving threatening calls for the last two years from suspicious people claiming to be debt collectors, telling her she owes money and will face criminal charges if she doesn't pay up. However Frances Marshall, of Davidson County, says she doesn't have any outstanding debts and the callers can't always tell her what the bills are for. At one point the so-called debt collectors, who contact the great grandmother from a Charlotte area code and have cited her social security number, claimed that someone was stationed outside her house. 'I felt very violated,' Marshall told FOX8. Harassed: Frances Marshall, of Davidson County, North Carolina, has been stalked by a seemingly non-existent debt collection agency claiming she owes them money . They said ''If you want to go this far and have your neighbors see you taken out in handcuffs, we'll be happy to do so''.' 'Well that scared the living daylights out of me. 'I'm thinking there goes my house, there goes my husband, my home ... there goes everything. 'They've taken my life away.' The amount of money the collectors claim Marshall owes varies from call to call, she said. The debt collection firm calls itself Forts and Segal, however there is no listing for the agency. When calling back the number that Marshall has been contacted by - 252 495 6601 - it is a voicemail asking for 'an ACF account number', a name and a phone number. The voicemail says a 'representative will return your call within 24 to 48 hours'. Marshall admitted at one point she was going to pay the apparently outstanding bills to make the harassment stop. However it appears that is what the people at the other end of the call want. North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper told FOX8 he received more 1,800 complaints in 2013 filed against debt collectors for such things as threatening calls and other illegal practices. It is illegal to threaten consumers with criminal prosecution. Suspicious: Mark Littrell, owner and president of debt collecting agency Source Receivables Management in Greensboro, says the actions of the so-called debt collection agency are illegal and don't make sense . Cooper said anyone facing this kind of treatment should file a report with the Attorney Generals office. Frances has reported the calls to the Davidson County Sheriffs Office but the calls continued. The office said they have a deputy assigned to investigate the matter. When it comes to owing money, consumer rights are outlined in the The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Under section 806, it is illegal for debt collectors to harass, oppress or abuse anyone when trying to collect a debt. Mark Littrell, owner and president of debt collecting agency Source Receivables Management in Greensboro, believes the threats Marshall has been receiving don't add up. 'I don't know any of the instances where someone actually faces criminal charges for a debt unless it's a court system calling them,' Littrell told FOX8.","Frances Marshall, of Davidson County, North Carolina, has been stalked by a debt collection agency for the last two years .

"By . Joel Christie . and Associated Press Reporter . A Michigan sheriff has taken a swipe at crime dramas such as Netflix smash Orange Is The New Black for making prison uniforms 'cool' and 'trendy', announcing that he has completely overhauled the jumpsuits at his jail as a result. Saginaw County Sheriff William Federspiel believes that standard all-orange jumpsuits have increasingly become seen as fashionable because of pop culture, so he has reverted the inmates at Saginaw County Jail to wearing convict era-style black and white stripes. 'When the lines get blurred between the culture outside the jail and the culture within the jail, I have to do something to redefine those boundaries, because they've been blurred far too often in public culture,' Federspiel told Signaw County News. Scroll down for video . New look: Siginaw County Jail in Michigan - which houses 513 inmates - is introducing new black-and-white-striped uniforms because shows such as Orange Is The New Black made orange - the standard prison uniform color - 'fashionable' Inspiring change: The popularity of Orange Is The New Black starring Taylor Schilling (pictured) has been blamed for 'blurring the lines between the culture outside jail and the culture inside jail' Fashion crisis: The Siginaw County Jail, which houses 513 inmates, is changing its uniforms from orange to black-and-white-stripes because shows like Orange Is The New Black have made orange trendy . 'It's because as you see shows on . television, like Orange Is The New Black, some people think it's cool to . look like an inmate of the Saginaw County Jail with wearing all orange . jumpsuits out at the mall or in public. 'We decided that the black-and-white stripes would be the best way to go because it signifies 'jail inmate,' and I don't see people out there wanting to wear black-and-white stripes.' Saginaw County Sheriff William Federspiel wants the uniforms to signify 'jail' and not 'cool' Federspiel believes that the Netflix series starring Taylor Schilling - which was recently nominated for four Emmy Awards - is so in vogue that regular people are wearing orange jumpsuits out in public. He says inmates sometimes do community work, and he doesn't want there to be any confusion. The jailhouse fashions come relatively cheap. The sheriff says the new monochrome jumpsuits, which last for about two to three years, cost $11.73 apiece. Siginaw County Jail houses about 513 inmates on a daily basis. Siginaw is the third most violent city per capita in the United States, according to 2012 crime statistics compiled by the FBI. The city was places  behind Flint and Camden, N.J. for the number of violent crimes recorded per capita in cities of 50,000 people or more. It is located about 100 miles north-west of Detroit. Federspiel hopes all prisoners will be in their new uniform by the end of the year. But the inmates are not happy about the change. 'They don't like it,' Federspiel told The Siginaw County News. 'They've been very verbal. A lot of them have said, ''We don't like wearing black-and-white stripes''. And my response is, ''Too bad. Don't come to jail''. 'If you come to dinner at my house and you don't like what I'm serving, don't come back ... I didn't ask you to come wear this uniform. 'It tells me something, though, when the inmates think that it's bad: It's probably good. ' 'We don't want them getting too comfortable, feeling like they're productive members of society, when actually they're incarcerated.' Orange Is The New Black, from Weeds creator Jenji Kohan, was turned down by almost all major American TV networks before Netflix picked it up. Using an experimental format of releasing the entire first season all at once, it unexpectedly went on to become one of the biggest shows of 2013, only increasing its audience with the debut of its second season in June. The third season is currently being filmed and is slated for a summer 2015 release. Orange Is The New Black - starring Laura Prepon (left) and Taylor Schilling (right) - was recently nominated for four Emmy Awards . Orange is the New Black received a total of four Emmy Award nominations for 2014, including star Taylor Schilling('Piper Chapman'), who is up for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy. It is also nominated for Outstanding Comedy and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy (Kate Mulgrew ('Red'). Three of the supporting stars are up for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy, including Natasha Lyonne ('Nicky'), Uzo Aduba ('Crazy Eyes') and Laverne Cox ('Sophia').","Siginaw County Jail is changing inmates' uniforms from orange to black and white .

In an unprecedented move, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club have extended Tom Watson’s Open exemption for one more year to enable him to bow out at St Andrews in 2015. Given this will also be the 40th anniversary of the first of his five victories, at Carnoustie in 1975, it’s hard to imagine anyone will think the R&A have called this one wrong. ‘If I have to crawl, I’ll be there,’ said the 64-year-old, who will make his 36th appearance at the Open at Royal Liverpool in a fortnight’s time. ‘I feel very proud and honoured to be given the opportunity to play at St Andrews once again.’ Veteran: Ancient Golf Club have extended Tom Watson's Open exemption for one more year . Still going: Watson will make his 36th appearance at the Open at Royal Liverpool . Watson will be wearing two hats, of course, when he turns up at Hoylake, given he is also America’s Ryder Cup captain. To that end, he could hardly keep the excitement out of his voice when asked about Tiger Woods’s imminent return to major championship action. ‘It is great to see him back and I just hope he is able to play free from pain,’ he said. But he did insert a caveat when it came to a possible appearance at Gleneagles in September. ‘I want him on the team if he is healthy and playing well,’ he added. The announcement of Watson’s invite came on the same day as almost 300 golfers competing at four great courses went after the 12 precious spots up for grabs for this year’s championship at final qualifying. They included Matt Fitzpatrick, who gave up the spot he earned as US Amateur Champion when he turned professional a fortnight ago. The 19-year-old never really recovered from a poor finish to his first round and has one last chance to make it at the French Open this week, where three spots are available to the highest-placed finishers not already qualified. Ireland’s promising amateur Paul Dunne, 21, posted an impressive 36-hole total of 10 under par to book his place.

"By . Joel Christie . A BASE jumper in Oregon has fallen to his death after taking a solo leap from a 1,000-foot high tower . Zachary Sommer, 38, of Portland, told friends he was going for a jump on Wednesday evening, but never called back. They worriedly called police on Thursday about 7am and gave them the location of the tower near Silverton, according to KPTV. Officers from Marion County arrived at the scene and discovered Sommer's body. Tragic: Zachary Sommer, 38, was BASE jumping from an aerial tower in Silverton, Oregon, on Wednesday night when he fell to his death . One of the responding officers, sheriff's depty Steve Cooper, who is an experienced base jumper, believes Sommer grabbed a lanyard as well as the handle to deploy his pilot parachute. He believes this stopped the parachute from fully deploying. '(The lanyard) was coming out from under his jacket, and it's very possible when he grabbed his pilot chute, he also grabbed that,' Cooper said. 'And that would certainly interfere with doing a proper pull.' 'It's sad and I know what the community will be going through,' Cooper added. 'They're missing a friend.' Scene: The aerial tower is on private property in Silverton, Oregon, just east of Salem . The tower is about 1,000 feet high. Police do not want to disclose the actual location to stop any future BASE jumpers using the tower as a platform. BASE jumping is not illegal in Oregon. However the tower was on property private, so Sommer was trespassing.","Zachary Sommer, 38, of Portland, believed to have fallen to his death some time on Wednesday night .

"By . Joel Christie . An anaconda is on the loose in New Jersey's biggest freshwater lake - and a reptile specialist says he was 'sworn to keep his mouth shut by local officials' for one week while he searches for it. The snake - estimated to be about 15 or 16 feet in length - has been known to locals and boats around Lake Hopatcong for the last few weeks, however it was reported to be a boa constrictor. But now Gerald Andrejcak, one of the men tasked with trying to capture the animal - the world's heaviest and one of the world's longest snakes - says he was 'sworn to secrecy' about revealing that it was a green anaconda. 'I've known its species (since last week), but I was sworn to keep my mouth shut by local officials to avoid causing a panic,' he told NJ.com. On the loose: A green anaconda, estimated to be between 15 and 16 feet long, has been sighted numerous times in Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey . On the prowl: Reptile specialist Gerald Andrejcak took it upon himself to search for the snake after seeing the media reports, and later identified it as a green anaconda . Lake Hopatcong is New Jersey's largest body of freshwater/ It is 30 miles from Delaware River, 40 miles from New York City and located within both Sussex and Morris counties . 'Now that there's a panic, I'm going on the record.' Andrejcak said he saw the snake in a boat house attached to a property on South New Avenue on Thursday. However the snake quickly entered the water and evaded its captors. Andrejcak, Jefferson Township animal control officer Naomi Modafferi and Steve Vil, Andrejcak's assistant, searched boat houses, a storm drain and other areas of the shoreline. Andrejcak, who has a degree in zoology and more than 20 years experience handling and breeding large snakes, said he began following the snake sightings via news reports and Facebook last week. After seeing it, he informed Hopatcong animal control officer Dale Sloat that he believed it was a green anaconda, contrary to the reports of a boa constrictor. Sloat then asked him not to disclose the species or to tell anyone, Andrejcak said. Sloat had already been interviewed by local media, warning people not to approach or touch the snake if they see it. 'This big a snake would be aggressive,' he told CBS. The news caused great distress to locals. 'There's kids swimming in the lake, there's going to be people in the water this weekend, and my kids can't go in their backyard,' Tony Colantonio, who rents a property on the lake and says he has seen it, told NJ.com. Lake Hopatcong is a popular swimming, boating and fishing destination, so the news of an anaconda has worried locals . 'It's a green anaconda, a predator, hunting all day every day.' 'It's not a python that lives 80 percent of its life on land and only needs to eat once a month. 'It's one of the most aggressive snakes out there. 'It's been two weeks and (the township and state) have done nothing. 'Everybody I call just blows me off.' Green anacondas are not venomous. Sloat has also expressed scepticism about the snake. 'No officials have seen this snake, and you know how people exaggerate,' he told the site. Andrejcak said he asked Sloat to use trash cans as traps for the snake before he came up to search for the snake on Thursday. But when Andrejak arrived on Thursday, the cans hadn't been purchased. Reptile specialist Gerald Andrejcak says he is surprised at the way local authorities have handled the situation . While Andrejcak's main fear is that harm will come to the snake, the feeling is not mutual among locals. 'If someone can kill it and get out of here that's fine,' Colantonio said. 'I want proof that it's gone.' Green anacondas can grow to be more than 29 feet in length and weigh more than 550 pounds, according to an animal fact sheet on NationalGeographic.com. They typically live in swamps, marshes and slow-moving streams, mainly in South America. Andrejcak believes the snake was a pet that was dumped in or near Lake when it became too big to care for.","Snake first sighted on Lake Hopatcong few weeks but identified as a boa constrictor .

"By . Joel Christie . Some 22 people were shot over a 12 hour period in Chicago on Friday night, among them an 11-year-old who was killed by a stray bullet. Shamiya Adams was making smores at a sleepover in Garfield Park - part of the city's troubled West Side neighborhood - about 9.30pm when she was shot in the head. The bullet is believed to have come through the bedroom window of the first floor apartment where she was staying in the 3900 block of West Gladys Avenue. Adams was rushed to Mount Sinair Hospital in a critical condition. Her family staged a vigil by her bed throughout the night, but she was pronounced dead early Saturday, according to The Chicago Tribune. Scene: The shooting occurred here, at the 3900 block of West Gladys Avenue in the Garfield Park  neighborhood of Chicago. There were 22 shootings in the West Side area on Friday night . 'We do need these individuals (responsible) and we need them in custody as soon as possible,' community activist Andrew Holmes said. Earlier, a 12-year-old girl was among three shot in the same neighborhood around 3.30 pm, police said, according to NBC. However that girl survived. The shooting happened in the 700 block of North Ridgeway Avenue. The girl, along with a 33-year-old woman and a 44-year-old man, were shot when someone approached them on foot and opened fire. The woman was shot in the face. The girl and the woman were taken in stable condition to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County. The man suffered a graze wound to the calf and was treated at the scene, police said.

"By . Derek Lawrenson . When Canada’s Graham DeLaet returned to tour life three months after surgery for a herniated disc, he lasted two tournaments and wasn’t seen again until the following year. So the understandable exuberance that greeted the stunning announcement last Friday of Tiger Woods’s return from a similar operation, at his own tournament in Washington this week, needs to be tempered with a degree of caution. Yes, it all looks promising for the 38-year-old to be at The Open at Hoylake next month, where he won in such emotional circumstances in 2006, his first victory following the death of father Earl. But, as DeLaet discovered, there’s a world of difference between the driving range and playing competitively. Eyes on the prize: Tiger Woods tasted glory at Hoylake in 2006 . VIDEO Woods annouces return from injury . Trophy boy: Woods was victorious in Liverpool eight years ago . Taking soundings at the US Open two weeks ago from American reporters who spend their lives writing about Woods, the most optimistic projection for his return was the Bridgestone Invitational, staged in August before the season’s final major, the USPGA Championship. One close to Woods’ caddie, Joey LaCava, thought we wouldn’t see him again until December.Which just goes to show that, five years after hydrant-gate, even a backstage pass at the Woods travelling circus still offers little insight into what really goes on in the life of the headline act. Less than a month ago Woods said the recovery process following surgery in March was so slow he wasn’t able to throw a ball with his kids yet. Now he’s teeing it up on the PGA Tour. Is he rushing his return in the hope the entire summer will not prove a washout? He certainly had good cause to compete at the Quicken Loans National tournament this week, since the sponsor is one of the principal benefactors of the Tiger Woods Foundation. Woods will give a press conference today in which he will explain his astonishing recovery. And then it will be fingers crossed for when he goes out to play. Yes, The Open would go on merrily without him at Royal Liverpool. But what a huge shot in the arm it would be to see him back at the venue where, in 2006, he gave perhaps the most brilliant example of course management we have seen in recent times. If ever an event summed up a sport’s astonishing transformation, it was the women’s US Open at Pinehurst last week. Women’s golf was supposed to be beyond the point of no return, dominated by players from the Far East high on quality but low on charisma. Now its higher echelons are dominated by a quorum who look great and play even better. In the final round on Sunday you had world No 1 Stacy Lewis — who spent seven years of her life wearing a back brace to correct curvature of the spine — posting a 66 to set a target for the long-limbed beauty Michelle Wie. Young gun: Michelle Wie hugs the championship trophy . ‘I don’t know what just happened. Birdie the last seven holes? Even saying it sounds crazy.’ No wonder American Kevin Streelman was in shock. Trailing by seven shots, he one-putted each of his last 10 holes and birdied the last seven for a back nine of 28 to win the Travelers Championship in Connecticut by a shot from - it would have to be him, wouldn’t it? - the luckless Sergio Garcia and Korea’s KJ Choi. How many times have we detailed Wie’s struggles over the years to fulfil her unquestioned talent? This time last year she was an object of ridicule for an outrageous putting style, with her back so parallel to the ground you could serve supper off it. No wonder the Twitter-sphere exploded with joy when she shrugged off a double bogey at the 16th to birdie the 17th and win her first major at the age of 24 by two  shots. On those upturned saucer greens, she didn’t have a  three-putt all week. And then there was the lass in third place playing, would you believe, her first event as a pro. Step forward 22-year-old Stephanie Meadow from Royal Portrush in Northern Ireland. Rising star: Northern Ireland's Stephanie Meadow finished third . At the 18th hole, she knocked in one more birdie putt from 15 feet to claim a cheque for £170,000 and earn her card for the LPGA Tour in one fell swoop. What price Northern Ireland having the world No 1 in men’s and women’s golf over the next couple of years? And who’s Meadow going to play for in the Olympics — that will be the next question. Rio 2016 is going to do fabulous things for women’s golf and Britain and Ireland, with the likes of Meadow and Charley Hull right at the forefront. The next stop for all these players is the Ricoh British Open at England’s best course, Royal Birkdale, in a fortnight. Let’s hope the summer weather holds.","Woods had back surgery on March 31 and has been sidelined since .

"By . Derek Lawrenson . Given it’s only 18 months since Rory McIlroy declared unequivocally to this newspaper he felt ‘more British than Irish,’ there are passionate supporters of Team GB’s Olympic team who could be forgiven for feeling a bit like Caroline Wozniacki this morning. If truth be told, this latest U-turn from the 25-year-old is a bit less shocking than that one at Wentworth last month detailing his split with fiancee Wozniacki. Everything changed for McIlroy in the aftermath of our story about his feelings of ‘Britishness’. It caused such a commotion I sought him out the following week to make sure he had no problems with the piece. Sifting through the furore, McIlroy made it clear he was not bothered about the nutters filling the airwaves and newspaper columns with screeds of bigotry. What did cause angst — and make him think — were the thousands of decent Irish people who were genuinely hurt that someone who had grown up playing for Ireland could now contemplate deserting them on the biggest team stage of all. Going green: Rory McIlroy has chosen to play for Ireland instead of Great Britain at the 2016 Olympic Games . Patriot games: Rory McIlroy in action at the Pro-Am event ahead of the Irish Open at Fota Island resort . VIDEO Irish Open - Round 1 Highlights . Since then, McIlroy has tried to make amends. He has committed early to the Irish Open each year. When he missed the halfway cut last year, he stayed around, signing autographs and chatting with the locals. Now comes the most spectacular act of atonement of all. It could certainly be argued that playing for Ireland represents the path of least resistance. If he had represented Team GB in Rio, for instance, his reputation would never have recovered in the Republic. No doubt there are plenty on one side of the divide in Northern Ireland who will be feeling sore. But most people in Britain, including me, will echo the thoughts of Team GB’s golf coach Jamie Spence in recognising the difficult position McIlroy was in, respect his decision and wish him well for Rio. Best wishes: Team GB coach Jamie Spence has respected Rory McIlroy's decision to play for Irealnd . As Spence says, the worst of all worlds would have been if McIlroy had elected to sit on the sidelines.Fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell, who will also play for Ireland, put forward a persuasive explanation as to why they should wear green. ‘If you want to get religious or political about it you’re going to upset people but, to me, golf is an all-Ireland sport,’ he said. ‘I grew up wanting to wear the green blazer with a shamrock on it, so it makes sense that the best players, whether they be from north or south of the border, should want to represent Ireland in the Olympic Games.’ McIlroy certainly picked a great time to announce it, with the Irish Open about to begin and some sporting event going on in Rio you might have heard about. It must be a huge relief as well, for the longer it went on without a decision, the more the speculation would have grown. Shamrock style: Grame McDowell has put forward a persuasive argument for wanting to represent Ireland . For the Irish, of course, it’s a massive coup. Trying to predict the golfing landscape is difficult enough next month, let alone in two years, but it will be surprising if McIlroy is not favourite to claim the gold medal when the sport  re-enters the Olympic fold for the first time since 1904. He will be, by a considerable distance, the most feted sportsman in the Irish team and will be invited to carry the flag into the stadium at the opening ceremony. The format will be a 72-hole event featuring 60 players with qualification based on world ranking. Two players will represent each nation but up to four are allowed if they are all in the world’s top 15. Two men who might greet this turn of events with a rueful smile are Dubliners Padraig Harrington and Shane Lowry. Unless they overtake the two Macs in the world ranking or climb into the top 15, they will miss the party. Brit of alright: Based on current rankings, Team GB would feature Justin Rose (L) and Luke Donald (R) Conversely, British players such as Luke Donald, Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood, Jamie Donaldson and Stephen Gallacher now have a better chance of qualifying for the Olympics. Based on the present world rankings, Team GB would have been McIlroy and Justin Rose. Now it would be Rose and Donald, with the aforementioned quartet in hot pursuit of a place. Clearly they will not be too upset to learn McIlroy is now more Irish than British.

"By . Matt Blake . Apple's founder Steve Jobs wanted to wage a 'Holy War' against Google a year before he died, a top-secret email has revealed. The tech visionary sent the email in 2010 to his top 100 most senior executives, in which he outlined the company's strategy for the following year. About half-way down the email - headed by the words 'FYI - DO NOT FORWARD' - he suggests launching a 'Holy War with Google', bidding his underlings to suggest 'all the ways we will compete with them'. Scroll down for full email . 'Holy War': The tech visionary sent the email in 2010 to his top 100 most senior executives, in which he outlined the company's strategy for the following year . Also in the email, Jobs heralded the 'end of the PC-era' and promised to 'further lock customers into our ecosystem, warning that Apple was 'in danger of hanging on to old paradigm too long.' It also mentions the future of Apple TV, including a strategy to 'stay in the living room game and make a great 'must have' accessory for iOS devices,' with content from NBC, CBS, Viacom and HBO, as well as a possible TV-subscription service. He wrote the email at a time when Apple's fears were growing over Google, once a key Apple partner with the iPhone, making global waves with its Android technology. By licensing Android for free, Google developed software for most of Apple’s main smartphone and tablet manufacturing rivals. He also told execs the company 'needed to catch up to Android where we are behind,' referring to 'notifications, tethering and speech' as three areas, while . writing that Apple could overtake Android with features like Siri. He added: 'Google and Microsoft are further along on the technology, but haven't quite figured it out.' The email came to light as part of Apple’s lawsuit against Samsung over smartphone patents. Tough competition: Towards the end of the email - headed by the words 'FYI - DO NOT FORWARD' - he suggests launching a 'Holy War with Google', bidding his underlings to suggest 'all the ways we will compete with them' Apple is demanding $2billion in damages from Samsung, accusing the Korean technology giant of violating a batch of patents through its smartphones, including the rights to search technology that is part of the iPhone Siri voice feature. Jobs was famed for his ruthless approach to business development and competition. Last week another email revealed how Jobs reacted to news that he had got a Google . employee sacked with a simple 'smiley face'. He had taken issue with an attempt by the web giant to poach one of his engineers, apparently in violation of an alleged anti-competition agreement by the firms not to hire each other's staff.

The most encouraging aspect of England’s first netball victory of this Commonwealth Games was not the way they outwitted, outscored and outlasted a lacklustre Wales team. Or the individual honours for Sara Bayman, earning her 50th cap, and 19-year-old Helen Housby scoring five times on her England debut.

England have taken bronze three times. ‘At Delhi four years ago we were ecstatic with bronze,’ said captain Jade Clarke. In Glasgow, simply being on the podium will not suffice.

"By . Lawrence Booth . Follow @@the_topspin . The night before the 2008-09 Ranji Trophy final at Hyderabad, the 18-year-old Bhuvneshwar Kumar was nervously preparing to bowl to Sachin Tendulkar. ‘Is Tendulkar going to take your life?’ asked his coach, trying to gee him up. ‘In the worst scenario you will get hit for six sixes.’ Next day Kumar inflicted on India’s demigod a scratchy 15-ball duck – Tendulkar’s first in two decades in the domestic game. He finished the innings with five wickets, then made 41 and 80. Perhaps the only surprise about his all-round excellence at Trent Bridge and Lord’s is that it should even count as a surprise at all. Pitching it just right: Bhuvneshwar Kumar has shown the England bowlers how to use English conditions . The second Test is not yet over, but . already he has helped himself to three half-centuries from No 9 and a . pair of five-fors. Previously only Richard Hadlee and Ian Botham had . scored fifty and taken five-wicket hauls in successive Tests. In his . first Test series overseas Bhuvneshwar is rubbing statistical shoulders . with giants. Another 50: Kumar acknowledges his third half century of the Test series at Lord's . The Indian dressing-room were quietly . fuming when Jimmy Anderson beat him to the man of the match award in . Nottingham, but he is doing his best to make an unanswerable case here. In England’s first innings he showed the home side how to exploit English conditions, pitching the ball up with just enough swing and seam movement to make driving a hazardous business. On Sunday, he arrived at the crease with the Test – and possibly the series – in the balance. India had just lost their seventh wicket and led by only 211. Had Joe Root accepted a sharp but catchable head-high chance at third slip when Bhuvneshwar was on two, England would have been favourites. Instead, he did what proper batsmen do: in the company of the lively Ravindra Jadeja, he made the opposition regret their error. By the time he was last out, poking Ben Stokes to second slip, Bhuvneshwar’s tally in this series had reached 209 runs and 11 wickets. On Friday night he had raised a few eyebrows when he admitted his hero was another seam-bowling Kumar – Praveen, who enjoyed success here on India’s tour in 2011. Both men hail from Meerut, a small town in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh known for its production of cricket balls and scissors. It may be time another claim to fame was added to the list.","Kumar has three fifties and two five-fors in first two Tests .

He refused to leave the field, however, and Dinamo proceeded to bring on another player to even up the numbers without the referee noticing. Number 35 played for several minutes before the officials noticed and asked him to leave the field of play. Amazingly, before kick-off the tie was switched from Leigh Harriers' athletics ground after shot put damage forced the pitch to be deemed unplayable.

"By . Anna Wharton . Whenever my step-father had a tipple when I was a teenager, he’d start off in a great mood, reeling off his extensive repertoire of silly jokes and making everyone laugh. But inevitably, after the second or third glass, he would turn to the same old subject: death. More specifically, his death. David’s monologue soon became familiar; how he never wanted to get old, that he wouldn’t be able to stand being diagnosed with a terminal illness — and abhorred the thought of being wheelchair-bound. Always the joker: Anna Wharton with her fun-loving stepfather David . My younger brother Adrian and I would roll our eyes. Our mother Marion would tease him that he wasn’t going anywhere. But these conversations turned out to be more poignant than any of us realised back then. Because, years later, the three of us found ourselves sitting at David’s bedside as he lay unconscious, wired up to a ventilator — a machine pumping every breath into him — and we had to decide whether to turn it off. And with heavy hearts, we did. Controversial though it might sound, it is my belief that we granted him the greatest gift of all. We did what he would have wanted, rather than cling on to him simply because we were too heartbroken to say goodbye. So, until I know that Formula One legend Michael Schumacher faces a good quality of life, I can’t rejoice in the news that he is now out of a coma. Racing legend: A skiiing accident left Formula One driver Michael Schumacher in a coma . Last week, the former racing ace was transferred from Grenoble University hospital to a rehabilitation clinic in the Swiss city of Lausanne. For almost six months he’d been kept in an artificially induced coma following his skiing accident in France last December. Although he is said to have nodded to an ambulance crew, and has apparently kept his eyes open for extended periods, there is no indication if the fast-living Schumacher, loved by his family, friends and fans, will return to his old self. Of course, I don’t know if his family have faced the terrible decision of whether to turn off his life-support system. But with his wife Corinna reported to be at his bedside permanently since the accident, it’s obvious they’ve been determinedly clinging on to hope. However, I believe hope can lead us down the wrong path. Sometimes it exists only in our hearts, rather than our heads. And it’s in those traumatic times, faced with losing those closest to us, and when their lives are in our hands, that we need to take decisions based not on emotion but on cold, hard facts. To that end I believe that sometimes, if you love someone, you’ve got to let them go. That’s what I and my family did, and there’s not been a day since that I’ve regretted it. My stepfather came into my life when I was just five, after my parents’ marriage broke up. It was the early Eighties and he quickly worked out that the way to my heart was through endless toys and gifts, whether it was the latest Sindy or Pac-Man game. He would spend hours painstakingly perfecting my school projects with me, we’d fake wrestle on the living-room floor on Saturday afternoons while Big Daddy did the real thing on TV, and he’d embarrass me by shouting my nickname ‘Roo Roo’ across the school playground. Fond memories: When David came into Anna's life, aged five, he quickly won her heart . Even in my 30s — I’m now 37 — I’d find a fake plastic lizard or some such silly thing in my handbag after returning to his and my mother’s Peterborough home for the weekend. His idea of a little joke. David was ‘Dad’ to me. That’s why I chose him to give me away when I got married, despite my biological dad still being alive. ‘A real dad is the one who is there for you day after day after day,’ I texted to David on the last ever Father’s Day we spent together. He was always fit and healthy — a passionate advocate of fruit and veg — and he cycled to and from work every day.  He retired from his factory supervisor role in 2009 and he did slow down, a little. But it was highly unusual for him to not be able to shift a cough and virus that struck him down in March 2010. A couple of days later — on a Monday morning — I got a call from my brother to say David had collapsed at home and an ambulance had taken him to hospital. Loving family: David and Anna's mother Marion renewing their wedding vows a year before David died, with Anna (right) and her brother Adrian (left) I raced out of my London magazine office and got a train to Peterborough while my brother did the same from Brighton. When I arrived at A&E, my devastated mother said that David had suffered two cardiac arrests and was in an induced coma while machines kept him alive. Doctors never found an answer to why his body had failed him so catastrophically. His heart — in fact, all of his organs — were giving up on him, and he was only 63. The cramped waiting room for the intensive-care unit, with its endless cups of tea and hushed voices, was our home for the next three days. On the first day, I was too upset to sit by David’s bedside, but the following day, when doctors decided to bring him round, my brother and I waited patiently next to him for some sign of life. Sometimes his fingers might twitch and we’d jump out of our skin, but mostly he was completely unresponsive. It was terrifying and bewildering. A real Dad: Despite her biological father still being alive, Anna chose David (pictured) to give her away at her wedding . First we were told to prepare ourselves for the worst, that each organ was closing down. Then there seemed to be good news — he was attempting to open his eyes. Yet this frightened me, too. Because none of us knew if he would still be the David we all loved. There was a strong possibility he’d suffered irreparable brain damage. My worst fear was that he’d be trapped in a vegetative state. I remembered all of his monologues about death that we’d sat through, and I knew that unless we could guarantee he’d leave hospital as the man we’d known — independent and able-bodied — he wouldn’t want to leave at all. And so, after consulting with my mother and brother, I told the doctors just that. I also asked if they were attaching some emotional significance to someone ‘attempting’ to open their eyes and whether it was medically any more significant than, say, a slight increase in kidney function. While any decision was ultimately for the doctors and my mum to take, I felt the weight of responsibility for David’s life in my hands. Surely we had to put our emotions aside and do what was right for him? Ultimate act of love: Anna still believes that letting David go was the right thing . Another day went by and there were no other signs of life. The medical evidence suggested his organs were closing down. So the three of us made the decision to let him go. The risks of him coming back with severe brain damage were too huge, his future too uncertain and, more than anything, I knew he’d never forgive us for making him stay against his wishes. The doctors found it hard to accept our decision. That’s understandable, as they’d worked tirelessly to save him. But they also admitted that many families begged them to do whatever they could and then regretted it six months or a year down the line when their loved one had no quality of life. One doctor eventually told us we were doing the right thing — it was devastatingly sad but true. So we said our goodbyes, and I watched my mum kiss her husband of 30 years for the last time. We didn’t stay with David as he took his last breath — it would have been too traumatic. I just pleaded with the doctors to make sure he wouldn’t be in any pain. We drove home, mute with shock.Then, half an hour after we’d arrived, we got the call to say he’d passed away. The fact he had gone so quickly was proof again to me that we’d done the right thing. We did what David would have wanted. Please don’t think I’m judging the Schumachers if they want to try anything — and everything — to hold on to Michael. He isn’t, after all, a 63-year-old man who’s been determined never to make old bones. At 45, there’s the possibility of many years ahead. It may still be that he’ll make a miraculous recovery, though most doctors agree the chances are slim.Dr Gary Hartstein, a former F1 doctor, wrote on his blog this month: ‘I fear there will be no more good news.’ And, having been in a similar situation, I fear the same. I never imagined as I skipped beside David when I was five that his life would one day be in our hands. But, in the end, I believe letting him go was the ultimate act of love.","Anna's stepfather David always said he never wanted to get old and couldn't stand the idea of being terminally ill or wheel-chair bound .

He was barely a metre away,' she told the ABC. 'He was very white. Suddenly he just collapsed on the ground, rolled on his side and stopped moving.

"By . Ryan Lipman For Daily Mail Australia . and Emily Crane . A dairy farmer who is suspected of shooting dead his partner and then turning the gun on himself had earlier shot his ex-wife and her husband in front of six children in rural Victoria. The bodies of Greg Murray, 43, and a 41-year-old woman, believed to be his girlfriend, were found by police at their Murrabit West property, 300km north of Melbourne, about 4.30am on Sunday while they were investigating an earlier shooting. Police allege Murray had visited his ex-wife's house, who he separated from five years ago, in nearby Kerang on Saturday night armed with a gun and shot her in the neck and hand. Scroll down for video . Police allege Greg Murray had visited his ex-wife's house (pictured) in nearby Kerang on Saturday night armed with a shotgun . Murray allegedly shot his ex-wife in the neck and hand and her new husband in the shoulder. Both were treated in hospital following the attack . They say six children between three and 14 years were inside when Murray allegedly burst in at 11.30pm. Three were his children, two were his ex-wife's new husband's and one was a friend just having a sleepover, the Herald Sun reports. The ex-wife, 42, was flown to Melbourne hospital to be treated. Her husband, 47, was shot in the shoulder when he and a neighbour tried to intervene and wrestle the gun away from Murray. He was treated at a local hospital. Murray, who was the eldest of give children from a prominent local farming family, had reportedly been battling with his ex-wife to be allowed to see their children. 'He came to work very depressed one day because it had been difficult for him to see his kids,' a friend told the Age. 'Obviously he's kept getting denied, denied and denied and he's just snapped. 'He's a good kid from a good family and it's just a bloody tragedy.' The bodies of Murray and a 41-year-old woman, believed to be his girlfriend, were found by police at their about 4.30am on Sunday while they were investigating the earlier shooting . The dairy farmer fled his ex-wife's home in a blue utility after the shooting rampage and took another gun to his property 30km away . The dairy farmer fled his ex-wife's home in a blue utility after the shooting rampage and took another gun to his property 30km away . Murray had no criminal record, no intervention order against him and didn't have a gun license, according to Inspector Jamie Templeton. 'There was nothing to give us any indication. There was no history or signs of violence,' Insp Templeton said. 'We couldn't possibly see anything coming. This is a horrific crime, and traumatic for all involved. It’s a terrible set of circumstances.' The dairy farmer fled his ex-wife's home in a blue utility after the shooting rampage and took another gun to his property 30km away. Detectives found Murray's vehicle about a kilometre away from his property. They found his partner dead inside the house and Murray's body inside another car parked under the carport. Both had suffered gun wounds but it is unclear whether Murray had killed his partner before heading to his ex-wife's home the night before. Detectives found Murray's vehicle about a kilometre away from his property . Insp Templeton called the shootings 'extremely nasty' for everyone involved, particularly the children. 'The children were actually in the lounge room and heard a knock at the door, woke up the adults in the house and the husband went to the door... and saw the shotgun straight away,' he told the ABC. 'There's a number of people that are affected and it's a horrific crime scene and all the emergency services and other people involved, and of course families and friends and associates, there'll certainly be some ongoing support and welfare applied there.' Police confirmed the family had no history of violence and are investigating if the guns came from a family friend who did not know they had been taken as the gunman did not have a gun license. Investigators are not looking for any other person in relation to the incidents.","Bodies of Greg Murray and a woman, 41, were found at a property 300km north of Melbourne on Sunday morning .

"By . Natalie Clarke . Ordinarily, the Rev Paul Flowers would have presided over the 10.30am service yesterday at Wibsey Methodist Church. The . gathering at the modern pebble-dashed church outside Bradford, West . Yorkshire, lasts an hour and is followed by tea and biscuits. But . having been caught buying and using illegal drugs including crystal . meth, crack cocaine and ketamine, it would hardly have seemed . appropriate to take the pulpit. Paul Flowers is being investigated by the police after being caught on film apparently buying hard drugs, including crack cocaine and crystal meth . Ridicule: The Rev Flowers during the Treasury Select Committee hearing . The Methodist Church appears to agree – Flowers has been suspended from his duties for three weeks. He . has been one of its ministers for 40 years. Laudable, you might say. But does being in such a post really make one a suitable candidate to . become chairman of the Co-operative Bank? Was there something else in Flowers’s CV that qualified him for this most demanding of positions? Well, to be fair, the openly gay Flowers did work for NatWest for four years, in the late 60s. The . position he held is not clear, but given the fact that he was 19 at the . time and became a Methodist minister at the end of his tenure suggests . the post was not a senior one. At . a meeting of the Treasury Select Committee earlier this month, when . asked to explain how he was qualified to run the bank following its . £700million loss he replied: ‘I took the exam of the Institute of . Bankers. ‘I completed part one and the best part of part two of those exams before I became a Methodist minister. ‘I would judge that experience is out of date in terms of the needs of contemporary banking.’ Who would argue with that? Especially given his somewhat shaky grasp of figures. He told the committee that the Co-op’s balance sheet had £3billion of assets, when the answer was in fact £47billion. He was also at a loss to answer questions about the amount of loans on its books. Perhaps . there is some other evidence of financial wizardry, then, in his . background? Yesterday the Mail searched long and hard, but could find . nothing. Paul Flowers was . born in Portsmouth to parents Muriel and Charles but has lived in the . North for many years. His father died in 1993 aged 70, and he had a . brother, Ian, who died the same year aged just 39. He lives in a modest . house in Bradford and shared it with his mother until her death last . year aged 85. Mr Flowers lives in a modest house in Bradford and shared it with his mother until her death last year aged 85 . After that brief stint . with the NatWest, he became a minister with the Methodist Church, for . whom he now sits as a trustee on the body that manages its invested . funds and property. Twenty . or so years ago, Flowers came to attention as vice-chairman of Rochdale . Council’s social services committee during the ‘satanic abuse’ fiasco . between 1988 and 1991. It . involved social workers making lurid claims about satanic rituals being . performed on children and, as a result, 20 children from six families . were placed in care. However, . the police found no evidence and a government-backed inquiry . subsequently blamed ‘evangelical Christians’ for the scare. Flowers maintained a high profile, sitting on committees and getting himself involved in community projects. Ironically, given recent events, from 1992 to 2004 he was prominently . involved with the Lifeline Project, which helps drug abusers. Today he . remains a trustee of the Terrence Higgins Trust, the HIV/Aids charity. Speaking . about his involvement with the charity, he once said: ‘As an out gay . man for all of my adult life I am acutely aware of the issues . surrounding HIV. ‘Like many others I have been personally affected by it in ways which are often far too painful  to recount.’ Flowers was a councillor at Bradford City Council for ten years but does not appear to have been universally popular. One . former councillor told the Mail yesterday: ‘Flowers was an insufferable . and pompous man who threw his not inconsiderable weight around. 'He . always made it plain he was the most educated person in a room and . everyone else was a peasant.’ In 2010 – more irony – he was appointed by . Labour leader Ed Miliband to the party’s finance and industry board. None . of this goes any way to explain just how Flowers became chairman of the . proudly ethical Co-operative Bank. But it seems the system by which the . appointment was made goes some way to solving the mystery. Flowers rose through the Co-op’s ranks, joining the board of the Co-op Group in 2008 and becoming deputy chairman. In . 2009 the post of chairman of Co-operative Banking group became vacant. Choosing the candidate fell to the 13-strong Remuneration and . Appointments Committee, which is formed largely of former Labour . politicians and Co-operative movement veterans. It . traditionally selected directors from the board of the  Co-operative . Group. On that board of about 20 people, you would be unlikely to find . any high-flying bankers. Or . anyone, it seems, remotely up to the job of running a bank.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . It may look like a banana, but this curved device is actually thought to be the world's oldest pocket calendar. Archaeologists found the calendar in Serbia and believe the moon-shaped device is around 8,000 years old. It is made from the tusk of a wild boar and is marked with engravings thought to denote a lunar cycle of 28 days, as well as the four phases of the moon. Archaeologists discovered what's thought to be a Neolithic moon-shaped calendar in eastern Serbia, pictured. It is made from the tusk of a wild boar, is thought to date back around 8,000 years and is marked with engravings that denote the lunar cycle . The Neolithic period began around 10,000 years ago and ended with the Bronze Age more than four centuries later. It is thought neolithic humans were the first to cultivate plants and keep animals as pets and livestock. They are also said to have invented writing, pottery, weaving. These . new farmers would need a way to tell when to plant crops, as well as . when to harvest them, and as a result they have also been linked with . the invention of the first calendars and time-keeping devices. The archaeologists believe ancient man would have used it to work out the best time to plant and harvest crops. The tusk was found in an area close to the town of Smederevska Palanka in eastern Serbia. Professor Milorad Stojic from the Archaeology Institute in Belgrade, who made the discovery said: ‘We believe the engraved tusk represents a moon calendar.’ ‘There are 28 miniature triangular indentations carved there. ‘It fits into a pouch or a small bag so, yes, it can be said that this is probably the world's first pocket calculator.’ A group of 12 pits recently excavated in Aberdeenshire appear to mimic the phases of the moon to track lunar months over the course of a year. Researchers from the University of Birmingham now believe this monument could be the world's oldest 'calendar' and dates back 10,000 years . Professor Stojic said the area where the tusk was discovered represents one of Europe's most interesting archaeological sites from the Neolithic period and was a centre of religion 6,000 years ago. Aside from farmers using the calendar for crops, Stojic added it could have also been used for family planning. ‘Lunar calendars were used since Palaeolithic and Neolithic times,’ explained the professor. ‘But never before have [archaeologists] found such a good example like this tusk in Smederevska Planka.’ Although the device is believed to be the oldest pocket calendar, it is not the oldest calendar in the world. The archaeologists believe ancient man would have used the pocket calendar to work out the best time to plant and harvest crops. The tusk was found in an area close to the town of Smederevska Palanka in eastern Serbia . In July, archaeologists in Scotland discovered what they claimed was a 10,000-year-old date organiser. A group of 12 pits excavated in Aberdeenshire apperared to mimic and align with the phases of the moon, making it possible to track lunar months over the course of a year. The first formal time-measuring devices were thought to have been created in Mesopotamia about 5,000 years ago. The pit alignment near Crathes Castle predates those discoveries by thousands of years, experts said. The Mesolithic monument at Warren Field is said to have been created by hunter-gatherer societies ten centuries ago.","The moon-shaped calendar was found in Smederevska Palanka, Serbia .

"By . Natalie Clarke . In most office romances, the torrid details don’t usually travel much further than the water cooler. Alas, as Amanda Rosenberg can testify, the steel-and-glass Googleplex  in California isn’t like most offices, and her married lover, multibillionaire Google founder Sergey Brin, isn’t like most bosses. So rather than remaining under wraps in Silicon Valley, news of their relationship has ended up all over the internet – and for that, the 27-year-old ex-Marlborough pupil may have Brin’s wife Anna Wojcicki to thank. For the way the story of Miss Rosenberg’s romance with 40-year-old Brin – one of the world’s richest men, with a £15billion fortune – came out is rather intriguing. The face of Google Glass: Amanda Rosenberg, the 27-year-old marketing manager for Google's computerised spectacles, whose . relationship with Google co-founder Sergey Brin exploded into public . attention this week . Split: Brin, 40, pictured with his wife Anna Wojcicki, . also 40. One of the journalists who broke the story for U.S. technology website All Things D is the partner of a Google executive who . is a close friend of Miss Wojcicki . The relationship was first revealed in an article on US technology website All Things D. Some of the reporting on the piece was carried out by the site’s co-executive editor, Kara Swisher. Miss Swisher’s partner is Megan Smith, a Google executive who is a close friend of Miss Wojcicki, 40. On top of that, Miss Smith works at a division of the search engine giant dedicated to products including Google glass – which Miss Rosenberg promotes. On the same day, the website published a story about the departure of high-flying Google executive Hugo Barra. Marketing manager Miss Rosenberg dated Mr Barra shortly before her romance with Brin began. This week, he left the company to join a phone firm in China. His departure followed ‘a recent thorny personal situation related to the end of a romantic relationship he had with another Googler,’ All Things D reported. Model looks: A carefully posed picture of Miss Rosenberg taken from her publicly shared Google+ profile page . Where's the Google Glass: She holds a sandwich instead in the spot over her eye where the gadget would sit . In the wake of this rather complicated love ‘quadrangle’, no doubt employees inside Google are taking a rather wry look at the firm’s code of conduct. It states: ‘If a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved. ‘When faced with a potential conflict of interest, ask yourself: Would this activity harm my reputation, negatively impact my ability to do my job at Google or potentially harm Google? ‘Would this activity embarrass Google or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or blog? If the answer to any of these questions is “yes”, the relationship or situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should avoid it.’ Yesterday it was reported that Miss Rosenberg had been transferred to another department within Google ‘to be even further from Sergey in the chain of command’. Confusingly, another report quoted a Google spokesman saying she had not moved and ‘remains in her current position’. Either way, she has gone to ground and has not been answering calls. Famous friends: Miss Rosenberg with Tinie Tempah, a British rap artist noted for his choices of spectacles . It's not all work: Miss Rosenberg on the beach in one of numerous photos she has shared over the Internet . But thanks to her eagerness to embrace social networking sites, we know rather a lot about Miss Rosenberg. According to posts on her blog, she was born in Hong Kong and raised in London. She refers to herself as a ‘Chinese Jew’ – a ‘Chew’. Her mother is from Hong Kong, her father is British. She boarded at £31,000-a-year Marlborough College with Kate and Pippa Middleton and Princess Beatrice, and has worked for Google since she graduated with a communications degree from Leeds University. She was initially based in London, before moving to San Francisco to work at its Silicon Valley nerve centre last year. She has since been promoting Google Glass, glasses which enable users to film and broadcast everything they see – to the concern of privacy campaigners. Her social networking pages are filled with photographs of her modelling the glasses, and one shows her meeting rapper Tinie Tempah. In another, rather oddly, she is wearing a mask from the film Iron Man and holding a Spider-Man toy. In disguise: Miss Rosenberg wears an Iron Man mask, left; and right, she hides behind a wearable cushion . If she ends up at the centre of what could be the most expensive divorce in history, she might need some superpowers of her own. The precise timings and possible overlaps of her romance with Brin are not clear. It has been confirmed that Brin and his wife, who have a four-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter, separated several months ago. But whether Miss Rosenberg was the catalyst for the split is, naturally, subject to much speculation. Neither Brin or Miss Wojcicki has filed for divorce – yet. If they divorce, Californian law suggests their fortune would have to be halved. To complicate matters, however, they have reportedly signed a pre-nuptial agreement. Even if that falls through, Brin and Miss Rosenberg would hardly be short of cash – they would still have £7.5billion to get by on.","Story was first broken by partner of close friend of Sergey Brin's wife .

"By . Natalie Clarke . and Hugo Gye . Given that he has is caught up in one of the world's most high-stakes divorce battles, you might expect Belgian hotelier Didier Thiry to be slightly on edge. And this week, the stakes grew even higher when a judge sentenced him to four months in prison for hiding his millions from his estranged wife, fashion designer Alisa Thiry. But his response could barely be more blasé - the businessman says he won't return to Britain because he won't be able to get a good cup of coffee in jail. Defiant: Didier Thiry, left, refuses to return to Britain after his wife Alisa, right, managed to have him jailed . Mr Thiry is a well-known figure in his native country thanks to his flourishing hospitality empire, including a boutique hotel in Brussels and a decades-old restaurant in a quaint village. However, this week he hit the headlines thanks to his acrimonious divorce battle, which has seen him and his wife squabbling over their £45million fortune. The key bone of contention is a £13.8million loan a company owned by Alisa made to a company owned by Didier. Naturally, now the couple are no longer together, Alisa wishes her loan to be repaid. Alisa Thiry received £40m from her first husband and wants her second jailed for concealing assets . At a . hearing of the Family Division of the High Court on Wednesday, Alisa’s . barrister - at her behest - said Mr Thiry was in contempt of court for . failing to disclose information relating to this loan and urged the . judge to jail him. The judge agreed, and sentenced Mr Thiry, 52, to four months in jail. But he is currently in Belgium, and is in no mood to come rushing back to Britain to serve his sentence. 'I . can’t come to London,' he told the Daily Telegraph. 'You don’t know . what it is for me not to go to London and be condemned to jail.' Although . he refuses to discuss the details of the court case, he claims to have . launched rival proceedings in Belgium against Alisa. And . he retains a refreshingly light-hearted attitude to his own plight, . concluding: 'Who would want to come to England anyway? The coffee is . terrible, especially in prison I guess.' On the face of it, former magazine fashion editor Alisa, 49, has done very well for herself. Her first split from Stephen Marks, the founder of the French Connection fashion empire, in 2004, was resolved relatively smoothly. To pay off Alisa, Mr Marks dutifully sold £40million worth of shares in his company and she subsequently received a settlement somewhere in the region of that amount. And after the judge's ruling about Didier, one might expect 49-year-old Alisa to have felt quietly satisfied when she returned to her £15 million property, a five-storey house in one of Notting Hill’s grander terraces. After getting husband No 1 to hand over a fortune, she’s managed to get No 2 banged up in prison. That, surely, is a first. Except it isn’t quite as simple as that. Their divorce is far from settled — millions remain at stake. And the battle between this warring couple is about to become even bloodier than it already is. The news that Alisa Thiry is now embroiled in a second epic divorce battle involving many millions of pounds has been met with little surprise in certain quarters among their circle. Indeed, there are unkind mutterings that Alisa is a woman who weighs up a potential husband’s suitability according to the size of his wallet. ‘It didn’t go unnoticed that she took Stephen to the cleaners,’ says one who knows her. ‘She told her friends she was going to take him for everything she could — and she did. He was devastated. There are no feelings of warmth between Alisa and Stephen now —  just loathing. ‘No one was surprised when Alisa married another multi-millionaire. She has an uncanny way of latching on to money. I think Didier was probably warned, but sadly paid no attention.’ The couple were married overseas around 2006. Following their separation, it is understood a decree nisi was  issued, but a decree absolute cannot be given until a financial settlement has been agreed. The High Court hearing heard that Mr Thiry had a fortune of £8million when their relationship began. A large chunk of the  couple’s combined fortune is made up of the money Alisa took from her first divorce. How ironic — and a sort of poetic justice for Stephen Marks — if she lost it all in the second. The couple’s assets include the house in Notting Hill and a luxurious property on the Caribbean island of St Barts, where Alisa and Didier first met not long after her divorce from Mr Marks in 2004. The daughter of Raymond Chapman and his wife, Valerie, both hairdressers, she has certainly adjusted well to the lifestyle into which she has been propelled by virtue of her marriages. She was born Alisa Chapman in Cheltenham in 1964 but changed her name to Green after her mother’s marriage to Ronald Green in 1973. Alisa met Stephen Marks in 1989 at the launch of the short-lived Mirabella magazine. He is said to have been so smitten that he proposed that very evening. She was 25 and single. He was 20 years older, with a daughter from a long-term relationship with the fashion designer Nicole Farhi. The 49-year-old former magazine fashion editor walked away with an eight-figure settlement after splitting from Mr Marks, the co-founder of French Connection, in 2004 after the couple had three children together . And after founding the French Connection fashion label in 1969, he was already fabulously rich. Following their marriage in 1993, the couple had three children, Ella, now 19, Joshua, 17, and Ava, 12, and set up home in The Boltons in West London — one of the capital’s most rarefied addresses, where Alisa enjoyed giving lavish dinner parties. The family had holidays at their homes on St Barts and at The Hamptons outside New York. In the mid-Nineties, French Connection launched a new slogan — FCUK. The controversy it caused gave the company acres of free publicity and French Connection flourished. Mr Marks’s fortune was said to be £300 million. They were friends with Madonna and Sting. But in 2004 it emerged that Alisa had left the marital home, taking the children with her. Later that year, Mr Marks was forced to sell the £40 million worth of shares, reducing his stake in his company from 51 per cent to just over 40 per cent, to fund his divorce. Yesterday, Mr Marks declined to comment about his ex-wife’s divorce proceedings. But a French Connection spokesman told me that he did wish to point out that his wife had never been a ‘creative director’ at French Connection — as she is described on her internet LinkedIn site, which allows business people to network online — but was simply a stylist. She continues to maintain she was. It has been said in the past that the FCUK advertising masterstroke had something to do with Alisa, but the spokesman confirmed yesterday that this was not so either. What is true, however, is that the divorce left Mr Marks well and truly in the doldrums. The same year as the divorce, French Connection announced a severe profits warning and Mr Marks admitted: ‘I suppose if someone has a difficult time personally, they might not be quite as focused as they were before.’ Post divorce, it was reported that Alisa formed a friendship with a French photographer, Jean-Philippe Piter, then 35, living on St Barts. M Piter was said to be not especially keen on hard work, with a liking for wealthy women. One associate reportedly said of him: ‘Here on St Barts, people say that he works not with his brain but his beautiful body.’ Alisa was said to enjoy listening to him playing his guitar. But their relationship seemingly never took off and soon Alisa was introduced to Didier. After their marriage, they divided their time between London, Brussels and St Barts, living for the most part in the house in Notting Hill that Alisa bought with the proceeds from her divorce settlement. In 2009, she and Didier bought an art nouveau townhouse in Brussels and turned it into a boutique hotel, the Hotel Odette. Alisa presided over the interior decoration and decided that a black and white theme would be just perfect. So the carpets are black, the doors are black and in the library a  black and white TV plays black and white Fellini films on a continuous silent loop. Alisa’s other big design project was the house in St Barts that she and Didier moved into in 2010. It’s fair to say Alisa will be unwilling to let Didier have this property. It was built especially for her, according to her own vision, a fabulous, minimalistic shangri-la overlooking the sea. Alisa gave an interview to a magazine about the conception of the house, accompanied by photographs of her wearing a bikini and a mahogany tan. ‘It was an easy feat to design this house,’ she said, ‘given the surrounding beauty.’ (And a little help from three architects.) ‘I tried to incorporate natural elements in the flow of the house, primarily the wonderful light, the reflection of the sea and the welcome breeze. ‘This house is all about the sea, the sea and the light. For me, the ultimate luxury is taking a shower while being able to look out to the sea — that is complete freedom.’ It is, indeed. But as painful as it may be, it is possible that Alisa may not be able to shower while looking out to sea for much longer, if Didier gets the house as part of the settlement. What caused the split is not clear. A source says: ‘Alisa can be quite difficult. She’s very hard-nosed and money-oriented and a real man’s woman, not at all soft. Perhaps Didier just had enough.’ For now the wrangling goes on. And how much of her fortune Alisa may lose is not yet known. But even if her ex-husband is awarded a big slice of it, all is not lost. Given Alisa’s proven record for attracting multi-millionaires, who could rule out another one coming her way and becoming husband number three?","Alisa Thiry's first husband founded fashion empire French Connection .

The Alaska Airlines jet, Flight 135, landed safely. The jet was carrying 143 passengers and five crew members. The close proximity of the aircraft was enough for the agency to count the incident as a 'near miss.' Johnson said the aircraft were so close at least one pilot spotted the other plane. He said the NTSB's investigation, which has just begun, is being headed up by a senior air traffic control specialist based in Washington, D.C.

Todd Erickson, Ace Air Cargo's chief pilot, said the Ace aircraft was aware of the situation and in contact with the control tower the entire time. 'There was no danger,' Erickson said, according to Alaska Dispatch. 'Once Alaska Airlines radioed they had the 1900 in sight, our crew had no cause for concern.' A spokeswoman for Alaska Airlines said the Boeing 737 aircraft was equipped with a collision avoidance system, which alerted the crew that the other aircraft was close by.

An employee at a southwest Ohio skydiving business has died from head injuries she suffered when she walked into a spinning airplane propeller. Sarah Rhoads, 24, died early Tuesday at a Dayton hospital, where she was flown after the accident Sunday in Middletown. The Miamisburg resident had been office manager for three years at Start Skydiving, which operates near Middletown Regional Airport. Owner John Hart said it's the first time the business has had such an accident. He said it can be difficult to see fast-spinning propeller blades. 'It doesn't get any worse than this,' Hart told the Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News. 'She was like a daughter. I loved that girl.' Co-workers said Rhoads had walked out onto the tarmac planning to ask a pilot if he wanted food. But she inadvertently walked into the propeller of another plane that was idling on the tarmac, they said. She was transported to Miami Valley Hospital by Careflight and she was listed in critical condition Sunday and Monday. Hart said he and other skydivers who had been performing in Jacksonville, Florida, landed at the airport some 10 minutes after the accident, decending into a grisly scene. He described it as 'absolutely horrible' and the 'worst nightmare of my life.'

"By . Natalie Clarke . and Jessica Jerreat . The 27-year-old Google Glass employee revealed as the mistress of the Internet giant's co-founder Sergey Brin has become the most Googled employee at the company. Since details of her relationships with Brin, 40, who is married and has two children, and another Google executive Hugo Barra, who recently took a new job in China, Amanda Rosenberg has been attracting a lot of attention. By Saturday afternoon, a Google search for her name returned 38 million results. And, on Thursday, one day after a tech site revealed the affair, she was sixth in the company's list of 'hot searches'. Swept up: Amanda Rosenberg is at the center of a Google scandal over her romance with Sergey Brin and Hugo Barra . Peak: After a relatively small internet presence Amanda Rosenberg has become one of the most searched terms . Miss Rosenberg, who transferred to San Francisco from London last year, has also found herself under attack on her Google+ page according to the New York Post. 'Every fellow Googler knows she slept . with not one but two bosses within the same 8 months,' one person, named as Audrey . Winters, commented on her page according to the New York Post. Other comments included: 'Disappointed and ashamed. You're a pretty girl who is sleeping her way to the top ... Kim Kardashians and you should hang out,' from a user named as Ellie Poole. And, under a picture of Miss Rosenberg, a Bill Kowba posted: 'Was this photo taken before or after you slept with a married man and destroyed his marriage?﻿' Link: Amanda with Diane von Furstenberg and Sergey Brin at New York Fashion Week . Old flame: Amanda has previously been linked to Google's Hugo Barra . However, others have defended the ex-Marlborough pupil, with messages of support and called on fellow Googlers to protect Miss Rosenberg. 'I hope that all members of the Glass community will stay civil and not become quasi-paparazzi stalking you now for awkward shots,' Andreas Erben commented. In most office romances, the torrid details don’t usually travel much further than the water cooler. Alas, as Miss Rosenberg can testify, the steel-and-glass Googleplex in California isn’t like most offices, and her married , multibillionaire lover Sergey Brin isn’t like most bosses. So rather than remaining under wraps in Silicon Valley, news of their relationship has ended up all over the internet – and for that, the 27-year-old ex-Marlborough pupil may have Brin’s wife Anna Wojcicki to thank. For the way the story of Miss Rosenberg’s romance with 40-year-old Brin – one of the world’s richest men, with a $23 billion fortune – came out is rather intriguing. The face of Google Glass: Amanda Rosenberg, the 27-year-old marketing manager for Google's computerised spectacles, whose . relationship with Google co-founder Sergey Brin exploded into public . attention this week . Split: Brin, 40, pictured with his wife Anna Wojcicki, . also 40. One of the journalists who broke the story for U.S. technology website All Things D is the partner of a Google executive who . is a close friend of Miss Wojcicki . The relationship was first revealed in an article on US technology website All Things D. Some of the reporting on the piece was carried out by the site’s co-executive editor, Kara Swisher. Miss Swisher’s partner is Megan Smith, a Google executive who is a close friend of Miss Wojcicki, 40. On top of that, Miss Smith works at a division of the search engine giant dedicated to products including Google glass – which Miss Rosenberg promotes. On the same day, the website published a story about the departure of high-flying Google executive Hugo Barra. Marketing manager Miss Rosenberg dated Mr Barra shortly before her romance with Brin began. This week, he left the company to join a phone firm in China. His departure followed ‘a recent thorny personal situation related to the end of a romantic relationship he had with another Googler,’ All Things D reported. Model looks: A carefully posed picture of Miss Rosenberg taken from her publicly shared Google+ profile page . Where's the Google Glass: She holds a sandwich instead in the spot over her eye where the gadget would sit . In the wake of this rather complicated love ‘quadrangle’, no doubt employees inside Google are taking a rather wry look at the firm’s code of conduct. It states: ‘If a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved. ‘When faced with a potential conflict of interest, ask yourself: Would this activity harm my reputation, negatively impact my ability to do my job at Google or potentially harm Google? ‘Would this activity embarrass Google or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper or blog? If the answer to any of these questions is “yes”, the relationship or situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should avoid it.’ Yesterday it was reported that Miss Rosenberg had been transferred to another department within Google ‘to be even further from Sergey in the chain of command’. Confusingly, another report quoted a Google spokesman saying she had not moved and ‘remains in her current position’. Either way, she has gone to ground and has not been answering calls. Famous friends: Miss Rosenberg with Tinie Tempah, a British rap artist noted for his choices of spectacles . It's not all work: Miss Rosenberg on the beach in one of numerous photos she has shared over the Internet . But thanks to her eagerness to embrace social networking sites, we know rather a lot about Miss Rosenberg. According to posts on her blog, she was born in Hong Kong and raised in London. She refers to herself as a ‘Chinese Jew’ – a ‘Chew’. Her mother is from Hong Kong, her father is British. She boarded at Marlborough College with Kate and Pippa Middleton and Princess Beatrice, and has worked for Google since she graduated with a communications degree from Leeds University. She was initially based in London, before moving to San Francisco to work at its Silicon Valley nerve centre last year. She has since been promoting Google Glass, glasses which enable users to film and broadcast everything they see – to the concern of privacy campaigners. Her social networking pages are filled with photographs of her modelling the glasses, and one shows her meeting rapper Tinie Tempah. In another, rather oddly, she is wearing a mask from the film Iron Man and holding a Spider-Man toy. If she ends up at the center of what . could be the most expensive divorce in history, she might need some . superpowers of her own. The precise timings and possible overlaps of her . romance with Brin are not clear. It . has been confirmed that Brin and his wife, who have a four-year-old son . and eight-year-old daughter, separated several months ago. In disguise: Miss Rosenberg wears an Iron Man mask, left; and right, she hides behind a wearable cushion . But whether Miss Rosenberg was the catalyst for the split is, naturally, subject to much speculation. Neither Brin or Miss Wojcicki has filed for divorce – yet. If they divorce, Californian law suggests their fortune would have to be halved. To complicate matters, however, they have reportedly signed a pre-nuptial agreement. Even if that falls through, Brin and Miss Rosenberg would hardly be short of cash – they would still have $12 billion to get by on.","Amanda Rosenberg brings up 38 million hits on search engine .

As she introduced the governor, joking about his 'small personality' and 'modesty,' awards presenter Norah O'Donnell of CBS took a dig at the scandal, describing Christie as 'governor of New Jersey - you know, that state right across the GW Bridge.' The governor took the remarks in stride, however, playfully raising his eyebrows. Later he joked that while in New York, he would refer to New Jersey as 'the place on the other side of the Lincoln Tunnel.' Previous recipients of the award include former presidents Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan.","The National Father's Day Committee crowned the New Jersey governor at a ceremony in Manhattan today .

Berkin Elvan, was hit in the head by a police tear-gas canister and died in March without regaining . consciousness. Tens of thousands of people came to his funeral. The protests also focused on 301 people who were killed in a coal mine disaster last week in the western town of Soma.

"By . Corey Charlton . A Montana has man killed another man by slashing his throat after they argued over which branch of the United States military was better, the Army or the Marines, prosecutors say. Charging documents claim William Earl Cunningham, 63, told police that he and Nathaniel Horn, 40, were arguing Saturday night when Horn jumped up and took a swing at him. Cunningham told the officer he pushed Horn back and said: 'Then I cut him. I did what the Army taught me to do.' William Earl Cunningham, pictured left, has been charged with deliberate homicide over the death of Nathaniel Horn, right, who was found by police with cuts to his right cheek and left side of his neck . While Cunningham claimed to have done what the Army 'taught' him to do, it was unclear if Horn had served in the military. When . officers arrived at the scene at East First Street, Laurel, Cunningham was leaning against a car and Horn was . lying on the grass next to Cunningham's feet. Horn had a cut on his . right cheek and a deep cut on the left side of his neck, and a bloody knife three-and-a-half inches long was sitting on the picnic table. Horn appeared to be gasping for breath as an officer applied pressure to the neck wound, court records said. 'I cut him. He's dead,' Cunningham told police. 'The knife's on the table.' Horn was pronounced dead less than an hour later. After Cunningham was read his rights, he told officers he and Horn were sitting at the picnic table when they began arguing about whether the Army or Marines was the best branch of the military. William Earl Cunningham, 63, of Laurel, . entered no plea when he made an initial appearance on a charge of . deliberate homicide in Justice Court yesterday. The incident occurred on First East Street, Laurel, after an argument had continued on from the previous night . Laurel Police Sargent Mark Guy said Monday that the men had argued the night before about the same issue. Lena Heller told KULR-TV that she had invited the two men over on Saturday night and they had been drinking when they started arguing. 'I think it's horrible that somebody would just kill somebody for no reason, just because of an argument,' Heller said. 'I know it was the alcohol.' Cunningham's blood-alcohol level was 0.217 percent, above the 0.08 limit at which a person is considered legally intoxicated, according to court documents.","Man killed after argument about which branch of the U.S. military was better .

"By . Corey Charlton . Fox News presenter Sabrina Rodriguez has been accused of helping her partner shoplift . A Fox40 news anchor accused of helping her partner steal wallets worth more than $2400 has resigned from her job. Police claim March 2013 security camera footage shows Sabrina Rodriguez, who worked as a news presenter for the TV network Fox40, helping her partner Nicholas Gray take 10 wallets, worth $2500, from a Sacramento store without paying. Rodriguez has now been charged with grand theft, burglary and conspiracy to commit a crime. Court documents obtained by The Desk show a Folsom Police Department officer was called to the Coach outlet store on March 24 last year after employees had been told by a witness that Gray had been seen taking wallets without paying. A review of the in-store footage showed Rodriguez directing Gray to the wallets and helping conceal his actions as he placed them in his personal bag. It was when Gray was arrested for an outstanding warrant in May this year that a search warrant was received to check his iPhone, and text messages were found allegedly implicating Rodriguez in the thefts. Text message conversations between the two showed Gray telling Rodriguez: 'I got 8 $350 cashmere sweaters plus skirts I got rent'. And in separate instance, Rodriguez responded to his texts, telling him: 'I love when a plan comes together'. KCRA reported her lawyer said she was '100 per cent innocent' of the crimes and looked forward to defending herself in court. Yesterday Rodriguez took to her official Facebook page to announce she had resigned from her job with Fox40. She wrote: 'I am heartbroken to say, I have decided to resign my position at Fox40. Given the recent media attention I feel it was the best decision to make. 'The past three years at FOX40 have been absolutely wonderful. From management to my colleagues in the newsroom and other departments, everyone is talented and kind. It's been a blessing to work and learn from all of you. 'To the viewers, thank you for your incredible love and support. It's overwhelming. Resigning was not an easy decision to make, but it's one that will allow me to focus on my case and work to reestablish my good name.' News anchor Sabrina Rodriguez, pictured right, presenting the news on Fox40 with two colleagues . Rodriguez has now resigned from her job, saying she wished to focus on her upcoming court case . Rodriguez was released on $10,000 bail last week and will be arraigned on August 29. A Fox40 spokesperson recently told MailOnline: 'We were informed late Thursday July 31 that legal action has been taken against anchor Sabrina Rodriguez. 'These charges relate to a personal situation with Ms. Rodriguez that is not related to her work at Fox40. 'Sabrina maintains she is innocent of these allegations.

"By . Helen Pow . A young British aid worker has died from malaria while volunteering at a primary school in Kenya, it emerged today. Christi Kelly, 21, was cooking meals for poverty-stricken children and teaching them to dance when she fell ill. She was taken to a hospital six hours away in the capital, Nairobi, on Tuesday but died the following day. Miss Kelly's stunned family from Ilfracombe, Devon, said she had all the necessary injections and was taking anti-malaria tablets when she contracted the virus. Sudden death: Christi Kelly, left, from Ilfracombe, Devon, died of Malaria while volunteering in Kenya . The former university student was three months into a ten-month European Union assignment with Moving Mountains, a trust which improves social conditions in Kenya. She was stationed in the western county of Siaya, living at an orphanage and teaching dance at the local primary school. Miss Kelly's heartbroken mother Carol Kelly said she was desperate for answers about her daughter's death. She last spoke with her on Sunday, when Miss Kelly said she had been in bed and was feeling unwell. Carol Kelly, 41, said: 'She was teaching the children to dance, she absolutely loved it out there. 'She was . living at the orphanage and teaching at the primary school. She taught . dance but she obviously helped out with the cooking and so on. 'As far as we're aware, everything happened very quickly. 'I think . she went to hospital on Tuesday and died on Wednesday morning at around 6 . a.m. - but it's all very unclear at the moment. 'We had been speaking to her a lot more because of all the troubles in Kenya but they were fine. Anti-malaria: Miss Kelly's stunned family said she had all the necessary injections and was taking anti-malaria tablets when she contracted the virus . Aid worker: Christi Kelly, shown playing with children during her aid work, was loving her time in Kenya when she fell ill . 'It's got the highest rate of malaria but she had had all her injections and was taking tablets.' Miss Kelly attended Ilfracombe Arts College before completing a foundation degree in Dance and Community Work Practice at Plymouth university. She became a youth worker for Devon Youth Services and taught at the Rebecca Varley Dance School in Ilfracombe. Miss Kelly . was on her second overseas assignment, having carried out environmental . aid work in Borneo last year during a three month trip with Raleigh . International. Carol . Kelly, who has three other children, said: 'She was full of life and a . huge character, which is why everyone's so devastated. 'She loved everyone, cared about everyone and drove everyone crazy. She loved life and she was too young. 'She was very passionate about helping young people - that was her life. She was a real people person. 'It's a real comfort to think that she had all these amazing experiences.' Experts . said anti-malaria drugs have to be specific to the region the traveller . is visiting as some tablets are not effective in certain places. Charity work: The former university student, pictured, was three months into a ten-month European Union assignment with Moving Mountains, a trust which improves social conditions in Kenya . Early on: She was just three months into the 10 month trip . Dr Colin Berry, of Cardiff University School of Biosciences, said: 'Most malarial deaths occur in Sub Saharan Africa and most of them are children under the age of five. 'Africa is a particularly bad place for malaria. There are effective drugs but there are resistant parasites. 'In terms of the life-cycle of a parasite, once you're bitten, the parasite goes to the liver and spends a couple of weeks there before it comes out into your blood . 'If the drug level isn't sufficient when the parasite enters the blood stage, there will be problems. 'Before going on a holiday, you wouldn't go to a chemist and pick an anti malarial tablet off the shelf, you would have to go to a GP/travel clinic where they would look at where you were visiting. 'This is because one malaria tablet which may be effective in one country, may not be in another.' Hundreds of mourners gathered at Ilfracombe seafront on Thursday evening to release balloons in memory of Miss Kelly, who was known as Belle to her many friends. Her Facebook page has been inundated with tributes. Brogan Hewitt wrote: 'Rest in peace Belle, such a lovely person. You'll be truly missed.' Chyna Vickery added: 'You'll never be forgotten. One of my best friends taken too early, the least selfish person I know. Keep dancing up there Belle.' Danica Bawn said: 'Heaven has gained another angel, so sad. You had a good soul Christi Belle Kelly, may you rest in peace.' Malaria is a serious tropical disease . spread by mosquitoes and if it's not diagnosed and treated promptly, it . can be fatal. It only takes a single mosquito bite for someone to become . infected. Symptoms include a fever, sweats and chills, headaches, vomiting, muscle pains and diarrhoea. These . usually appear between seven and 18 days after a person becomes infected, . though the disease can lay dormant for up to a year in some cases before symptoms begin to show, . according to the NHS.

The indulgent villa was perched atop a 26-storey building in Beijing, China, and featured several dining halls, a gym, a karaoke bar, guest rooms and an open-air swimming pool. Owner Zhang Biqing, who made his fortune in traditional Chinese medicine, recently invited a group of reporters to survey what remained of the once-sprawling villa. The property made headlines last year for what - at a distance - looked like a pile of rocks dotted with trees on top of the apartment building. Neighbours had complained about the villa, saying they feared it could collapse on top of them. The demolition has finally been completed a year after it was first ordered to be deconstructed . Neighbours complained the villa was a health and safety risk and were frightened it could collapse the building . The rocks used for the building's exterior were said to be made of imitation shells, rather than stone, and had trees and shrubs growing from them as seen in classical Chinese landscaping painting . The rooftop home, which never received planning approval, caused cracks to appear in neighbours' ceilings and walls while some had to put up with leaks from broken pipes and drains. Neighbours were also forced to live with the noise and disturbance caused from the building work. One resident said their apartment was constantly flooded while another described the owner as a 'menace'.

Izola Curry was 42 when she stabbed King in the chest with a letter opener during his book signing at a New York store. King came close to death - surgeons told him the tip of the blade was touching his aorta and if he had so much as sneezed he would have drowned in his own blood.

However, she was deemed unfit to stand trial and was taken to the Matteawan State Hospital for the Criminally Insane in New York state. The Smoking Gun has now claimed to have tracked down 98-year-old Curry to the Hillside Manor nursing home in Jamaica, Queens. The website reported Curry could not recall the attempted assassination, but referred to the year it occurred and admitted she was placed in a 'hospital for the criminally insane'.

He said: 'You know, several years ago, I was in New York City autographing the first book that I had written. And while sitting there autographing books, a demented black woman came up. The only question I heard from her was, ""Are you Martin Luther King?"" 'And I was looking down writing, and I said, ""Yes."" And the next minute I felt something beating on my chest. Before I knew it I had been stabbed by this demented woman. 'And that blade had gone through, and the X-rays revealed that the tip of the blade was on the edge of my aorta, the main artery. And once that's punctured, your drowned in your own blood -- that's the end of you.'

A passenger ferry carrying hundreds of people has capsized in central Bangladesh, killing at least two people and probably many more as horrified villagers watched from the shore.

The ferry, which could have been carrying up to 250 people, capsized 30km south of the capital Dhaka . Hundreds of onlookers gather on the shores of the Bangladesh river near where the accident occurred . Azizul Haque, 30, was among at least 44 people who survived by swimming to shore, said he jumped overboard when it became clear the ferry was going down. He said: 'The ferry went out of control due to wind and current, tilting from one side to the other. 'Then the captain jumped out because he probably understood it was sinking. The river was rough, and there were many passengers on board.' The ferry capsized in the Padma River in Munshiganj district, about 44 kilometers (28 miles) south of the capital, Dhaka. More than four hours after the ferry capsized, authorities said they were still waiting for a larger vessel needed to launch a proper rescue operation. Local police officer Khalid Hossain said two bodies had been recovered so far. 'We are waiting for a big rescue vessel which is on its way,' said Nurul Alam Dulal, a local fire official.

"By . Corey Charlton . A violent pupil who lunged at a teacher with a knife just two days after teacher Ann Maguire was killed told him: 'I won’t miss next time', a court heard. The 14-year-old had been removed from a cookery class when he picked up the cutlery blade and thrust it towards the tutor, narrowly missing his neck. The teacher restrained the pupil and took the weapon, but when asked if he had done it for show, the teen brazenly replied: 'I would do it again. I won’t miss next time.' The pupil told magistrates at the South Tyneside Law Courts he was sorry for what he had done . He admitted a charge of threatening a person at a school premises when he appeared at South Tyneside Magistrates’ Youth Court, Tyne and Wear. The court heard the incident happened just two days after teacher Ann Maguire was stabbed to death by a pupil at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds. The pupil - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was given a 12-month youth rehabilitation order with an intensive supervision and surveillance requirement. He was also handed a two-month, electronically-monitored curfew, after magistrates told him he was 'very, very close' to custody. The court heard the South Tyneside youngster had been removed from a class on April 30 for being disruptive and put in a re-engagement room, where children are meant to be left alone to calm down. The death of teacher Ann Maguire in April shone a spotlight on student violence. She was killed two days before the Tyneside youth tried to attack his teacher with a knife . But the teacher heard a noise and went to investigate. Paul Kennedy, defending, said: 'This is a young man not without difficulties. 'What appears to have happened is someone else had been in the re-engagement room before him, and, when they had calmed down, had something to eat, and a plate, knife and fork was in the room. 'The teacher has come in the room and he asked him to leave. 'He has picked up the knife and made a movement towards the teacher. He accepts that. 'There was no physical contact and no injuries caused.' Police were called after the pupil was disarmed, and he was arrested. The pupil has since left the school. When asked by magistrates about his thoughts on the case, the pupil said: 'I’m sorry for what I did.' Dave Errington, chairman of the magistrates, said: 'By threatening a school teacher with a knife while in a fit of temper and also repeating that threat verbally, we believe this crosses the custody threshold. 'But we have listened to the personal mitigation from your defence solicitor and have decided to give you a youth rehabilitation order, with intensive supervision and surveillance. 'We can’t have this behaviour in society. You are one step short from custody. You were very, very close to custody.' The pupil was ordered to pay £50 compensation to the teacher.","Violent Tyneside 14-year-old lunged at his teacher's throat with a knife .

Pharmaceutical companies are unwilling to invest in vaccines and research to cure the deadly Ebola disease because it is only killing Africans, a leading UK doctor has claimed.

Writing in the Independent on Sunday, Professor Ashton said: 'We must respond to this emergency as if it was in Kensington, Chelsea, and Westminster. 'We . must also tackle the scandal of the unwillingness of the pharmaceutical . industry to invest in research to produce treatments and vaccines, . something they refuse to do because the numbers involved are, in their . terms, so small and don't justify the investment.

Tammy, who cried throughout the trial, was sentenced to five years in prison after being found guilty at the end of the trial which finished on Thursday. Judge Ashurst said: 'I am satisfied those were crocodile tears. 'There is no element of remorse in your case.

Susan Holgate desperately tried to raise the alarm to save her husband Michael, but no-one heard her cries for help from the Harecastle Tunnel in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire. The mother-of-four also frantically sounded the vessel’s horn to draw attention to the tragedy, but it was two hours before canal workers reached the stricken vessel - and a further eight hours before the 58-year-old’s body was pulled from the cold, murky waters of the Trent and Mersey Canal. Michael Holgate on the back of his barge. He died when he hit his head and fell passing through a canal tunnel . Michael and Susan Holgate planned to spend the rest of their lives together travelling Britain's waterways . Now a coroner has called for safety improvements at the tunnel after hearing chilling details of the tragedy in May this year. The couple, who previously ran a guest house in Windermere, Cumbria, had retired to live on their narrowboat last summer. Mr Holgate was described as an 'experienced boat handler' and the couple, who had been married for 32 years, had planned to spend the rest of their lives together travelling Britain’s waterways. The inquest in Stoke-on-Trent heard the boat was passing through Harecastle Tunnel near Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, on May 20 as the couple made their way to a family wedding. Mr Holgate of Ambleside, Cumbria, had been driving the narrowboat while his wife and their 44-year-old son Anthony sat at the front. But inside the cramped unlit 2,500-metre tunnel the retired bus driver is believed to have banged his head and fallen into the canal. His desperate wife tried in vain in pitch black conditions to locate him, but after over two hours she had to get out and raise the alarm. Harecastle Tunnel in Staffordshire where Mr Holgate is believed to have hit his head and fallen overboard . Mrs Holgate told the hearing: 'We went two-thirds of the way without any problem. I was first aware there was a problem when the boat hit the side. 'I shouted out and there was no reply. I got to the back and he wasn’t there. 'It was horrendous. I just shouted and screamed. 'I would hate for someone to go through what I went through.'

Mr Holgate's wife Susan, 55, and son Anthony, 44, were at the front of the boat when he fell into the water . North Staffordshire Coroner Ian Smith concluded the death was accidental. He said: 'Somehow or another, he caught his head on the roof or side of the tunnel and from there, he’s gone into the water. 'He may have struck his head again on the boat or side of the tunnel or the propeller as it went past him. We don’t know. There would be a degree of shock as the water was cold. I would like to think his death was mercifully quick.' Mr Smith said he would write to The Canal and River Trust to ask for lines of communication to be installed and that advice be given to passengers to wear a safety jacket when entering the tunnel. He added: 'There is a cost but what is the cost of Michael Holgate’s life? 'I don’t want to see people go on these narrow boats without life jackets.

Others depict the men dressed in their smart green uniforms on parade in a town square on the eve of war and then stood on a train station platform as they begin their journey to France. As well as being filled with colour, some of the photos are tinged with poignancy as many of the men pictured never came back. Scroll down for video . Men of the Hertfordshire Regiment at summer camp in late 1914. This is one of a number of old First World War photographs to be digitally coloured . On the left, young Rowland Hill poses for a photograph in 1914 - such pictures were common at the outbreak of the war when patriotism and national fervour swept the country. On the right, Jack and Walter Satterthwaite pictured before Jack, on the left, was killed two years later. Walter was seriously wounded and died in 1962 . This photograph shows in vivid detail a group of territorial soldiers leaving a train station in Letchworth, Hertfordshire . They include Sergeant Jack Satterthwaite who is pictured stood alongside his younger brother Walter in front of a green hedge in the summer of 1914. He was shot and killed at Festubert, north west France, two years later. Another image in the gallery that has been reproduced in colour was shot in 1920 - two years after the war - and depicts a town’s first armistice day commemorations at the newly-built war memorial. The distinctive red, white and blue of the Union flag draped on top of the memorial provides a striking contrast to the solemn black and brown overcoats worn by those gathered. Most of the men photographed served in the Hertfordshire Regiment at the start of the war. The black and white photos have been given the 21st century colour makeover to mark the opening of an exhibition to be staged by the Herts at War project on August 4. Dan Hill, who is leading the project, said: 'In applying new technology to historic images previously seen only in black and white we are able to cross the century long divide and bring individuals back to life, if only for that one moment in time. Wounded servicemen in their 'hospital blues' pose for a photograph in one of the 38 private residences converted into convalescent homes in Hertfordshire . Hertfordshire Regiment Territorials rest during summer camp on the eve of the outbreak of war. The images were coloured using Photoshop software . A Belgian refugee at work in Kryn and Lahy factory in Letchworth, 1915. The images were reproduced by Doug Giles, who painstakingly coloured in the pixels of the original photos . 'We are used to seeing photographs and film in the grainy images of 100 years ago and to see them enhanced in this way is a fantastic window into a war that seems ever more real as a result. 'We are proud to work with projects like colourising history in furthering the story of Herts at War as the centenary of the conflict approaches ever closer.' The photographs have been reproduced by Doug Banks, of Colouring History. He used Photoshop software to painstakingly colour in the pixels in the original photos. He said: 'There is a bit of guess work in terms of getting the colours absolutely right and a bit of artistic licence is required. 'For instance, most of these photos were at the very start of the war so the uniforms would have been brand new and all been the same shade of khaki. A battalion of the Warwickshire Regiment pictured parading in Hitchin market square on the way to war in August, 1914 . On the left, a young girl on horseback poses for a photo with a Canadian trooper in 1917. Pictured right is the first Armistice Day parade in Letchworth Garden City, 1920 . 'One has to respect the content and whoever is in it and put aside what you think might look good in colour for the sake of it. 'I always start with the flesh and skin tones and try and relate to the people in the picture. 'Then I work on the clothing. People say that they were taken in black and white and they should remain that way but the people who lived through the war didn’t experience it in black and white. 'If there is just one person in the picture it would usually take me two or three hours but others have taken me half a day to do.' One of the photos that have been reproduced shows a young boy wearing an army uniform in honour of the British soldier, much like how a child would wear a replica football shirt today. Two other images show a Belgian refugee at work in a munitions factory in Letchworth Garden City in 1915 and wounded servicemen wearing their ‘hospital blues’ at a convalescent home in 1918. The photos can be viewed at the Herts at War exhibition at Letchworth Garden City from August 4. Doug . Banks, the artist responsible for breathing new life into these First . World War photographs, spends anywhere from a couple of hours to half a . day turning the black and white images into colour. Using . Adobe Photoshop, he selects a picture, zooms in to a high resolution . then 'paints' on new 'layers' of colour to specific areas of the images. This could be green for background trees, or a mixture of lighter . colours to create pinkish skin tones. Mr . Banks said: 'It helps if the photograph is a high resolution. It is . better if it's 300dpi or more because if it wasn't I wouldn't be able to . expand it to colour it pixel by pixel. 'A lot of colourists in America use layers. I open it up and make it as big as I can without distorting it. 'I . prefer to colour the skin tones first, I always work on the skin tones . first because the person you're colouring then becomes a person. 'With . this Photoshop software that I use it is referred to as building it up . layer by layer. Skin tones are perhaps the first layer then build upon . that. 'Then you may, depending on the age of the person, add other colours that make you a flesh as opposed to just pink. 'The . eye is another layer, and talking about military photographs, I add the . uniform. Generally if it's a British soldier it's usually khaki. So . it's not just a case of I paint the khaki colour. 'Finally if that's all you've got, the background is another layer - picking out a background layer that complements.' Mr . Banks said there was some artistic license required in order to use . colours which were suitable - such as duller colours for late war . uniforms which were likely faded. 'It's . painting by numbers without the numbers. But it isn't the case of just . slapping on any old bit of colour. You do have to have some artistic . bent, if you like.'","Grainy black and white photographs taken 100 years ago have been brought to life through digital colouring .

"By . Corey Charlton . In a cloud of smoke and with a thunderous blast three historic towers were demolished today after dominating an English town's skyline for more than four decades. The three southern towers of Didcot A power station in Oxfordshire were brought down by more than 180kg of explosives in a matter of seconds. Hundreds of locals are thought to have defied the guidance issued by power company RWE npower to stay away from the site and watch the demolition via a webcam livestream. Scroll down for video . The last time the cooling towers could be seen dominating the Oxfordshire skyline. Moments later, 180kg of explosives sent them crashing to the ground . The three cooling towers collapse in the explosion. The demolition was carried out in the early hours of the morning due to health and safety concerns . The incredible images show the three cooling towers, each approximately 100m tall, collapsing simultaneously in the early hours of the morning . The towers had been on the Didcot site for more than 40 years, but the controlled explosions which destroyed them down took only 15 seconds . The decision to demolish the towers in the early hours of the morning angered some locals, with a petition to change the timing gaining more than 3,000 signatures. The town council had also expressed its disappointment but npower said the timeslot between 3am and 5am had been chosen on health and safety grounds. The time took into account the risk of people getting too close to the explosion, and the impact of the dust cloud on local roads and a nearby rail line. Warning sirens were sounded 15 and then 10 minutes before the explosion at 5am. Didcot Power Station was constructed from 1964 to 1968 at a cost of £104million. The combined coal and oil power plant featured a chimney 200m tall and cooling towers approximately 100m high. Controversial even when proposed, a 'yes' vote to proceed with its construction was successful because of the number of jobs it was expected to bring to the region. In later years the power plant was the focus of several environmental protests. In 2006 and 2009, Greenpeace protestors invaded the station, chaining themselves to conveyor belts and climbing the chimneys - on one occasion, even painting 'Blair's Legacy' across it. Its 2013 closure came about due to EU directives to reduce carbon emissions and RWE npower declined to update it with power generation technology that would allow it to continue. During the build-up to the explosion . #DidcotDemolition was trending on Twitter, and one Oxfordshire resident . said: 'This has gotta be Didcot's most momentous occasion since we won . the FA vase.' As many as 1,500 people gathered at nearby Wittenham Clumps to watch the action unfold, the Oxford Mail reported in a liveblog on its website. For those who chose to watch the demolition online there were some technological gripes. One local tweeted: 'The demolition cam is very intermittent... what are the odds it's offline at the crucial moment? #DidcotDemolition.' The coal-fired power station ceased generating in March last year after dominating the skyline around the town since 1970, with the neighbouring gas-fired Didcot B continuing. The towers' appearance was not universally appreciated with many people finding them an eyesore, although many on Twitter expressed sadness the towers were gone. 'Boom! There goes another piece of my childhood,' one wrote. Another . said: 'Can't believe that 3 of the Didcot towers will be demolished . tonight. A beacon that showed some of us were nearly home.' Hannah Smart wrote: 'Sad to say goodbye to these beauties #DidcotDemolition - iconic Oxfordshire landmark.' Following the demolition some of those who had watched it described it as 'epic', 'pretty dramatic to watch' and 'strangely emotional'. Mark Coleman, managing director of specialist demolition firm, Coleman & Company said it had been job well done. He tweeted: '#DidcotDemolition well done to all involved. A professional textbook job. Thank you to all the locals. I hope you enjoyed it.' The early morning skyline in Didcot provided a wonderful backdrop for the explosion as crews undertook their final preparations for the demolition . This photo of the demolition from a different angle shows the first of the three cooling towers to come down,  crumbling and collapsing as it falls to the ground .

"By . Corey Charlton . Incoming Centrica boss Iain Conn will receive a pay and perks package worth up to £3.7m when he begins . Bills are to be reduced by £12 a year on average after new price controls were agreed by five of the six companies that run Britain’s electricity network. Regulator Ofgem said the cut has been driven by £2.1billion of savings it has secured from the companies’ business plans since last year. The distribution part . of the energy bill - which accounts for 8% of an annual dual fuel bill - . will be on average £12 a year lower than it is today from 2015 - 2023. However, the incoming chief executive of Centrica - which owns British Gas - is in line for a welcoming pay and perks package worth up to £3.7million when he begins his tenure as boss on January 1. It comes as his predecessor and current Centrica chief executive Sam Laidlaw is expected to leave with a bundle worth up to £4 million. Critics yesterday branded Laidlaw's sum ‘a reward for failure’. His . tenure has seen household energy prices increase by more than inflation . every year. The average dual fuel bill now stands at almost £1,300 . a year, compared to £600 when he joined in 2006. His successor, former BP executive Iain Conn, will walk into a £925,000 salary when he takes up his new role, alongside up to £2.7m in perks and bonuses. The exorbitant salary and welcoming package comes at a time when many families are struggling to pay their energy bills and have been branded as 'insulting'. Labour MP John Robertson said: ‘The name Iain Conn is about right – he is conning the public with this insulting salary. ‘His base salary alone is thirty-five times the average salary and would pay the electricity bill of over seven hundred people. ‘Mr . Conn has said he will rebuild trust into the sector. He certainly has . not got off to a good start, and is instead living up to his name.’ Centrica yesterday said Mr Laidlaw would not receive 12 months’ pay when he leaves. Sam Laidlaw will leave Centrica with pay and perks package worth up to £4million at the end of the year . But he will get to keep interests in hundreds of thousands of company shares under a host of lucrative rewards schemes. These . will pay out to him if the group hits performance targets in the coming . years – even though he will no longer be at the firm. He . bowed to public pressure earlier this year by offering to donate his . £851,000 bonus to charity – but sparked outrage by accepting a lucrative . share scheme worth up to £2million just days later. He also holds shares in the company worth more than £6million, built up over almost a decade’s service at the group. Last November, Western Power Distribution was the only company to have its prices agreed early after Ofgem judged its business plan for the eight-year period showed sufficient value for consumers. Ofgem returned five out of the six companies' plans - UK Power Networks, Northern Power Grid, SP Energy Networks, SSE Power Distribution and Electricity North West - because they failed to deliver value for consumers. Since then, companies have identified £700 million of savings and Ofgem has ruled out a further £1.4billion following further analysis. SSE said it was disappointed with a number of elements within the draft determination, including Ofgem's assumptions about the scope of further cost reductions across the industry.","Energy bills to fall by £12 a year after firms agree on new price controls .

Domino's said it was investigating how a customer was sent this pizza totally covered in green mould . But as he raised the crust of the first slice to dip it in barbecue sauce, he spotted a speck of green on the base. Turning over the rest of the pizza he found it completely covered in the mould. Mr Hewett, of Chessington, Surrey, said: 'It’s just revolting. I couldn’t quite believe what I was seeing. It was just coated in green mould. 'My son was in the bath, thankfully, because he was going to have some too. 'I immediately phoned the branch back in Tolworth. I said: ""You’ve just delivered me a pizza covered in mould"".' Mr Hewett described the customer service he received after his purchase last Tuesday evening as 'abysmal' and 'dismissive'. Mr Hewett said he had stomach cramps the day after he ate a whole slice before discovering the mould . He said he got a more satisfactory response by posting these photos on the company’s Twitter and Facebook pages, and was eventually refunded the cost of the pizza. He added he suffered stomach cramps the day after eating the mouldy pizza. A Domino’s spokeswoman said: 'Food quality is of upmost priority and we are working with the franchisee of the Tolworth store to conduct a full and thorough investigation.

'These will become more widespread across East Anglia and southeast England by morning, dying out for a time later in the morning, before further isolated heavy showers and thunderstorms develop again in the afternoon. 'There is also a risk of heavy rain affecting the far southeast at times later today and into Monday night.' Meanwhile, a spokesman said 'very heavy' rainfall in Northolt, north-west London, had seen 1.7in (43mm) fall within three hours. 'The weather front is slowly dissipating and will move south and is weakening. 'It's just restricted to the southeast area. That warning is in place until quarter to midnight tonight so that area is at risk of that heavy rainfall.' Sussex Police warned drivers to be careful as the flash flooding hit Worthing, West Sussex, and Portslade and Mile Oak on the outskirts of Brighton and Hove. Southern Water said it was doing all it could to help customers affected by the sewer network being overwhelmed. The AA said it attended 34 flood-related call outs, mostly around west London and West Sussex. Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: 'Although the flash flooding was forecast, it's more difficult to predict the actual impact on the ground and unfortunately some people this morning found out the hard way that drains struggle to cope with such large deluges. 'Don't risk driving down a flooded road as just a tiny amount of water can wreck your engine - three-quarters of flood-damaged cars are written off. It's far better to turn round and find an alternative route.'

Grass fields turned into giant waterlogged puddles as firemen attempted to pump the water away from the flooded roads . Calm before the storm: The hail and thunderstorms enveloping Brighton in the early hours of the morning - with them came travel chaos and rail service disruptions . A Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said: 'Due to heavy rain and storms this morning parts of the city are experiencing flooding. Essential services are being maintained. The drains will start to carry away the water once the rain subsides. 'City . clean is working with East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service to clear . roadside gullies. The refuse and recycling service is operating normally . but might be a bit slower due to the weather. 'Council . staff are advised that Kings House is closed due to flooding in the . basement which is threatening some of the main electrical panels. Immediate work is under way to clear the water safely and isolate the electrics.' Areas of Essex and also Ruislip to the northwest were caught in the thunderstorms which appeared to avoid central London. Twenty houses were affected by flood water in Ruislip, while up to 1ft of water flooded a ground floor flat in Northolt Road, Harrow. Essex Fire and Rescue Service said it had dealt with 20 incidents in Thaxted following flash flooding - this included rescuing five people from three neighbouring houses, while a road in the town collapsed from the heavy rainfall. A Brighton local wades through the flood water covering the town's roads. The Met Office said the flooding was restricted to southeast England today . The famous Brighton Pier today looked vastly different from last week when it was basking in warm temperatures and thousands of people were on the beach . Brighton Beach was deserted today as rain and hail lashed the region, stranding residents in their own homes and throwing public transport services into disarray . The worst of the rainfall hit Brighton Pier - pictured this morning during the worst of the storm - before slowly making its way southeast across the channel . Sean Penston, Meteogroup forecaster . said there were 'intense' showers across southeast England, with 47.7mm . of rainfall recorded in three hours in Suffolk. 'That's fairly torrential bursts of rain, . there's also frequent lightning going off in a line from London to . Brighton - there's some pretty active thunderstorms.' Thunderstorms also hit Buckinghamshire, with Beaconsfield suffering flash floods that turned roads into rivers. However, it is not likely to hang around. Mr Penston added: 'Tomorrow will be a fine day actually . across the southeast. There should be plenty of sunshine and quite warm weather.

"By . Corey Charlton . Christopher Bridger pictured leaving court. Today he was found guilty of assaults on three separate women . A paramedic was today warned he faces a long prison sentence after a jury convicted him of rape and sex assault charges. Christopher Bridger, 25, used a ruse that he was gay to get close to three women victims before attacking them when they were drunk after boozy nights out. One of the women he assaulted was passed out drunk in a hotel bed with her lesbian lover, while another was a fellow student at St George's University Hospital. The South East Coast Ambulance Service paramedic was found guilty of one count of rape and four other sex abuse charges following a 12-day trial at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey. Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith warned Bridger that he faced a long prison sentence as he remanded him in custody ahead of his sentencing on September 5. The judge ordered a pre-sentence report to be conducted, and said: 'You have been convicted by this jury of some very serious sexual offences. The consequence of that conviction is inevitably a lengthy custodial sentence.' Bridger had . denied all the allegations, accusing all of his victims of lying and . putting them through the ordeal of giving evidence at his trial. He . was acquitted of two further charges of sex assault by penetration and a . sex assault, which had been alleged by two other women he knew. The first victim was a fellow student in September 2008, while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George’s University Hospital in London. He raped the drunk student paramedic at St George’s University Hospital after accompanying her back to her halls following a Freshers’ Week fancy dress party. She told how he started cuddling and kissing her, despite her asking him to stop. He then raped her, but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. He then began working for South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the jury how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at a staff Christmas party the following year. She had been arguing with her girlfriend, who started recording her drunken rant on her mobile phone. Bridget was convicted at Guildford Crown Court in Surrey today after a jury spent four hours deliberating . Audio of that recording was played to the jury, during which Bridger is heard to come into the room and ask the woman for a hug and a kiss, which she obliged to, thinking he was gay. Afterwards, Bridger climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn’t understand what had happened. The day after was Bridger’s birthday and he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Bridger claimed the incidents were just 'drunken fumbles' and that the women were lying . Another said: 'You don’t have to forgive me, I’m just telling you the truth. I’m ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay the night at her house after a dinner in October 2012. The court heard all the women had been told by Bridger - and believed him - that he was openly gay. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to his bosses in late 2012. Following an internal NHS inquiry, Surrey Police arrested Bridger in January 2013 and he denied any involvement, telling detectives that he was a gay man who had been in several same sex relationships. He had been separately arrested by the Metropolitan Police and questioned in relation to the allegations while he was a student paramedic. Bridger did admit having sex with his rape victim but claimed that it was consensual and an experience 'that confirmed I am gay.' He claimed the other incidents had just been 'drunken fumbles' and that the women were lying. Bridger was convicted of rape, two counts of sexual assault, one sexual assault by penetration, and one charge of engaging in a sex act without consent. He was acquitted of two further charges of sex assault by penetration and a sex assault, which had been alleged by two other women he knew. Bridger, of Stevenage, Hertfordshire, had denied all the charges. He was remanded in custody and will be sentenced at Guildford Crown Court on September 5.","Paramedic convicted of sex attacks after convincing victims he was gay .

"By . Corey Charlton . The mother of 3-year-old Mikaeel Kular is a 'demon' for brutally killing her son, hiding the body then claiming he was lost, according to the boy's father. Zahid Saeed, 30, has spoken publicly for the first time about the death of his son at the hands of Rosdeep Adekoya. She was charged with murder but pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of culpable homicide and attempting to defeat the ends of justice at the High Court in Edinburgh on Friday. Scroll down for video . Zahid Saeed pictured leaving court after Rosdeep Adekoya admitted to killing his 3-year-old son Mikaeel. He has labelled her a 'demon' who deserves to suffer everyday, and said he hopes she dies in jail . Killing: Rosdeep Adekoya (left) admitted responsibility for the death of three-year-old son Mikaeel Kular (right) Speaking to the Sun on Sunday, Mr Saeed said: 'She's a demon. She should suffer every day. 'She's not a monster - not even a monster or animal would kill their own child.' Mr Saeed, of Guardbridge, Fife, said that in his opinion justice should be an eye for an eye. He said: 'But I don't want her to rot in hell, I want her to live for eternity so she can remember what she has done and live with the guilt. Mr Saeed was in court to hear details of how Adekoya, 34, repeatedly beat Mikaeel before stuffing his lifeless body into a suitcase. She lost her temper and assaulted the toddler after he was repeatedly sick following a family day out at a Nando's restaurant in Edinburgh on January 12. After he died from his injuries at their city home two days later, she wrapped his body in a duvet cover, concealed it in the suitcase and drove 25 miles to Fife to hide it in woodland. Mikaeel (left) was buried in a suitcase behind the house in Kirkcaldy where his mother (right) once lived . A major search was launched for the youngster after Adekoya phoned 999 and claimed her son was missing in an effort to conceal the crime. She finally admitted to police: 'It was an accident and I panicked.' Adekoya, a prisoner in Cornton Vale jail near Stirling, will be sentenced on August 25. An independent significant case review will now be held after it emerged social services had stopped monitoring the family weeks before Mikaeel's death. In the wake of Adekoya's guilty plea, social services have been accused of failing Mikaeel. Resting place: The small patch of land in Kirkcaldy where the suitcase containing the toddler's body was found . It has emerged Adekoya, 34, twice had her five children taken into care – but on both occasions, they were returned to her by social workers. This was despite neighbours and even her own mother warning the authorities on many occasions that the children were being seriously neglected, left to sleep on filthy mattresses and abandoned for whole weekends while she went out partying with drug dealers, drinking and taking cocaine. And when Adekoya – the daughter of a respectable Hertfordshire GP – moved from Fife to Edinburgh, social services failed to pass on the records about her. This meant that no one was monitoring the welfare of three-year-old Mikaeel and his siblings in the weeks before his death. A whistleblower from the local social services told the Mail: ‘The family were known to social services on and off from when the twins were born.’ The source said the tragedy ‘could have been prevented’ and that Mikaeel would still be alive but for the incompetence of social workers handling the case. ‘Rosie couldn’t cope with looking after them,’ she said. ‘In 2012 she had taken an overdose. There were constant cries for help. 'They were not properly monitored after they moved. There was no communication so Edinburgh did not even have a file on them when Mikaeel went missing.’","Father of 3-year-old Mikaeel Kular breaks silence, says his son's mother is a 'demon' for killing their child and hopes she remains in jail until she dies .

"By . Corey Charlton . The shipwrecked Costa Concordia cruise liner made its final journey yesterday arriving in the northern Italian city of Genoa where it will be scrapped. Pulled by tugboats for 200 miles and nudged by winds, the ship was eased into the port. It took five days for the liner to reach the headquarters of ship owner Costa Crociere Spa where the luxury vessel first set sail after construction in 2005. Thirty-two people were killed when the ship ran aground in the seas near the Tuscan island of Giglio in 2012, making it the worst maritime disaster since the Second World War. Meanwhile, the captain has provoked anger as pictures emerged of him reportedly 'celebrating' a book deal at a publisher's exclusive VIP party on the holiday island of Ischia. Scroll down for video . Transported: The Italian cruise liner Costa Concordia sits today inside Genoa's Voltri Port, Italy. Thirty-two people died onboard when the ship ran aground in 2012 .

At port in Genoa: The Costa Concordia dismantling operations are predicted to last two years . It's here: The cruise liner was made floating again on July 14, 30 months after the cruise ship hit a reef and partly capsized off the island of Giglio in January 2012 . The salvage operation for the ship - pictured as it is towed to Genoa today - is expected to be a long and expensive process that will take two years and cost 1.5billion euros . The ship's . captain Francesco Schettino has been a figure of ridicule and contempt . since the accident, and local media suggested he was celebrating a book . deal at the party. He . is currently on trial for manslaughter, with it alleged he performed a . 'salute' to the island as he tried to impress his Moldovan lover - a . former dancer who worked as a hostess on the ship. Local newspaper Il Golfo . published the images, showing a tanned and happy-looking Schettino . socialising at Italian publisher Pietro Graus's annual 'White Party'. The Sunday Telegraph reported Mr Graus defended inviting Schettino to his party. 'The commander was invited to the event that I organise every year for my publishing house,' he said. The Costa Concordia, a huge floating hotel as long as three football pitches laid end to end, with 13 passenger decks, was carrying some 4,000 passengers and crew when it went down shortly after the start of a Mediterranean cruise . Final journey: The Costa Concordia arriving at Genoa's Voltri Port. The ship's dismantling operations are expected to last two years . As much of the country watched on as the wreckage of the ship, where 32 people died, was towed north, Capt Schettino was attending a VIP party in Ischia . Locals in Genoa watch on as the massive ship - the length of three football fields - is slowly hauled in to the port where operations will begin to salvage scrap metal . Four tugboats and several escort ships were lined up to tow the 114,000-tonne vessel to Genoa after the most daunting salvage operation ever attempted . 'I have a . duty to transfer all the pain, the anger of a man who has always had . before him the silent and endless horizons of the sea.' Twitter users were quick express their condemnation of the captain. One wrote: 'The party organized by the editor @GrausEditore who wanted #Schettino as guest star. Pure disgust.'

"By . Jenny Hope . The long days of summer might harm the chances of fatherhood, claim scientists, but drinking and smoking don’t damage a man’s sperm. A study produces surprising evidence that while more daylight may affect sperm quality, lifestyle factors long thought to have an effect, including obesity, make no difference. Even wearing tight underwear did not have an effect, despite dire warnings previously that prospective dads should invest in boxer shorts. Surprising: The study found that the seasons have an effect of sperm quality while other factors - such as alcohol and obesity - do not . The only lifestyle choice that had a major impact was smoking cannabis, which can reduce a man’s fertility by altering the size and shape of his sperm. A similar effect was discovered in the summer, although experts suggest it isn’t heat but probably the length of the day and hormonal changes that are responsible. When less than 4 per cent of a man’s sperm has a normal size and shape, statistics show he will find it harder to father a child and may need help from fertility techniques, including IVF. Teams from the universities of Sheffield and Manchester carried out the world’s largest study on the effects of lifestyle on sperm. Using data from  2,249 men attending fertility clinics around the UK, they compared the medical history and personal habits of 318 participants with less than 4 per cent of normal sperm and 1,652 whose sperm was of higher quality. Men in the first group were nearly twice as likely to have used cannabis in the three months before giving a sample, if they were aged under 30. They were also nearly twice as likely to have produced the sample in the summer months. The scientists believe younger men were most affected by cannabis simply because they were more likely to use greater quantities. Chemicals in the drug itself, not the tobacco used in ‘joints’, were probably responsible since cigarette smoking had little effect on sperm. One of the team leaders, Dr Allan Pacey, senior lecturer in andrology – the study of male health – at Sheffield University, said habitual cannabis users who wanted to become fathers should kick the habit for at least three months. ‘I can’t tell you definitively that your sperm will improve, but that’s a reasonable assumption,’ he said. He said the summer influence was surprising but it did not appear to be linked to heat or significantly alter seasonal conception patterns. ‘We didn’t expect this,’ he said. ‘It’s complete conjecture on my part, but it could be a sunlight effect. Day-length affects our hormones and  vitamin D in all sorts of ways.’ He added that men wanting to be fathers should not wait until winter. However, the study, published in the journal Human Reproduction, found that abstaining from sexual activity for more than six days improved sperm quality. It was possible that unmeasured factors, such as the quality of sperm DNA, influenced the results, said the researchers. One of the key findings of the study is that men wanting to have children should quit taking cannabis. The drug doubles the risk of men under 30 producing abnormal sperm - something that can have a serious impact on their fertility. Cut it out: Men wanting to have children should quit cannabis as it can have an impact on the size and shape of their sperm, potentially reducing fertility . Dr Allan Pacey said: 'If you are a man trying for a baby then the sensible thing to do is to stop smoking joints but the effect won’t be seen overnight.' 'It takes three months to produce sperm so you can’t stop smoking cannabis on Friday and expect to see an improvement on Monday. You’ve got to stop in June to see an improvement in August,' he added. The exact reason cannabis has an impact on sperm production was not established, but Dr Pacey says the connection 'jumped out of the analysis.' 'I think it’s a real effect, and it’s not been shown before in such a robust way,' he said. 'The fact that we see this in younger men suggests that we are seeing a dose effect. Younger men may be more inclined to smoke cannabis more frequently and in higher doses than older men,' he went on to say.","World's largest study on the effects of lifestyle on sperm has been published .

"By . Jenny Hope . Concerned: Allan Pacey, chairman of the British Fertility Society has said: 'We simply do not have enough sperm donors in the UK' Women using donor sperm may be more likely to get pregnant if the man is over 40, according to UK scientists. The first major study to investigate the effect of male age on fertility treatment using donor sperm found no significant difference in the rate of live babies born whether the man was middle-aged or much younger. But women were slightly more likely to have a baby if the sperm was donated by a man in his 40s, probably because he had already proved his fertility by having a family of his own. Current UK guidelines suggest men should not be accepted as donors over the age of 40. Donations from older men have previously been linked to greater risk of miscarriage and birth defects. In the light of the latest findings experts say it could be time to rethink the guidelines to ease the acute shortage of donors. The study is to be presented tomorrow at the Annual Meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Munich. Optimistic: The findings suggest that a woman's chances of IVF success are the same, whether she uses sperm by an older or younger man . Scientists . looked at 40,000 treatment cycles involving donor sperm between 1991 and . 2012 from the database held by the UK fertility watchdog, the Human . Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. The findings showed no significant differences in the rate of live babies born relative to the age of the donor. For . sperm donors under 20, the birth rate using IVF techniques was 28.3 per . cent, rising to 30.4 per cent when the donors was aged 41 to 45 years. In donor insemination patients, the birth rate was 9.7 per cent with a . donor aged under 20, and 12 per cent with a donor aged 41 to 45. Dr . Meenakshi Choudhary, from the Newcastle Fertility Centre, led the study . with colleague Dr Navdeep Ghuman. Dr . Choudhary said: ‘It’s sperm quality rather than male age that matters. Our study shows that we are good at selecting the right sperm donors . with the right sperm quality – and that’s why we found no difference in . live birth rate despite the increasing age of sperm donors.’ Women . could be slightly less likely to get pregnant using sperm from younger . donors because these men may not have proven fertility, unlike older men . who have probably already had a family, Dr Choudhary said. She . added: ‘Advanced paternal age has also been associated with long-term . disorders in offspring. But the available evidence is limited.’ The . HFEA’s code of practice advises clinics not to use sperm donors over . the age of 45, but guidelines for doctors suggest 40 as the cut-off . point. The study included older men because the data goes back in time . beyond recent guidelines. Experts . are concerned at the shortage of donor sperm and eggs. Some blame a . change in UK law in 2005 requiring sperm donors to reveal their . identities to any children born to them when the child reaches 18. Sarah . Norcross, director of ethics campaigners the Progress Educational . Trust, said: ‘Given the need for more sperm donors in the UK, perhaps it . is time for the guidelines on sperm donation to be reviewed in light of . this study, to consider extending the upper age limit.’ But . Professor Allan Pacey, chairman of the British Fertility Society, said . there was a ‘very small but detectable’ rise in disorders of children . born to older sperm donors. ‘The . study does not answer the question about the health of the children,’ he said. ‘I think I would be worried about raising the age limit for . sperm donors to 45 because of the possible effects on the health of . children.’nior doctors have claimed that the quality of sperm donors is falling because of a shortage in British fertility clinics.","Allan Pacey, head of the British Fertility Society, says demand is too high .

"By . Jenny Hope . An ‘astonishing’ drug that has apparently cured a man dying of skin cancer was hailed by doctors yesterday. They say the results of medical trials are ‘jaw-dropping’ and offer hope for victims of other forms of cancer. The medicine, pembrolizumab, is the latest in a new generation of ‘immunotherapy’ treatments that prevent cancers from shielding themselves from the immune system. Instead it lets the immune system attack the disease, often in conjunction with other conventional drugs. Doctors say 'jaw-dropping' results from medical trials involving medicine pembrolizumab could offer hope for millions of cancer sufferers (stock pic) The drug was tested on melanoma because the prospects for patients with advanced forms of the disease are so grim –  only 10 per cent of men and 35 per cent of women survive a year. But in the trial involving 411 patients, 69 per cent were still alive 12 months after starting on immunotherapy. The ‘cured’ patient, 64-year-old Warwick Steele from Ruislip, west London, has had six months of treatment with the drug, which is injected into the bloodstream. After three months his tumours had almost vanished and they show no sign of returning. His consultant, David Chao of the Royal Free in London, said: ‘We cannot say for certain that he’s been cured, but he is doing very well. ‘He was aware that without an effective treatment his survival prospects were not good – maybe months. Pembrolizumab looks like it has potential to be a paradigm shift for cancer therapy and is firmly helping to establish immunotherapy as one of the most exciting and promising treatment modalities in recent years. A 64-year-old man from London, who had six months of treatment with the drug, improved dramatically . ‘This is one of several new drugs of this type being produced. What these early trials are showing is that they are fulfilling their promise ridiculously fast. ‘Some of these results are really astonishing; almost jaw-dropping. And these drugs may be applicable to many different cancer types, including ones that are hard to treat such as lung cancer. ‘Cancers adapt to treatments, and when they come back they are harder to treat. Can we dream about actually curing some of our patients with very advanced cancer? ‘Once we get the immune system attacking the cancer, can it act independently to keep the cancer under control? ‘We don’t have all the answers yet, but that’s what we’re looking at.’ Pembrolizumab is a man-made antibody that blocks a biological pathway – programmed cell death 1 or PD-1 – that cancers use to shield themselves from the immune  system. In healthy individuals,  PD-1 is part of the process that applies a ‘brake’ to the immune system. By removing the brake, the immune system is freed to do the job of defeating the cancer. Pembrolizumab was generally well tolerated by the trial patients, said Dr Chao, although responses varied widely. Results were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. Clinicians do not yet know exactly how pembrolizumab might affect survival chances. After 18 months, 62 per cent of patients were still alive and undergoing treatment. Around 80 per cent of patients responded to the drug in some way – an unusually high proportion. Seventy-two per cent experienced tumour shrinkage, including 39 per cent whose tumours were more than halved in size. Additional data showed the drug also reduced the size of advanced non-small cell lung cancers by up to 47 per cent. It is being tested on 30 forms of the disease, including cancers of the head and neck. The drug was tested on melanoma (pictured) because the prospects for patients with advanced forms of the disease are grim - only 10 per cent of men and 35 per cent of women survive a year . Pembrolizumab’s American manufacturer, Merck Sharp & Dohme, is expected to apply for a European licence to market the drug within months. It is being fast-tracked in the US. The price is not known. Each year, around 13,300 people in the UK are diagnosed with melanoma – more than a third of them under 55. Gillian Nuttall, founder of the charity Melanoma UK, said: ‘Advanced melanoma is a terrible disease with a poor prognosis. ‘Pembrolizumab represents the latest advance in a whole raft of new treatments in advanced melanoma which have come through over the past few years. ‘These results are really exciting and could represent a turning point for patients affected by advanced melanoma giving them a greater chance of survival.’","'Immunotherapy' drug pembrolizumab lets immune system attack the disease .

It has led to calls for a new criminal offence of cyber bullying as concerns grow that the most vulnerable could be at risk of self-harm or suicide. Many youngsters are scared to reject the approach of strangers on social media because they fear they will become a target for abuse, a study suggests (file picture, posed by model) The death of 14-year-old Hannah Smith last year after apparently being the victim of online bullying resulted in her father David calling for action against internet trolls, though an inquest this week was told by police there was no evidence the girl from Lutterworth, Leicestershire, had been targeted. Previous studies have shown cyber-bullying is on the increase, with girls most likely to suffer. The research from Nottingham Trent University found texting and email harassment is now less common than bullying on social media. Dr Lucy Betts, senior lecturer in psychology, and researcher Karin Spenser studied 29 children aged 11 to 15 years as part of a bigger project  on cyber bullying. Children in their mid teens report being regularly approached by strangers who want to be their ‘friends’ on Facebook and other social media, said Mrs Spenser. ‘They think it’s safer to accept a stranger than reject them, even though they recognise the dangers,’ she said. The father of Hannah Smith, 14, pictured, called for action against internet trolls after his daughter was apparently bullied online. However, an inquest this week heard there was no evidence she was targeted . ‘Partly this is peer pressure to have as many friends as possible – saying you have 1,000 friends gives you a lot of kudos. ‘But they feel powerless to say no even when they’re horrified that someone has got hold of their details and come into their life. ‘They don’t recognise the public nature of social media and they don’t realise how many people can get access to them outside their core group of friends.’ Mrs Spenser said cyber abuse was different to face-to-face bullying, which normally took the form of repeated harassment through insults or physical aggression. She said a ‘one-off’ incident online could have much bigger repercussions. ‘A nasty remark that gains  100 “likes” from friends or others is devastating, the sheer volume of response can be amazing. ‘What’s worse is that children feel a compulsion to keep looking online 24/7,’ she added. Mrs Spenser, who is a magistrate, said she would like to see cyber bullying become a criminal offence. ‘We are seeing far more examples now in the criminal justice system and we don’t have the tools to deal with it.’ The study findings were presented yesterday at the British Psychological Society conference in Birmingham.","Nottingham Trent University research found growing rate of online bullying .

"By . Jenny Hope . Being on first name terms with work colleagues may seem friendly, but NHS staff have decided it can be a little too familiar. A new drive for ‘professional courtesy’ at one NHS Trust means staff will address each other more formally in future. Pressure from senior staff at Kent Community Health NHS Trust has led to a policy telling staff not to use first names without a title - unless permission has been expressly given. A new drive for 'professional courtesy' at one NHS Trust means staff will address each other more formally in future (stock picture) No longer will a doctor or nurse use first names only when speaking to each other. Instead, they will say 'Sister Megan' or 'Nurse Lisa' - a tradition that has been dying out. ‘There has been unease among senior staff at being addressed by their first name, particularly by junior staff ‘ said Trust source. ‘It was noticed that cleaners and clerks were talking to senior personnel as if they had known them for years’ they added. It comes after there has been unease among senior staff at being addressed by their first name, particularly by junior staff . The Trust has now introduced a professional courtesy conduct rule whereby staff no longer just use first names. It comes after consistent complaints by patients that they object to their first names being used by NHS staff who are strangers. A number of Trusts have responded with new rules, saying staff will ask patients how they wish to be addressed, for example as Mrs or Ms. Staff are also advised to avoid lapsing into over-familiarity unless this is acceptable to, and agreed by the patient. Using colloquial terms such as ‘dear’ and ‘petal’ are banned by Dorset County Hospital, for example, unless the patient’s agreement has been sought. Patients at Kent Community Health Trust now want to get in on the act, according to a letter published in its internal journal. ‘May I ask that you consider also asking your staff to refrain from using first names for patients unless the patient specifically asks them to’ writes a former patient from Maidstone. ‘I am aware that many patients do prefer the use of a first name and this should obviously be an option. ‘However, some people prefer not to be infantilised by the use of their first names and the use of ‘ dear’ and ‘ darling’, particularly with more elderly patients. ‘Patients should be given as much respect as nurses and doctors have’ says the letter. The Trust source said the idea was ‘under consideration’.","A Kent NHS Trust has a policy banning use of first names without a title .

"By . Jenny Hope . Eczema, as any sufferer will attest, can be a real pain. But there may be a silver lining, it seems, as the condition may lower the risk of developing skin cancer. People with eczema have an overactive immune system which means their skin easily becomes dry and prone to infection. But this so-called defective skin barrier may also help them shed potentially cancerous cells from the skin and so protect against one of the most common types of skin cancer, squamous cell cancer (SCC). Silver lining: Eczema sufferers have an overactive immune system drying out their skin, however this may help shed potentiality cancerous cells from the skin . Previous studies have suggested that having eczema may cut the risk of skin cancer. But it is difficult to draw firm conclusions based on studies of humans because eczema symptoms vary in severity and drugs used to treat the condition might also influence cancer. A new study from King’s College, London, is the first to show that allergy caused by the skin defects could actually protect against skin cancer. People with eczema have an overactive immune system which means their skin easily becomes dry, inflamed and prone to infection. There are no cures but medical moisturisers called emollients are used to keep the skin lubricated, backed up by topical steroid creams to control flare-ups. Common ailment: There are about 12 million children in Britain, of which one in five has been diagnosed with eczema, around 2.4 million . There are about 12 million children in Britain, of which one in five has been diagnosed with eczema, around 2.4 million. A new study published online in eLife journal is the first to show that allergy caused by the skin defects could actually protect against skin cancer. Eczema can result from the loss of structural proteins in the outermost layers of the skin, leading to a defective skin barrier. Genetically engineered mice lacking three skin barrier proteins - called ‘knock-out’ mice - were used to replicate some of the skin defects found in eczema sufferers. The researchers compared the effects of two cancer-causing chemicals in normal mice and the knock-out mice. The number of SCC tumours per mouse was six times lower in knock-out mice than in normal mice. The findings suggest that defects in the epidermal barrier protected the genetically engineered mice against tumour formation. Researchers found that both types of mice were equally susceptible to acquiring cancer-causing mutations. However, an exaggerated inflammatory reaction in knock-out mice led to enhanced shedding of potentially cancerous cells from the skin. This cancer-protective mechanism bears similarities to that which protects skin from environmental assaults such as bacteria. Breakthrough: This most recent study is the first to show that allergy caused by the skin defects could actually protect against skin cancer . Professor Fiona Watt, of King’s College, said: ‘We are excited by our findings as they establish a clear link between cancer susceptibility and an allergic skin condition in our experimental model. ‘They also support the view that modifying the body’s immune system is an important strategy in treating cancer. ‘I hope our study provides some small consolation to eczema sufferers - that this uncomfortable skin condition may actually be beneficial in some circumstances.’ The researchers were funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Wellcome Trust and Cancer Research UK charity. Skin cancer is a common and growing problem, accounting for one in every three cancers diagnosed worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Malignant melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer, affecting almost 10,000 Britons a year, but more than 76,500 people are diagnosed with non-melanoma skin cancers such as SCC each year. It is estimated the true figure could be at least 100,000 because this cancer is far more likely to go unreported. Dr Mike Turner, Head of Infection and Immunobiology at the Wellcome Trust, said ‘Skin cancer is on the rise in many countries and any insight into the body’s ability to prevent tumour formation is valuable in the fight against this form of cancer. ‘These findings that eczema can protect individuals from skin cancer support theories linking allergies to cancer prevention and open up new avenues for exploration whilst providing some (small) comfort for those suffering from eczema.’","Eczema sufferers have an overactive immune system drying out their skin .

"By . Claudia Joseph . Prince William, pictured in his RAF flying gear is to announce he will become a helicopter pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance . Nine months after he gave up his wings as an RAF search-and-rescue pilot, Prince William has been lured back to a flying job. The Duke of Cambridge will announce he is to become a helicopter pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance service rather than taking a full-time Royal role. He and Kate are planning to base themselves at Anmer Hall, on the Sandringham Estate, which lies midway between the air ambulance service bases at Norwich and Cambridge. The move will enable William to see Prince George on a regular basis. He is likely to be one of six pilots, mainly from military backgrounds, who fly the ambulance service’s  two yellow twin-engine EC 135 T2 helicopters, which can reach 135 knots (150mph). They can get to anywhere in the counties of Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk in 25 minutes. All are employed by Bond Air Services, with salaries ranging  from £40,000 to £60,000, but it is not known if William will be paid. Work is on a rota of five days on, three  days off, for 365 days a year. As the only air ambulance service in the country with night vision technology, William will expect to fly at night as well as daytime, working ten-hour shifts. However, when he is on official engagements, the Prince will travel in a more luxurious manner: the Queen is leasing an £8million Agusta Westland A109S helicopter to fly members of the Royal Family on official engagements. The money will be paid for out of the Sovereign Grant. The aircraft, which bears the Royal crest, has leather seats and a top speed of 180mph. It will be available to all the Royals – but as William and Kate step up their official engagements, they are likely to spend most time on board. William has made no secret of the fact that he misses flying since he left his post at RAF Valley on Anglesey last September, where he flew a Sea King helicopter. In a BBC documentary last year he spoke of his pride in the job. ‘I don’t think there’s any greater calling in life,’ he said. One of the two East Anglian Air Ambulance's that Prince William could soon be piloting . Since then he has been taking what aides describe as ‘a transitional year’, attending a ten-week land management course at Cambridge University and launching his United for Wildlife charity. But he has admitted he was itching to get back in the cockpit. During a trip to an aviation museum, on his recent tour of New Zealand, he said that the historic military aircraft made him ‘long to be flying again’ and revealed he was hoping to get his commercial pilot’s licence as well as his military wings and private flying licence. And, last month, he asked to meet the crew, staff and charity trustees of the Scottish Air Ambulance, making a beeline for their twin-engine Bolkow 105 helicopter parked on  the playing field of Strathearn Community College in Crieff. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are planning to base themselves at Anmer Hall, pictured, which is on the Sandringham Estate . The Duchess may have mixed feelings about her husband returning  to the cockpit. In the foreword to a book about RAF wives published last month, she wrote: ‘I loved my time in Anglesey when William was serving with RAF search-and-rescue. 'I cannot pretend I didn’t feel anxious at times when William was on shift in howling gales, but he loved doing it and I felt incredibly proud.’ The East Anglian Air Ambulance service, run as a charity, was launched by jockey Frankie Dettori in 2000 after he survived a plane crash. A spokesman for Kensington Palace said the Duke had made it clear he was considering this option as part of his public service duties. A spokesman for East Anglian Air Ambulance said: ‘We know that he  is considering his options but that is all we are aware of at this stage.'","Prince will announce he is to become a pilot with East Anglian Air Ambulance .

"By . Jerard Hurst . and Jenny Hope . Rachel Merchant was just 17 when she was given the devastating news that she would never be able to have children. Doctors told her she had suffered an early menopause which had left her infertile. Now, nearly 20 years on, she has confounded the medical profession by giving birth to a daughter, Holly. Rachel Merchant with daughter Holly, who gave birth despite going through the menopause aged 17 . Miss Merchant, who lives in Derby with her fiance John Gatt in Derby couldn't believe it when she fell pregnant . Specialists told Miss Merchant, now 36, that the condition must have reversed, although they cannot explain why. ‘My consultant said that in her 30 years as a gynaecologist she had never seen a natural reversal in anyone diagnosed with premature menopause as a teenager,’ Miss Merchant said. The first signs that she might be recovering came in 2012 when she experienced some bleeding. Miss Merchant was told she had undergone early menopause but then went on to give birth . Early menopause is rare in younger women, affecting around one in 1,000 under 30s. It occurs when the ovaries fail, which can be caused by genetic problems or infections such as mumps or malaria. It can also be triggered by treatments such as chemotherapy. Many sufferers have to rely on IVF treatment to become pregnant, almost always using a donor egg. But younger women could start to menstruate again, even years after the diagnosis. Up to 10 per cent of women with ovarian failure can conceive on their own, usually because some healthy eggs remain in the body. Confused by conflicting advice from doctors about whether she should stop taking HRT, which she had been prescribed aged 17, Miss Merchant decided to seek the advice of a top consultant at London’s Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Miss Mechant says she still can't believe that Holly, pictured is here following her fertility issues . The specialist confirmed the original diagnosis and told her she should continue to take HRT. In the meantime Miss Merchant discovered she was pregnant. ‘We couldn’t believe it,’ she said. ‘It was as if the HRT had kick-started my body in some way, but there is no way of really knowing why it happened.’ According to a 2011 study, as many as one in 20 women suffers an early menopause, when they stop having periods, sometimes for no medical reason, before the age of 40. It puts them at greater risk of a heart attack, stroke and bone disease in later life which is why HRT is prescribed to replace lost oestrogen. The drug does not prevent them getting pregnant, however, and under 50s are told to use contraception for two years after their periods have stopped. Dr Nick Panay, patron of The Daisy Network, a support group for women having premature menopause, said: ‘Although women are informed that [the condition] is irreversible, occasionally there can be recovery of ovarian functioning due to some eggs still being present in the ovaries. This can lead to periods restarting and even pregnancy. ‘It is because of cases such as this we have recommended that the condition should be renamed Premature Ovarian Insufficiency. ‘There is some evidence that HRT might help and we offer our patients the option of short ‘hormone holidays’ as a test of whether their ovaries are showing any signs of recovery.’ Miss Merchant and fiance Jon Gatt, who live in Derby, welcomed Holly to the family in December, and are now hoping for another child. She added: ‘I still can’t believe Holly is here. It is something I never, ever expected.’","Rachel Merchant told she would never have children when she was 17 .

"By . Jenny Hope . Errors in hospital waiting list times have undermined public confidence in the data, claims a public spending watchdog. The Public Accounts Committee called for independent audits in future after spot checks found one in four hospitals recording false waiting list times. It said hospital Trusts were 'struggling with a hotchpotch' of IT and paper-based systems that made it difficult to compare their performance. One in four hospitals checked were found to be misrecording data on waiting times . Margaret Hodge, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said patients are being deprived of choice . For example, there were variations on how many cancellations patients were allowed to make of planned surgery before having to go back to their GP which affected when the waiting time 'clock' was re-started. PAC chairman Margaret Hodge MP, said 'If patients cannot be confident of accurate comparable data on the performance of hospitals they cannot exercise choice. 'Both GPs and their patients need reliable and comparable information about the waiting time performance of individual trusts so that they can make an informed choice about where to be treated.' The committee's report published today says the National Audit Office found records of waiting times riddled with errors. Spot checks carried out by the NAO showed in more than half of cases, hospital trusts were either wrongly recording data about waiting lists or keeping incomplete records. Dr Mark Porter: 'It's vitally important that information on waiting times is accurate and reliable' The NAO found details were falsely recorded in 26 per cent of the cases examined - most often because NHS administrators were 'starting the clock' at the wrong times, or routinely pausing official waiting times. NHS targets, introduced by Labour in 2008, state that 90 per cent of patients who need inpatient care and 95 per cent who require outpatient treatment should wait no longer than 18 weeks. Mrs Hodge said 'Public confidence in the success hospital trusts have had in meeting the 18 week waiting time target is inevitably undermined by errors in trusts' recording of waiting time information. 'Waiting list data needs to be independently audited.' She said the committee was 'sceptical' about the chances of the new e-Referrals appointment system - due to replace online Choose and Book - being any better used. Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association council, said 'Waiting for an operation or treatment can be a worrying and stressful time for patients, so it's vitally important that information on waiting times is accurate and reliable. 'It is also essential so that GPs can provide patients with the right information on waiting times, as this can affect where they decide to seek treatment. 'Ministers need to ensure data collection is consistent and reliable. However a rise in the number of private providers and the fragmentation of services, resulting from the government's top down reorganisation, has made this harder, not easier to achieve.'","Calls for independent audits in future to stop misrecording of figures .

"By . Claudia Joseph . The Duchess of Cornwall shows  off her down-to-earth tastes – reading a rip-roaring bestseller and wearing a Marks & Spencer swimming costume on holiday in Majorca – even if she is relaxing on a £50 million yacht. She was spotted last week aboard the yacht ‘Leander G’, enjoying a Mediterranean break with some friends. And the Duchess had prepared for her trip with some high street shopping, judging by the royal-blue one-piece she was wearing. The simple costume with white straps, apparently from M&S, is from a previous season and cost about £20. Relaxed: The Duchess of Cornwall chats with a friend on holiday in Majorca . Casting off: Camilla devours her beach read . It was one of three – including a pink polka-dot and a flowery blue number – that Camilla wore during the day spent sunbathing and swimming with girl pals. The 246ft yacht is owned by car park tycoon Sir Donald Gosling. It can be chartered for up to £440,000 a week when Sir Donald  is not entertaining guests such as Joan Collins and Sir Tim Rice. In years gone by, Elizabeth Taylor also visited. Camilla’s trip to the Balearic Islands was a perfect break for a woman who has long been known as a sun-lover. And no beach break would be complete without a book to read (a paper book; no Kindles for the Royals!). Camilla’s choice was the appropriately titled Casting Off, by Elizabeth Jane Howard, who was married to Kingsley Amis and had a much-publicised affair with Laurie Lee. Steady how you go: Camilla is known to be a fan of soaking up some rays . Head above water: Camilla cools off in the balmy waters . It is the fourth in the Cazalet Chronicles, a series of novels following the lives of an upper-middle-class English family during and after the Second World War. The books, which are semi-autobiographical, have been called a ‘guilty pleasure’ but Camilla displayed no signs of guilt, taking regular dips in the sea and chatting happily. Perhaps her ease was in part because Sir Donald, who was knighted in 1976, has developed a close friendship with the Royal Family and has been discreetly lending them Leander G since the Royal Yacht Britannia was decommissioned. He loaned the vessel to the Queen for her jubilee celebrations and Camilla has stayed aboard at least three times. She and Prince Charles used it for an official tour of the Caribbean in 2008 and she doesn’t seem to have been deterred by the severe bout of seasickness she suffered then in choppy waters. This time the sea was calm when Camilla, 66, arrived in the Balearics on Monday for the mini-cruise with her protection officer and some lady pals. Royal baths: Camilla decides to do some floating as she unwinds off the Balearic Islands . Despite the glorious sunshine, however, a shadow was cast over Camilla’s holiday by the death of another figure from those days. At home, Prince Charles is mourning his friend Hugh Van Cutsem, whom he met while at  Cambridge University. The Prince was ‘hit very hard’ by the death of Mr Van Cutsem, who was his confidant during the break-up of his marriage to Princess Diana. Van Cutsem’s house, Anmer Hall, on the Sandringham Estate, was where Charles and Camilla discussed their future together. The Royal couple will appear in public together on Wednesday when Camilla will join her husband hosting a reception in the gardens of Clarence House to mark 21 years  of Duchy Originals products.Expect Camilla to be sporting  a suntan.","The Duchess of Cornwall took a holiday in Majorca .

"By . David Wilkes . and Claudia Joseph . When they decided to put an extension on their home, Nicola and Paul Walling were simply hoping for extra space to enjoy family life. But instead, they discovered their modern property was playing host to a macabre echo of history. Underneath their back garden a builder found the partial skeletons of at least two French prisoners captured in the Napoleonic Wars. Uncovered: The centuries-old remains of these French prisoners of war were found buried behind a house in Fareham, Hampshire . The chilling remains, including part of a jaw with three teeth still in it, were buried behind the £400,000 four-bedroom detached house on an estate in Fareham, Hampshire. Experts established the bones are of two or three ‘well built’ men and their state of preservation suggests they are up to 300 years old. Thousands of prisoners were captured and brought back to Britain where they were incarcerated during the conflict with Napoleon from 1803 to 1815. Shock: Nicola and Paul Walling were unaware of the macabre remains under their garden . But Mr Walling, 45, a software consultant, knew nothing of this when he looked out of the window one day and saw two policemen in his garden talking to the builder. He went outside and was shown about 40 bones. For a heart-stopping moment the couple, who have two teenage daughters, feared they were at the centre of a mystery worthy of their favourite crime drama, Silent Witness. Mrs Walling, 42, who works in sales, said: ‘It was a huge shock. We are huge fans of the TV programme but we certainly did not expect to find bodies buried in the garden. ‘Our builder had found some bones. At first he thought they were animal remains but then he found a larger bone and guessed it was human... he called his boss, who told him to phone the police.’ A crime scene forensic officer was unable to date the bones so he sent them to Southampton University to be examined by archaeologists. The couple’s new-build property is near Portchester Castle, where around 7,000 French prisoners were held during the Napoleonic Wars because existing jails were full. Archaeologist David Hopkins, of Hampshire council, said the Wallings’ home also lies about 100 yards from the site of a prison hospital from the conflict. Similar burials were found nearby 30 years ago. Captured: The French skeletons are though to have been soldiers in Napoleon's army, which was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo, shown above . Captured Frenchmen were held on ex-Navy ships in nearby Portsmouth harbour, from the 1770s to 1850s. Many died from diseases, but it is not known how those in the Wallings’ garden met their fate. Mrs Walling said: ‘The archaeologist asked us whether we would allow them to rebury the bones in the garden and we agreed… Now we have got used to the idea, we are quite excited about it.’","Nicola and Paul Walling unearthed the bones in Fareham, Hampshire .

"By . Claudia Joseph . and Sarah Oliver . Call-girl: Baronet's daughter Charlotte Colquhoun, pictured, is locked in a furious fight with the stables of multi-millionaire City boss Robin Geffen . Even for a man who plays the stock market for a living, giving a racehorse to a high-class call-girl was always going to be a bit of a risk. And now the stables of multi-millionaire investment fund manager Robin Geffen are locked in a furious fight with aristocratic escort Charlotte Colquhoun over the fate of the once much-fancied King of Wands. The horse, which belongs to Mr Geffen, was given to brunette Charlotte, 37, on the understanding that she would hack out on him and show him off in the ring. She was also supplied with a full set of leather tack. Mr Geffen made a payment of £2,000 in February to Charlotte for King of Wands’ upkeep. But to the dismay of the City titan, whose Neptune Fund Management is valued at £85 million by The Sunday Times, the £140-an-hour prostitute has put the injury-prone King of Wands up for sale behind his back. The gelding has been entered into an equine auction at Ascot on Tuesday. She has put him up for sale as a wildcard (or late) entry. He is listed in the Brightwells Ascot Sales Catalogue at Lot 48. Now Mr Geffen’s racing manager Charlie Liverton is begging Charlotte to give the horse back. Last week Mr Liverton emailed Charlotte – who is a gifted rider – saying: ‘I am very sorry to see that the King of Wands has been given a wildcard entry into the Brightwells Sales at Ascot next week and wondered if there was anything we could do to help? ‘As you know, he was given to you so that you could show him in the ring and enjoy him on hacks, and we duly sent a full set of tack, including saddle, with him on the understanding that this was where his future lay. We are therefore slightly perturbed to see him in the Ascot sale. Injury-prone: The £140-an-hour  prostitue has put the once much-fancied King of Wands, pictured, up for sale . ‘Would you be able to advise as to why you are now having to sell him? Could we look at taking him back off your hands and find him another suitable home? 'Our worry, of course, is his injury and the fact that he might well end up back in a racing yard, which would only cause him harm. We would like to prevent that if it were at all possible please.’ But Charlotte – the illegitimate eldest daughter of old Etonian baronet Sir Malcolm Colquhoun – is adamant King of Wands is hers to sell. ‘I am selling King of Wands because of a change of circumstances,’ she told The Mail on Sunday from her home in a Herefordshire village. ‘I’m having a clean-out of stock and am getting some new horses in.’ Successful: Investment fund manager Mr Geffen (left), 56, is pictured with other owners at the races . Mr Geffen denied knowing Miss Colquhoun, claiming she was a ‘fantasist’. He later confirmed he made a payment of £2,000 to her for the upkeep of the horse. King of Wands broke down in May 2012, and was sent to the Heart of Wales livery stable on February 7 this year. ‘He went with a new set of tack and on February 8, I paid £2,000 to cover two years cost of stabling him. This is usual practice when placing retired, broken-down racehorses,’ Mr Geffen said last night. Charlotte, who works as an escort under the pseudonym Charlie Foxtrot, is believed to have stabled the horse at the Welsh yard. The mother of two was exposed this year as a prostitute who encouraged wealthy clients to enjoy her services by trading on her aristocratic lineage. Her estranged father is a clan chieftain with 45,000 acres of land along the banks of Loch Lomond. Wealthy: Ms Colquhoun's father owns 45,000 acres of land, including the Loch Lomond estate, pictured . Charlotte, who was born to a girlfriend of the baronet before he was married, even posted a copy of the Colquhoun family crest alongside intimate pictures of herself on her Facebook page. She took to prostitution to bankroll a luxury lifestyle and was unashamed to have been unmasked in the media earlier this year, saying her work as an escort enabled her to keep two retired racehorses, four spaniels and to spend her time enjoying country pursuits. Mr Geffen, 56, who lives with his wife Camilla, 53, and two sons in a £2.5 million house near London’s exclusive Hurlingham Club, likes to maintain a low profile despite his substantial fortune. He set up the Neptune Investment Management Fund in 2001 from an office in Hammersmith, West London, and it has expanded to employ 112 people and manage £6.25 billion worth of assets. He sees horse racing as a relaxing hobby. ‘I have a high-pressure job and for the first five years after setting up Neptune, I had very little time. For me, though, a day’s racing is like a week’s holiday,’ he said. ‘I’m a pretty modest operator, I don’t lead a wild life and I work bloody hard. But going racing is a collective thing – we all get our pleasures from it in our different ways.’ Mr Geffen bought King of Wands, his first horse, in 2010 for an estimated £250,000 from breeder Philippa Cooper. The seven-year-old gelding – a son of Derby winner Galileo – has won £67,744 in prizemoney but has failed to fulfil its potential after straining a tendon. He is expected to fetch up to £10,000 at auction. Mrs Cooper is also distraught the horse is being sold, fearing his injury might see him sold for slaughter. She said: ‘You would not know to look at him that he has had a serious injury. If you put a horse in the Ascot sale, it’s like the last-chance saloon. You have the meat men there.’","Escort Charlotte Colquhoun was given once much-fancied King of Wands .

"By . Claudia Joseph . Lying undiscovered in a box in an attic for nearly 40 years, these are the unseen images of the Rolling Stones at a photo shoot for one of their most iconic albums. At the height of their fame in 1971, the band is captured chatting, laughing and occasionally Mick Jagger is even yawning nonchalantly as they pose for their Sticky Fingers album cover. The pictures, taken by photographer Peter Webb, show guitarist Mick Taylor in one of his first official appearances with Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman. Leaning Stones: Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Mick Jagger, Bill Wyman and Mick Taylor in one of the 1971 images . Jack Flash: Mick Jagger in a flatcap in the photoshoot that could have been used instead of the infamous zipper . In the end only a few images were ever released and the band eventually opted for their infamous and suggestive zipper cover, created by Andy Warhol and Craig Braun. However, the final colour image ‘Leaning Stones’ from the shoot was published and voted by Q Magazine as one of the top 100 rock ’n’ roll photographs of all time. A grainy black and white image entitled ‘The Big Yawn’ with Jagger standing to one side yawning while Wyman scratches his nose was printed on the inside sleeve of the album – their first of the 1970s and first to be released on their new label, Rolling Stones Records. For many critics it is the band’s best album. The collection of photographs was only discovered after Webb’s brother-in-law, Bill Pierce, also a photographer, found the negatives in a dust-covered box in his attic. ‘After they were found I walked around with this huge smile on my face for days,’ says Webb. ‘Who would have thought 40 years later the Rolling Stones would still be touring?’ Standing Stones: The band appear in relaxed mood for this shot taken at the height of their fame . Casual: Mick Jagger yawns and Bill Wyman picks his nose in a picture that was used for the record's inside sleeve . This is one of the many images that went unseen after the shoot which was commissioned for Sticky Fingers . Webb, a Cambridge graduate, learnt his trade in America as an assistant to photographer and film director Howard Zieff, whose films include Private Benjamin and My Girl. On his return to London he made his name as an advertising photographer and was spotted by David Puttnam, the filmmaker who at the time was working as a photographer’s agent. The future Lord Puttnam invited Webb to shoot his ‘friends’ the Rolling Stones for the cover of Sticky Fingers. After the band showed little interest in his original ideas, Webb decided to photograph them in a line up ‘like Dad’s Army’. He recalled: ‘I had been advised by a photographer friend that the band “were trouble” to photograph and they could end up throwing V-signs to the camera.’ Discovered: These shots of Keith Richards (right) and Mick Jagger (left) are just two of the many photographs unearthed from negatives in a dusty box in the attic of photographer Peter Webb . Uninterested? They showed 'little interest' in Webb's ideas until he suggested lining up 'like Dad's Army' But he found the band to be surprisingly well behaved. Webb said: ‘They were not only compliant to my instructions in arranging them, but even seemed somewhat camera shy, which was totally unexpected. ‘I had to ask them to act a little more threateningly, to which they duly obliged.’ He then took portraits of each band member, provoking Jagger to remark: ‘Passports is it now, mate?’ After the shoot, Webb went on to set up his own studio, directing the BAFTA-winning film Butch Minds the Baby and Give My Regards to Broad Street. But, caught up in the excitement of transforming his dark room into a cutting room, he forgot that he had handed his brother-in-law a folder of negatives to store. It was in 2009 that he got a telephone call from Pierce. He recalls his brother-in-law saying: ‘I’ve found an unmarked box of negatives in the attic. I think they’re your Rolling Stones pictures.’ The book Sticky Fingers: the Lost Session is available for £395 at www.snapgalleries.com. Orders before May 31 cost £265.","The band posed for Peter Webb in 1971 for cover of Sticky Fingers .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Most of the crowd were probably young enough to be her grandchildren. But that wasn’t going to stop Dolly Parton getting the biggest cheer of the weekend at Glastonbury yesterday. Some 80,000 revellers crowded around the stage to watch the 68-year-old country singer bring the festival to a close. Scroll down for video . Shooting from the hip: Dolly Parton performing on the Pyramid Stage during the famous 'Sunday Afternoon Legends slot' at Glastonbury Festival, at Worthy Farm in Somerset . Despite heavy rain having turned the site into a quagmire, Miss Parton wore an immaculate white sequined trouser suit with hundreds of crystals as she sang her classic hits, including Jolene. Down in the mud, hundreds had donned wigs to copy her style, others waved banners bearing her name, and the line of security guards at the front of the stage had even rehearsed a special dance routine for her songs. And she wasn’t the only veteran rocker to prove very popular at Glastonbury this weekend  – with Bryan Ferry, Yoko Ono, Robert Plant and Blondie all playing during the three-day event. Miss Parton took what has become known as the ‘golden oldie’ slot on the main Pyramid stage at Sunday tea-time. Queen of glam: Dolly Parton entertained the crowd with her greatest hits, including Jolene and 9 to 5 . Dollywood: The crowd packed themselves to watch the 68-year-old, one of the most talked about acts of the Glastonbury festival . Brave choice: Ahead of her performance on Sunday, 68-year-old country legend Dolly PArton said she had chosen the white outfit as it would go well with the brown mud at Glastonbury . She played hits including I Will . Always Love You and Nine to Five – but admitted she had to tailor her . setlist for the young audience at Worthy Farm, Somerset. She . said: ‘I’m just a country girl and now I feel like a rock star. I can’t . do a bunch of sad songs because everyone is drunk and high. ‘We’ve tried to do a set where we keep it moving pretty good and not keep them down too much.’ At . one point, Miss Parton was joined on stage by Bon Jovi guitarist Richie . Sambora as they played a version of his band’s song Lay Your Hands On . Me. Before her performance, . she said: ‘This is going to be a big deal and because this is the . biggest festival in the world, I even wrote a song about the mud, so . I’ll be doing that in the show.’ Age is but a number: Robert Plant, 65, was by no means the oldest artist as Yoko Ono, 81, followed on Sunday . N-OAP: Also in the older bracket of performers were Debbie Harry and Bryan Ferry, both 68 years old . Speculation mounted on social media last night that Miss Parton had mimed her performance – but she insisted she had been singing live and blamed the rumours on poor sound and picture link-up on television. This year’s veteran performers included Debbie Harry, 68, who sang with her Blondie bandmates on Friday lunchtime. Former Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, 65, entertained the crowds with a folk set on Saturday night, and Roxy Music singer Bryan Ferry, 68, was well received on the more mellow West Holt stage. John Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono was the oldest performer at the age of 81. She played at the smaller Park Stage in front of thousands with the Plastic Ono band last night.","Dolly Parton, 68, performed at Glastonbury on Sunday afternoon .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . A businessman has been awarded £6million of taxpayers’ money after a court ruled he was wrongly arrested by the Serious Fraud Office. Entrepreneur Vincent Tchenguiz was questioned when the SFO carried out a dawn raid on his home in 2011. It was part of an inquiry into the collapse of Kaupthing bank, one of three Icelandic banks to fold during the 2008 credit crunch. Settlement: Vincent Tchenguiz, left, with brother Robert and sister Lisa on board his yacht . But after the investigation collapsed, a judicial review at the High Court quashed the search warrants and was highly critical of the SFO’s conduct. Now, in a final settlement, the SFO has agreed to pay Mr Tchenguiz £3million to settle the case and a further £3million towards his legal costs within 21 days. However, the agency has yet to settle with Mr Tchenguiz’s younger brother Robert, who said last night he intends to pursue a £100million claim. The Iranian-born brothers, who together are worth an estimated £850million, were seeking a record £300million in damages from the agency before yesterday’s settlement with Vincent. Robert, 53, said last night: ‘I was unceremoniously arrested in a dawn raid on the morning of March 9, 2011, by the City of London Police, at the behest of the SFO. ‘The media had been tipped off and were present before the police arrived to exercise the warrants. ‘I intend to continue to pursue this claim through the courts in order to right the wrongs that have been done.’ Brothers: Iranian-born Robert (left) and Vincent Tchenguiz are together worth an estimated £850million . Vincent Tchenguiz, 57, said: ‘I am happy to accept this settlement from the Serious Fraud Office and bring to a close my disputes with them. ‘Whilst I and my business have suffered serious and significant damage at the hands of the SFO, it has become increasingly apparent that the SFO’s investigation was influenced by certain third parties, acting in their own commercial interests. ‘I have settled my case against the SFO and intend to focus my attentions on those other parties whom I consider are responsible. ‘However, I hope that the SFO has learned lessons from this sorry episode in its history and the serious errors which led to my investigation and arrest are never repeated. ‘I have maintained my innocence since day one and this settlement and apology that I have received from the SFO is total vindication for me.’ A judicial review at the High Court was highly critical of the Serious Fraud Office's (above) conduct . Vincent – who like his brother lives in Kensington, West London – had claimed he had been the victim of false imprisonment, trespass, misfeasance in public office and malicious prosecution. The SFO said in a statement that it was ‘pleased’ to settle the claim and admitted ‘mistakes’ had been made in the case. But a Taxpayers’ Alliance spokesman said: ‘This sorry episode has cost the taxpayers millions, but what’s most galling is the fact that the SFO believes it’s doing the public a favour by handing out bumper compensation payments. ‘The whole affair has been entirely avoidable, and those responsible must be held accountable. ‘This kind of waste cannot be tolerated if Britain is to bring down its £1.3trillion debt mountain.’ David Green, the director of the SFO, said: ‘I am pleased that we have been able to resolve this matter without the need for a costly trial. 'The SFO deeply regrets the errors for which we were criticised by the High Court in July 2012. ‘On behalf of the SFO I apologise to Mr Tchenguiz for what happened to him.’ The SFO was looking at why substantial funds flooded out of the Kaupthing bank in the days before it failed in 2008. Vincent Tchenguiz had borrowed £100million from the Icelandic bank shortly before its collapse. Both he and his brother have always denied any wrongdoing.","Iranian-born Vincent Tchenguiz, 57, arrested by Serious Fraud Office in 2011 .

"By . Claudia Joseph . Jessie Burton, writer and actress . An impoverished actress is  set to become a millionaire after  her debut novel soared to the top  of the book charts - outselling  J. K. Rowling. Jessie Burton, 31, landed a six-figure book deal after her novel  - The Miniaturist - became the subject of a frantic bidding war. It was eventually published by Picador and sold to 30 countries and is now being fought over by film producers who think it has the makings of a blockbuster. The novel is the story of an arranged marriage in 17th Century Amsterdam and revolves around a miniature doll's house that the heroine was given as a wedding gift from her husband. It entered the Booksellers' charts at number four and is currently outselling Robert Galbraith (aka) J. K. Rowling  at Waterstone's. The last first novel to be so successful was EL James's bonkbuster Fifty Shades Of Grey, which currently holds the crown for fastest-selling debut. But E. L. James's book was published straight to the cheaper paperback format - not hardback - after her work had already become an online hit, boosting initial sales. Waterstone's head buyer Kate Skipper said of The Miniaturist: 'It's so rare for a debut to sell in this way but it is simply a fantastic novel and the must-read book of the summer.' Until her breakthrough, Jessie was an out-of-work actress. Now she has bought her first home, a £270,000 one-bedroom flat in Forest Hill, South-East London, with her boyfriend, actor Pip Carter.Jessie, an only child, dedicated  the novel to Pip and parents, Edward, 71, a retired architect turned antique, ceramic and porcelain restorer, and Linda, 70, a retired schoolteacher. Jessie was educated at the non-fee paying Church of England Lady Margaret School in Fulham and her first love was acting.But after a year at Central School of Speech and Drama, she realised that she would not be able to earn a living as an actress and began writing her novel. She conceived the idea of The Miniaturist in 2009 after a weekend break with Pip to Amsterdam. 'We both love going to museums - it . sounds so nerdy - but we do have a mutual interest in art and culture . and stuffing our faces,' she said. The Miniaturist became the subject of a frantic bidding war . 'Pip suggested we went to the . Rijksmuseum and I saw the doll's house. It's a beautiful object and I . was completely mesmerised. When I discovered that it cost the same as a . real town house to build and furnish, I was hooked.' Two . years later, after winning a place on a creative writing course, she . finished the manuscript, returning to Amsterdam on her 30th birthday in . 2012 to add the final touches to The Miniaturist. Mushens put the book up to auction with 11 publishers and landed Jessie her life-changing deal.'I was working in an office in the City,' Jessie recalled of the day publishers began fighting for her signature to take the book. It was a Friday afternoon and my agent left me a voicemail with the list of 11 publishers. It was just crazy. 'By Monday, two had dropped out but we still had nine publishers, some making enormous leaps to stay in the auction. I could barely concentrate.' Since then, her life has been a whirlwind. She and Pip bought their flat in March - she previously couldn't get a mortgage - and she had a book launch at the Rijksmuseum and at the London Canal Museum. She has also received a letter from Booker Prize winner Hilary Mantel congratulating her on the book. Jessie, who leaves for a tour of America in September, is now working on her next novel - which is set in 1937 Spain and 1967 London.","Jessie Burton, 31, set to become millionaire after landing 6 figure book deal .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . and Sarah Griffiths . From weepy ballads to stirring instrumentals, many pieces of music have been described as powerful or moving. But now there’s a musical instrument that actually generates power when it is played - and it could provide light in poor and remote communities. The percussion shaker, called Spark, generates electricity that can charge a phone, or power a lamp after just 12 minutes of movement. Scroll down for video . A bright idea: A musical instrument called Spark (pictured) generates power when it is played, and 12 minutes of shaking generates enough power to light a home for an hour, or to charge a phone. It has a USB port so that a lighting strip can be attached (also pictured) When Spark is shaken, a magnet moves backwards and forwards through the centre of a solenoid - a coil of copper wire. A current is induced in the loops of wire and each time the magnet slides through, it charges up a rechargeable battery. Because the energy is stored, Spark can be played in the morning and the electricity generated, used later in the dark. Around 12 minutes of shaking generates enough power to light someone’s home for an hour. It is the brainchild of Sudha Kheterpal, who has been a percussionist with dance band Faithless for 15 years. She hopes her innovation - which she’s raising money to put into production on crowd funding site Kickstarter – will improves the lives of people in Kenya, where three quarters of the population have no access to electricity. The heart-shaped instrument is full of beads that make a noise when shaken, but play an important electricity-generating role, as well as making noise. The motion forces a magnet to move through a copper coil to make a current, which charges up a battery. More than 12 minutes of shaking can light up someone’s home for an hour. ‘I've tested the prototype with a number . of different communities in Kenya and have proven it is incredibly . useful to people. Children, teachers and village elders have all . embraced it,’ she wrote on Kickstarter. The heart-shaped instrument is full of beads that make a noise when shaken, but also play an important electricity-generating role. It has been trialled in Kenya (pictured) and its creator hopes Spark will let children do homework when it is dark and charge phones to connect families and communities . A USB port on the side of the Spark allows people to charge a mobile phone or plug in a lamp, and during tests in Kenya, this proved to be safer than using a kerosene lamp. ‘During testing, the people who used Spark said it was useful because they had light in the evenings which they used for doing homework, household chores and for lighting their way home in the dark,’ Kheterpal continued. ‘Spark will enable children and their families to be safer by eliminating the need of kerosene for light for example, and by providing light for women and girls in areas where rape is a huge problem.’ The design is based on the shape of a heart, but it gets its geometric look because Kheterpal was also inspired by flint stones, which are used to create a spark and ‘give birth to a powerful new source of energy.' So far, just over half of the money required to ship 1,000 Sparks to Kenya has been raised and people can buy t-shirts, tickets to a special Faithless concert as well as a Spark assembly kit, for £150, which will be manufactured next year.","Called Spark, the shaker was created by London musician Sudha Kheterpal .

"By . Jennifer Smith . For city dwellers, a spot of rain can bring the end to any good hair day. And it seems the problem's no different for those living on the wild side, as one lion proved when he awoke to a serious case of bed-head. Unfortunately for the animal, Tiny, his embarrassment was documented by a group of wildlife photographers at the Wildlife Heritage Foundation Big Cat Sanctuary in Kent. Tiny the lion was left feeling a little flat when a spot of drizzle ruined his luscious golden mane at the Wildlife Heritage Foundation Big Cat Sanctuary in Kent . Photographer Gary Brookshaw was able to capture the animal's melancholy as he woke up from a nap. 'It was a miserable wet day and this lion brought a smile to our faces as his normally glorious mane was soaked and flat - he looked completely fed up,' the 43-year-old said. 'I was really pleased to get the shot as it was almost the first one of the day and I knew it was a good moment and technically good shot.' Tiny, who lives at the sanctuary with his two brothers, Manzi and Kafara, was born with a digestion problem causing him to regurgitate food and not grow properly. After having a stomach valve corrected, he has made a full recovery and is now a normal size. That's better: Tiny looking his usual preened self (left) and his two brothers, Kafari and Manzi (left) cuddle up on the sanctuary where all three moved in 2005 . The African Lions were born at the Woburn Safari Park in 2003 and were moved to the big cat sanctuary in Kent at the age of two . 'He's called Tiny because he kept regurgitating his food when young so he didn't grow at the normal rate. He had an operation to correct a stomach valve and things got better for him. 'He has had some hairy moments, when in 2008 some horse mane got stuck in his intestines and he almost died,' added Mr Brookshaw, who gives workshops on wildlife photography at the sanctuary. 'He had an operation where they had to cut out almost 5 foot of intestine but luckily lived to tell the tale. 'Despite these troubles he's still an impressive lion and full of character.'","Tiny the lion awoke to find his luscious mane flattened by a spot of rain .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . A Connecticut man who assaulted acclaimed Irish author Colum McCann last month outside a hotel after the author tried to help the man's wife following a domestic dispute has been charged. Michael Mott, 34, of Oxford was charged with assault in the June 28 incident outside the Study Hotel in New Haven. Mott confessed to assaulting McCann, 49, and turned himself in Monday evening, police said. They declined to elaborate. McCann, the author of 'Let the Great World Spin,' was treated for significant facial injuries at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Witnesses suggested McCann had tried to help a woman who was involved in a dispute in the hotel lobby, police said. Charged: Michael Mott, pictured, allegedly assaulted award-winning novelist Colum McCann outside a hotel in June after McCann tried to help Mott's wife . Police said Mott had a dispute with his wife after hotel staff told the couple the credit card Mott used didn't have sufficient funds to pay for the room. ‘What we . believe happened is that the victim tried to intercede in what appeared . to be a domestic dispute between a man and a woman,’ Assistant Police . Chief Archie Generoso told the New Haven Independent last week. ‘He saw a woman pushed to the ground. He tried to assist the woman. ‘He asked the woman if she wanted him to call the police. He urged her to do so. She said she didn’t want to call the police. The . guy said, ‘It’s your decision.’ He turned around, began to walk away, . and he was assaulted.' McCann went outside where he was attacked, police said. Police say Mott punched McCann, who lost consciousness. Mott was also charged with family violence breach of peace for the altercation in the lobby, police said. 'This was a particularly disturbing case because Mr. McCann was specifically targeted after he tried helping another victim,' Chief Dean Esserman said in a statement. McCann ended . up with a concussion, a broken cheekbone and some broken teeth from the . 'shocking, cowardly attack in broad daylight on a busy street,' he told . the Irish Times in a statement. Critically acclaimed: Colum McCann's 2011 novel Let the Great World Spin won him awards around the world . First responders arrived to find McCann on the sidewalk bleeding from the head, police told the Independent. He was taken to the hospital, released later that night and returned home to New York City. ‘I was trying to help someone out,’ his statement said. ‘I was cold-clocked without warning. I had a severe concussion, a broken cheekbone, some broken teeth and a spirit that has been temporarily bruised. ‘But I am recovering quickly and I’ve been overwhelmed by the generous response from friends and strangers alike.’ He credited an nearby off-duty paramedic with rushing to his aid as his attacker fled the scene. McCann told the Times he was in New Haven to attend a conference on empathy at Yale University for Narrative 4, a non-profit organization he is involved in. He was forced to pull out of an event because of the attack. Where it happened: McCann was knocked out on this sidewalk just outside The Study, a hotel just off campus . ‘I suffered a few injuries but nothing that can’t be quickly healed,’ he continued. ‘If anything, I was shaken out of the ruts of my ordinary perception, and I have been struck the genuine caring nature of people asking about how they can help out.’ The award-winning author then used the opportunity to call attention to ‘others who suffer far worse violence. ‘It could have happened anywhere in the world. The fact that it happened on the edge of one of the world’s foremost colleges campuses simply highlights how prevalent this sort of situation is,’ said McCann. New Haven, where Yale University is located, does have an above-average crime rate, but it is not as common for attacks like this to occur on or near the campus. McCann is home recovering and should be back to normal within a few weeks. McCann is . from New York City. He just released the story 'Gone' through the online . publisher and subscription service Byliner. It's his first short story . in a decade. He has written six novels, including . 2011’s 'Let the Great World Spin' – which earned him international acclaim . and several awards including the International Impact Award and many . other honors.","Author Colum McCann was attacked outside the Study Hotel in New Haven, Connectiut .

"By . Zoe Szathmary . and Associated Press Reporter . A Kansas man ate pizza, smoked marijuana and watched almost two episodes of 'Game of Thrones' with his partner before remembering his 10-month-old foster daughter was still inside a sweltering car, authorities said. Seth Jackson, 29, faces a first-degree murder charge in the July 24 death in Wichita. No charges have been filed against his partner, who has been identified as Payton Schroeder. Jackson remembered the girl after hearing a child's cries on the HBO program, Schroeder told police, according to an affidavit obtained by Kansas.com. They reportedly watched one-and-a-half episodes. Police say the girl was inside the car with the windows up for more than two hours. It was around 90 degrees outside. An autopsy showed she died of hyperthermia due to heat exposure. Scroll down for video . Foster father: Seth Jackson, pictured, reportedly smoked marijuana and watched Game of Thrones before remembering his foster daughter was inside a hot car for two hours . Victim: Kadillak Poe Jones was reportedly in the sweltering car for two hours while her foster got high and watched the HBO fantasy drama . The girl has been identified by local media as Kadillak Poe Jones. Police have not released her name, however, and documents in the case only use her initials. The affidavit says Schroeder told police that Jackson called that day to let him know he would be picking Kadillak up from the baby sitter after taking their 5-year-old adopted child to a doctor's appointment. Jackson told police that when he arrived home, he locked the car and went inside with his 5-year-old and pizza he had picked up. Schroeder revealed to investigators that he and Jackson smoked marijuana that Jackson had earlier picked up that day, according to the affidavit. Scene: When officers arrived, Jackson still on the phone, making calls and repeatedly stating, 'I left her in the car, she's dead, she's dead' Professional: Jackson, right, reportedly picked up marijuana the day Kadillak died . Both men said they ran to the car to retrieve Kadillak and call authorities. Schroeder told investigators Kadillak was hot and stiff when she was taken from the car and carried into the house. As he called 911, Jackson attempted CPR but could not get the child's mouth open, according to the affidavit filed by Wichita police detective Ryan Schomaker. Officers who responded found Jackson still on the phone when they arrived, making calls and repeatedly stating, 'I left her in the car, she's dead, she's dead,' according to the affidavit. Meanwhile, Kadillak was unresponsive and lying on her back on the couch. Firefighters moved her from the couch to the floor once they arrived and attempted to revive her. Family: In addition to Kadillak, whom they were trying to adopt, Jackson and his partner had five other children in their care. They had three other foster children ages 3, 5 and 18, and two adopted children ages 5 and 7 . Couple: Jackson, left, is seen with partner Payton Schroeder, right. Jackson reportedly works for the Wichita school district . Later in an interview at police headquarters, Schroeder told detectives he and Jackson had been foster parents to Kadillak since she was 2 weeks old. Although the girl died of hyperthermia, Sedgwick County District Attorney Marc Bennett said the first-degree murder charge was warranted because the child died during the commission of an inherently dangerous felony, aggravated endangering of a child. The case is not charged as intentional murder. In addition to Kadillak, whom they were trying to adopt, Jackson and Schroeder had five other children in their care. They had three other foster children ages 3, 5 and 18, and two adopted children ages 5 and 7. The two younger foster children were visiting other relatives at the time the 10-month-old died. Jackson's Facebook account lists him as a paraprofessional for the Wichita school district. Familiar: Jackson remembered Kadillak was in the car after hearing a child cry on Game of Thrones . 'It always struck me he had empathy, compassion and patience with the students,' former substitute teacher Tom Fleming recently told KWCH.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . J. Keith Mularski started out as a furniture salesman after graduating from college. However, he later changed his line of work and became one of the top cybercrime experts for the FBI . J. Keith Mularski's world has expanded greatly since he stopped selling discount furniture to join the FBI 1998. Especially since he transferred from Washington, D.C., in 2005 to fill a vacancy in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's field office's cyber squad - which he now heads. Since then, Supervisory Special Agent Mularski has been recognized as a foremost expert on cybercrime. His profile has risen even more since the Justice Department used Mularski's sleuthing to bring two indictments with worldwide ramifications. In May, five Chinese Army intelligence officers were charged with stealing trade secrets from major manufacturers including U.S. Steel, Alcoa and Westinghouse. In June, a Russian man was charged with leading a ring that infected hundreds of thousands of computers with identity-thieving software, then using the stolen information to drain $100 million from bank accounts worldwide. Mularski, 44, said in April during an oral history interview for the National Law Enforcement Museum that he became a furniture salesman out of college because jobs were hard to come by then. He spent about five years in the business before joining the FBI. 'I was in private industry beforehand. But I've kind of always liked computers,' said Mularski. Mularski chose to join the Pittsburgh cyber squad largely because of family considerations - he grew up in suburban White Oak, Pennsylvania, the son of a steelworker. 'It kind of looked like cyber was the wave of the future,' Mularski said. 'The majority of all my computer training was just on-the-job training at the bureau.' Since joining the FBI, Mularski has accomplished important missions such as infiltrating the Dark Market, a online forum where criminals bought and sold fraudulent credit card information . It has proved remarkably effective. Even before the Chinese and Russian cases made worldwide headlines, Mularski was making cyber waves. He made his reputation infiltrating Dark Market in 2006. The worldwide Internet forum allowed crooks to buy and sell stolen identity and credit card information. Mularski infiltrated the network by pretending to be a notorious Polish computer hacker using the screen name 'Master Splyntr' - a takeoff on the cartoon rat who guides the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Mularski was inspired while watching the cartoon character with his young son: 'He's a rat that lives underground. It was perfect,' he said. Mularski befriended the criminal mastermind behind the site and persuaded him to let Mularski move the operation onto new computer servers. The servers happened to belong to the FBI, which led to more than 60 arrests worldwide. Misha Glenny, a British journalist who specializes in cybercrime, wrote a book about the case called 'Dark Market, How Hackers Became the New Mafia.' 'Keith Mularski is not without technical ability, but his real talent lies in convincing experienced cybercriminals that he is one of them and not a law enforcement officer,' said Glenny. His aw-shucks demeanor also makes him an ideal team player. 'He has an understanding of the whole grid, and then he develops relationships, whether it's with victims, the private sector, and our international partners,' said David Hickton, the U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh. Those partnerships are important because the United States doesn't have extradition treaties to bring the Chinese and Russian suspects here for prosecution. Those defendants could be arrested if they travel into areas that cooperate with the U.S., but Hickton and Mularski said that's not the only purpose served by those indictments. A furniture showroom, the kind of place Mularski used to work at before quitting and joining the FBI in 1998 . 'The best result is to be able to get cuffs on a guy,' Mularski said. 'But you have to measure how you can impact each (criminal) organization.' In the Russian case, Mularski got a federal judge in Pittsburgh to allow the Justice Department to monitor some 350,000 computers infected with malicious software, so the thievery could be stopped. The Chinese indictment, meanwhile, was a 'put up' to the Chinese government's rumblings that the U.S. government should ""shut up"" about ongoing cyberspying allegations unless they could be proved, Mularski said. Some cases produce a more tangible result. The Dark Market case led Mularski to Max Ray Butler, a San Francisco hacker whose home computer was found by the FBI with 1.8 million stolen credit card numbers on it. Butler, who changed his name to Max Ray Vision, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 13 years in prison - the longest sentence yet handed down in a U.S. hacking case. He was also ordered to repay banks $27.5 million, the cost of replacing all the cards he stole. 'This was all just really organized crime with a computer,' Mularski said. 'It's traditional sleuthing but in a 21st-century way.'","J. Keith Mularski graduated college and became a discount furniture salesman, joining with the FBI in 1998 .

"By . Chris Brooke . and David Williams . and Lizzie Parry . Two people have been charged with the murder of Thavisha Lakindu Peiris, pictured . Two people have been charged with murdering Thavisha Peiris as he delivered his last pizza before starting his dream job as an IT consultant. Shamraze Khan, 25, of Sheffield and a 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared at Sheffield Magistrates' Court today for a five-minute hearing. The body of Mr Peiris, 25, was discovered in his car last Sunday night - he had suffered stab wounds. On the night he died, Mr Peiris had been delivering his last pizza on his final shift as a Domino’s . courier in Sheffield, a part-time job that had helped fund his studies. Colleagues, who went to look for Mr Peiris when he failed to deliver his order, found his body slumped in his silver Toyota Yaris at around 10.30pm. Khan and the youth were held in custody by magistrates before their next appearance at Sheffield Crown Court on November 15. Tonight, around 60 of Mr Peiris's friends and members of the Sheffield Sri Lankan community gathered for a vigil at his home in the Fir Vale area of Sheffield. The terraced house was packed for the Buddhist ceremony. His friends said the hour-long vigil involved religious elements led by Buddhist leaders as well as food and tributes. Speaking from their home in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Mr Peiris's family described him as the ""most caring and loving son a parent could have"". His father Sarath Mahinda Peiris and mother Vajira Peiris Narangoda said: 'We sent our son to the UK to study so he can have a better life. Now we are left with only a broken heart. 'We were devastated and shocked to hear of our son's tragic end and we are still unable to comprehend that he is actually gone. 'Thavisha was one of the most caring and loving sons a parent could have. He was full of life and always had a smile on his face. Anyone who met him immediately liked him.' Mr Peiris's older brother Pramod Chetheka Peiris said: 'I am heartbroken. My brother Thavisha was the centre of our world. Thavisha Peiris, right, has been described as a 'kind and gentle' son and brother. His family, brother Pramod, father Sarath Mahinda Peiris and mother Vajira Peiris Narangoda said they are 'devastated' at his loss . 'He gave us so many reasons to smile. He was kind and considerate and we were extremely proud of his achievements. 'We were so happy that he was doing so well in England.' Mr Peiris came to the UK to finish an IT degree and graduated from Sheffield Hallam University in 2011. He had just secured a job as an IT consultant in the city. His colleagues and police said he had been feeling unwell during his last shift and was going to go home early but agreed to deliver one last order. Domino's Pizza has said it was funding the cost of flying Mr Peiris's family to the UK in the coming days. Mr Peiris came from a hard-working family. His father, who worked for a petrochemical plant before his retirement and his mother, a housewife, saved hard for their children’s education and sent him to a well-regarded school in the Sri Lankan capital. Speaking from their home in Colombo, Sri Lanka, Sarath and Vajira, left, paid tribute to the 'most gentle and caring son a parent could have'. The 25-year-old had come to Britain to study IT at Sheffield Hallam University . After studying IT, Mr Peiris moved to Britain in 2011 to do a ‘top-up’ course required to bring his qualifications up to degree level. He won a place at Sheffield Hallam University, graduating that year with a degree in information technology. Shortly before his death, he had landed a job as an IT consultant and had been ‘excited’ about starting a career. On the evening he died, he had told his bosses that he was feeling ill and asked to finish work early. However, he agreed to deliver one last pizza before going home and set off at 9.50pm. When he failed to deliver the order, his colleagues became concerned and set off to find him. They spotted the company’s Toyota Yaris parked in a residents’ bay near the delivery address at 10.30pm, with Mr Peiris ‘slumped in his vehicle’. Ravi Marripudi, the manager at Domino’s Pizza, said the branch had received a phone call chasing up the order 15 minutes after Mr Peiris had left to make the delivery. . ‘When another driver came back I sent him down and they found Thavisha,’ said Mr Marripudi. Mr Peiris shared a house with other Sri Lankans. Hassan Natheer, 25, who lived with him, said: ‘He was a calm and kind person. He just worked hard and did what he was told to do. ‘He didn’t complain or demand anything. He loved the job and he was committed to his work, but he was ready for the next step in his life. We can’t believe he is not with us. We are trying to take it in.’ Sunil de Silva, a friend in Colombo, said: ‘This is so tragic, such a waste of a life. He went to the UK to study at personal cost to his family and to better himself through education. ‘It is so hard to believe that this has happened. He came from a lovely family and he was quiet and hard working, but also very bright with a funny side.’ Police established a cordon around the scene in Sheffield where Dominos workers discovered the body of their 25-year-old colleague on Sunday night .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Emily Crane . and Associated Press Reporter . A female victim of the horrific Bourbon Street shooting spree last weekend has become the first person to die as a result of her wounds, authorities said. Brittany Thomas, 21, from Hammond, Louisiana, passed away Wednesday, according to her family. A total of 11 people were shot during the early Sunday morning shooting on the iconic New Orleans street, according to police. Her death came on the same day the New Orleans Police Department announced it was looking to speak to 20-year-old Justin Odom, WGNO reported. He later turned himself in and was booked on unrelated charges. Shooting spree: Brittany Thomas (left) died today as a result of injuries suffered in Sunday morning's Bourbon Street shooting just as authorities announced Justin Odom (right) was being sought for questioning . Thomas and three other victims - an 18-year-old man, a 19-year-old woman and a 35-year-old man - were the only ones still hospitalized after the terrifying ordeal, according to WDSU. Odom is often seen with another male by the name of Josh or Joe, who cops have also called a 'person of interest,' according to WGNO. Investigators have not any luck tracking the other man down and are asking for the public's help locating them. A 21-year-old woman from Australia who was shot in the face during the fracas told a Perth television station she is lucky to be alive after coming within centimetres of death. Amy Matthews and a friend were celebrating their graduation from the University of WA when they were caught in the crossfire of a gunfight between two men on Sunday at 2.45am. The pair had been walking on New Orleans' main tourist strip, Bourbon Street, when Ms Matthews was one of nearly a dozen innocent bystanders injured. Amy Matthews suffered severe injuries when she was shot in the face in a New Orleans street on Sunday at 2.45am . The bullet entered Ms Matthews' right cheek and shattered most of her teeth and bottom jaw, before ripping her tongue open and coming out the top of her lip. 'Four centimetres higher or lower and I definitely wouldn't be talking to you today,' she told Nine News. 'I'm definitely counting my lucky stars for sure. 'I mean the surgeons came in and said it's not every day we get to see someone sitting up and talking to us just after they have been shot in the face.' Video footage of the street fight shows Ms Matthews and her friend walking past a bar on the busy street when gunshots send the crowd of people running. Two US Marines stayed with the pair on the street until an ambulance arrived. The bullet entered the 21-year-old's right cheek and shattered most of her teeth and bottom jaw, before ripping her tongue open and coming out the top of her lip . 'I was trying not to freak out too much and the marines were trained in that so they were keeping my mind off those thoughts,' Ms Matthews told the West Australian. 'They were making jokes and telling me how I was handling it better than most of their marine friends would have. They definitely helped.' She was taken to Interim LSU Hospital where it took 30 stitches to sew her tongue back together and she had a metal support fixed to the roof of her mouth. Ms Matthews is expected to face multiple surgeries, including bone grafts, as part of her recovery. Ms Matthews, pictured with her Aunt Rhonda in hospital, had been walking with a friend on New Orleans' main tourist strip, Bourbon Street, when she and 10 other bystanders were injured . She and her friend had flown to the US in March for a gap-year holiday after completing her bachelor of arts and majoring in political science and economics. The pair had already visited New York and Nashville, before they hired a car to drive to New Orleans. Police are still searching for the two men who exchanged gunfire and it remains unclear what sparked the shooting, WWL-TV, New Orleans reports. 'This is a heinous crime. This is two young men, both armed with firearms, who chose to settle a dispute between themselves without a moment's care for anyone else,' New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Ronal Serpas said.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . A federal judge in Kentucky struck down the state's ban on gay marriage on Tuesday, saying that it violated equality laws. Despite the ban being overturned, the ruling was temporarily put on hold, and it was not immediately clear when same-sex couples could be issued marriage licenses. U.S. District Judge John G. Heyburn in Louisville concluded that the state's prohibition on same-sex couples being wed violates the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution by treating gay couples differently than straight couples. Campaign: Protesters for and against gay marriage gather at a rally, above.  A Kentucky judge ruled on Tuesday that that state's ban on same-sex marriage violated equality laws . Heyburn previously struck down Kentucky's . ban on recognizing same-sex marriages from other states and countries, . but he put the implementation of that ruling on hold. That decision did not deal with whether Kentucky would have to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Instead, Tuesday's ruling dealt directly with that question. 'Sometimes, by upholding equal rights for a few, courts necessarily must require others to forebear some prior conduct or restrain some personal instinct,' Heyburn wrote. 'Here, that would not seem to be the case. Assuring equal protection for same-sex couples does not diminish the freedom of others to any degree.' Heyburn noted that every federal court to consider a same-sex marriage ban has found it unconstitutional. Uncertain future: A couple embrace at a Defense of Marriage Act rally last June. Tuesday's ruling does not deal with when or if Kentucky will issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples . Equality: Michael Deleon, left, and his partner Greg Bourke attend a press conference in February about the same-sex marriage debate in Kentucky. A judge ruled Tuesday that every federal court that had debated the matter found the ban unconstitutional . The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled arguments on rulings from Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee in a single session, on Aug. 6. Although the cases are unique, each deals with whether statewide gay marriage bans violate the Constitution. Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear said the state will appeal the decision. Dan Canon, one of the attorneys for the plaintiffs, said he was excited about the ruling because the day will arrive soon when same-sex couples can get a marriage license in Kentucky, even though the decision was put on hold pending appeals. 'We believe the opinion forcefully lays to rest any notion that Kentucky's anti-marriage laws are based on anything other than discrimination against homosexuals,' Canon said.

The 8-year-old who received national attention for his touchdown run in the 2013 Nebraska spring football game has had a recurrence of brain cancer. Jack Hoffman, from Atkinson, Nebraska had been in remission since October.

Doctors have learned his brain tumor has returned . 'Today we were humbly reminded that when your child has an inoperable brain tumor, that anything can happen at any point in time,' Hoffman wrote. 'Despite Jack's tumor being declared in remission (stable) last October, today we learned that that is no longer the case. While we left Boston in April with the knowledge that there was a spot of concern’, we nonetheless remained optimistic that it was just nothing.'

"By . David Williams . Survivors of the Philippines typhoon have been ‘let down’ by a slow aid response, the UN’s humanitarian chief said yesterday. Baroness Amos said that despite relief pouring in from around the world, it is still not reaching many of those in need a week after Haiyan struck. Britain yesterday sent the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious to help the victims, as anger grows in areas where life-saving aid has yet to arrive. Lady Amos, the former UK International Development Secretary, added: ‘I do feel we have let people down. We need to get assistance to them now. Scroll down for video . Thousands of people trapped in the devastated city of Tacloban are in desperate need of food and water six days after Super Typhoon Haiyan struck . Survivors have scrawled messages on buildings, roads and roofs pleading for help as the chief of humanitarian aid at the UN admits they have let people down . A survivor holds up a sign begging for aid as he stands amid the wreckage of hundreds of destroyed homes in Tacloban, Leyte Province . Valerie Amos, the UN humanitarian aid chief, said relief to the worst affected areas has been far too slow . ‘They are already saying it has taken too long to arrive. Ensuring a faster delivery is our immediate priority.’ She added: ‘I very much hope that in the next 48 hours, that will change significantly. 'It’s true, there are still areas that we have not been able to get to where people are in desperate need.’ The death toll originally put at 10,000 around the city of Tacloban alone was yesterday dramatically reduced to 4,460, although this is still expected to rise. With the stench from rotting  bodies overwhelming and little shelter among the devastation, frustration has been boiling over as essential supplies fail to reach many of those in need in the city, where food and other goods have stacked up at the airport. Just five miles away, thousands have found shelter among the squalor of a convention centre but say they have not seen any relief workers. Hundreds of bodies in Tacloban are being buried in mass graves. Policemen and volunteers carry a body bag for burial . Tacloban's Mayor Romualdez said he is desperate to move the bodies from the streets because they are 'creating an atmosphere of fear and depression' The scale of the human tragedy is demonstrated by these Filipino firemen unloading lorry loads of bodies in the pouring rain . The city of Tacloban has a dire shortage of heavy equipment such as lorries which are needed to move bodies and deliver food . The bodies were piled on top of one another in deep pits as fire crews and authorities desperately try to clear the streets of people killed by the typhoon . Amid deeply harrowing scenes, 300 bodies were buried in a mass grave yesterday on the outskirts of Tacloban while a larger one capable of holding 1,000 is under construction. ‘There are still bodies on the road,’ said Alfred Romualdez, mayor of Tacloban, a city of 220,000 people reduced to rubble in worst-hit Leyte province. ‘It’s scary. There is a request from a community to come and collect  bodies. They say it’s five or ten. When we get there, it’s 40.’ Some areas appear to be teetering on anarchy amid the widespread looting of shops and warehouses for food and water. In some spots,  Philippine soldiers on trucks distributed rice and water as chainsaw-wielding teams cut debris from blocked roads. Thousands more swarmed Tacloban’s damaged airport, desperate to leave or to get treatment at a makeshift health centre. Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres described a bleak situation in Guiuan where 45,000 live. Worker Alex Moens said: ‘People are living out in the open.  The needs are immense and there are a lot of surrounding villages that are not yet covered by any aid organisations.’ Survivors of the devastating typhoon are having to cope with barely any supplies and men as young as this one have to pitch in moving bodies . These men have the grim task of placing hundreds of bodies in this enormous mass grave . Authorities in Tacloban said they urgently need logistical support because they cannot move bodies and the deliver food in the same trucks . About 2,000 bodies have been collected so far in Tacloban but authorities say there are many more, although the original feared death toll of 10,000 is now believed to be too high . Many bodies of people killed by Typhoon Haiyan are still unrecovered with more corpses lying in the streets . Volunteer Corazon Cecleno added: ‘What can we do? There’s nothing we can do! We really want to know why the distribution of help is  so slow.’ The Illustrious, with 900 crew aboard and seven helicopters, was sent to the region from the Gulf  yesterday as Britain announced it had increased the amount of help given to £20million. The operation will be one of the last for the carrier – Britain’s oldest warship – which is due to be decommissioned next year.

This woman is surrounded by her children and pleads with a soldier to be given a seat on the plane . HMS Illustrious is being sent to the Philippines to provide practical support . Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious is being sent to the Philippines to help victims of Typhoon Haiyan, David Cameron has announced. Speaking during a visit to India, the Prime Minister said that the ship will replace HMS Daring, which has already been deployed to the Philippines. Its helicopters may be used to assist with the distribution of food and water to survivors stranded in remote locations in the far eastern archipelago state, and its facilities to make water drinkable are likely to be in demand in a country where supplies have been badly disrupted by the typhoon. The Ministry of Defence said that Illustrious, which has been taking part in war-game operations, should arrive in the Philippines on November 24 or 25, with 900 crew and seven helicopters on board. Mr Cameron said: 'What happened in the Philippines is an absolute tragedy. You can see the devastation, the suffering, and it's quite clear that we are going to need long-term help for those people. 'As ever, the British people have been very generous with their donations. 'The British Government has already pledged over £20million, which makes us one of the most generous donors anywhere in the world. 'But it's practical action that's needed as well. That's why I sent HMS Daring to go and help in the Philippines and I can announce today that once Daring has started its work, we are actually going to be able to replace in time HMS Daring with HMS Illustrious, which is, of course, a carrier with helicopters - seven times as many helicopters as on HMS Daring and with the key ability to process fresh water, so we will be giving further assistance in the best way we can.' The MoD was unable to confirm the current location of Illustrious but the Royal Navy reported the warship was in Muscat, Oman, on November 12.

"By . David Williams . and Ian Drury . Constant danger: A British soldier on patrol in . the village of Chah e-Anjir in Helmand. Many soldiers serving there were deeply affected. (Stock image) In a bleak corner of Helmand, only twisted, rusting barbed wire, rubble and broken blocks of concrete remain of what were once the British checkpoints of Kamiabi and Omar. Yet two years ago they were considered vital to British operations and security in the region – a buffer against the Taliban, and during the summer of 2011, home to the Marines of 42 Commando. They provided basic protection in a Taliban stronghold area known as ‘Death Valley’ and through the long hot months of the 2011 ‘fighting season’, clashes were so intense it was compared to the Zulu wars. At its worst, it was a daily lottery for survival. At one point during the six-month ‘tour to hell’, the body parts of British troops blown up by improvised explosive devices were hung in trees as trophies by Taliban fighters to taunt the Marines as they patrolled. Some Marines have said they were also so concerned about running out of ammunition that they collected Taliban weapons and ammunition. Indeed in the words of Marine C – one of the three man tried for the Afghan’s murder: ‘It is a s*** place out there, it’s not nice. It’s just a dirty, s***** war.’ Marine C told the court martial that around 20 friends had been killed or maimed during the six-month tour, including a popular young officer and a Marine who had previously won a Military Cross for courage under fire. He was blown up while searching a mud-walled compound. Marine A, a hardened veteran of previous Afghan tours as well as Iraq, said other comrades had suffered ‘life changing’ injuries in the blast and described the effect the deaths had on the commandos. He said they were not always able to recover the body parts of dead or maimed comrades. ‘It had quite a harsh affect. It’s not a nice thing for the lads. 'Close friends they have lived with have been killed and parts of their bodies are displayed as a kind of trophy for the world to see.’ Marine B said he had been under attack ‘every single day’ and there had been ten casualties in one 24-hour period. ‘My friend’s legs had been put in a tree, I picked up my mate’s brains. I have no good memories of that tour. My way of coping with that was to put it away in a box at the back of my head.’ Uncertainty haunted daily patrols along routes pitted with booby traps and expertly buried bombs that could be triggered by a footfall. Ambushes were an all-too-frequent danger. Locals who waved their greeting at one point would become an enemy to be feared the next – it was a common Taliban tactic for an attacker in a field to take a shot at patrols and then hide his weapon, picking up a farm tool instead. ‘Smiled in the back,’ was how one tour veteran termed it. Some of the insurgents were called . ‘ten dollar Taliban’. Marine A explained: ‘You find that fighting-age . males would take part in the fighting season when the poppy season comes . to an end and they are quite prepared to take ten dollars to fight.’ Isolated: A British patrol base in the area. The . key concerns of the Marines who testified at the trial yesterday were . said to be their limited numbers, their lack of air support and a feeling of isolation. (Stock image) A tipping point came in August 2011, when a popular Marine, James Wright, was badly wounded in an attack in which the Taliban tried to overrun a commando base. Marines on patrol were horribly outnumbered. After a fierce battle they managed to get back to Kamiabi but the emboldened and reinforced Taliban attacked again and again. Marine Wright, 23, was hit by a grenade and seriously wounded. The patrol commander called in air support from Apache helicopter gunships and the enemy dispersed. A Chinook helicopter flew Marine Wright to Camp Bastion, but he died. Colleagues are said to have been furious they had been left so close to being overrun.

The key concerns of the Marines were said to be their limited numbers, their lack of air support and overwhelmingly a feeling of isolation. Marine C said when he left for Afghanistan he was ‘keen for action’ but his attitude altered as the tour progressed. ‘It soon became apparent this was not a game,’ he said. ‘I was drained, very stressed and constantly in fear, really.’ Marine A said humour like that captured on the video clips by fellow Marines – including swearing at the expense of Afghan nationals – could be seen as ‘inappropriate’ to those back in Britain. ‘But when you are facing on a daily basis people trying to kill you, you inject humour as a coping mechanism as otherwise I would say things would be very dark.’ It was against this backdrop of exhaustion, fear and loathing that the murder took place, with the contempt felt by some summed up by Marine A as he shot the fighter and said: ‘Shuffle off this mortal coil, you c***. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.’","Marines tried for murder of Taliban insurgent describe their 'tour from hell'

A Swedish tech start-up has launched an app for Apple devices that lets people take photos of themselves without having to touch their screens. Using touchless technology, which it says is ideal for taking 'selfies' or 'groupies', Crunchfish's GoCam app lets users trigger photos or videos from a distance with just hand gestures. Scroll down for video . Using touchless technology which it says is ideal for taking 'selfies' or 'groupies', Crunchfish's GoCam app lets users trigger photos or videos from a distance with just hand gestures . Photos can be triggered from a distance of up to 10 ft (3 metres), the company claims. The company, based in the southern Swedish city of Malmo, says the free GoCam app is currently only available in Sweden and Australia. Over the past few years, gesture recognition has become more popular thanks to products such as Microsoft's Kinect for video games. However, power-hungry technology has yet to become mainstream in computers or mobile devices. Photos can be triggered from a distance of up to 10 feet (3 metres). The company, based in the southern Swedish city of Malmo, says the free GoCam app is currently only available in Sweden and Australia . The technology using something known as Touchless A3D software which detects and tracks different gestures. It does this using a video stream from the camera in the mobile phone, picking up on particular movements, such as a wave of a hand . 'Even though a number of handset vendors globally are integrating our touchless software for different features into their devices, we wanted to develop GoCam in order to show the capabilities of gesture interaction also in the iOS environment,' said Joakim Nydemark, chief executive of the group. The technology using something known as Touchless A3D software which detects and tracks different gestures. It does this using a video stream from the camera in the mobile phone, picking up on particular movements, such as a wave of a hand. 'Touchless A3D requires no hardware changes and runs on all major mobile operating systems, the company writes on its website. 'This makes it possible for the user to experience a new interaction paradigm in any mobile device.' Too lazy to get up to switch the kettle on? Soon you may be able to simply raise your hand or nod your head from another room, and you’ll be moments away from a fresh cup of tea. This is the hope of researchers at the University of Washington who have developed technology that will allow people to control household devices with simple gestures. The technology, named ‘WiSee’, is similar in concept to how Microsoft's Xbox Kinect sensor works by using cameras to recognise gestures. By adapting a Wi-Fi router and wireless household devices, the researchers developed a system that can detect specific movements without the need for sensors or cameras. They claim it is simpler and cheaper than similar gesture-recognition technologies . Out of the 900 gestures performed, WiSee accurately recognised 94 per cent of them. It was found that as many as five people can move simultaneously in the same room without confusing the receiver.","App tracks gestures via iPhone camera using its Touchless A3D software .

"By . David Williams . Hungary faced demands to allow Scotland Yard to investigate the brutal murder of a former British model after her inquest was told a local policeman was a prime suspect in the killing. The family of Eva Rhodes, a friend of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, claimed officer Horvath Zoltan Peter had a grudge against the 65-year-old and was linked to both her murder at the animal sanctuary she ran in a remote Hungarian town in September 2008 and an orchestrated cover up by the authorities there. The victim’s sister Judith Majlath, a Nobel peace prize winner, told how the policeman had even been part of the investigation into the disappearance and murder despite personally threatening previously Mrs Rhodes would be ‘eliminated.’ Celebrity: Animal lover Eva Rhodes, left, was murdered in Hungary in 2009, and found fame in the 1960s as a model and socialite. An inquest into her death has started in London today . Inquest: Eva Rhodes' daughter Sophia Barta (left) and Eva's sister Judith Majlath (right) at Westminster Coroner's Court during the inquest . Friendship: Eva Rhodes became friends John Lennon and Yoko Ono, whose cash eventually helped pay for her animal sanctuary . Two Scotland Yard detectives were at . Westminster Coroners Court in Central London to hear the horrific story . of how Mrs Rhodes had been bludgeoned to death and her body butchered . and burned in the grounds of the sanctuary she ran in Gyor, in . north-west Hungary. One of . her assistants, Csaba Augusztinyi, 33, a weight-lifter and wanted . criminal, later confessed and was jailed for 13 years but passing a . verdict of unlawful killing, Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox called . into question the findings of the investigations in Hungary. Crime: Her caretaker Csaba Augusztinyi admitted killing her and setting fire to her body but her daughter believes the police were also involved . She . said that while she was satisfied Augusztinyi was ‘at least partly . responsible’ inconsistencies in evidence supported the family's belief . ‘others might have been involved.’ Dr . Wilcox highlighted how examinations carried out in the UK on the . victim’s remains by a forensic anthropologist showed Mrs Rhodes had died . as a result of a ‘multitude of skull fractures’ in a ‘frenzied physical . assault’ which conflicted with Augusztinyi's evidence that a punch to . the face and single blow to the head had killed her. ‘It leaves uncomfortable concerns,’ she said. The . coroner said she was concerned Zoltan Peter, who it is believed was . pensioned off from the Gyor force as questions over the death began . emerging, was never questioned by Hungarian investigators. Sophia . Barta, Mrs Rhodes’s daughter, told the inquest how the policeman had . been responsible for a ‘Rambo’ style attack on her and her mother at the . sanctuary in 2002. A . dispute over a rescue dog had grown, she said, so that at one point the . officer had attacked her mother in the courtyard and then turned on Ms . Barta when she tried to photograph the assault. She said her head was ‘smashed’ against the wall and Zoltan Peter then hit her repeatedly with his baton. 'I crumpled into a heap and he began raining blows on me with his baton - an American baton designed to break bones,’ she said. 'I turned my head and looked at his face and his eyes were that of somebody taking great pleasure in what he was doing. ‘I thought I was going to die.' Eva Rhodes pictured in Tuscany (left). The 65-year-old disappeared in September 2008 from her home in Gyor, near Budapest in Hungary. Caretaker Csaba Augusztinyi  admitted killing the former model and socialite . Horrific crime: Ms Rhodes was murdered at her animal sanctuary in September 2008 near Gyor, 65-miles from Budapest. Her body was dismembered and burnt . Star: Eva Rhodes being chased by the press in London at the height of her fame in the 1960s . Eventually, . Mrs Rhodes calmed him, she recalled, but not before he had ‘crushed . like a pancake’ a grey kitten with his foot that had been beside her . head. With the support of . Amnesty International, Ms Barta, from Chelsea, West London, and her . mother successfully took court action against Peter but pressure from . the authorities meant a series of further trials with the final one set . for the month after Ms Rhodes was murdered. Ms . Majlath, whose work on mine clearance was recognised with the Nobel . Peace Prize in 1997, said Zoltan Peter had threatened to have her sister . killed as legal proceedings continued between them over the attack. Conspiracy: Ms Rhodes' sister Judith Majlath believes that the Hungarian authorities covered up the investigation to protect a local police officer . She . said: ‘She told me her life had been endangered.  She had received . phone calls and dead animals thrown into her house and locals were being . nasty... ‘She said to me she was frightened of him and genuinely her life was in danger. ‘Zoltan Peter had said to her “I will get you eliminated"".’ The . former beauty queen's sister raised the alarm on September 18, phoning . the Hungarian police from her home in Vienna, Austria, saying Mrs Rhodes . was missing. The next day, . Ms Majlath arrived at sanctuary to find the boss of another animal . sanctuary taking the animals and her sister's office ransacked and a . laptop stolen. She claimed she reported a robbery and her sister's disappearance but the police did not want to know. A few weeks later she paid for cadaver search dogs to look around the grounds. All . three found blood traces inside her Land Rover but the police failed to . impound the vehicle.  Worried that a cover up was under way, she moved . the vehicle to a house Ms Barta owned but it disappeared, the inquest . heard. The charred remains . of her sister were found partially buried in the sanctuary’s grounds . after they had been moved in a wheelbarrow from the fire by Augusztinyi, . who then telephoned sex chat lines. Dr Wilcox said she found both Ms Barta and her aunt to ‘be credible and compelling witnesses.’ The cats and dogs sanctuary was funded partly by donations from animal lovers in England and a gift from Yoko Ono . The battered body of Eva Rhodes was found in woods near her home (pictured) near Gyor, 65-miles from Budapest . She . continued : ‘I accept the evidence of Sophia Barta that this man had . previously seriously assaulted her on the sanctuary premises in a manner . which would appear strikingly similar to the attack which later took . her mother's life. ‘I am concerned that this man never appears to have been questioned in relation to Eva's death.’ Foreign . Secretary William Hague has twice written to the Hungarian authorities . asking them to hand over details of their inquiries so Scotland Yard can . review the case but they have steadfastly refused. Now . the family believe the inquest and Dr Wilcox’s findings provide a . compelling reason for Scotland Yard to be invited to carry out a new . investigation. Ms Majlath said : ‘The verdict completely contradicts the findings of the Hungarian court. 'This is because it was built on lies and the story of the murderer which is now completely crushed. ‘It . has been five years of Hungarian cover-ups and heartache seeking truth . and justice.  There is now a clear case for an independent investigation . by Scotland Yard. Beauty: Ms Rhodes was a successful model and actress before moving to Hungary to look after animals . ‘Ironically, . Viktor Orban, the Prime Minister of Hungary, was in London giving a . speech on European Traditional Values, as the inquest took place. Surely truth, justice and transparency should be high among them. ‘Prime Minister now is the time that you act upon what you are preaching at this moment. 'I would like to see Horvath Zoltan Peter interrogated and brought to justice.' Mrs Rhodes, whose family left Hungary in the late 1956, rose to fame as a model and actress in London in the 1960s. Her . stunning looks and skill as a model and actress attracted the attention . of John Lennon and Yoko Ono, who were looking for an actress to star in . a film they were making called Rape, about the intrusion of the camera . in everyday life. She . married British architect Mark Rhodes. The couple later divorced and she . established the sanctuary in 1997 using £150,000 of her own money.  It . was subsequently partly supported by donations from animal lovers in the . UK and a payment from Yoko Ono.","Former socialite Eva Rhodes found dead in woods near her home in 2009 .

"By . Jason Groves . and David Williams . America pointed the finger of blame at the Syrian regime last night for the chemical weapons attack on civilians that has horrified the world. The US State Department said Syrian rebels did not have the means to carry out an outrage on the scale seen in the Damascus suburbs on Wednesday – leaving tyrant Bashar Al Assad firmly in the dock. Amid signs that the West is rapidly moving closer to intervention in Syria’s bloody civil war, Barack Obama ordered US intelligence agencies to ‘urgently gather’ evidence about the attack, which killed up to 1,700 civilians, many of them women and children.

A State Department spokesman said . that, if confirmed, the use of chemical weapons by Assad’s regime would . be ‘an outrageous and flagrant escalation’ of the conflict. As France called for a ‘reaction of force’, London and Washington were weighing the options for responding to the massacre.

Sources said that Foreign Secretary . William Hague and US Secretary of State John Kerry would hold talks . overnight to discuss a co-ordinated response. David Cameron is expected to call world leaders from his holiday in Cornwall to discuss the crisis. Number . 10 sources insisted that there had still been no decision over whether . Britain should arm Syria’s rebels. But a source acknowledged the . massacre would reignite the debate about intervention. ‘The . more attacks of this sort there are, and the bigger they are, the more . we have to look again at the options,’ the source said. France . led the calls for the West to wade into the conflict. Foreign minister . Laurent Fabius said that if there is proof of a chemical weapons attack . by the regime ‘we need a reaction by the international community... a . reaction of force’. Turkey . also stressed the need for action. ‘All red lines have been crossed but . still the UN Security Council has not even been able to take a . decision,’ said foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu. Britain . called for UN chemical weapons inspectors – already in Syria – to be . given urgent access to the site of the deadly toxic attack. A . Government source said: ‘If the Assad regime really wants to . demonstrate it had nothing to do with this, they have a UN investigation . team 20 minutes away. The fact they are not being allowed access fuels . concerns about what has happened.’ United Nations secretary general Ban Ki-moon also called for inspectors to be allowed in ‘without delay’. But . the Assad regime appeared determined to resist the calls, with Syrian . officials warning the safety of inspectors cannot be guaranteed in areas . that have been the scene of frequent brutal clashes since the conflict . began in March 2011. Russia, . Assad’s strongest ally, also called on Syria to allow the inspectors in . – but put the blame on rebels, claiming that victims were killed by ‘a . homemade rocket loaded with an unidentified chemical agent’ and saying . the attack was likely to be a provocation by opposition forces. Former . foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said the images of rows of dead . children underlined the case for arming Syria’s rebels. ‘If . it is proven – which seems likely – that this was a serious chemical . attack then it indicates they are using weapons of mass destruction,’ he . said. ‘That is a red line which must lead to a serious response.

"By . David Williams . Plot: Samantha Lewthwaite planned to attack Western-linked buildings in Kenya . British fugitive Samantha Lewthwaite has been officially named as a ‘key actor’ in an Al Qaeda-linked plot to blow up Kenya’s Parliament and the United Nations offices in Nairobi. The so-called ‘White Widow’ - the world’s most wanted woman - is also said to have been part of a terrorist cell targeting Kenyan Defence Force camps, Western embassies and the assassination of the country’s top politicians. A Kenyan intelligence report leaked yesterday links the widow of 7/7 suicide bomber Jermaine Lindsay to Abdulkadir Mohamed Abdulkadir, the man U.S. Navy Seals were hunting in a ‘kill or capture’ mission in Somalia at the weekend. He is said to have been the mastermind of the multiple plots in Kenya in late 2011 and early 2012 which the report says were sanctioned by Al Qaeda’s core leadership in Pakistan. It is the first time the Home Counties mother-of-four has been named in connection with the plots which were foiled by the Kenyan authorities, underlining her importance to Somali-based, Al Qaeda-inspired terror groups. The 29 year-old had only been previously linked to alleged plots to blow up Western hotels in Mombasa and a grenade attack on a popular bar in the Indian Ocean resort. Al-Shabaab terrorists, seen here, are believed to pose a worldwide security threat . Lewthwaite, who was named last month . on an Interpol international arrest warrant, escaped capture in Mombasa . when she produced a fraudulently obtained South African passport in . another person’s name and convinced officers she was not the Briton they . were hunting. The . detailed report will raise new questions over whether Lewthwaite played . any role in the planning of the Westgate shopping mall attack on . September 21 in which 60 people died. In . the immediate aftermath of that attack, reports suggested she may have . been among the gunmen but this has now been questioned. It . will raise questions too over why there was not greater security in . place at one of Nairobi’s premier shopping centres after intelligence . officers spelt out in the report how a year earlier they knew of plans . for an attack there. Close proximity: The Navy SEAL raid in the coastal town of Baraawe was about 130 miles south of Mogadishu . Wanted: Samantha Lewthwaite, known as the 'White Widow,' is one of the world's most hunted terrorists . The . National Intelligence Service report, in an entry dated exactly one . year before the mall attack, said operatives of the Somali-based . Islamist group Al Shabaab were in Nairobi ‘and are planning to mount . suicide attacks on undisclosed date, targeting Westgate Mall and Holy . Family Basilica.’ Two suspects were believed in possession of suicide vests, grenades and AK-47 assault rifles, the report said. The . men who attacked the Westgate mall and held off besieging Kenyan troops . for several days were armed with grenades and AK-47s, but apparently . had no suicide vests. It . was unclear if one planned attack on the mall was foiled and then . carried out again or if it was merely postponed for a year by Al . Shabaab, which claimed responsibility for the carnage. The . internal document shows that Kenyan intelligence officers have detailed . information about plots and individuals tasked with carrying them out. Other . targeted sites included the capital’s Hilton Hotel, the Yaya shopping . mall, the office of the prime minister, and possibly the embassies of . the United States - which was blown up by Al Qaeda in 1998 - and of . Britain and Israel.","Samantha Lewthwaite was a 'key actor' in plan to attack Western-linked buildings and the Kenyan parliament .

"By . David Williams . and Tom Leonard . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said several Arab states were willing to pay for a U.S- led invasion of Syria . Arab countries have offered to pay for an invasion of Syria by US forces amid new fears that President Assad’s regime possesses biological as well as chemical weapons. US Secretary of State John Kerry revealed that several states had promised they were ready to foot the bill for overthrowing Assad if America led the military operation. Syria’s Arab neighbours are worried about the spread of the civil war and the possibility that the regime’s use of chemical or biological weapons could spill over into their backyards. Mr Kerry spoke as Russia warned of a catastrophe if US missile strikes hit a nuclear reactor containing enriched uranium near Damascus. Nearly six million people live in and around the Syrian capital and the Kremlin called on the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear agency, to assess the risk urgently as the US considers action to punish the Syrian regime for last month’s gas attack that killed hundreds. ‘If a warhead, by design or by chance, were to hit the Miniature Neutron Source Reactor (MNSR) near Damascus, the consequences could be catastrophic,’ said a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry. It warned that nearby areas could be contaminated by highly enriched uranium and that it would be impossible to account for the nuclear material after such a strike, suggesting it could fall into the hands of people who might seek to use it as a weapon. Mr Kerry did not identify which countries made the invasion offer, although Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf monarchies have privately urged the US to topple Assad – whom they see as the main regional ally of their enemy, Iran. ‘With respect to Arab countries to bear costs and to assess, the answer is profoundly yes,’ said Mr Kerry. ‘They have. That offer is on the table.’ While ‘boots on the ground’ have been ruled out at this stage, the Pentagon believes that it would require at least 75,000 troops to secure chemical weapons held at several sites around Syria. Syria¿s Arab neighbours are worried about the spread of the civil war. Pictured, a U.S. F/A-18E Super Hornet prepares to launch from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the Red Sea . The nuclear warning came amid reports in the US that Syria possesses the ingredients to manufacture biological weapons, including lethal bacteria and viruses, and has the equipment necessary to convert them into powders and aerosols to deliver their payload against military or civilian targets. US officials believe Syria’s bio-weapons programme has been largely dormant since the 1980s. But its capability has alarmed other Arab nations. On Sunday, the Arab League called for international action against Assad over his regime’s ‘ugly crime’ of using chemical weapons. Any biological weapons would be particularly dangerous as they are designed to spread easily and leave little evidence of their origins. President Putin has warned that an attack on Syria without UN support would be an ‘act of aggression’. Moscow has been the most powerful ally of President Assad, shielding him from tougher UN resolutions and warning that a Western military attack on Syria would raise tensions and undermine efforts to end the country’s civil war. The IAEA said in a report to member states last week that Syria had declared there was a ‘small amount of nuclear material’ at the MNSR, a type of research reactor usually fuelled by highly enriched uranium. Nuclear expert Mark Hibbs, of the Carnegie Endowment think-tank, said the MNSR was a very small reactor and would not contain a lot of nuclear material. But he said there could be ‘a serious local radiation hazard’ if any nuclear material in the reactor were to be dispersed by a weapon strike.","U.S. Secretary of State: Syria's neighbours want to stop conflict spreading .

The huge sea of refugees besieging a border crossing with Iraq is contributing to a growing humanitarian tragedy. As Britain committed £348million in aid to help meet the mounting crisis, United Nations officials revealed two million refugees have fled their homeland with one person escaping across Syria’s borders every 15 seconds. Scroll down for video . Crisis: More than 2million Syrians have now fled the country and been forced into refugee camps like Zaatari in Jordan . Giant: The Zaatari camp has ballooned to such a huge size that it is now Jordan's fifth-biggest city . Disaster: The humanitarian crisis caused by the war is the worst since that seen in 1990s Afghanistan . The UN High Commissioner for Refugees yesterday laid bare the scale of the suffering with more than one million children forced from their country.Antonio Guterres said: ‘Syria has become the great tragedy of this century – a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history. ‘It took two years to reach the first million refugees. It took six months for the second million to be reached. It means things are accelerating in a way that represents a dramatic humanitarian problem. The only solace is the humanity shown by the neighbouring countries in welcoming and saving the lives of so many refugees.’ An average of almost 5,000 Syrians are fleeing into neighbouring countries every day, and officials warned of the need to significantly increase humanitarian aid and development support to host communities.

Leaving home: Some of the 2million Syrians who have been forced to flee their homeland thanks to the civil war . Youngsters: More than half of the 2million refugees are children less than 17 years old . At the border: A total of more than 6million people have been displaced within Syria or forced to leave the country . British money is providing support including food, medical care and relief items for more than one million people including those affected by the fighting in Syria and refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and Iraq. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: ‘It’s shocking that there are now two million Syrian refugees. The number has doubled in the last six months alone. ‘Neighbouring countries who have accepted these refugees have shown huge generosity but also shouldered huge burdens. Britain has given its largest ever response to a humanitarian crisis. ‘The international community must follow this lead and provide the long-term support needed for host countries to cope.’In Syria itself, UK aid has already delivered food for more than 156,000 people affected by violence and shelter and relief items for 305,000. In neighbouring countries, British support has provided safe drinking water and sanitation to almost 100,000 people in Jordan and Lebanon and shelter and essential relief supplies for more than 84,000. Crossing over: Refugees arriving over the weekend in Turkey, which is one of the countries hardest-hit by the influx of fleeing Syrians . Family: Many relatives have sought a new life abroad after constant fighting made it unsafe to stay in their homes . Aid: UN workers hand out supplies to Syrians who have reached the Peshkhabour border crossing between their country and Iraq . The UN said that by the end of August, two million Syrians had applied to register as refugees – including 716,000 in Lebanon, 515,000 in Jordan, 460,000 in Turkey, 168,000 in Iraq and 110,000 in Egypt. More than half – 52 per cent – of the refugees are children aged 17 or under. Foreign Secretary William Hague wrote on Twitter: ‘One year ago: 230,000 Syrian refugees. Today: 2,000,000. 1/2 children. If we don’t end the conflict, think what the figure could be next year.’ In addition to those who have left Syria during the two-and-a-half-year war, 4.25million people have also been displaced. David Bull, executive director of Unicef UK, warned that the humanitarian response to the situation in Syria is ‘dangerously underfunded’. He said: ‘We urge everyone to focus now on the humanitarian aid needed to help repair the shattered childhoods of Syria’s children. We must provide them with some sense of hope and normality amidst this most awful of crises.’ Despair: A young boy sitting on the ground in a refugee camp in Iraq - which is itself suffering from a long-running civil war .

"By . Lucy Thackray . AC/DC guitarist Malcolm Young is unlikely to return to the band, according to the rock group's biographer. Malcolm, 61, has already been temporarily replaced by his nephew, Stevie, while he battles a mystery illness that saw him hospitalised last month . Speaking to a US radio station, biographer Jesse Fink has warned fans to expect that 57-year-old Stevie is now part of the band and will tour as a part of AC/DC later in the year instead of Young. Scroll down for video . Guitarist Malcolm Young on stage with AC/DC in 1971 . Malcolm Young (far left) is not expected to return to AC/DC as he struggles with an undisclosed illness. Here he is pictured with (from left to right) Cliff Williams, Angus Young and Brian Johnson. ‘I’m not expecting to see Malcolm return,’ Fink said. ‘I think the important thing is that we let Mal be and hope he can recover. But I think we should all expect that Stevie Young is in the band now.’ Stevie played on the band’s latest album, their 15th record, which is expected to be released later this year. The band reunited in Vancouver, Canada in May this year to record their new music. Stevie first filled in for his uncle in 1988 whilst Malcolm received help for his issues with alcohol. Malcolm Young (far left) pictured with AC/DC in 1981 . Frontman Brian Johnson confirmed that Malcolm is in hospital last month in an interview with Classic Rock Magazine. Johnson also revealed the huge impact Malcolm’s absence is having on the band. They are considering calling the album Man Down. ‘It’s a bit negative and it was probably just straight from the heart. I like that,’ Johnson explained. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the band's formation. It's rumoured they will celebrate with a 40-show tour across 40 cities - but Stevie Young will tour the band in place of his uncle, Malcolm Young. Fink has just released a new AC/DC biography, entitled The Youngs: The Brother Who Built AC/DC. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the band and there has been speculation the band will perform 40 shows in 40 cities as a part of celebrations.","AC/DC's Aussie biographer says 'I'm not expecting to see Malcolm return'
