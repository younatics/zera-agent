"Marc Wroe, who was jailed for 18 weeks at Preston Magistrates Court after a seven-year stalking campaign against a married colleague . An officer worker secretly urinated in a married colleague's water bottle during a seven-year stalking campaign where she repeatedly spurned his advances. Marc Wroe, 44, kept pestering mother-of-one Heather Kendall with a string of suggestive emails while working together at a distribution company in Preston. She received mystery parcels of ladies underwear, lingerie catalogues and samples in the post plus Valentine’s cards addressed to her husband posted to her home and bunches of 'apology' flowers. Wroe, from Preston, Lancashire, also turned up unannounced at her home late night whilst her daughter was in bed and whilst her husband was away on business. Police were eventually called in after Mrs Kendall noticed the liquid in her bottle of sparking water which she kept on her desk had a 'foul smell' and went to her bosses. CCTV cameras were installed at the distribution company where they worked and captured Wroe sneaking past her desk, taking the sparkling water bottle with him and returning with it full of liquid. Tests then showed it was contaminated with his own urine. Today Wroe was jailed for 18 weeks after he admitted harassment between July 2007 and April 2014. In a statement she said she thought Wroe was trying to 'play a twisted, perverted game' with her. She said the stalking campaign left her feeling 'dirty and suspicious of people' and was now 'living her life on pins.’ She also added she could not even go to the supermarket for fear of bumping into her tormentor. Preston Magistrates Court was told the the victim’s ordeal began in 2007 when she started receiving emails from Wroe as they worked together at Tom Parker Ltd in Preston. Prosecuting Miss Alex Mann said the messages started out as 'harmless emails at work' but said Mrs Kendall 'wasn’t interested' in Wroe and she emailed him at home asking him not to send her so many messages at work. Scroll down for video . Miss Mann said: 'The contact continued even after she asked him to stop. She said the content wasn’t professional - it was a bit sexually suggestive.. 'He was told by the police not to contact her. Contact did stop for about six months, unfortunately other things happened after that. 'She says the defendant was turning up at her home at 10pm knocking at the door. Her husband was away with business she was home alone with her child. It unnerved her. 'She was concerned how he knew where she lived. She did get flowers sent as an apology. 'He continued to email her. She sent a reply telling him to leave her alone but he didn’t take any notice.' Victim Heather Kendall, who found that Wroe had urinated in her water bottle while they were both working for a distribution company in Preston . The emails got more and more explicit and on one occasion, Wroe commented on an item of underwear he had seen in Mrs Kendall’s bag, which was belonged to her daughter. After an incident in which Wroe turned up at her home, a colleague warned him off but Mrs Kendall believed Wroe was watching her every move. She eventually told her partner everything after catching him staring at her as she got into her car. Miss Mann added that the victim’s statement told of her becoming 'scared' of his behaviour and was concerned that it wasn’t right. She added: 'It affected her work life, home life and impacted on her relationship with her partner and child. She was constantly upset. he goes on to mention at work she felt that her water bottle smelt a bit funny, she noticed a particularly foul smell that reminded her of urine, it was clear that it was in it.' Last February she went to the director, and was said to be 'shaking' saying she felt awful she had to work with someone who hated her so much. When it happened again, tests showed her water was contaminated and the firm set up cameras on. Three days later, Wroe was caught contaminating her water. He was sacked. Miss Mann said: 'The cameras did show the defendant leaving with the water bottles and returning with them. It happened more than once. She was scared what could happen in the future. She didn’t know what she had done to deserve this.” Cameras were installed at the Tom Parker Ltd in Preston and tests revealed that the water bottle had been contaminated with urine . She added that the victim had always spoken to him in a 'courteous' and 'professional' manner. Miss Mann said Wroe had previously been handed a caution for public damage and public order offence in the past. She added: 'It seems he has simply targeted this lady for whatever reason.' In mitigation, Wroe’s lawyer Greg Earnshaw said that his client had been sacked as result of his behaviour. Mr Earnshaw said : 'The defendant has expressed remorse and done so by writing directly to the court. It has hung over his head for some time. 'He has obviously lost his job, he will probably lose his employability. He is not work shy. He is ashamed by the publicity. He is thinking of moving from the area. He is not suffering from any mental disorders.' But passing sentence district judge Jane Goodwin said: 'This was extremely serious behaviour that continued over seven years, although not constant it was behaviour in a work place. 'It is accepted there were sexual connotations by way of emails. You ignored warnings not only from your victim but the work place too. It appears you were fixated with Mrs Kendall. You visited her address late in the evening. She hadn’t provided you with that and it heightened her anxiety.' Wroe who appeared in the dock with his head bowed throughout was also banned from contacting Mrs Kendall for three years and was ordered not to go within 100 metres of Tom Parker Ltd. Mrs Kendall refused to speak after the hearing saying only she was “pleased” with the sentence.","Marc Wroe repeatedly pestered Heather Kendall stalking her for seven years .

"This is the dramatic moment a gang of masked raiders carried out a daring sledgehammer raid on a row of jewellery shops in the middle of the day. Shocked shoppers ran for cover as four men carrying hammers and axes burst through the Argyll Arcade in Glasgow today as they carried out smash and grab raids on four stores. Witnesses said an elderly security guard was rushed to hospital after being hit by one of the gang. Scroll down for video . Raid: This is the dramatic moment a gang of masked raiders carried out a daring sledgehammer raid on a jewellery shop in Glasgow's Argyll Arcade in the middle of the day . Smoke: Hammer-wielding gang members were seen sprinting through a cloud of thick smoke, thought to have been caused by a security device. A security guard, wearing his traditional top hat, can be seen trying to apprehend them . Four jewellery shops - Rox, Mappin and Webb, Laing the Jeweller, Lewis Grant - were targetted, with the gang only able to break into Rox, where police said they stole a 'small quantity' of jewellery, before running off. The gang's getaway, through thick smoke which police said was released by a security device, was captured on video by stunned shoppers, who were warned that they would be shot unless they moved. A security guard, dressed in his traditional uniform, complete with top hat, is seen trying to apprehend the gang. A security smoke alarm was triggered, and the thieves, dressed in dark clothing with their faces covered, were then seen running out of the centre onto pedestrianised shopping destination, Buchanan Street. They were then filmed darting down an alleyway between the arcade and the next door Princess Square shopping centre. In video footage taken of the raid, one gang member can be heard to say: 'Out the way or I will kill you all.' Shock: Shoppers watch as the gang make their escape through the smoke-filled arcade . Escape: The gang were then seen running out of the Arcade and sprinting down a shopping street . Police officers immediately closed down the shopping promenade, and cordoned off parts of Buchanan Street as well as blocking a side entrance and lowering the centre's shutters to prevent anyone from entering. Retired district nurse Sally Fitzpatrick, 66, from East Kilbride, was in Laings jewellers with her sister, Margaret McGlone, 70, when the gang struck. 'I was in Laings and suddenly there was a bang outside the shop and then four or five men came running through wearing balaclavas and carrying truncheons,' she said. 'They hit the glass of the shop opposite Laings but then never got in, and then they ran away. But the glass never broke it just shattered, so I don't think they got anything. 'The next thing the jewellers set off smoke which was quite frightening as I didn't know what was happening. 'They never said to me, but seemingly they set off the smoke to deter people although I don't know how it would deter people outside because the smoke was inside. 'I never saw axes, all I saw was balaclavas and truncheons because they were just running by the shop. Probe: A police spokesman confirmed that officers were investigating reports of an armed robbery . Witness: Shopper Calum Macaulay said he saw men in balaclavas running away from the Arcade . 'I was scared and everybody else was frightened, the women in Laings were frightened. Seemingly the security guard got hit, an elderly man, and he got taken away to hospital. 'It was the last thing I expected to happen while I was out looking for a new ring for myself. 'I didn't fear for my life because I was inside the shop, but if I'd been outside then it might have been different.' Her sister Margaret had left the arcade just before the men struck. She said: ''I'd just walked outside the arcade so I didn't see what happened and by the time I went back inside there was smoke coming out of the shop that Sally had been in. 'I thought it was just a fire at the time when I saw all the smoke and then Sally appeared after that so I knew she was all right. ""Only the security guard got hurt, it seemed to be his leg but I don't know what with. The police came fairly quickly, within five or 10 minutes.' Eye-witness Liam Dargie, 21, who lives in Perth, captured the dramatic moment the men tried to flee the scene. Aftermath: Five police vehicles and an ambulance are seen waiting outside the Arcade, while police officer guards the entrance . Sealed off: Officers tape off the entrance to the Argyll Arcade on Glasgow's busy Buchanan Street . Escape route: After leaving the Arcade, the gang was seen sprinting down this alleyway . He said: 'A group of masked men running out the arcade carrying sledgehammers and big holdall bags. 'They ran into the alleyway next to the arcade while loads of smoke came piling out of it.' Another witness said she was told by the masked men they would 'shoot' if she did not move. Digitial designer and film maker David McCourt, 25, said: 'Myself and two colleagues were walking up Buchanan Street, when we were heard what sounded like a fire alarm coming from the Argyll Arcade. 'As we passed the opening to the arcade, we noticed many terrified looking shoppers fleeing from the scene. 'As we looked in, we noticed the arcade's smoke clouds had been activated with four to five figures dressed in black emerging. 'They were wearing balaclavas to conceal their identities and began to charge at the security brandishing baseball bats and hatchets, with some of them attempting to break the reinforced glass as they began their escape. 'Unable to successfully make away with any merchandise, the group of thieves then fled, with one of them shouting ""I'll f****** kill you all"", at which point I stopped filming. 'They were last seen disappearing down the adjoining alley way on foot, witnessed by some 30-40 onlookers.' Emergency: Police were called to the shopping centre at 12.20pm today . Eye-witness Paul Gray, 42, a marketing manager from Glasgow, said: 'I was standing outside in Buchanan Street when the smoke and alarms went off. At first we thought it was a fire, but the smoke was white. 'Then out of the smoke came four hooded boys carrying axes and baseball bats. 'They shouted at our crowd at the door to get out if the effing way or I'll kill you all. 'They then doubled back onto the next lane and ran quickly. It was jaw dropping.' Speaking on social media, Ann-Marie McMenemy, said: 'Lovely lunch. Got screamed at off four balaclavad [sic] men at argyll arcade they would shoot me if I didn't move - thanks guys so nice.' Calum Macaulay also tweeted: 'Was about to enter Fraser's on Buchanan St earlier and alarms going off and blokes in balaclavas running from jewellery heist.' And shutters were also pulled down on the jewellery district, as officers could be seen taking statements from shaken customers and members of staff. A lane next to the arcade - opposite House of Fraser - was also sealed off with several police officers standing guard. Fire crews were also in attendance amid reports smoke could be seen coming from the arcade. The Arcade prides itself on being Glasgow's jewellery quarter, similar to London's Hatton Garden, and boasts of offering 'the largest selection of diamond rings, diamond jewellery, wedding rings and watches in a single location in Scotland'. There are 19 shops inside the shopping mall, most of which are jewellers. A window at the Mappin and Webb branch was broken, but it is not thought the raiders gained entry to the shop. Target: The gang are thought to have tried to smash a window at the Mappin and Webb branch . A Police Scotland spokesman said police were alerted to the theft at around 12.50pm. 'Police were called to a report of four jewellers - Rox, Mappin and Webb, Laing the Jeweller, Lewis Grant - being targeted by four males,' she said. 'They managed to enter only one of the jewellers – Rox - and quickly grabbed a small quantity of jewellery before running off. 'A security guard sustained a leg injury during the incident. The four male suspects were last seen running up a lane at the side of the arcade’s Buchanan Street entrance. Officers are currently speaking to witnesses and gathering CCTV images to establish more details on the four men responsible. 'The four suspects are described as 5ft 8ins in height and of slim build. All were wearing dark clothing. 'It is believed that they made off in a white hatchback vehicle. A white Volkswagon Golf has been recovered in St James Road, Townhead, Glasgow and enquiries are also ongoing at that location to establish if it is the vehicle involved.' In September last year, a thief stole a watch and ring worth over £10,000 at Rox Jewellers in Glasgow's Argyll Arcade. He stole the items worth a five-figure and was chased by a security guard into Buchanan Street before he was lost in the King Street car park area near St Enoch Shopping Centre.

"The family of a woman animal keeper mauled to death when a tiger walked through an open door say they still have questions unanswered following the conclusion of an inquest into her death. Sarah McClay, 24, was pounced on in the keeper's corridor of the tiger house at South Lakes Wild Animal Park in Cumbria before she was dragged by the back of the neck into a den and then to an outside enclosure. The animal was supposed to never have access to the corridor but male tiger Padang walked straight through a door to where Miss McClay, from Barrow-in-Furness, was as she carried out her cleaning and feeding duties in the house. Sarah McClay, left died after she was mauled by a tiger at the South Lakes Wild Animal Park in Cumbria . An inquest jury in Kendal ruled in a narrative verdict that Padang got to Miss McClay by entering two open internal sliding gates within the house and then an open door that led on to the corridor. Systems were in place at the park in Dalton-in-Furness in to ensure that animals and keepers remained apart at all times through indoor and outdoor compartments connected by lockable self-closing doors. But when staff members rushed in after the attack on May 24 last year they found the door to one of the tigers' dens ajar and not locked. Two internal sliding gates were also open which allowed Padang and his female companion, Alisha, to move in and out of a light den and a dark den to the outside enclosure. The court heard that a bolt on the top of the dark den door - which had been the one open immediately before the attack - was found to be defective in the hours following her death as the scene was examined but it could not be said if that damage had occurred before the fatality. An environmental health officer for the local authority told the jury that the top spring-loaded bolt could not be held back and it would bang against the frame when it tried to close, which left a gap of between 20mm and 25mm. Sarah's mother Fiona, left, asked to leave the inquest while park owner David Gill, right gave his evidence . The jury found that one or more of the bolts on that door extended so as to prevent it from closing into the frame. South Cumbria Ian Coroner told jurors though that their task was not to try and apportion any blame for Miss McClay's death but to determine the facts. A criminal health and safety at work investigation is being held by Barrow Borough Council which licenses the park. Following the hearing, Miss McClay's boyfriend, David Shaw, 25, told reporters he had a theory as to why the door to the corridor was open but he said he was not willing to share it at this stage. In a joint statement issued with Ms McClay's mother Fiona, left, her boyfriend, David Shaw, right, said the family still wanted answers to several questions about how the tiger was able to escape and attack Sarah . He said: 'We will see how things move forward. We are aware that the council in Barrow is still conducting their investigation and it would be wrong of us to say anything before they have concluded that investigation. 'There are always questions that we would like answered. We know full well that we will not be able to answer some of them ever but there is the chance that some answers may come out in the investigation in time.' In a joint statement with Miss McClay's mother, Fiona, Mr Shaw, a systems engineer for British Aerospace, added: 'Sarah's death has been difficult for us all and we hope that today's conclusion will help us move forward in some way. 'While this inquest has been a necessary step and has allowed us to understand some of the events on the day in greater detail, it cannot bring Sarah back to us. 'Our thanks go out to all of Sarah's friends, colleagues and well-wishers who have stood by us and who have offered their emotional strength to us. Your support has helped us through this traumatic time.' Glasgow-born Miss McClay had worked at the park for more than two years and was well experienced with working with big cats which she saw as a 'privilege'. Her mother, a 50-year-old housekeeper from Linlithgow, West Lothian, said it was her daughter's 'dream job' after she had visited the park as a child. Ms McClay was attacked in the tiger enclosure at the South Lakes Wild Animal Park in Cumbria . The inquest heard that a defective bolt on the door, circled on this scale model, allowed the tiger to escape . Giving evidence, she also said Miss McClay was 'a meticulous person to the extreme' who did not have any health or money problems. Mrs McClay said her daughter would not have blamed the tiger for the attack and would not want it to be killed. Colleagues spoke of her 'bubbly' personality, her passion for the job and her ability to engage with people, especially children. A post-mortem examination showed among Miss McClay's unsurvivable injuries were deep puncture wounds to the neck, the back of her body, both arms and her left foot. The jury heard that she was airlifted from the scene to Royal Preston Hospital where she was formally pronounced dead. Park visitor Gareth Bell, from Newcastle was the only person to see the moment through a viewing window that the tiger entered the corridor . A jury at South Cumbria Coroner's Court, pictured, returned a narrative verdict along with the known facts . He said it 'tore through' the door unhindered and dragged Miss McClay into the den as she let out a scream. Fellow zoo keeper Emma Els told the hearing that Miss McClay had let her into the tiger house shortly before the attack in the mid-afternoon to grease the internal sliding gates. But during the routine she ran out of grease and was let out of the tiger's dark den by Miss McClay and then the keeper's entrance. She said she could not recall whether her colleague shut the door on to the corridor after letting her out. Mrs Els said the Sumatran tigers were locked outside and in the outside enclosure at the time. She said it was around 3.45pm feeding time for the big cats but that the Sumatran tigers were on their once-a-week fasting that day. When she returned to the tiger house she saw people outside and someone had shouted 'the tiger is out', she said. Her husband, Cornelius, a maintenance worker, rushed to the scene and forced open the entrance door with a crowbar as staff secured the area. Park owner and founder David Gill, who designed the tiger house, told the jury how he jumped out of a digger 80 yards away and ran towards a fence on the side of the enclosure where he saw the tiger sitting over Miss McClay. Park visitor Gareth Bell, pictured, said he saw the attack through a viewing window. He told the inquest that the tiger 'tore through the door unhindered' and dragged Ms McClay into his den while she was screaming . He said he struggled to get a clean shot on Padang and had targeted the top of the animal's shoulder when he fired his rifle and the tiger darted back into the house. In a statement issued today, Mr Gill said: 'Sarah McClay was a dedicated and valued member of the animal caring staff at the park. 'Her enthusiasm and friendly character were appreciated by everyone she met. Sarah was committed to the aims of the park, to conservation and to preservation of rare species as seen for example in the red squirrel project she helped to develop and run. 'Her tragic and untimely death has affected all of us at the park and she is greatly missed. 'On behalf of myself and everyone at the park I wish to convey our condolences to Mr Shaw, Fiona McClay and all of Sarah's family and friends.' Shortly after Miss McClay's death, Mr Gill reportedly suggested that it was because of 'keeper mistake' and 'a sad error of judgment'. Mrs McClay, right, said some of the park owners comments about her daughter's death were 'ill-advised, premature and disrespectful'. She said the comments 'did not give anyone who read it a true picture of Sarah' Her family criticised the comments as 'ill-advised, premature and disrepectful' and said it had caused them hurt. Before Mr Gill was due to give evidence at the inquest, Mrs McClay asked to leave the room. She explained today that up to that point that only positive comments had been made about her daughter and she was wary that the statement would be brought up and cause those comments to be 'spoilt'. Asked about Mr Gill's initial statement, she said: 'I thought it was absolutely negative and certainly did not give anyone who read it a true picture of Sarah but I felt that everyone in court this week has done that.' At the time of the death, Cumbria Police said there was no suggestion of any foul play, suicide or self-harm and they believed it to be due to human or system error, or mechanical failing, or combination of both.","Sarah McClay died after a tiger escaped its enclosure due to 'defective bolt'

"A Texas teacher has resigned following comments she made about President Barack Obama and Muslims. Angela Box of Houston, Texas, was appearing on a local political show, Tommy's Garage, when she joked, 'Can't Ebola just take one for the team and take out Obama?' Box, a frequent guest on the show, also said in one episode, 'Every normal human being in the world knows that goat-f**king Muslims and, oh, boy f**king Muslims, are the evil of the world.' Scroll down for video . Resigned: Angela Box (above), a third grade teacher in Houston, resigned from her job after comments she made about President Barack Obama and Muslims on a local show became public . Ouch: Box joked in one episode of the local political show Tommy's Garage, 'Can't Ebola just take one for the team and take out Obama?' Too far: In another episode she referred to Muslims as 'bacon haters' and 'goat f**kers' After these comments became public and people began labeling her a racist, she decided to resign, a decision that was unanimously approved by the school board. Under her deal she will still receive three months of pay. Now Box, who was a third grade teacher at Daily Elementary, is trying to make it clear she is not a racist. Tommy's Garage host Tom Adkins tried to make this point by showing clips in which Box voices her support for South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, Florida Senator Marco Rubio, and female fighter pilot Major Mariam Al-Mansouri of the United Arab Emirates, who flew missions against ISIS earlier this year. She is also a fan of Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann, saying that in her dream government Palin would be head of the EPA and Bachmann the ambassador to the United Nations. Box also issued a statement to the Houston Chronicle saying, 'Opposing President Obama and sounding the alarm about radical Islam does not make me a racist.' She reiterated this sentiment in an interview with KHOU last month, saying, 'I don't believe in judging people by the color of their skin. I, actually, like Martin Luther King did, shockingly, judge people by the content of their character.' Tommy's Garage . Clearing her name: Box now wants to make it clear she is not a racist, saying she judges people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin . Now, Box is also voicing her anger on Twitter in what she believes is a double standard in regards to what she can say as opposed to others, specifically liberals and radical Muslims, the latter of whom she refers to in one video as 'bacon haters.' 'Degenerate liberals and America-hating, radical Muslim apologists get to say whatever but patriots have to shut up? NO MORE,' she wrote just this week. She has also used her new semi-public persona to share her views on other political issues, like Tuesday's release of the CIA tortue report. Box wrote on Facebook Wednesday, 'I'm sure any of the people around the world--including the 3,000 innocent souls lost on 9-11--who have been brutally murdered, genitally mutilated, crucified, enslaved, raped, stoned to death, burnt alive, or bombed by radical Muslims would gladly trade places with the terrorists the CIA made stand up for a long time, listen to death metal, or made really super cold.' In another post she shares her opinion that the GOP are just as 'despicable' as Democrats. As for the program that led to this trouble, Box makes it clear she never intended for children to watch it, or see her appearances. 'No I don't want children to watch it. That's cuckoo talk,' she said. 'But we're adults and it plays on midnights on a cable access station. It's a comedy satire show for people that have strong opinions.'","Angela Box of Houston, Texas, resigned from her job as a third grade teacher after comments she made about President Obama and Muslims .

"A drunk salesman threw himself to his death under the wheels of a three-tonne caravan while arguing with his girlfriend about whether she loved him, an inquest heard yesterday. Dominic Goddard, 23, was trying to get a taxi with Kirsty Eastwood, also 23, after a work Christmas party - when he told her: ‘The next car that comes down here, I am going to let it run me over.’ Moments later he stepped in front of a Jaguar X-Type car towing a caravan. The driver avoided Mr Goddard, of Cleckheaton, West Yorkshire, but he was hit by the caravan and dragged underneath. Couple: Dominic Goddard (right), 23, was trying to get a taxi with Kirsty Eastwood (left), also 23, after a work party when he told her: 'The next car that comes down here I am going to let it run me over' He suffered fatal crush injuries and died at the scene. In the moments before his death, Mr Goddard had kept jumping into the road and at one point jumped onto the bonnet of a taxi. Tests showed he would have been four times the drink-driving limit and had drunk the equivalent of 12 pints of beer or 21 single measures of spirits, Huddersfield Coroner's Court was told. An inquest heard Mr Goddard, who worked for a recruitment company, indulged in a weekend ‘drinking culture’. Tragedy struck on Boxing Day 2013 when he went to a party with Miss Eastwood. She told the hearing: ‘He seemed fine, absolutely fine when we first got there. I was tired and didn’t really know anyone at the party but once I said I would go he was absolutely fine. ‘He took four beers and had some vodka there. But at some point he started to get emotional and started saying he did not think I loved him and did not feel the same way about him. 'I just told him to calm down.’  Miss Eastwood left Mr Goddard for 15 minutes but found him still agitated and upset on her return. Dangerous game: In the moments before the tragedy Mr Goddard had kept jumping into the road and at one point jumped onto the bonnet of a taxi . She added: ‘He came into the living room and said to his friend that he needed to make more of an effort to be friends with me or he didn’t want anything to do with him. 'I love you': Miss Eastwood said she told her boyfriend to 'calm down' when he was agitated . ‘Everyone was getting upset now and one of the girls said she would take me home but I didn’t want to leave if while he was like that.’ Eventually she decided they should both head home and called a taxi. But as the pair walked along a road in to meet their taxi, Mr Goddard kept asking Miss Eastwood ‘do you actually love me?’ Miss Eastwood added: ‘He was shouting and he kept jumping in the road and then would come back to the pavement. He was all over the place.’ As they were walking along the road in Gomersal, a village next to Cleckheaton, he jumped on the bonnet of an oncoming taxi before jumping off. The taxi driver inspected his car for damage and drove off. Miss Eastwood said: ‘I shouted for him to come back to me when I saw the car coming down. He was at the side of the road and just ran in. ‘At this point I just started to try and calm him down saying “I love you, I need you to calm down.” But he kept saying he was fed up of how people thought of him. ‘I saw the caravan coming down the road and he was standing at my side at this point but as it came closer he sort of moved into the road. There was no warning. He suddenly moved out. ‘He had a clear view of it coming. It all happened so quickly. He was stuck underneath. It was horrific. I think it was an attention seeking thing. ‘He had that much to drink, he wasn’t thinking straight. He had done this before and it was for attention then as well.’ Eyewitness Helen Kilroy told the inquest: ‘I saw the couple walking up the pavement on the far side of the road. He was shouting and at that time I could not hear the words. ‘He began to randomly run into the road and back onto the pavement. He was shouting at the female.’ She said as Mr Goddard and Miss Eastwood walked further up the road toward her house she heard Mr Goddard say ‘I am a fat, black, ugly and psycho.’ Drunk: Tests showed Mr Goddard would have been four times the drink-driving limit and had drunk the equivalent of 12 pints of beer or 21 single measures of spirits . Ms Kilroy added: ‘I remember it was strange as he was slim, white and tall. The female was very distressed and he was not in control of his emotions. Horrific: Miss Eastwood said the incident leading to her boyfriend's death 'all happened so quickly' ‘The shouting continued and I heard him say “the next car that comes down here I am going to let it run me over”. When I heard that my heart started to pound in my chest as I didn’t know what was going to happen. ‘I saw lights coming down the road through the trees and seconds later there was an almighty bang. It was shocking.’ A toxicology report revealed Mr Goddard had 325 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit is 80mg. Mr Goddard’s co-worker Nicola Teale, who hosted the Christmas party, said: ‘Toward the end of the night Dominic appeared to be talking to Kirsty. The two moved to the kitchen. The discussion seemed to turn from a discussion to an argument but it wasn’t a shouting argument. 'Dominic can be emotional at times but he appeared in good spirits. It was unusual to see him having an argument with his girlfriend.’ The hearing was told Mr Goddard had ‘lost it’ during a previous row with his girlfriend when he stood in the road threatening that ‘I might as well get hit’, only to move to safety when a car approached. In a statement, his father Mark Goddard said: ‘Dominic was involved in a binge drinking culture. He wouldn’t usually drink during the week whilst at work but at weekends he would drink to excess. ‘Every so often he would get into a situation where he had to call his brother because he was drinking and could not look after himself.’ Location: As the couple were walking along a road (pictured) in the village of Gomersal in West Yorkshire, Mr Goddard jumped on the bonnet of an oncoming taxi before jumping off . The hearing was told Jaguar driver Terence Stocks, who was on his way to Spain with his wife for three months, could not avoid a collision. PC James Harrison said: ‘He had seen Mr Goddard jump in and out of the road and in order to give him as much space he move across on the opposite carriageway, making as much space as he could. ‘He was travelling at 25mph and heard a . bang and knew that his caravan had hit Dominic. He got out and checked . and found Dominic trapped under the caravan and got his wife to phone . the emergency services.’ 'He had a clear view of it coming. It all happened so quickly. He was stuck underneath. It was horrific' Kirsty Eastwood . Recording a conclusion of accidental death, assistant coroner Mary Burke said: ‘Although Dominic intentionally took this act, I am satisfied this was not an intentional act on Dominic’s part to take his life. ‘Dominic would undertake acts intended to provoke a reaction. He was in a highly charged emotional state and found it very difficult to control his emotions. ‘In addition the level of alcohol in his system would have affected his ability to think clearly. He did not appreciate what tragic consequences would unfold.’ Soon after his death at 1.30am on December 27, Miss Eastwood said in a tribute on Facebook: ‘Words can’t describe how much I miss my boy. I might have only known him six months, but we shared so much together and I know we’d have been together so much longer. ‘We had so many things planned for next year and I can’t believe he’s gone. Waking up and looking at my phone knowing I’ll never have my morning text from you is the hardest feeling.’","Dominic Goddard, 23, was trying to get a taxi with Kirsty Eastwood, 23 .

"A woman who was stalked by her ex-boyfriend left her family a note apologising for being 'weak' hours before she fell to her death from a motorway bridge, an inquest has heard. Kamaljit Sidhu, 29, died on October 25 last year following months of harassment from her ex-partner Ryan Dey. She died hours after plunging  from a motorway bridge over the M6 near Birmingham in the early hours of the morning. Kamaljit Sidhu (left), 29, died on October 25 last year following months of harassment from her ex-partner Ryan Dey (right) The bar manager was seen sitting on the ledge holding onto a gate while drinking from a bottle of wine shortly before she fell to her death. An inquest heard how the 'bubbly' 29-year-old had appeared happy on the day she died. But her attitude changed when she saw Dey - and her friend Wioletta Zawislak told Smethwick Coroner's Court that Miss Sidhu had 'crawled into the toilet' to hide from him. Ms Sidhu, known to friends as Kam, had been in a relationship with Dey for 18 months but she split up with him a week before her death in October. But the lorry driver refused to accept the relationship was over and stalked her on social media and bombarded her with late night calls to her home. In April, Dey, 23, was jailed for two years after he admitted stalking and causing serious alarm or distress. Dey had threatened her when she wanted to end the relationship, subjecting her to a long campaign that included sitting outside her home in his car sounding the horn. The inquest heard three young men saw Ms Sidhu, from Great Barr, sitting on a ledge drinking wine above the M6 before letting go and shouting 'no, no, no'. She later died of multiple injuries. Ms Sidhu (pictured left and right), known to friends as Kam, had been in a relationship with Dey for 18 months but she split up with him a week before her death in October . Family members later found a note attached to a bottle of moisturiser that said: 'I loved you all. I just got weak. Sorry. x.'. Recording a verdict of death by misadventure Coroner for the Black Country Robin Balmain said her actions on the bridge were 'inherently dangerous'. He added: 'This is a young lady who was troubled clearly. 'She had earlier suggested that her family might be at some risk if she went home. What happened is tragic.' The court heard that Dey had harassed Ms Sidhu in the last few months of the relationship before she was driven to split from him. He had stepped up his campaign of harassment during the last week of her life, the court was told. Dey stole her mobile phone while they were together and even hacked into her Facebook account to find out who she was talking to. He also threatened to reveal personal secrets to her family and rang her parents' home so often they were forced to change their number. Ms Sidhu died hours after plunging from a motorway bridge over the M6 (pictured) near  Birmingham . Family members found a note attached to a bottle of moisturiser after Ms Sidhu died, that said: 'I loved you all. I just got weak. Sorry. x.' Earlier Miss Zawislak told the inquest: 'She was really happy and laughing until she saw him. 'Then she crawled to the toilet to hide from him. She was terrified and shaking.' Speaking after the inquest, her sister Narinder Kaur said: 'Kam said to us that whatever he says he will do, he will do. 'We still do not know what happened to her between 2.30am and when she was seen on the ledge at 4.34pm. 'It's disappointing because there is a large gap there. No-one knows what she was doing or who she was with for those two hours. 'We were hoping to find out what happened then during the inquest, but we didn't. We think there is more to it.'","Kamaljit Sidhu suffered months of harassment from ex-partner Ryan Dey .

"Since it was revealed Mark Wahlberg is seeking a pardon in Massachusetts for assaults he committed as a teen, the actor is well aware that the court of public opinion has weighed in on why he wants one and whether he deserves it. 'Everyone has an opinion and has a reason why they think I'm doing it,' said the actor Wednesday at the New York premiere of his new movie 'The Gambler,' opening December 25. 'I've been working very hard to correct a lot of mistakes that I made since the day that I woke up and realized, 'You know what? I need to be a leader instead of a follower,'' he said. However, some Asian Americans are wary of his motivation and wondering why he has never personally apologized. Pardon? Mark Wahlberg's application seeking a pardon for a previous assault is being met with skepticism by some Asian Americans, wary of his motivation and wondering why he has never personally apologized . Troubled past: Mark Wahlberg served 45 days in prison after he blinded a man in a 1988 assault . A group called 18MR, short for 18MillionRising.org, which promotes civic engagement among Asians and Pacific Islanders in the United States, has voiced its opposition to the pardon. So far almost 3,000 signatured have been collected. A document was filed November 26 requesting the pardon by Wahlberg. It states in 1988, when Wahlberg was 16, he hit a man in the head with a wooden stick while trying to steal two cases of alcohol in front of a convenience store near his family's home in the Dorchester section of Boston. He punched another man in the face while trying to avoid police. Court documents reveal just how horrifying the 1988 attack was - including startling racial slurs he shouted at the victim and others. Wahlberg, who served 45 days in jail after the assault, says his record continues to impact him and could prevent businesses, such as restaurants, that work with him from getting licenses. Changed man: Now, Wahlberg is hoping to get a pardon for his past actions . New start? Mark Wahlberg and Rhea Durham attend 'The Gambler' premiere.  Wahlberg wants to become an LAPD reserve cop. But a felony conviction from his youth may block his attempt to become a volunteer . Scene of the crime: The liquor store where Wahlberg attacked a man with a stick and then ran away . He insists he has come a long way since April 1988, when he attacked Thanh Lam with a five-foot stick while yelling slurs at him in order to steal the two cases of beer he was carrying. Wahlberg admits in the application that he was high on marijuana and narcotics at the time. He ended up being convicted as an adult of assault and other charges, and he was sentenced to three months in jail. He said he was released after serving about 45 days. Wahlberg, 43, who went on to be a rapper and then A-list actor who's been nominated for an Oscar, said he isn't trying to use his public persona to sway the decision. 'In no way shape or form was I trying to use my celebrity or success to say, 'Well, I feel entitled to get this because of the fame and fortune.' Instead he said 'Every day I wake up trying to be the best person I can be.' He also tries to set an example for kids growing up in tough neighborhoods like he did. 'I've worked really hard to be a positive influence for kids growing up in communities like mine who don't really have a chance, and try to provide an opportunity for them to be more successful and that's why I'm doing it.' Family guy: Wahlberg (above with wife Rhea Durham and three of his children and Kevin Hart) is now committed to multiple charities and attends church every day . The actor said he's never shied away from talking about his troubled past. 'And it's not like the story hasn't been talked about. I've been talking about it for 25 years. You read any piece that's ever been done on me it's really the same old kind of story and for me to kind of be able to move on from that and move forward and continue to show kids that anything's possible.' But it was his appearance in the 1996 film Boogie Nights that really changed things, catapulting Wahlberg into the critically-acclaimed box office juggernaut that he is today. 'I am deeply sorry for the actions that I took on the night of April 8, 1988, as well as for any lasting damage that I may have caused the victims,' Wahlberg wrote in the pardon application. 'Since that time, I have dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that I can be a role model to my children and others.' Pardon? It will ultimately be up to newly elected Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker (above) to decide whether or not Wahlberg should be pardoned . He devotes much of his time and a large amount of his money to various charities, including the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation and the Dorchester Boys and Girls Club. He is also a family man now, married to former model Rhea Durham and the father of four children, and attends church daily. The Board of Pardons will investigate the petition to decide if it warrants a hearing before it is recommended to the governor who by that time will be the recently elected Charlie Baker. The Massachusetts Parole Board would have to review Wahlberg's case and make a recommendation to the governor, who can grant pardons. Pardons rarely are issued in Massachusetts. Governor Deval Patrick has not approved one in his nearly two terms in office. Nor did former Governor Mitt Romney. Wahlberg said his commitment to being a good person and role model stands, no matter the outcome. 'I will continue to do that whether the pardon is granted or not,' he said.","Mark Wahlberg is seeking a pardon from the state of Massachusetts for an assault he committed in 1988 that left a man blind in one eye .
Wahlberg, now 43, served 45 days in prison and was tried as an adult even though he was just 16 years old at the time .

"Police forces are appealing for motorist's dashcam footage in a bid to catch dangerous drivers. Dashboard-mounted cameras, which cost around £70 to install, are used by thousands of drivers in the UK. Many use them to protect against false claims or insurance premiums. But now forces are planning to make the . most of the cameras - and are appealing for drivers to send in footage . of other motorists breaking the law. Scroll down for videos . Appeal: Police are calling for drivers to submit their dashcam footage - such as this series which captured a driver hitting an elderly man - so they can catch more dangerous drivers . Hit: The 75-year-old man can be seen stepping out into the road while the driver speeds forward . Justice: The motorist - who was driving near Heathrow - was prosecuted and disqualified . Some cameras have already been used to catch dangerous drivers. Shocking footage taken by one driver in Southall, Heathrow, of a driver hitting an elderly man and then driving off led to a prosecution. The driver of a red vehicle can been seen speeding along for several minutes before attempting to overtake another motorist on a single carriageway. Crash: A Surrey police car can be seen stopped in the middle of a single carraigeway . Smash: The driver of a blue BMW then piles into the side of the car . Hit: The officer is sent flying and both cars are badly damaged . The footage shows the man stepping in to the road and the driver hitting him - before speeding off. The driver was disqualified thanks to the video. Other videos taken of dangerous UK drivers show a HGV narrowly avoiding a pile up on the A13 towards Dagenham.

Matt Stockdale of PoliceWitness.com - a . site that helps drivers submit footage to police - said: 'PoliceWitness.com is merely a conduit that helps the public assist the police. 'The incidents we report to the police are from members of the public who have inadvertently captured acts of inconsiderate or dangerous driving on their dash cams, set up to record their journeys whilst they go about their daily business.

"The family of beheaded American photojournalist James Foley are facing fresh agony after sick Islamic State militants tried to sell them his headless body for $1million, according to a new report by Buzzfeed. The website spoke to three middlemen trying to broker the deal, who say they can prove the body is Foley's with a DNA swab and will deliver the remains across the Turkish border once the ransom has been paid. Foley was the first American hostage to be beheaded by an ISIS militant in a graphic video recording this summer. Since August, the terrorist group overtaking large swathes of Syria and Iraq, has beheaded two more Americans and a Briton in similar displays of barbarism. Scroll down for video . Remains: ISIS militants are allegedly trying to sell the body of beheaded American hostage James Foley for $1million. The photojournalist was executed by the terrorist group this past summer, in a highly-graphic video recording (still from the video above) Victim: Foley was kidnapped from a cafe in a northwestern Syrian town on November 22, 2012. He was working as a photojournalist covering the civil war at the time . The three middlemen interviewed by Buzzfeed include a Syrian rebel fighter, a businessman and an official for the Free Syrian Army (FSA), the U.S.-backed rebel group helping to fight ISIS in the civil war-torn country. The rebel fighter, who also claimed to have connections to Jubhat al-Nusra (Al Qaeda's Syrian affiliate), called his work 'a humanity case' since he believes returning the body to Foley's parents will help bring them closure. 'They ask for $1 million, and they will send DNA to Turkey, but they want the money first,' he said. 'They will not give the DNA without the money.' But the FSA official warned Buzzfeed against publishing the article, believing the U.S. government would shut the deal down if they found out. Foley was one of 23 Western hostages held by ISIS earlier this year. Fifteen of the hostages were freed when their respective European governments paid millions of dollars in ransoms, but the British and American hostages were left behind since neither country negotiates with terrorists. Next offer: Before Foley was executed, ISIS allegedly offered to release him if his family paid a $132million ransom, but the amount was not paid since the U.S. does not negotiate with terrorists. Foley's parents John and Diane speak after the video depicting his beheading was released in August . It was previously reported that before Foley's death, his family was approached by the group with a $132million ransom to secure their son's release, but that U.S. officials made it clear that if they paid the ransom themselves it would be an act of treason. 'It will be like a shame for the U.S. government,' the FSA official said, of selling the body. 'People will ask why you brought the body but you didn’t bring him when he was alive.' The Foley family have not yet commented on the story, and the U.S. State Department told Buzzfeed 'we are seeking more information'. Holding Western captives for ransom is one of the main ways terrorists groups like ISIS raise money. A New York Times report published this year found that Al Qaeda has made at least $125million from ransoms since 2008, with $66million raised in 2013 alone.","Three middlemen confirmed the proposed deal to Buzzfeed .

"The woman who nearly died after drinking the industrial cleaning solution lye in an iced tea she bought from a Utah restaurant last week is slowly improving. Jan Harding, 67, has been upgraded from critical to serious condition and can now talk, albeit in a strained voice, and is also breathing on her own, family attorney Paxton Guyton said. Harding had been in critical condition since she consumed the tea and was rushed to a hospital last Sunday. Doctors last week determined she suffered deep, ulcerated burns in her upper esophagus and burns to her mouth. Improving: Jan Harding, pictured with her husband, is in now in serious condition after accidentally drinking lye at a BBQ restaurant. An employee reportedly thought a toxic cleaning agent was sugar . This comes as the police agency investigating how an industrial cleaning solution ended up in a woman's iced tea at a Utah restaurant, badly burning her throat, is forwarding its findings to prosecutors to determine if anyone should be charged. No arrests will be made until Salt Lake County Attorney Sim Gill reviews the investigation, South Jordan Cpl. Sam Winkler said Monday. That determination could come as soon as Wednesday. Police often arrest people on suspicion of a specific charge before handing over the case to prosecutors. But Winkler said this case is unusual because multiple people possibly played a role in what happened. 'We've looked at reckless endangerment to see if it might fit, but it's wide open for them to see what fits,' he said. Police were not releasing names, but Winkler said those who could be charged include current or past restaurant employees. Scene: She had taken one sip of the lye-laced tea at Dickey's Barbecue Pit near Salt Lake City, pictured . Authorities said a worker at Dickey's Barbecue in South Jordan unintentionally put the heavy-duty cleaner in a sugar bag last month. On August 10, the substance from the bag was mistakenly mixed it into the iced tea dispenser. Harding and her husband had just arrived at a Utah restaurant for a relaxing lunch with friends when she filled her cup with sweet tea from a self-serve beverage station. The 67-year-old grandmother took one sip before spitting it out and exclaiming to her husband: 'I think I just drank acid.' In fact, the tea was laced with a highly toxic industrial cleaning solution meant for degreasing deep fryers, authorities said. It contained the odorless chemical lye, the active ingredient in drain cleaners. Four days later, Harding was in critical condition Thursday at a Salt Lake City hospital's burn unit, unable to talk and fighting for her life, lawyer Paxton Guymon said. She hasn't improved since Sunday, when she and her husband went to Dickey's Barbecue Pit in South Jordan after church. Investigators and the restaurant manager have told the Hardings that a worker mistook the cleaning product for sugar and accidentally mixed large quantities of it into the iced-tea dispenser, Guymon said. 'It's disturbing that this kind of toxic, poisonous material would be in the food prep area and somehow find its way into the iced tea vat,' the attorney said. 'I don't know how something like that can happen.' Fighting for her life: Harding, left, pictured with one of her daughters, drank the tea at the restaurant following church . Loved: Her family, including her husband Jim, pictured, have been by her bedside in the hospital . South Jordan police are still investigating how the chemical ended up in the sweet-tea container, but they think it was accidental, Police Cpl. Sam Winkler said. South Jordan is a suburb of 60,000 about 15 miles south of Salt Lake City. Investigators are reviewing video footage from inside the restaurant and interviewing staff who worked that day and in the days leading up to the incident. They have determined Harding is the only victim, Winkler said. It appears she was the first to drink the tea that day, and restaurant employees dumped it out after she was burned, he said. John Thomson, owner of the Dickey's Barbecue South Jordan franchise, said in a statement Thursday that he's praying for Jan Harding and cooperating with investigators. He said he would refrain from commenting on the specifics of what happened out of respect for the Hardings. His restaurant is one of 400 Dickey's around the country in the Dallas-based chain. Guymon said he will wait for the police investigation to finish before determining what legal action to take. The chemical, also known as sodium hydroxide, comes in both liquid and powder form. The one the worker added to the tea was a powder, Guymon said. The chemical also is in products such as Drano, said Tom Richmond, professor of chemistry at the University of Utah. 'It would start dissolving your insides,' he said. Doctors are trying to determine if it caused any tears in Harding's esophagus or stomach, Guymon said. Questions: The family's attorney, Paxton Guymon, holds a photograph of Jim and Jan Harding during a news conference last week. He said the restaurant told him an employee had confused the two powders . The woman lives in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy with her husband of 47 years, Jim Harding. They have three adult children and six grandchildren. Jim Harding and the couple's children are by her side at the hospital, praying for her recovery, Guymon said. They declined to comment through the attorney, who spoke on their behalf. It's unclear if the employee who added the chemical still works at the restaurant or if anyone there faced any kind of disciplinary action. Guymon didn't know, and a Dickey's corporate spokesman didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The restaurant has remained open since the incident, said Jeff Oaks, Food Protection Bureau manager at the Salt Lake County Health Department. His office inspected the establishment Monday and found all chemicals properly labeled and separated from food items. The health department is awaiting results of the criminal investigation to determine if it should issue any violations. It's unlikely the restaurant would be fined or shut down, Oaks said. The department focuses on education and prevention over punitive measures, he said. Health officials aren't aware of anything like this ever happening in Salt Lake County before. Oaks said restaurant-goers don't need to be worried. 'I believe this to be an isolated incident,' he said.","Jan Harding is improving at Salt Lake City's University Hospital .

"A TV and video game actor was charged with killing and cooking his ex-girlfriend's pet rabbit, sending her grisly photos of the procedure and threatening to do the same thing to her, authorities said Wednesday. Dimitri Diatchenko, 46, of North Hollywood, was charged Tuesday with felony counts of cruelty to an animal with use of a knife and making criminal threats. He faces up to four years and eight months in prison if convicted. Small-part actor Dimitri Diatchenko was arrested on Sunday after allegedly killing and eating his ex-girlfriend's pet rabbit. Pictured above in May 23, 2012 at the premiere for the film Chernobyl Diaries . Pictures of a rabbit named 'Miss Bella' are posted to Diatchenko's Facebook account. It's unclear if this is the animal Diatchenko killed and ingested . According to Los Angeles County prosecutors, Diatchenko had been living with the woman for some time after their romantic relationship had ended. She told Diatchenko that they should stop being roommates, prosecutors said. On December 7, while she was out of the house, Diatchenko killed the rabbit, authorities said. 'Diatchenko skinned the pet, cooked it and ate half of it while sending her step-by-step pictures of what he did' according to a statement from the district attorney's office. 'When she returned the defendant allegedly told her he would do the same to her.' Born in San Francisco, Diatchenko is an actor and musician. He mainly has played Russians and Eastern Europeans on television. He also had a small part in the movie 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.' Diatchenko also has had many voice roles in video games, including in several 'Call of Duty' titles. His Facebook profile also shows that he appeared on the TV shows 2 Broke Girls and Bones. He posted two pictures to the social networking site of a rabbit named 'Ella'. Diatchenko was free on bail. His manager, Barry Bookin, declined comment. He is due back in court on December 30, when prosecutors are expected to request his bond be raised to $90,000. On Diatchenko's Facebook, he posted a picture posing with the cast of 2 Broke Girls, pictured second from the left between the show's stars Beth Behrs (left) and Kat Dennings (third left) Diatchenko also posted a still from the episode he appeared in, playing a Brooklyn, New York taxi cab driver .

"Two teenagers accused of feeding a live cat to two dogs, videotaping the attack and posting it online have been arrested in central California on suspicion of cruelty to an animal. The Bakersfield Californian reports that while the incident apparently occurred over the summer, Animal Control wasn't contacted until December 4 after a person reported receiving the graphic video on a social networking site. After reviewing the videotape, Animal Control staff contacted the Kern County Sheriff’s Office and requested the Sheriff’s Office investigate the incident. Brutal attack: Detectives arrested a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old last week for feeding a cat to two live dogs (not pictured), filming it, and putting it online . Sheriff's deputies said the video appeared to show two large dogs being fed a live cat while voices in the background encouraged the dogs to attack. Detectives arrested a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old last week. Both teens were booked into Juvenile Hall. Because the suspects are minors their identities have been protected and have not been made public at this time.

"A  woman has been found guilty of murdering her baby who she mistakenly believed had dwarfism and did not fit in with her 'obsession with perfection'. The six-month-old baby girl was discovered by paramedics floating face down in the bathtub of her home in Sydney's inner west, on November 18, 2010. The Sydney mother, who cannot be identified, was deemed unfit to stand trial and had faced a special hearing earlier in the Supreme Court this month. But in a marathon judgment handed down today, Justice Geoffrey Bellew found that although the mother was clearly suffering some disturbance of the mind at the time of the girl's death, he said it was not at a level that stopped her functioning. Instead, he found she had murdered the baby girl by intentionally drowning her. A Sydney woman has been found guilty of murdering her baby who she mistakenly believed had dwarfism (file picture) Describing the 39-year-old as a mother 'obsessed with perfection', the court heard she had raised concerns with doctors soon after the girl's birth about skin tags on her ears. Noticing some possible limb shortening, the pediatrician tested for achondroplasia, the medical term for dwarfism. The tests came back negative. Despite further testing and repeated assurances by doctors over the following months that the girl was healthy and 'normal', the mother became increasingly anxious that she was 'seeing the signs of a dwarf'. To friends, the mother confided she 'didn't want her perfect husband and perfect life' to be ruined by the baby and that it was likely the girl would need 'head surgery'. Two days before the murder, she told a friend she wanted to be 'rid' of her baby by jumping off a cliff with her or 'throwing her in a bin'. The court heard she raised concerns with doctors about the baby's skin but tests revealed she was healthy (file picture) Justice Bellew said those statements, in combination with a raft of other circumstantial evidence, had led him to dismiss the mother's claim her baby had fallen out of her bath seat into the water and drowned in a 'tragic accident'. He also dismissed the alternative partial defences to murder of infanticide and substantial impairment. The woman, who at times raised her arms in objection and at other points cried throughout the judgment, remained expressionless as her bail was revoked and she was taken into custody for the first time. The matter was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal and will return to court later this month to discuss what the mother's limiting term should be. A limiting term represents the maximum amount of time she could be detained.","Sydney woman has been found guilty of murdering her daughter .

"A 21-year-old student has successfully sued her estranged parents for $16,000 college tuition even though she has not spoken to them in more than a year - and they are refusing to pay. Caitlyn Ricci and her parents Maura McGarvey and Michael Ricci, who are divorced, headed back to court in Camden, New Jersey on Monday, where a judge upheld his earlier ruling that they should pay towards her education at Temple University. But while they agreed to pay $906 for her community college costs, they said they will not pay a single cent of the $16,000 until Caitlyn  tries to have a relationship with them. After they previously refused to pay, Caitlyn sued them for contempt of court. 'That's fine, they can hold me in contempt of court,' her father told ABC6 after this week's hearing. 'They can do whatever they want. I'm not going to pay. I'm not going to give them any money until my daughter has a relationship with me and we start to heal our family.' Scroll down for video . Back in court: Caitlyn Ricci, who has sued her parents for her college tuition, returned to court this week (pictured) after they failed to pay up. Her grandfather, left, paid for her to sue her parents . Hurt: Maura McGarvey and Michael Ricci, pictured left, say their daughter only wants their money . Caitlyn left home in February 2013. McGarvey told the court that her daughter left after refusing to do chores and follow a curfew, which they enforced after she repeatedly got in trouble for underage drinking. But Caitlyn said she moved partly because of a dispute about taking a summer class. McGarvey explained they had enforced the summer class as punishment for Caitlyn getting kicked out of the Disney College Program - paid for by her and her ex-husband - for underage drinking. She moved in with her paternal grandparents in Cherry Hills, New Jersey and, despite their fallout, Maura said she tried to reach out to Caitlyn - sending her letters and writing her poems - but she never heard back. The parents claim she also purchased a car when she left the family home and subsequently demanded the money through her lawyers. Refusal: The parents, who divorced when Caitlyn was a toddler, said they will not pay until she attempts to have a relationship with them. She moved out of her mother's home nearly two years ago . Fallout: Caitlyn, a student at Temple University, says she left home after a dispute about summer classes, but her mother said they argued about chores and curfews set after Caitlyn was caught drinking . They eventually tried to file for an emancipation but the day before Mothers' Day last year, papers from Caitlyn's attorneys arrived at their home. The girl's grandparents - who have not spoken to their son in years - paid for her to get a lawyer to sue her parents. She sued them for her county college tuition in Pennsylvania in August 2013, then in October, she sued them for the tuition money for Temple. A judge ruled in her favor. 'I love that child more than anything,' McGarvey, 42, said in court this week. 'But she only wants the money.' Her daughter countered: 'It's not about the money. I want to go to college.' Caitlyn's mother fell pregnant with her while she was still at college and worked full time while also attending classes to care for her. She divorced Michael Ricci in 1997 and they have both remarried and have younger children. But they have maintained a good relationship and regularly chipped in so that Caitlyn could get the best, Maura claimed in online posts. McGarvey, an English teacher, and Michael Ricci, a high school basketball coach, have agreed to pay the county college tuition by January 1 but say they can't afford her out-of-state college tuition. Happier times: Both of Caitlyn's parents have remarried and have younger children . The couple say that their daughter, whom they have not spoken with in more than a year, did not apply for eligible loans and scholarships, but the student's attorney said she is has paid some of the $26,000 bill at Temple with financial aid. The couple are raising funds for their appeal through a GoFundme account. Caitlyn Ricci's attorney told the Philadelphia Inquirer that the parents' combined household income was more than $272,000 a year. 'Caitlyn really is a good girl,' attorney Andrew Rochester said. 'She is the nicest, sweetest girl. All she wants is to go to college.' The girl's grandfather said if his son and his ex-wife do not pay up, he believes they should go to jail.

"Victim: Jackie (pictured) told Rolling Stone she was violently assaulted by seven men in a fraternity house two weeks into her first year at UVA . The Rolling Stone article about an alleged gang-rape at a University of Virginia fraternity is unraveling even more as three friends who supported the victim, identified as 'Jackie', have refuted key points of the account she detailed to the magazine. Friends Randall, Cindy and Andy (all pseudonyms) told the Washington Post that while they were featured prominently in Jackie's account of the night, they were never contacted by reporter Sabrina Rubin Erdely to give their side of the story, despite the article saying Randall turned down an interview 'citing loyalty to his own frat'. They said they believe something traumatic happened to Jackie the night they found her distraught, but are suspicious of the story she told Rolling Stone since it contradicts both what they saw and what she initially told them happened inside the Phi Kappa Psi house the night of September 28, 2012. In the explosive article, which prompted the university to shut down all Greek life until January, Jackie describes how in her first semester, she was lured to the frat by a brother named 'Drew' who she met working as a lifeguard at the university pool. She says the junior asked her out for dinner and a date function at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, and she accepted. Back at the house, Drew invited her to an upstairs bedroom, where things took a gruesome turn as she was thrown onto a glass table which shattered and then raped by seven men one after the other in what appeared to be an initiation ritual. When she later came to early Saturday morning, Jackie described fleeing the house barefoot and calling her new friends Randall, Cindy and Andy to come find her. Wrong: Jackie identified Phi Kappa Psi -known as Phi Psi for short - as the frat house where the attack took place but told the Washington Post she only did so because a friend pointed to it a year later and told her: 'That's where it happened.' Her father said she had got the detail wrong . Perhaps the most heartbreaking part of the article is how Jackie describes the trio's reaction to seeing her bleeding and in shock. Shaken by the events, she waits as the three discuss whether to report the rape to police, speaking about how it would impact their social lives, the boys' plans to pledge a fraternity and Jackie's college reputation. But in separate interviews with the Washington Post, all three refute this cold description of their behavior. Randall, Cindy and Andy say they found Jackie crying and clearly traumatized, saying her date drove her back to his fraternity, asked her to come inside and then forced her to perform oral sex on five men. Horrified by the story, the three say they urged Jackie to report the incident to police, but that she declined and asked to go back to her dorm where two of them spent the night comforting her. 'I mean obviously we were very concerned for her,' Andy told the Post. 'We tried to be as supportive as we could be.' They also added that Jackie did not appear to be injured, despite her account that she was bleeding significantly from being thrown through a glass table. Further, they also had doubts about her attacker. This past week, Jackie finally named the lifeguard who took her back to the frat to her new friends, but when a reporter gave Randall, Cindy and Andy that name, they said they had never heard of it before. University of Virginia officials also found the name suspect, saying that no one with that name has ever attended the school. The Post interviewed a man with a similar name, and he admitted to working at the pool with her, he says he never met her in person and was not a member of Phi Psi. The fraternity released a separate statement saying no Phi Psi brother was working at the aquatic center at that time and that they didn't hold an official social event on the weekend in question. At the time, Jackie's friends were under the impression that her date was a junior she met through her chemistry class that year. Jackie started talking about this mystery man when Randall rebuffed her romantic advances, wanting to stay friends. When she revealed that an older student in her chemistry class had been asking her out on dates,  the three friends say they took his number from her phone out of curiosity and started texting the stranger. The person they talked to wrote about 'this super smart hot' freshman and how they both shared of a love of the band Coheed and Cambria, according to the two-year-old messages shown to the Post. 'I really like this girl,' the guy said in one message. He also sent pictures of himself, showing he had a distinct jawline and blue eyes. But the messages also hinted at Jackie's crush on Randall, since the student wrote that she was interested in someone else and refused to date her. 'Get this she said she likes some other 1st year guy who dosnt (sp) like her and turned her down but she wont date me cause she likes him. She cant turn my down fro some nerd 1st yr. she said this kid is smart and funny and worth it,' the older student wrote. Eventually, Jackie told her friends that she succumbed and accepted a date from the older student for Friday, September 28, 2012. Adding even more mystery to the already confusing story, the Post identified the man in the text messages from his pictures, and it turns out he went to high school with Jackie in northern Virginia. However, that man, now a junior at a school in a different state, says he  'never really spoke with her', did not attend UVA, was not a member of any fraternity and hadn't been to Charlottesville in at least six years. On the specific weekend when Jackie  said she was raped, he was at an athletic event in a different state, and the pictures of him that were messaged to Jackie's friends appear to have been pulled from his social media accounts. Jackie's friends also had a hard time finding her crush on social media, adding that they never met him in person and now fear they had never been messaging with him in the first place. While they are skeptical of details of the night described in the Rolling Stone article, they all agree that something happened to leave Jackie terrified. 'She had very clearly just experienced a horrific trauma,' Randall said. 'I had never seen anybody acting like she was on that night before and I really hope I never have to again. ... If she was acting on the night of Sept. 28, 2012, then she deserves an Oscar. Both Randall and Andy say they've been interviewed by the Charlottesville Police, who were asked by the university to start an investigation into the alleged incident. Rolling Stone has issued an apology for the story, initially saying their trust in Jackie was 'misplaced'. They have stopped commenting on the article, while conducting an internal review. On Wednesday, the lawyer representing Jackie asked reporters to stop contacting her and her family. 'As I am sure you all can understand, all of this has been very stressful, overwhelming and retraumatizing for Jackie and her family,' Jackie's lawyer Palma Pustilnik said.","Friends Randall, Cindy and Andy (all pseudonyms) have spoken out .

"A powerful storm expected to pack hurricane force winds and heavy rain triggered emergency preparations across Northern California on Wednesday, with residents gathering sand bags, crews clearing storm drains and San Francisco school officials canceling classes for the first time since 9/11. As much as 8 inches of rain could fall on coastal mountains over a 24-hour period starting late Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. Ski resorts in the northern Sierra Nevada could get more than 2 feet of snow before the storm moves through Southern California and to the east with less strength through states including Nevada, Idaho, Arizona and New Mexico. Those states could get rain and snow, but nothing like what California is expected to experience, forecasters say. 'It's a short amount of time for that amount of water,' weather service forecaster Diana Henderson said. 'We are anticipating some localized flooding, maybe some downed trees and downed power lines. It could have an effect on a wide range of people.' The storm is expected to be one of the windiest and rainiest in five years and could also cause debris slides, especially in areas affected by this year's intense and widespread wildfires. Big waves are expected along the coast. Getting ready: Jerry Croissant places sandbags to protect his home from mudslides outside his home in Gelndra, California, below mountains burned over in wildfires . Prepared: Kathryn Olson rests on a sandbag before carrying it to her vehicle to be used at her North Highlands home.  Sandbags and sand were provided in flood- prone areas of Sacramento County for residents to use . Supplies: Cat Kaufman brings over a sand bag to protect her Santa Rosa Business. Northern California residents are bracing for a powerful storm that could be the biggest in five years . 'Pineapple express': An atmospheric river of moisture was expected on Wednesday to bring a massive storm capable of dumping the most rain seen since 2005 on some areas of Northern California . Lashing: The storm was expected to start lashing western Washington on down to the San Francisco Bay on Wednesday . Good and bad: Flash flood warnings were issued by the state of California, but heavy snowfall was expected to benefit the state as forecasters said it would fall in areas hit hard by three years of drought . Dramatic: Aidan Stephenson and Conor Stephenson, visiting from Phoenix, watch the waves break on Ocean View Blvd in Pacific Grove, California, on Wednesday . Public schools in San Francisco and Oakland and some private schools in the Bay Area planned to stay closed Thursday. San Francisco Unified School District Superintendent Richard A. Carranza said he didn't want to put students at risk, and staff absences and power outages could affect the district's ability to supervise and feed students. Storm drains in the Bay Area were vacuumed by crews in anticipation of the storm, KTVU reported. California Department of Transportation spokesman Bob Haus told the affiliate station 'This is not the most glamorous work that there is, even with equipment like this. This is still really hard work. Hard and dirty work but something that has to be done to make sure the system functions properly when we do have a big storm.' Wind gusts of up to 70 mph were expected on mountain tops, creating possible blizzard conditions in the Sierra. Rain, pounding surf and gusty winds were forecast for Southern California starting Thursday evening. The National Weather Service  issued a high-surf advisory from the Central Coast to Ventura County, saying 'waves will over-top jetties and sea walls at times' and 'will potentially wash into low-lying beach areas or parking lots.' According to Accuweather.com, Sacramento could see as much as six inches of rainfall in just a couple of days--the most in that period of time since 2005. In California's agricultural heartland, farmers were looking forward to the dousing after three consecutive dry years. Parts of the state have experienced above-average rainfall this year, but not enough to make much of a dent in the drought. James McFarlane, a third-generation farmer in Fresno County, said workers would have to stop picking citrus crops during the storm, but rain this time of year makes fruit bigger, allowing it to fetch higher prices.

The so-called 'Pineapple Epxress' is an atmospheric river of moisture that often brings major weather events to North America's Pacific Coast. The system is named for its origins in Hawaii, around where it gets its massive moisture content. Via NOAA.gov: . Atmospheric Rivers (AR) are relatively narrow regions in the atmosphere that are responsible for most of the horizontal transport of water vapor outside of the tropics. While ARs come in many shapes and sizes, those that contain the largest amounts of water vapor, the strongest winds, and stall over watersheds vulnerable to flooding, can create extreme rainfall and floods. These events can disrupt travel, induce mud slides, and cause catastrophic damage to life and property. However, not all ARs cause damage – most are weak, and simply provide beneficial rain or snow that is crucial to water supply. An average of between 30 to 50 percent of the total precipitation for the year on the West Coast comes from ARs. The biggest events among them can transport in the form of water vapor between 7.5 and 15 times the average flow of liquid water at the mouth of the mighty Mississippi. How a typical Pineapple Express 'atmospheric river' event works . 'If we're not getting some Mother-Nature-dictated time off out in the field, that probably means we're going to have a hard time finding surface water in the warmer months,' he said. The rain and the snow in the Sierra Nevada fills reservoirs that supply irrigation water during hot, dry months. In San Francisco, where as much as 4 inches of rain was forecast, crews cleared storm drains and removed loose rocks from a hillside to prevent them from crashing down. Residents were advised to sweep up leaves and debris in front of their properties to prevent them from clogging drains. 'We have crews working starting tonight in 12-hour shifts,' said Rachel Gordon, a spokeswoman for San Francisco's public works agency. 'It will be all hands on deck.' Mark Ghilarducci, the director of the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, issued a warning that the storm will present a risk of flash flooding and debris slides. 'This year was also a significant fire season for Northern and Southern California and burned areas are especially at risk for debris slides. Even regions that don't experience regular seasonal flooding could see flash flooding during this intense storm system, which could be the largest to date of this year's rainy season,' he said in a statement. Authorities are warning motorists to avoid driving through standing water; stay clear of outside roadway lanes, especially at night; keep headlights on at all times; and drive slowly to prevent hydroplaning. People should also have emergency contacts available and a stock a small emergency kit that can sustain each person for three days. Farther north, a series of strong weather fronts with high winds and heavy rains could lead to flooding and landslides this week in western Washington state. The weather service expects as much as 14 inches of rain between Monday and Thursday in the Olympic Mountains west of Seattle. Saturated soils will bring the risk of mudslides, while winds could topple trees. High winds were also forecast in Oregon. Waves are seen in Oregon's Depoe Bay on Wednesday. High winds are forecast for the state . Flooding is expected in Northern California as a result of the powerful storm, the National Weather Service has said .

"A Port Authority police recruit is claiming she was repeatedly sexually harassed and humiliated by her academy instructors who called her too pretty for the job and likened her to an 'American Girl doll'. According to her federal lawsuit, Amanda Holley, 29, alleges that Sgt. Erick Torres told her she would die as an officer and made the lurid suggestion she would make a good looking body in her coffin. 'Holley, when you are killed in the line of duty, I'll make sure you look pretty for your family,' PA Sgt. Erick Torres allegedly told trainee Amanda Holley, 29, her suit claims. Discrimination claims: Amanda Holley (pictured here with her boyfriend Anthony Gabriel) claims she experienced severe harassment while training to be a cop with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey . 'I do a lot of funerals for fallen cops, and I normally never look at their face, but for you, I'll make sure you look pretty.' Holley, who lives in Jackson Township, alleges that she was picked out for unfair treatment the minute she arrived at the Jersey City academy in August 2013. According to the New York Post, she was sexually harassed from day one until the day she was fired, four months later. The trainee, who graduated with a masters degree in May, 2012, says that she was made to do squat thrusts on her own in front of the entire platoon and was subject to name-calling by Torres. Qualifications: In May, 2012, Amanda collected her Masters degree with a 3.987 GPA (left) but was hounded out of the academy she claims by sexist instructors . Holley says that Torres would sing 'She is an American Girl doll' and 'One time, Sgt. Torres told (the) plaintiff that he took his two daughters to the American Girl Doll store and swore that he saw the plaintiff there.' On the day she was fired, Torres called her out of class claims Holley for a meeting with supervisors. 'While waiting outside the chief's office, plaintiff reached into her duffle bag to grab a memo book,' the lawsuit says. 'Sgt. Torres then put his hand on his gun and asked what plaintiff was reaching for, implying that she was reaching for her weapon. According to the New York Post, Torres also called Holley, Angelina Jolie after her lips swelled because of a pepper-spray test and added she was sprayed more times than other recruits.

'To be ridiculed and feel ashamed of the way I looked was the hardest part. I was just embarrassed and humiliated.' Holley blames the harassment for her failure to graduate in December 2013, and says she never received the same tuition and time as the other female trainees. Indeed, prior to attempting to join the police, Holley worked as a social worker at the New Jersey Department of Corrections - a fact she claims was used against her. 'Sgt. Torres made it appear that plaintiff did not have the gumption to do law-enforcement work and should have stuck with social work solely because she was a young female,' her lawsuit claims. Holley also added she was disappointed she was fired because of her long family history within the NEw Jersery police.

"Russian Tennis Federation president Shamil Tarpischev has been forced to publicly apologise for his slur against the Williams sisters, Serena and Venus. The International Tennis Federation came under fire from Martina Navratilova on Monday for failing to act after Tarpischev described the Williams' as 'brothers'. The Womens' Tennis Association responded swiftly to Tarpischev's remarks by banning him for a year and issuing a fine of 25,000 US dollars (£15,500).

Tarpischev faced a backlash after making the offensive remarks about Serena (left) and Venus (right) Tennis legend Martina Navratilova believes Tarpischev's comments were a form of bullying . Navratilova, however, claimed the ITF's silence on the matter was 'pretty deafening'. The 59-times Grand Slam champion added: 'Certainly this kind of bullying comment cannot be tolerated from anyone, but particularly from a high-up official in the tennis world.' ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti, however, has now responded and made it clear to Tarpischev such comments will not be tolerated. Ricci Bitti believes Tarpischev's apology and the WTA's actions are a sufficient punishment. Bitti said: 'The ITF was very disappointed when it learned that Shamil Tarpischev, long-time President of the Russian Tennis Federation, made derogatory remarks about the gender of Serena and Venus Williams. 'What Mr Tarpischev said was wholly unacceptable to the ITF and, when we learned of the issue, we encouraged him to apologise immediately.

Witness Matty Thomas, speaking to the NY Daily News, said: 'There were four bodies in the air. There was a lady who got hit as [the car] went through the glass window. 'Her body was in the display case and her legs were under the car. She was bleeding all from the side of her head. They had to saw her out of the car.

"Police have found a woman's body in the trunk of a car belonging to a couple and their four young children who went missing in Southern California. The Honda Accord belonging to Daniel and Erica Perez and their sons, aged from six to 11, was found near a hospital about half a mile from their home in Montebello, police said. Capt Luis Lopez would say only that a dead woman was found in the trunk, but would not provide her identity or cause of death, deferring those and other details to the coroner's office. A woman's body has found in the trunk of a car belonging Erica Perez (left) and her husband Daniel  (right) who went missing with their four children last Friday from their home in Montebello, Southern California . Lopez called the discovery 'alarming', adding: 'We are concerned for their safety'. He said: 'At this point, Mr Perez is considered a person of interest, so if he’s seen or the children are seen we urged everybody to call the police department.' The family had not been seen since Friday and neither adult had been answering their phone. Lopez said an Amber Alert is now being issued for a 2014 black Toyota Camry with California license plate 7FDS891 connected to the family.

"Fans of Apple's discontinued iPod are forking out four times the original retail price in order to have a chance own one before they disappear for good. Just three months after Apple discontinued the iPod classic in favor of more advanced models, demand for the music player with the traditional click wheel has risen, causing prices to soar. Some are listed for nearly $1,000 -  in 2008, the product retailed for just $249. The latest versions of the classic with a maximum storage of 160GB - more than any other portable music player - are currently selling on eBay for up to 1,000 as music fans and tech geeks clamor to get hold of the last of the 6th generation models before they're all gone. Scroll down for video... Old model! Prices of the iPod Classic have soared to more than $1,000 on eBay for some models in recent months as they become the 'must have' present for Christmas, after Apple discontinued them in October . It was once considered bulky and too primitive to compete with slim touch screen music players and smartphones that could play videos at the same time but in a case of pure nostalgia the older model is experiencing a resurgence. Apple discontinued the iPod classic in October following a slow but steady drop in sales as people began to favor the iPod touch and using their phones and cloud devices to store music. But the large capacity of the Classic, which allows people to store thousands of songs without having to sign up to a website and pay a subscription fee, has made it the must-have present this Christmas. Music experts began advising experts to get hold of an iPod Classic as early as last year, before they were discontinued and demand, and prices began to increase. And its value is likely to continue to rise after Tim Cook, chief executive of Apple, said it was unlikely the model would be revisited because they lacked access to the components and a redesign would be too expensive, the Observer reported. Early last year Will Dunn, editor of Stuff magazine, advised people to buy a version of the Classic, predicting prices would double. He said: 'There's still a huge affection for the iPod Classic and it's not hard to see why - Spotify might offer 20 million songs, but 120GB of music is more than most people need, and your iTunes library doesn't carry data charges or a subscription fee.' Twisted logic: Customers are paying up to $1,000 for 6th generation iPods and around $480 for 7th generation, with 160GB storage . eBay has been selling versions of the iPod Classic 6th generation, with 160 GB storage for between $180 and $1000. The latest, 7th generation version, is currently listed on the site with a $480 price tag. The iPod Classic was first launched in 2002, with storage increasing to 160GB with the sixth and generations produced from 2007. It began to be replaced by slimmer more advanced models, such as the nano, first launched in 2005 and the iPod touch in 2007 as the popularity of the touch screen began. The iPod Touch is now the only model being produced with the most capacity, but at 80GB this is still only half of the Classic version. 2001 - The first iPod, capable of holding 1,000 songs was created and later became known as the first generation iPod Classic. 2002 - The second generation was unveiled and made available for Windows, rather than just Apple, users for the first time. The iPod shuffle was launched in 2005, giving people the chance to store songs on a much smaller device . 2003 - The iTunes music store was released along with a slimmer third generation iPod, capable of selling 7,500 songs. In its first week iTunes sold 1million songs. 2003 - The millionth iPod is sold. 2004 - iPod mini is launched and iTunes is made available in the UK. Sales of iPods tops 10 million as the iPod Classic fourth generation goes on sale. The iPod nano replaced the iPod mini in 2005 . 2005 - Apple launched the smaller iPod shuffle and the iPod nano replaced the iPod mini. A fifth generation iPod is released that plays TV shows and music videos. Around 42 million iPods are sold throughout the year . 2006 - Sales throughout the year reach 88 million. 2007 - The iPod touch, which eventually causes the demise of the iPod Classic was launched, along with the iPhone. Sales of iPods reached 141 million throughout the year and the iPod Classic reaches its sixth generation version, with 160GB of storage. 2008 - Almost 200 million iPods sold. 2009 - Films can be bought and rented in high definition on the iTunes store and around 250 million iPods are sold throughout the year . 2010 - iTunes achieves a new record with 10 billion songs sold. A new version of the iPod touch becomes available and the seventh generation of the iPod Classic is produced. 2014 - Apple removes all iPod Classics from its website in October and discontinues production. Three months later demand for the models causes prices to increase to $1000.","Apple discontinued all versions of the iPod Classic in October this year .

"The menopause could be eliminated within 20 years and the process of ageing could be halted or even reversed, a scientist has predicted. Pioneering stem cell scientist Aubrey de Grey said that rapid progress in stem cell and regenerative therapies meant that current age limits on when women can conceive and give birth were likely to vanish. He said there was no reason why anti-ageing treatments should not extend to the female reproductive life-span because the ovaries were ‘just another organ’. Scroll down for video . Pioneering stem cell scientist Aubrey De Grey says the menopause may be eliminated in 20 years . Estimating the timescale for when the menopause may be eliminated, Dr de Grey told The Times: ‘We can definitely think in terms of 20 years from now. ‘We could rejuvenate the ovary by stimulating or replenishing stem cells, we could create a whole new ovary through tissue engineering like an artificial heart, there are all manner of possibilities.’ Dr de Grey, a theoretician in the field of gerontology, is co-founder of the Sens Research Foundation, which funds research aimed at developing treatments on reversing ageing. While regarded by some as a maverick, his research has attracted significant financial backing, including some from Peter Thiel, the Facebook investor. Fertility experts agreed that significant progress had been made towards overcoming some forms of female infertility that were previously completely untreatable. Older mothers: Halle Berry (left) gave birth at 47 and Uma Thurman (right) had a child at 42 . Evelyn Telfer, a reproductive biologist at the University of Edinburgh, told The Times that treatments were on the horizon for early menopause. She said: ‘The dogma has been that a woman has a fixed number of eggs, that they’re formed before birth and there’s no more once they run out.’ Work by Professor Telfer’s group also suggests that primordial follicles - immature female egg cells - taken from the ovaries so young girls undergoing cancer treatments can be successfully matured in culture outside of their body - raising the prospect that their fertility could be preserved. There is emerging evidence that the ovary retains an untapped reservoir of immature follicles beyond the menopause that could potentially be exploited in the future to extend the limits of female fertility. Fertility experts agreed that much progress has been made in overcoming previously untreatable infertility . There is even some evidence that the ovaries contain even more primitive egg stem cells - raising the possibility of a limitless supply of eggs. But this finding remains controversial and contested within the field. Professor Telfer added: ‘It depends what you mean by eliminate the menopause. ‘It would be naive of anyone to think that you might get these cells and just put them in an ovary and expect them to grow. There’s a long way to go and you hesitate to say things that could create false hope.’ Dr de Grey has previously claimed that there is no reason why human being should not live to be 1,000 years old. Speaking ahead of his talk at the ReWork technology summit in London this week, Dr de Grey conceded that there was scepticism about his ideas, but remained confident that science would overcome ageing eventually. He said: ‘The industrial revolution changed a lot too, but not many people think it was a bad idea.’","Scientist Aubrey de Grey says stem cell therapies will eliminate process .

"Oscar-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin claimed that he had no idea who Michael Fassbender was according to the latest tranche of embarrassing emails leaked as part of the Sony cyber-hacking scandal. The emails reveal, however, that others at Sony were aware of the actor - or at least the size of his manhood - with producer Michael De Luca allegedly claiming in one email that the star, 'makes you feel bad to have normal sized male genitalia.' The actor gained notoriety after playing Brandon Sullivan in 2011’s sexual exploration movie Shame and appearing in a full-frontal nude scene that revealed an impressive appendage. The latest leaks concern Sony’s failed attempts to make a movie about the life of Apple co-funder Steve Jobs, which Sorkin was adapting from Walter Isaacson’s biography. The emails reveal Sorkin’s attempt to lobby for Tom Cruise to take the lead role and reveal his initial disdain when informed that Fassbender, Oscar-nominated for 12 Years A Slave, was favored for the role. Scroll down for video . Academy Award-winning screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and actor Michael Fassbender are the latest Hollywood stars to be embarrassed by information leaked after a massive cyber attack at Sony Pictures . ‘I don't know who Michael Fassbender is and the rest of the world isn't going to care,’ was his sniffy reply to Columbia Pictures Chairman Amy Pascal and movie producer Scott Rudin. It was Rudin who called Angelina Jolie a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' in another email, while the latest leak of documents by the group calling themselves ‘the Guardians of Peace,’ are from Pascal’s email box. Her exchanges with Rudin and Sorkin reveal that an extensive list of Hollywood big hitters had been considered for the Jobs role. After Leonardo Di Caprio turned it down, Christian Bale was mentioned, but email exchanges show Sorkin only had eyes for Cruise. When Pascal sent Sorkin a message to say that director Danny Boyle ‘seems committed to’ Fassbender, he wasn't best pleased. 'This used to be an event. I don't know who Michael Fassbender is and the rest of the world isn't going to care. This is insane,' he wrote. Sony producer Michael De Luca allegedly claimed in one email that the star (pictured), 'makes you feel bad to have normal sized male genitalia' Screen character: Fassbender gained notoriety after playing Brandon Sullivan in 2011’s sexual exploration movie Shame and appearing in a full-frontal nude scene that revealed an impressive appendage . Letting loose: In one email, Rudin (left) writes to Sony Pictures co-chairperson Amy Pascal (right) that Jolie is a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' Jolie felt the ire of several Sony execs over her desire to star in a remake of Cleopatra . However Sorkin eventually came round to the idea of Fassbender and wrote, 'F*** it. He's a great actor whose time has come.' 'That’s where I ended up,' Pascal replied. 'Yeah, if the movie’s good, he’ll be on the cover of everything and get nominated for everything,' Sorkin conceded. Sony producer Michael De Luca chimed in with one email adding that the star, 'makes you feel bad to have normal sized male genitalia'. Fassbender has previously admitted his naked appearance in Shame prompted many of his Hollywood friends– such as George Clooney, Sarah Silverman and Charlize Theron - to joke about his appendage. In an interview with the UK issue of ELLE magazine, he once said: ‘I can’t start saying, ‘Wait a second there is more about the film than my d**k; it’s one scene and it doesn’t go on for very long’.’ Not long after the email exchanges, Sony's attempt to make the Jobs movie collapsed and the script was picked up by rivals Universal. The leaking of sensitive  internal emails continues to be a source of embarrassment for Sony, which has announced that it isn’t taking any chances with the red-carpet premiere of The Interview on Thursday. The comedy, slated for U.S. release on December 25, stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as a producer and television host tasked with assassinating North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The film has caused great anger in North Korea and there is much speculation that the country is behind the massive cyber attack at Sony and now the studio has announced that the movie's stars won’t be available to interview. Sony Pictures said on Wednesday that no broadcast media will be invited to cover the film's gala opening in Los Angeles and no interviews will be granted to print reporters at the screening. A Sony spokeswoman refused to comment on the reason for the premiere's coverage restrictions. The studio is also adding extra security for Thursday’s event. 'Security is always a concern at premieres, and this is certainly no different,' a Sony official told Deadline. 'We will have appropriate security at the premiere.' According to the LAPD, four off-duty officers have been added to the security team for the premiere at the Ace Hotel’s palatial theater in downtown Los Angeles. The Interview: The Franco/Rogen comedy has caused great anger in North Korea and now Sony has added extra security for Thursday's red-carpet premiere in Los Angeles . The studio also cancelled a Los Angeles press day that had been planned for this week and said a press day in New York next week may not take place. The cyber attack launched on Nov. 24 shut down Sony's computer network and exposed company secrets. Among them were e-mails that revealed Sony Corp Chief Executive Kazuo Hirai ordered The Interview be toned down after North Korea complained. The e-mail exchanges concerning Jolie claim she was displeased to learn that David Fincher was going to be directing the Jobs biopic rather than her re-make of Cleopatra. Rudin referred to Jolie as 'a minimally talented spoiled brat' before viciously slamming her in multiple e-mails. '[Jolie] is upset about us giving david jobs she wants to talk,' Pascal, 56, told Rudin in a leaked e-mail dated February 27. Over a series of email, Rudin, left, and Pascal, right, slam Angelina Jolie and her desire to have David Fincher direct her remake of Cleopatra . But he apparently had no interest in discussing the matter with the Maleficent star, saying, 'She’ll survive it. I don’t want to waste my time on this.' Later that day, he appears to have sent another e-mail to Pascal, which read, ‘YOU BETTER SHUT ANGIE DOWN BEFORE SHE MAKES IT VERY HARD FOR DAVID TO DO JOBS.’ She appears to respond with, 'Do not f**king threaten me.' Rudin then proceeds to criticize Jolie with a number of cutting remarks and slams the idea of the movie altogether. 'There is no movie of Cleopatra to be made (and how that is a bad thing and rampaging spoiled ego of this woman and the cost of the movie is beyond me) and if you won’t tell her that you do not like the script — which, let me remind you, SHE DOESN’T EITHER — this will just spin even further out in Crazyland but let me tell you I have zero appetite for the indulgence of spoiled brats and I will tell her this myself if you don’t.'","Aaron Sorkin claimed he had no idea who Michael Fassbender was .

"A San Francisco television station has been forced to make a humiliating apology after an on-air gaffe resulted in a live racist joke about the fatal Asiana plane crash. During the midday broadcast on Friday, presenter Tori Campbell, announced that her news station, KTVU, had just learned the names of the four pilots who were on board Asiana flight 214 when it crashed at San Francisco International Airport on Saturday. She then proceeded to read out four fake names from a teleprompter whilst keeping a straight face. Scroll down for video... In poor taste: KTVU News read these names live on television today stating that the National Transportation Safety Board had confirmed that these were the pilots of Asiana 214 . The names poked fun at the crash and have been further criticized for their racist undertones. It is not yet clear where the names originated but the broadcaster did confirm them with the National Transportation Safety Board before airing them. The safety board said a summer intern told KTVU the names were correct. The video of the cringe-worthy mistake has gone viral and drawn heavy criticism on the Internet. The first name — 'Captain Sum Ting Wong' might have been a giveaway that something was not quite right. However, . with the camera's rolling and in the middle of a live broadcast, Ms. Campbell continued to read without so much as flinching: 'Wi Tu Lo, Ho Lee Fuk, Bang Ding Ow.' After . an ad break, the station was quick to correct the gaffe clarifying that . the names were clearly wrong and blaming the National Transportation . Safety Board for the incorrect information. In a statement the NTSB admitted a summer intern had 'erroneously' confirmed the names of the flight crew and was 'acting outside the scope of his authority' in doing so. 'The National Transportation Safety Board apologizes for inaccurate and offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of Asiana flight 214, which crashed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6,' the NTSB said in a statement. 'Earlier today, in response to an inquiry from a media outlet, a summer intern acted outside the scope of his authority when he erroneously confirmed the names of the flight crew on the aircraft,' it added. Days earlier, KTVU news director Lee Rosenthal was crowing about how good his news operation had performed. 'Being . first on air and on every platform in all aspects of our coverage was a . great accomplishment, but being 100% accurate, effectively using our . great sources and social media without putting a single piece of . erroneous information on our air, is what we are most proud of as a . newsroom.' The station issued a statement on Friday afternoon acknowledging it had 'misidentified the pilots involved.' Third victim: A San Francisco hospital says a third victim of a plane crash, a Chinese girl, has died from her injuries. She was among about a dozen injured still in hospital after Asiana flight 214 crashed as it approached the airport too low last week . In an-online apology, KTVU general . manager Tom Raponi wrote: 'We sincerely regret the error and took . immediate action to apologize, both in the newscast where the mistake . occurred, as well as on our website and social media sites. Nothing is . more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and . integrity, and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of . error does not happen again.' Two . teenage girls from China and another unidentified passenger were killed and more . than 180 people injured when the Boeing 777 clipped a sea wall and . slammed into a runway Saturday at San Francisco International Airport. Based in Oakland, California, the Fox affiliate represents a city where 16.8% of the population is Asian. KTVU . also broadcasts in two heavily Asian-populated communities: San . Francisco, where Asians make up 33.3% of the total population and San . Jose, where 32% of the population is Asian. KTVU’s . false report comes after a week of speculating whether last week's . disastrous Asiana Airlines crash could be attributed to Korean 'culture' and whether South Korea’s tradition of deference to hierarchy could . have played a role in the crash. Broken news: Anchor Tori Campbell read the names off the teleprompter and didn't bat an eye, adding that the information had been confirmed by the National Transportation Safety Board . Asiana Airlines has identified two of the four flying crew on board as the pilot and copilot Lee Kang-kook and Lee Jung-min. Coverage of the tragic plane crash at San Francisco International Airport, which killed three people and injured dozens of others last Saturday has proven tricky for some news outlets. Earlier this week, the Chicago Sun-Times apologized for its front page headline 'FRIGHT 214,' which was criticized for sounding like a stereotype of an Asian accent.","Station broadcast inaccurate names but apologized for the error a few minutes later .

"Shocking images depicting U.S. soldiers burning the bodies of what appear to be Iraqi insurgents, have emerged today.

In 2005 report, U.S. soldiers in Gumbad, Afghanistan were investigated for burning the bodies of two enemy fighters. The men argued they set alight the corpses for hygienic reasons, after local citizens had not retrieved the bodies after 24 hours. A report concluded that the action indicated poor judgement but was not a war crime. It stated: 'Based on the criminal investigation, there was no evidence to substantiate the allegation of desecration or any violation of the Law of War. However, there was evidence of poor decision-making and judgment, poor reporting and lack of knowledge and respect for local Afghan customs and tradition.'","The explosive photographs, reportedly taken in Fallujah in 2004, have sparked a Marine Corps investigation .

"Manchester City keeper Joe Hart has hailed his side's resolve for never giving up on securing their progress to the knockout stages of the Champions League. The Premier League champions left it until the last group match, a 2-0 victory over Roma thanks to goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta, to reach the last 16 and avoid another humiliating early exit.

'We've got resolve, we've got character and we've got fantastic players - add that all together and we've got a chance. 'It's been a great performance, we are moving in the right direction. That's five or six games on the spin now that we've really stepped it up. 'We've been together for a long time and there's no international breaks about to disrupt what we're trying to do. We are going into December - Vinny's (Kompany) is going to be fit, the Wizard (Silva) is back - we are starting to get our players back and the squad is strong.' The Manchester City squad surround Samir Nasri after his fine strike opened the scoring in Rome . Hart signals to the travelling Manchester City fans after their side beat Roma 2-0 on Wednesday evening . Meanwhile scorer Samir Nasri echoed Hart's sentiments: 'Because Yaya wasn't there and Kun (Aguero) wasn’t there it was important for us to show that we are a team and we did that tonight. 'The manager told us to take our time. We won our last game against Bayern Munich in the last minute. We knew that we had to be patient and we did it and we scored and we won the game.' Nasri was evidently relieved to fire in his spectacular long-range opener for Manuel Pellegrini's side. 'It was important for me to score. After surgery it took a while for me to come back to my full level and now I am. 'My strike was important but at 1-0 the save the Joe made was amazing - and afterwards as well to hold on was good.' Midfielder Nasri scored an absolute screamer from outside the box to put Manchester City ahead in Rome .

"From his first audition to securing his place in the X Factor finals, Andrea Faustini has belted his way into the nation's heart. However, the 20-year-old Italian still can’t believe his luck. ‘I keep thinking back to April when I left Italy and it feels mind blowing to be here,’ he tells FEMAIL in an exclusive interview. ‘When I think I was in a queue and there were thousands of other people – and now I’m one of the last three in the final and I’m singing at Wembley Arena. It’s incredible. It was just so unexpected.’ Scroll down for video . Andrea with finalists Ben Haenow (centre), Fleur East (right) after making it through the sing-off on Sunday . Andrea leaving the semi-final live show on Saturday (left) and on stage awaiting his fate with Mel B on Sunday night's result show (left) Since arriving on British shores, Andrea's life has been in an X Factor whirlwind. ‘I’ve experienced a lot of strange things – it’s been the most crazy time,’ he says. ‘I’ve been flown to Mexico - and learnt to cook and use the washing machine for the first time!’ he says, admitting usually it’s his ‘mama’ who usually tackles these housekeeping matters for him. ‘Seriously, I’m the same guy who left Italy but at the same time I’ve grown so much – apart from the washing machine. I’ve learnt to face things alone and look after myself. No matter what happens, this will really help me in my life, not just in my career.' One thing that's clear is that Mel B’s involvement in mentoring her little 'Italian teddy bear' hasn’t just been for the X Factor audience. ‘She’s not just been a judge – she’s been a friend,’ Andrea says. ‘She’s done everything to make me feel at home. I’m so glad I’ve had the chance to work with her. She works with so much passion and devotion. Ready for the final: X Factor's Andrea Faustini was seen drumming up support in London on Tuesday . Andrea Faustini belted his way to a place in the X Factor finals with show-stopping performances . ‘The way she behaves makes me realise how you have to be in your life. The most amazing thing I realise from watching Mel is that even though she’s a star, the most important thing is her family. ‘She’s so humble and such a lovely person with everyone. Even if you are successful you have to be humble and work hard and be nice to everyone.’ At the ripe old age of 20, Andrea has never had a serious girlfriend but is philosophical about finding love. ‘What will be, will be,’ he says. ‘I just want someone who makes me laugh, someone who takes things easy and doesn’t stress.' Even though he hasn’t had much experience in the love stakes, he’s certainly managed to do one thing most men can only fantasise about – bringing Cheryl Fernandez-Versini to tears. Andrea showing his quirky style in yellow trainers (left) and in a tuxedo and trainers (right) How did that feel? ‘I was very happy,’ he says. ‘When you see someone crying for you when you are singing – it’s so beautiful – you did something good and touched their heart. I don’t just want to be a singer with a good voice I want to give emotion.’ Despite rumours that the X Factor men were told to watch their figures, Andrea says his new obsession is Terry’s chocolate orange. ‘I’m not on a diet and I don’t want to be on a diet. We all try and stay healthy in the house because we have such a busy schedule – but sometimes I just need some chocolate. ‘But chocolate is healthy – because it makes you smile – and that’s healthy! Right?' Spice up your life: Things then took a fun turn as the Italian was joined the ‘Spice Girls’ in Central London . During the first two live shows, it seemed Andrea could do no wrong but the tides turned when Simon started dishing out the criticism. But, Andrea says, ‘I’ve always appreciated the fact that he’s been fair. ‘Being honest he  made me realise the things I’ve had to change. And in the last two weeks I’ve received amazing comments from him.’ But it’s no longer Simon whom Andrea has to please. His fate now lies in the hands of the X Factor audience, whose votes alone will decide the winner of the live final this Saturday. Before he gets ready to board his tour bus to continue his campaign to conquer the UK, Andrea is keen to say one final thing. ‘I love the fact that this country has made me feel so welcome and loved. Thank you,’ he says speaking as passionately as he sings. ‘Being in the final three is such an amazing experience. No matter what happens next, I just want to enjoy it – and sing my heart out.’ To watch Andrea sing his heart out and help decide his fate switch on to ITV on Saturday at 8.30pm for the X Factor final .","Andrea, 20, belted his way to a place in the X Factor finals .

"CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's full match report from Rome . Manchester City should consider dropping Yaya Toure and continue using Fernando and Fernandinho as their midfield 'template' for playing in Europe, according to Gary Neville. The Premier League champions progressed to the last 16 of the Champions League with an organised and disciplined 2-0 defeat of Roma at the Stadio Olimpico - with Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta netting the decisive goals. As Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher noted 'it wasn't pretty', but it was effective and fellow Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville believes that fielding a more defensive-minded partnership in midfield should be how Manuel Pellegrini sets his side up in the future. Fernandinho (front) and Fernando (back) gave Manchester City stability in their 2-0 defeat of Roma . Fernando helped provide a shield in front of defence to give City their first European clean sheet this season . Fernandinho congratulates Samir Nasri (right) after the Frenchman opened the scoring . Suspended midfielder Yaya Toure can leave the midfield exposed, says Sky pundit Gary Neville . CLICK HERE to read the Player Ratings for both teams . 'The two central midfield players (Fernando and Fernandinho) played as a pair. 'When Yaya Toure plays he's a game changer and a goal scorer, but his defensive play can be easily played around - we've seen that in the Premier League and in European games. 'Tonight for the first time we've seen City play as a pair in midfield. In terms of moving forward that might be a template of how to play in Europe - it's a question for Manuel Pellegrini.' 'If City play their best Premier League team - that's Aguero and Dzeko up front, Silva and Nasri out wide, and Toure as part of the midfield - you cannot play that way in Europe because Nasri and Silva do not play defensively. 'What Milner and Navas have given them tonight in wide positions is legs to attach themselves to the two in midfield (Fernandinho and Fernando). Fernando (above) and Fernandinho's (below) heat maps show how the pair kept their positions in central midfield to protect City's defence - CLICK HERE for more stats from our Match Zone . David Silva is a creative 'wizard' but does not offer the midfield much protection without the ball . 'If you lose the battle in central midfield you will struggle - this is the template city need to use going forward. 'If you play your best players, you don't necessarily play your best team. This should be the template for them moving forward. 'You don't necessarily leave them all out, but you cant fit them all in. If you go away to Barcelona you cant play with Silva, Nasri, Dzeko, Aguero and Toure in the same side.' Carragher also praised the stability brought to the side by playing the two Brazilians in midfield together. 'It was an excellent European performance and it comes on the back of a lot of big players missing,' he said. 'Fernando and Fernandinho, those two did a proper job shielding the defence and that is part of the reason City got their first clean sheet from the group stages.' Manuel Pellegrini should consider playing more cautiously in Europe, especially against the leading teams . City stars celebrate after securing their passage into the last 16 of the Champions League . Former Liverpool midfielder Graeme Souness agreed that City need to approach European games with more caution. 'It was a really solid euro performance and there's no magic to it. City have been a wee bit too adventurous in the past. Show teams more respect in the early part of games - if it pans out the way you want then leave it, if it doesn't then make changes,' he said. 'Most football people would have seen that and thought that's the way they should have gone in big European games. 'If you field your most attacking side from the first minute then you hand the initiative to the opposition, especially if you go behind,' he added.","Manchester City defeated Roma 2-0 to progress to the knockout stages of the Champions League .

"Australian and Indian players were both visibly shaken after the visitors' captain Virat Kohli was hit on the helmet by the very first ball he faced from Australian paceman Mitchell Johnson in the first Test at the Adelaide Oval. Johnson reacted immediately to check on the Indian skipper's welfare, as did several Australian players including captain Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin, Steve Smith and David Warner. But Kohli was thankfully not hurt by the 90mph bouncer and later went on to score a century on day three. VIDEO Scroll down to watch India's Virat Kohli hit in the head during Australia test match . Indian captain Virat Kohli is hit on the helmet by Australian paceman Mitchell Johnson in the first Test . Johnson reacted immediately to check on the Indian skipper's welfare, as did several Australian players including captain Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin, Steve Smith and David Warner . The Australian and Indian teams shaken up after a short ball from Johnson hits Kohli on the helmet . Johnson seemed to be affected by the incident but Clarke offered encouragement on way back to his mark . The back page of Australia's Daily Telegraph . Johnson seemed to be affected by the incident as he walked back to the mark but his skipper, after first checking with his opposite number, quickly ran to his fast bowler's side and offered words of encouragement. The Test match has been dedicated to late batsman Phillip Hughes, Australia's 13th man, who died two weeks ago today after being struck in the neck by a bouncer. Kohli's impressive 184-ball innings of 115 on day three propelled the tourists to 369 for five at stumps after Australia declared on 517 for seven before the start of play. With the sun shining once more after Wednesday's interruptions, Australia declared their innings before the start of play. In the third over of the day, Shikhar Dhawan, on one, survived a dropped chance when he got an inside edge off Johnson, although it was a tough one as Brad Haddin dived for the ball only to see it slip through his grasp. Dhawan stuck around to help India score at a decent rate, but was nevertheless the first man out for 25, another inside edge off Ryan Harris needing no further assistance this time as it went straight on to his stumps. Murali Vijay had made a tentative start at the other end, but after taking eight off a loose over from Peter Siddle, he began to open up, and he ended the 20th over with a six and a four off consecutive balls from Nathan Lyon. He would hit Lyon for six again but soon after reaching his half-century he fell victim to Johnson, playing at a delivery which swung away from him and helping it into the gloves of Haddin to go for 53. The Indian captain ducked into a short ball from Johnson. Kohli was visibly shaken up but not hurt . Virat Kohli is struck. But the Indian skipper bounced back very quickly, two balls later he played a strong a straight drive down the ground. The first ball he faced hit the Indian captain on the front of the helmet. Visibly concerned Australian players rushed to check if Virat Kohli was okay . That brought Kohli to the middle and before he could set about a fine afternoon's work there was the tense moment of Johnson's delivery hitting his helmet as he ducked late. Once Kohli was given chance to settle, he and Pujara got to work before Lyon broke their third-wicket stand with a good delivery which caused Pujara to hesitate before a tentative prod merely helped it through on to the stumps. Lyon continued to put India under pressure, in particular asking lots of questions of the new man in Rahane, who was subject to one big shout for lbw - replays showed an inside edge - and then offered a half-chance to short leg, with the ball just falling short. From the first ball after tea, Kohli brought up his first Test fifty in 11 innings, a great way to show how he is handling the extra responsibility of captaining the side for the first time. At the other end, Rahane was nearing a half-century of his own, but still offering chances. A big pull shot from a Siddle bouncer went high but Lyon, racing in from the boundary, could not stretch for the catch and instead it ran for four. David Warner and Steve Smith join Mitchell Johnson to check on Kohli after he was struck on the helmet . Words of encouragement from the Aussie skipper Michael Clarke for paceman Mitchell Johnson, who was noticeably shaken up after his delivery struck the Indian captain on the helme . Rahane would make it past 50, but with the new ball looming, Lyon stepped up his attack. Australia claimed the catch when David Warner twisted acrobatically at short leg, but the ball had come off the pad. But from the next delivery, Rahane gloved it to the slips where Shane Watson hung on to remove him for 62. With Sharma in at the other end, Kohli brought up his century in style by punishing Mitchell Marsh's poor delivery to claim his 12th and final four of the day over the mid-wicket boundary. They kept India ticking over before Johnson made the key breakthrough for the hosts in the 95th over, taking Kohli's wicket with a bouncer that the India captain could only send into the palms of Ryan Harris at deep fine leg. Stumps came two overs later with Sharma, unbeaten on 33, and Wriddhiman Saha, one not out, at the crease with India trailing by 148 runs.

"Zlatan Ibrahimovic may have struggled to fit in during his season at Barcelona, but the Paris Saint-Germain striker claims he still has plenty of friends at the club. The Swedish star scored on his return to the Nou Camp and celebrated passionately putting his new side ahead against his old one, before watching Barcelona come back to win 3-1. But after the game Ibrahimovic played down the suggestion that he had any ill-feeling towards Barca. Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Lionel Messi share a hug after Barcelona's 3-1 victory over Paris Saint-Germain . The Swedish striker did not hold back when he celebrated scoring against his former club on Wednesday . When asked if he still had any friends in Barcelona, PSG's talisman, who spent a year in Spain for the 2009/10 campaign, told Spanish TV  'Yes, 90,000 and the 22 players on the field'. Ibrahimovic's time at Barcelona is not always remembered particularly fondly, as the Sweden star was often shunted out wide to make room for the supremely talented Lionel Messi. 'You bought a Ferrari, but you drive it like a Fiat,' Zlatan complained as he failed to get the prominence he felt he deserved. Ibrahimovic claimed he still had 90,000 fans at the Nou Camp but they didn't enjoy his goal . Zlatan fell out with Messi when they played together for a season in 2009/10 but he played down the dispute . He has also previously been less than complimentary the club's three biggest stars: ‘Messi, Xavi and Iniesta always obeyed without protest. They were like schoolboys.’ But  he seemed to have put those differences behind him, embracing Messi at the final whistle on a night where both scored from their favoured central positions.","Former Barca striker puts differences with club behind him .

"Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City ensure the Premier League will have three teams represented in the Champions League last 16, despite Liverpool's limp group stage exit. The Gunners and Jose Mourinho's team cruised through their respective groups and are joined by the Premier League champions, whose stunning win in Rome sealed their progress. Here, Sportsmail gives you a guide to their Champions League exploits so far and who they  can face in Monday's draw for the last 16 when the competition resumes in February. VIDEO Scroll down for Jose Mourinho: Chelsea hoping to face PSG in the Champions League . Arsenal .

Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid, Monaco, Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Porto . Odds to win Champions League: 33/1 . So once again Arsenal will be going through the Champions League group stage, but once again it will be as runners-up. Like in previous years there was very little doubt the Gunners would end up sailing through in Group D, despite an opening day loss at Borussia Dortmund. The German side and the Gunners quickly became runaway leaders and the question became which one of the two would top the pile? Head-to-head there was nothing between them so it ultimately came down to Dortmund's ability to comfortably beat Anderlecht and Galatasaray just a bit easier than Arsene Wenger's team managed, and sneak top spot on goal difference. The next question is will the north London side have to yet again take on another European giant in the last 16? It's almost becoming a pattern.

Juventus, Basle, Bayer Leverkusen, Paris Saint-Germain, Shakhtar Donetsk . Odds to win Champions League: 11/2 . Like Arsenal, a stumble on the opening day following a Stamford Bridge home draw with Schalke was about as nervous as it got for Chelsea, as they cruised through Group G and had the group won with a game to spare. The Blues' two big tests were brushed off, with a 1-0 win in Sporting Lisbon trumped by an emphatic 5-0 victory at Schalke as Jose Mourinho's outfit made light work of their supposed rivals in the group. Their only slip up away from home came in the 1-1 draw at Maribor, but a 6-0 thrashing of the Slovenian minnows on the previous matchday meant the result was more of a nuisance than the start of a major panic. Dreams of a second Champions League crown have remained steady as tougher tests will be sure to come at Stamford Bridge, but the current Premier League leaders are fourth favourites behind Bayern Munich, Barcelona and Real Madrid heading into the last 16.

Who can they face? Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid, Monaco, Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona, Porto . Odds to win Champions League: 12/1 . By contrast to Chelsea and Arsenal, Manchester City looked like they were on a fast-ticket to a Champions League exit for a large majority of their group stage campaign. Even with two games to play City hadn't won a game, and with a daunting home tie against Bayern Munich and a testing trip to Roma left - Manuel Pellegrini's side looked doomed. But Sergio Aguero's stunning hat-trick to defeat the German champions, and a magnificent performance to win 2-0 in Roma saw City through in dramatic circumstances as group runners-up. It leaves them with daunting last 16 prospects, but it keeps them feeding alongside Europe's elite which just about every City fan would have taken after sitting bottom and winless following a home defeat by CSKA Moscow after matchday four.

How the Champions League last 16 draw works . Group winners will be drawn against runners-up, with the exception that teams from the same association as well as the same Champions League group cannot face each other.

"Joan Rivers has said she has no sympathy for the plight of the Palestinians in Gaza, declaring they ‘deserve to be dead’. The 81-year-old comedian launched a furious rant outside a Los Angeles airport, saying that the Palestinians who do not leave their homes are ‘idiots’ and that ‘at least the ones that were killed were the ones with very low IQs’. Rivers, the daughter of Russian-Jewish immigrants, later released a statement where she claimed her words were taken out of context, but that she stood behind what she had said. Scroll down for video . Rant: Joan Rivers said she does not feel bad for the civilian victims in Gaza, that they 'deserve to be dead' and that 'at least the ones that were killed were the ones with very low IQs' Rivers’ rant came when a photographer asked for her opinion on the conflict on the Gaza strip as she was leaving LAX airport on Wednesday. The TV presenter first compared Gaza's rocket attacks to going to Madonna's house to 'throw paint bottles’ and the civilian casualties to the victims of Hiroshima. She then said the thought the nearly 2,000 Palestinian who have died on the Gaza strip since Israel launched military operations in the area a month ago 'deserved it'. 'When you declare war, you declare war,' Rivers said. ‘They started it. We now don't count who's dead. You're dead. You deserve to be dead. You started it. You started it. Don't you dare make me feel sad about that.’ Attack: The 81-year-old began to rant about the Gaza conflict outside LAX airport in LA on Wednesday . Rivers compared the Gaza conflict to Hiroshima and said Hamas had been elected by 'stupid people who don't even own a pencil' Blaming Gaza: Rivers underlined her lack of sympathy for the dead in Gaza by adding that 'they started it' She then further attacked the Palestinian people for voting for Hamas in democratic elections. 'You can't get rid of Hamas, You have to say you do not recognise them, they are terrorists. 'They were re-elected by a lot of stupid people who don’t even own a pencil.’ When questioned further about the . civilian victims, she added: 'You were told to get out, you don't get . out, then you know you're an idiot, and at least the ones that were . killed were the ones with very low IQs.’ After . the video began circulating online, Rivers released a statement on her . Facebook page, in which she made it clear she stood behind her words, . but that they had been taken out of context. 'I am both saddened and disappointed . that my statement about the tragedy of civilian casualties was totally . taken out of context,' she said. 'Their fault': Hanan Abu Leil, a six-year-old Palestinian girl injured during an Israeli military strike on the Gaza strip, lies in a bed after being evacuated to a hospital in East Jerusalem . Victim: Mohammed Ali Wahdan, a two-year-old Palestinian boy, receives treatment for burns and injuries he sustained in an Israeli attack at the al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City . Destruction: Residents walk through the rubble of his destroyed home in the devastated neighbourhood of Shejaiya in Gaza City, shortly before the end of the ceasefire . ‘What I said and stand behind is, war is hell and unfortunately civilians are victims of political conflicts. I am both saddened and disappointed that my statement about the tragedy of civilian casualties was totally taken out of context. What I said and stand behind is, war is hell and unfortunately civilians are victims of political conflicts. We, The United States, certainly know this as 69 years later we still feel the guilt of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The media, as usual, has decided to only quote the most out of context and inflammatory non sequitur rather than giving an accurate account of what my intentions were behind the statement. Along with every other sane person in this world, I am praying for peace. It is stupid and wrong and I am tired of bearing the brunt of attacks by people who want to sell newspapers or gain ratings by creating a scandal about me that is non-existent. ‘Along with every other sane person in this world, I am praying for peace. ‘ .

This morning, Israeli military resumed strikes on targets 'across Gaza' in response to rocket fire from the territory that was aimed at Israel. The new round of fighting came after a three-day truce expired on Friday morning and Israel-Hamas talks that have been underway in Cairo on a new border deal for blockaded Gaza hit a deadlock. After the end of the temporary, 72-hour cease-fire, Gaza militants fired at least 17 rockets at Israel. Gaza's police say that Israel then resumed tank fire on northern Gaza and launched an airstrike that hit a farm south of Gaza City.","Joan Rivers filmed ranting about the Gaza conflict outside airport .

French midfielder Nasri unleashed a blistering 20-yard drive early in the second half before Zabaleta added another with four minutes left to secure victory at the Stadio Olimpico and send City through as runners-up to Bayern Munich in Group E. Despite missing Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure, Manuel Pellegrini’s side gave a steely display and the manager said he hopes it gives them the momentum to challenge Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea, who are also in Monday’s draw along with Arsenal.

Joe Hart, Edin Dzeko and David Silva support City's travelling fans after a famous night for the Manchester club . Zabaleta kisses the City badge after his goal . Pellegrini said: ‘We are happy because we achieved a target and now we will try to catch Chelsea in the Premier League. We have important games in the Premier League and that is as important, maybe it is more important than this. We have to beat Leicester and then carry on winning in December.’ Given they were missing key players such as Aguero, Pellegrini believes the victory has scotched suggestions that City are a one-man team. ‘It’s not relief I feel,’ added the manager. ‘After we beat Bayern I knew we had a good chance. I’m very happy because we beat a good team and played well from the beginning to the end. ‘I trust in the players and the squad deserves more credit. We are more than just Kun (Aguero). This team is more than just one player. We have a lot of different critics. We are not trying to send messages to people. I think Roma are a good team and played well but against them in Manchester it was the worst we played and we still drew. Here I knew if we played as we have in the Premier League then we had a good chance to qualify. This team deserves a little more credit than it gets.’ City’s win owed as much to the heroics of goalkeeper Joe Hart as it did to goalscorers Nasri and Zabaleta. Most important was touching a header from Kostas Manolas on to a post. The wily Pellegrini gives little away on the touchline, but the Chilean must be delighted with the result . Hart keeps out an effort from Francesco Totti on an impressive outing for the England No 1 . Hart said: ‘Rome is a difficult place to come but Samir made our fans’ night for them. People wrote us off without our key players but we’re a strong unit, we believed in what we could do. 'You don’t win two Premier League titles in three years easily. We have resolve, character and fantastic players — add that together and you’ve got a chance.’ For his part, Nasri looks on the verge of some of his best form for the club. The French forward said: ‘I think the performance of the team was amazing. It was important for me to score, after injury. ‘I took a while to get to my full level but now I am (fit). ‘With Yaya Toure and Kun Aguero missing, It was important to show we were a team and we did it. At 1-0, the save Joe Hart made was amazing.’","City won 2-0 in the Eternal City to book their spot in the last-16 .

"Liverpool may be forced to sack Brendan Rodgers if results do not improve dramatically, according to Anfield legend Steve Nicol. Rodgers has made a point of saying that some defeats ‘can be the making’ of you but there is no doubt the criticism of his team, results and himself will be stinging him. Take this from Nicol, whose medals in a 13-year Anfield career include a European Cup. Brendan Rodgers has come under intense pressure following a run of dismal results . Steve Nicol won a raft of trophies at Liverpool and is pictured during the one that got away at Anfield in 1989 .

We are not even halfway through and most people don’t expect Liverpool to get into the top four. ‘You wonder where this team are going. He has tried to add to the squad to make it better.

What they do expect, is to be back in the top four come May. If Rodgers is to achieve that, he needs to get results. Fast.","Liverpool crashed out of the Champions League after draw with Basle .

"A stomach-turning incestuous sex trial wrapped  Wednesday after testimony this week that described in new and startling detail the horrors of an Alabama family sex ring. A jury took just two hours on Wednesday to find Wendy Wood Holland, 35, guilty of sodomy, sexual abuse, sexual torture and child endangerment. The trial gave no clue as to the whereabouts of the presumed dead family member Brittney Wood--whose disappearance gave rise to an investigation that led to the arrest of eight of her family members, . However, it did give voice to abuse victims who claimed the sexual torture started when kids were still in diapers and involved family six-ways. A teenager testifying to being part of a family sex ring told jurors Tuesday that she was first molested while still in diapers. Guilty: Horrific details were revealed in this week's testimony in the trial of Wendy Wood Holland, 35 (pictured) in the Baldwin County Circuit Court on Wednesday. She was found guilty on Wednesday of sodomy, sexual abuse, sexual torture and child endangerment . Sick: Holland, whose now-deceased husband was believed to be the Alabama sex ring leader, helped indoctrinate her young relatives at a very young age . 'With all my heart': A witness Tuesday, a family member who is still a minor, said she still loved Holland while replaying the sick abuse Holland helped to coordinate . The young woman, who is still a minor, said her earliest memories include having sex with adult relatives — one of whom was Holland. Despite that, the teen tearfully said she still loves Holland 'with all my heart.' The state rested its case following Tuesday's session, during which the teen testified that her relatives often had group sex. She said it sometimes including Holland's missing 19-year-old niece Brittney Wood. 'We would be in a circle and we'd all switch up,' the girl testified. Prosecutor Teresa Heinz asked how often such things occurred. 'It happened a bunch,' she said. A male relative who pleaded guilty later testified he once had six-way sex with a group of relatives that included the girl and Holland. Crying, the teen had to stand up to see over the judge's desk to identify Holland as one of the people who abused her. Holland dabbed at her eyes and looked at the girl only briefly. Defense lawyer Mitzi Johnson-Theodoro brought up statements in which the girl initially denied Holland had done anything to her, and she said the youth had falsely accused a total of eight people of sexual advances, including the lead police investigator. The witness said people might have misunderstood her, and she admitted making up two names of two people and accusing them of sexual abuse because a relative was pressuring her for information. But, the teen said, she was truthful about her allegations about Holland and other close relatives. 'I wouldn't lie to anyone about this,' she said. In opening statements, Johnson-Theodoro compared the youth to the George Costanza character in the old 'Seinfeld' comedy series, saying that she, like he, told lies that became more and more outrageous. 'Just saying something doesn't make it true,' said Johnson-Theodoro. 'Just believing something doesn't make it true.' Heinz told the jury of 10 women and four men, including two alternates, that the youth has a hard time recalling specific instances of molestation because it happened so often. 'This was her norm. This is what happened to her on a regular basis,' Heinz said. Mystery that started it all: Holland's niece, 19-year-old Brittney Wood (pictured with her daughter) vanished in May 2012. The investigation that followed quickly mushroomed into a multi-generational family sex sting that involved eight of Wood's family members including her mother Chessie . Started when they were in diapers: Seen here aged 5 or 6, Brittney Wood was a 19-year-old single mother of a daughter born when she was 17, Wood was molested as a child by a step-grandfather who went to prison for the crime. She is believed to have been involved in the sick family sex parties described in her aunt Wendy Holland's trial . Holland is Brittney Wood's aunt. Eight of Wood's relatives and three family friends have been charged with multiple felonies in two counties since the teen's disappearance. Brittney Wood's 23-year-old brother Derek Wood, who pleaded guilty to having sex with the underage victim in Holland's case and is awaiting sentencing, said he had sex with Holland too many times to count starting around age 13. Brittney Wood's mother, Chessie Wood, who also is charged with a sex crime, came to court with her son but wasn't allowed inside because she is a defendant in a related case. Holland's brother-in-law Dustin Kent testified that he participated in a six-way sexual encounter that included Wendy Holland, the alleged teen victim, and his wife Mendy Kent, Wendy Holland's twin sister. Kent, who also pleaded guilty to sex charges and is awaiting sentencing, said he first saw Wendy Holland having sex with the alleged victim in October 2011. 'It wasn't like it was her first time. Her and (Holland) had done this before,' said Kent, 38. Wendy Holland sat expressionless during the testimony of both Wood and Kent, but her lawyer noted that both men are awaiting sentencing and could hope to get lighter punishment for helping prosecutors. A mother accused: Brittney's mother, Chessie Wood, is charged with two counts of sodomy and sex abuse of a child under 12 . Chessie Wood, Brittney's mother: Two counts of sodomy and sex abuse of a child less than 12. Derek Wood, Brittney's brother: Second degree rape and second degree sodomy. Nelton ‘Butch’ Morgan: Rape and sex abuse of a child under 12. Dustin Kent: Two counts of rape, sex abuse, sodomy and production of obscene material of a person under 17. He allegedly raped a 13-year-old while her father looked on . William 'Billy' Brownlee: Two counts of rape, sodomy and sex abuse. Mendy Kent: Sodomy and sex abuse. Wendy Holland: Sodomy, sex abuse and child torture. James Cumbaa: Rape, sodomy, and sex abuse. Randall Scott Wood: Second degree sodomy, enticing a child to enter and second degree rape. Jennifer Moore: Production of pornography involving minors and second-degree child abuse. Donald Holland Jr: Incest and second degree rape . Kent admitted to repeatedly lying to investigators when he first denied witnessing a threesome involving the twin sisters and the girl. A friend of the family was convicted in October in the first trial to result from the investigation. Wood was last seen with Holland's husband, Donnie, in 2012, and 11 people have since been arrested on sex-related charges. That includes Wendy Holland, on trial on charges of sexually abusing another underage relative. Authorities said Wood could provide important evidence about sexual crimes by her adult relatives if only they could find her alive. But searches and two years of investigation have failed to turn up any sign of her. Police believe Wood is dead, possibly killed in the days before the case went public. Following the disappearance, Holland was charged with sexual abuse, sodomy, sexual torture and child endangerment. Prosecutors told jurors during closing arguments that Wendy Holland, her late husband and others were monsters who subjected their own children and others to perversions that were almost too depraved to understand, with parents and in-laws using their own young relatives for sex. Holland used sex toys and other forms of stimulation to groom the alleged victim for sex with adults at an age children typically are watching 'Sesame Street' and learning to color, prosecution witnesses told the jury. 'You have heard testimony over the last two days that no one wants to believe,' prosecutor Nicki Patterson said in closing arguments. 'We want to give family the benefit of the doubt.' But defense attorney Mitzi Johnson-Theodoro argued that the alleged victim, two other relatives who pleaded guilty to sex charges and a jailhouse friend of Holland were lying when they portrayed her as a serial child abuser. Suspects: Randall Wood (left), who who pleaded guilty to second degree sodomy, and Brittney Wood's brother, Derek Wood (right), who's been charged with second degree rape and second degree sodomy . Under suspicion: Brittney's uncle Dustin Kent is accused of raping a 13-year-old girl while the father allegedly looked on . Neighbors didn't see pornography or sex toys in Holland's home, and prosecutors have no physical evidence, Johnson-Theodoro told jurors. Holland is a loving person who took her own kids trick-or-treating and worked as a certified nursing assistant at a state nursing home for veterans, she said. 'They want you to believe that a woman who cared for the elderly abused children?' Johnson-Theodor said in closing arguments. Deliberations began after Judge Jody Bishop said deliberations instructed jurors on the fine points of the law. Donnie Holland was under investigation as the leader of the alleged sex ring at the time of Wood's disappearance, and he died days later of what authorities ruled was a self-inflicted gunshot. Regardless of the outcome, the trial was all about Brittney Wood for Christin Huffman, a friend of the missing teen. Testimony showed Wood was part of at least one family sexual encounter involving Holland, three other adults and two children, but the fact that no one has seen the teen since before the case broke in 2012 wasn't mentioned to jurors. Seated in the court and wearing a T-shirt decorated with Wood's photo, Huffman dabbed at her eyes as attorneys laid out details of generations of incest allegations involving her friend's family. 'To me the whole thing is about her,' Huffman, 21, said outside court. 'There's no way anyone could look at it and say it's not.' Wood's older brother and an uncle have pleaded guilty and testified against Holland, and her mother faces sex charges. Holland was the second person to stand trial in the case. Family friend Billy Brownlee was convicted in October. Linked: William Brownlee (right), is not a member of the family but was the first to be charged as part of the sex ring.

"Jose Mourinho believes Chelsea are playing on a 'different level' to last season and can win this year's Champions League - but only if the 'sharks in the ocean' let them. The Blues boss saw his side sweep past Sporting Lisbon 3-1 at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night as they finished the group stage undefeated. And Mourinho thinks his current squad is capable of winning the entire competition, but only if they can get the better of Europe's most talented sides - and avoid the likes of Paris Saint-Germain or Juventus in Monday's last-16 draw. Chelsea beat Sporting Lisbon 3-1 at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night in the Champions League . Jose Mourinho (second right) believes his squad can win the Champions League this season . Cesc Fabregas slots home his penalty to put Chelsea in front early on at Stamford Bridge . Speaking to Sky Sports after the victory, he said: 'We can dream about winning (the Champions League) because we did well last year and we are playing on a different level now. 'But let's see if the sharks can let us do that because there are a few sharks in the ocean.' 'The real Champions League starts now. Barcelona are there, Real Madrid, Atletico (Madrid), Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund are there. 'Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea, Paris and everybody is there. 'What can we do? I don't know. Last season, we were not one of the top four for sure and we played in the semi-finals. Let's see what we can do this time step by step.' The match itself was a stroll in the park for the Blues, with Cesc Fabregas slotting home an early penalty before Andre Schurrle netted from the edge of the area. Jonathan Silva then pulled a goal back for Sporting Lisbon but John Mikel Obi netted his first Champions League goal for Chelsea to seal the victory. The former Arsenal midfielder salutes to the crowd after giving the Blues the lead on Wednesday night . John Mikel Obi taps in a third from barely a yard out to seal the game for the hosts on Wednesday . And the Chelsea boss was happy with his side's overall display. He continued: 'Immediately I saw our team were very focused and I am so happy for that. 'I feel sorry for Sporting because I would have liked them to qualify but only if Schalke got the result. We are professionals and I am so happy my players delivered. 'It was important to win again. Obviously we didn't need the points but football is not always about what you need. It was a good reaction, good for players who are not playing a lot to have more minutes and I am really happy with the victory. 'We have a good squad. We have players who need to grow up like (Mohamed) Salah, like (Kurt) Zouma - people with many years to play and improve. Jonathan Silva gave the Portuguese side a lifeline to make it 2-1, but Sporting head out of the competition . Chelsea went into an early lead as Fabregas scored an eighth-minute penalty at Stamford Bridge . 'It is good because it is a game without the pressure you usually have in the moment. This was not the game for that. It was quite an easy game to play but they did very well.' Mourinho also introduced 18-year-old academy product Ruben Loftus-Cheek into the match with seven minutes remaining, to huge acclaim from the Stamford Bridge faithful. He was also full of praise for the youngster, adding: 'I told him (Loftus-Cheek) that he needs to bring me a bottle of red wine (before he came on) and he said 'No problem, I'll do that'. 'He's a very confident personality. He is not afraid to take responsibility on the pitch. It was an easy game, we were trying to find the best moment to give him an easy chance.

'A month ago he was playing Sporting in the youth but today he was on the big stage and he showed his great potential but he has a lot to improve. He's going to be a big player.' Schurrle's goal was expertly taken and Mourinho was also quick to insist that the German remains a part of his plans going forward. 'Schurrle is in my plans - when he is in top form,' he said. 'He had a problem when he came back very, very ill after last time he was with the national team but he came on and played well against Newcastle and today he had 75 minutes to improve his form. 'He is a player that needs to adapt better to the Premier League but a one who has goals on his boots.' Andre Schurrle has been starved of first-team opportunities but celebrates his deserved goal . THe Germany international  celebrates Chelsea's second after 16 minutes at Stamford Bridge . And Schurrle himself was also reasonably happy with his own performance - as well as echoing his manager's assertion that Chelsea can win the competition. Schurrle told Sky Sports: 'It could have been more (than one goal for me). I had a free-kick but I am happy to score a good goal after not such a positive time for me. 'I think I was an okay (performance) for my first start since Maribor but I felt good on the pitch. I am getting better but I am working hard to get my old strength back. I am happy with my goal and my performance and the win. 'We don't fear anybody but we know there are very good and very strong teams in this competition but if we play our best we can win against anyone.'

"Standing in the sunshine, chatting with my friends in the park on a lovely Saturday morning, I could not have been more content. Then I caught a glimpse of garish pink and DayGlo yellow. In an instant, my mood was shattered as a voice gasped: 'Dear God, Jennie. Is that your husband?' And there he was, walking towards us in an outfit even Daniel Craig would struggle to pull off. In fact waddling would be a more apt description, as his cycling shoes made walking all but impossible. Scroll down for video . Cycle of despair: Jennie Price and her husband Richard with his £2,000 bike . Yet, as I stood there mortified, Richard had a smile as broad as the Thames. For my darling husband is a MAMIL, and had just returned from his ritual Saturday bike ride. 'What is a MAMIL?' I hear you cry. Well, as of last week you need look no further than the Oxford Dictionary to find out. It stands for a Middle Aged Man In Lycra. The definition is 'a middle-aged man who is a very keen road cyclist, typically one who rides an expensive bike and wears the type of clothing associated with professional cyclists'. Crisis: Richard's mid-life crisis is entirely his choice, says Jennie who says it has turned her into a weekend widow rapidly turning grey as she watches money drain from their joint account . You will have seen them. Their numbers are swelling at an alarming rate, thanks to Tour de France winners Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome — men I would admire but for my husband's desire to emulate them. As professional sportsmen, it is their job to dress in ridiculous clothes and spend endless hours in the saddle. But Richard's mid-life crisis is entirely his choice, and has turned me into a weekend widow rapidly turning grey as I watch money drain from our joint account more quickly than a Mark Cavendish sprint. For those fortunate enough to have normal husbands, allow me to elaborate. Being a MAMIL is about much more than squeezing your ample frame into tight lycra. MAMIL hero: The men all want to be like Tour De France winner Bradley Wiggins . This means boring dinner parties into silence with endless chat about bikes, spending long hours of family time out 'training', embarrassing your children walking around the house in bib shorts (think a mankini with padding around the nether regions) and paying eye-watering sums for obscure items of kit. Richard's transformation into a MAMIL began five years ago when, to get fit, he bought a road bike. At first, he wore a sensible pair of shorts and a loose-fitting jersey. But then the buying began in earnest. New wheels (the old ones were slowing him down, apparently), a pair of cycling shoes, then another pair, then a 'quicker' helmet, then a personal trainer to help him shed the pounds and improve his 'power to weight ratio'. Transformation: Richard's evolution into a MAMIL began five years ago when, to get fit, he bought a road bike . The clothes grew tighter, the cost escalated as he bought a cycling computer (a glorified satnav), which at £500 cost almost as much as his bike, and £250 sunglasses (they have gaps in the lenses to stop them steaming up — but if you sweat as much as Richard, they steam up anyway). Now our weekends have been taken over by cycling. For MAMILs do not simply go on an hour-long run out. Rides regularly last three hours or more, while in the spring and summer they disappear for days to ride in 'sportive' events. My husband, like so many of his friends, is a fanatic. He buys an average of one bike a year, each more expensive than the last. His first was a relatively meagre £800, that he sold two years on for £200. Emulating their idols: Jennie's husband and his friends go on cycling trips abroad so they can cycle routes taken by professionals like Chris Froome, pictured right . Today, he has three: a day-to-day 'workhorse' (£1,000), a steel 'winter trainer' (£850) and a custom-built, red, white and blue road bike (£2,000 — his name is painted on the frame). Then there are the clothes, gadgets and 'sports nutrition'. Tools, inner tubes, tyres, wheels, hats, gloves (summer, autumn, winter and spring versions), shoes (waterproof for the winter, lightweight for the summer), overshoes, arm warmers, leg warmers, lights, pumps, pedals and saddles... the list is endless. Every week another mysterious package arrives, with the latest waterproof jersey or a vintage cycling cap of a type once worn by one of his increasingly obscure heroes. Spending: Jennie says every week another mysterious package arrives, with the latest waterproof jersey or a vintage cycling cap of a type once worn by one of his increasingly obscure heroes . At night in bed, he reads Cycling Weekly or autobiographies of surly-looking Belgians. He has also been agonising over whether to shave his legs or not, although the only reason he can give me for doing so is 'the pros do it'. Even when it rains we get no respite. Rather than miss a ride he sets up rollers (a treadmill for bikes) in the kitchen and scares the dog witless by riding on the spot for a noisy hour. Then there are the foreign trips. We live in the Surrey Hills — one of the best cycling spots in the country. Box Hill, where the Olympic road race was held, is a local climb and the Tour of Britain passes through every year. All the gear, no idea: Jennie's husband as much kit as Mark Cavendish but cycling is not his career . The one thing we don't have is a mountain. So a couple of times a year Richard and his MAMIL pals pack their bikes into protective boxes (£500) and fly to the Pyrenees or the Alps, for a weekend emulating their professional cycling idols. It may drive me to distraction, but I must admit I admire his dedication. Our son, James, six, certainly looks up to him and wants a road bike, too. Even Jessica, eight-going-on-18, was genuinely interested in racing a bike until recently, when she started to prefer my Zumba and dance classes. For a man diagnosed with multiple sclerosis ten years ago, Richard is impressively active . Both ride well and have picked up a love of exercise from Richard and me. For a man diagnosed with multiple sclerosis ten years ago, Richard is impressively active. Within a year of taking up cycling he rode from London to Paris and this summer did the Etape du Tour — a mountain stage of the Tour de France, in appalling weather. As mid-life crises go it could be a lot worse. I am far happier my 41-year-old husband is out riding a pushbike with a bunch of other men than zooming around on a Harley-Davidson and chasing girls half his age. I also take comfort from the fact I am not alone. In our circle of friends, six of the husbands have taken up cycling . They are putting this passion to good use, too. Next May they will take part in a charity cycle ride from Guildford to Bordeaux in aid of The Fountain Centre, a local cancer charity. Being a MAMIL, like all mid-life crises means acting like little boys. As 11-year-olds do, they have their in-jokes, asserting the perfect number of bikes to own is N + 1 (N is the number of bikes you have already). Another formula, which shows they are not entirely stupid, is S – 1 (S is the number of bikes that will prompt your wife to demand a separation). In Richard's case, he seems to have taken heed to the latter — he used to have two more than now (a mountain bike and a Brompton folding cycle). Of course, he hankers for more. Recently, he has been wittering on about carbon and titanium frames, in the hope of boring me into submission. I humour him up to a point, but on one issue I will not budge. Since that day in the park Richard is banned from attending any social occasion dressed in lycra — on pain of his bike being sent to the tip. Would I really follow through with the threat? Just try me.","Jennie Price from Surrey is a cycling widow .

"Stefan Johansen has told wonderkid Martin Odegaard that joining Celtic would be an ideal next step in his remarkable rise to prominence. Ronny Deila revealed last week that he has not given up hope of luring his former prodigy from Stromsgodset – despite the 15-year-old Norwegian midfielder being the most wanted youngster in Europe. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich are among those tracking Odegaard, who has also been linked with Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool. Martin Odegaard is Norway's youngest ever player and has been scouted by Europe's biggest clubs . Odegaard, 15, has broken into the first team at his club Stromsgodset and is wanted by several top teams . Johansen, though, sees real merits in the teenager not jumping straight to one of the continent’s elite clubs but instead continuing his development under a manager he trusts. It is a point he has made to his ex-Stromsgodset team-mate, who is now also a colleague in Norway’s national squad. ‘I’ve talked a lot with Martin,’ said fellow midfielder Johansen, ahead of tonight’s closing Europa League group game against Dinamo Zagreb in Croatia. ‘We keep in touch and speak on the phone. ‘I have told him that Celtic can be a good choice for him. The way we play would suit him. We have the ball a lot and that’s what Martin likes. He wants to be on the ball and creating chances. The Norwegian international has trained with Liverpool, Real Madrid and Manchester United recently . Odegaard is an attacking midfielder with an eye for goal, who Stefan Johansen called an 'amazing talent' ‘Martin is an amazing talent and I hope he comes to Celtic. The gaffer has shown in Norway that he is very good with young players and he gives them a chance when they deserve it. Martin knows him and myself. ‘But it is up to Martin. His father is a good guy who helps him a lot and he’s also very mature in the way he thinks. I’m sure he’ll make the right decision for his career.’ He added: ‘To say that you are going to go and play at Real Madrid and compete against Ronaldo and Bale and those guys… for a 15-year-old that’s going to be difficult. ‘He would be unlikely to play right away at a Real Madrid or Barcelona. Of course it would be difficult. But, as I said, he needs to choose for himself.’ Johansen, above training ahead of Celtic's Europa League tie, says he hopes Odegaard will come to Scotland . The Celtic midfielder says his compatriot would fit in at the club, and might struggle to play elsewhere . Johansen admits he has been hugely impressed by the way Odegaard has coped with the incredible hype that surrounds him. ‘He’s been at all the big clubs in Europe and it’s probably the most insane thing I’ve seen around a 15-year-old boy,’ he said. ‘Everybody in Norway is talking about him. It’s crazy. But he has handled it all. ‘He is very good, that’s for sure. He’s about to turn 16 but you can give him the ball and know he won’t lose it. He’s creative, too. ‘He’s young and will get stronger. Give him one or two years and he will get there on the physical side. But on the ball, he is fantastic.’","Teenage star Martin Odegaard is wanted by Europe's top clubs .

"Goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta ensured Manchester City beat Roma and sealed progression to the knockout stages of this season's Champions League. Results were in their favour on Wednesday night and, along with Chelsea and Arsenal, they are in the pot for the last 16 draw. Here, Sportsmail looks at City's group stage story, and how they came back from the brink... BAYERN MUNICH 1-0 MAN CITY . September 17 . City get off to the worst possible start after Jerome Boateng’s last-gasp winner in Munich. To top it off, Roma have beaten CSKA Moscow 5-1, and things look bleak for Manuel Pellegrini's men. Joe Hart rocks back on his heels in the post-match interview, after a man-of-the-match performance. City are still confident despite two poor results on the opening night, he says. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart stretches but is powerless to keep out Bayern Munich's late winner at the Allianz Arena . Bayern Munich centre back Jerome Boateng, formerly of City, punches the air having raced towards the touchline to celebrate his goal . MAN CITY 1-1 ROMA . September 30 . Sergio Aguero gives City the lead from the penalty spot, but a record-breaking Francesco Totti goal rescues a point for Roma. If City are to progress, these are the games they need to win. At home to their main rivals for the second qualification spot. The Etihad crowd seem to have given up hope too - the attendance is 10,000 under capacity. Sportsmail's Martin Samuel summed up the performance: . 'Roma probably shaded it here, and certainly Joe Hart was the busier goalkeeper. The hero in defeat against Bayern Munich, he saved City once again, and was unfortunate that a slip at a vital moment prevented him closing out what proved to be the equaliser.' Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City took an early fourth-minute lead, but could not hold on for three vital points against Roma . Francesco Totti scores Roma's equalising goal against Manchester City, becoming the Champions League's oldest scorer in the process . CSKA MOSCOW 2-2 MAN CITY . October 21 . The visitors coast to a 2-0 half-time lead but throw away a vital victory. Sergio Aguero and James Milner are on the scoresheet as the first 45 minutes end, and things are looking rosy from a City perspective. Yes, they had one point from their first two matches, but a positive away win will do them the world of good. A disastrous second-half performance follows though, as Seydou Doumbia and Bebras Natcho steal a point for the Russians. Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman reports from the game: . 'Freezing temperatures, a stadium echoing to the boorish, boozed-up chanting of CSKA fans who shouldn’t have been anywhere near the place and a late penalty decision so dreadful it’s tempting to check the Hungarian referee’s passport for Russian lineage.'  It wasn't City's night. Manchester City players gather to congratulate goalscorer James Milner while CSKA Moscow goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev looks down . Hart dives to his left but is unable to keep out Bibras Natcho's late penalty after Aleksandar Kolarov brought down Doumbia in the area . MAN CITY 1-2 CSKA MOSCOW . November 5 . Things go from bad to worse for City. Four games, two points. Both Fernandinho and Yaya Toure see red, and a double from Seydou Doumbia secures an unlikely away win for the Russian side. Sportsmail's Martin Samuel was at the game: . 'Even by the dismal standards of Manchester City in the Champions League this was a low. Defeat at home to what had been considered the weakest team in Group E, reduced to nine players by the end, never ahead at any stage of the match, trailing after two minutes, Toure banned for the rest of the campaign, this was close to as bad as it gets.' City captain Vincent Kompany has his head in his hands during the defeat at the Etihad, leaving his side with a mountain to climb . Hart can only flap at thin air as Doumbia's header flies past his outstretched arm to stun the home crowd at the Etihad . MAN CITY 3-2 BAYERN MUNICH . November 25 . The turning point for City. Bayern Munich will progress as group winners, and City's chances of taking second spot in the group are given a huge boost with a miraculous three points at the Etihad. Sergio Aguero, take a bow. The Argentinian scores a hat-trick, and City aren't down and out just yet. 'Sometimes, it doesn’t have to make sense, you know,' Martin Samuel said from the Etihad. 'It just is what it is. By some miracle of mathematics and against all logic, Manchester City are still in Europe.' Sergio Aguero lies on the turf as his team-mates pile on following the striker's last-minute winner against Bayern Munich . Aguero runs away in celebration after sealing victory and his hat-trick with a last-minute strike against Bayern Munich . ROMA 0-2 MAN CITY . December 10 . They've done it. Manchester City, along with Arsenal and Chelsea, are through to the knockout stages of the Champions League. They made hard work of it, but eventually goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta takes them through to the stage that looked so unlikely just two games ago. It started badly in September, but finished with a flourish on Wednesday. Martin Samuel watched the game unfold live in Rome: . 'They were men down here, and good men, too — Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure, Vincent Kompany, David Silva until midway through the second half. Yet they came through. They won, CSKA Moscow lost and a place in Monday’s last-16 draw was theirs.' Click here to read the match report.

Security instantly intervened as a violent scuffle broke out outside the El Capitan theatre and Sediuk was dragged to the floor and arrested.

Moments later when security guards step in, Pitt re-emerges without the glasses on his face. Pitt, 50, who took the unusual step of attending the premiere with his five of his children, is understood not to have been seriously injured in the altercation. That hasn't stopped a judge from taking legal precautions, however, as Sediuk has been ordered to stay at least 500 feet away from Pitt for the next five days. The actor was not standing near Jolie when the attack happened - she was in another section greeting her fans. Pitt was signing autographs when Sediuk, 25, rushed past barriers and hit him in the face. Whether exactly this kind of attack had been the intention or not, is not clear.

'The . officers who were handling him said it looked like it was intentional, . but at this point, it remains to be determined,' said Sergeant Leonard . Calderon for LAPD Hollywood. Before the incident, Jolie said that the El Capitan is like a local theatre for herself, Pitt and their children who usually do not attend her premieres but did Wednesday night. 'Well, oddly, we usually go to the El Capitan, that's where we take the kids. That's the closest theater to us,' Jolie said. 'This is the first time they were able to come to mommy's premiere.'

"An extraordinary Cabinet row has broken out over plans by Ministers to force Muslim schools to teach pupils about Christianity. The move by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is intended to stop Islamic extremists from ‘brainwashing’ children. But it has led to a clash at the top of Government, with Home Secretary Theresa May lining up with Mrs Morgan against Communities Secretary Eric Pickles. Mrs Morgan drew up the proposals in the wake of the ‘Trojan Horse’ plot by radical Muslims to take over schools in Birmingham, which led to the Government rushing in new measures to compel schools to teach ‘British values’ of tolerance. Nicky Morgan, is said to have drawn up the new proposals in the wake of the Trojan Horse plot in Birmingham schools . However, The Mail on Sunday has learned that the plan has infuriated Mr Pickles, who has argued it ‘violates religious freedom’, and warned about the impact on Catholic and Jewish schools. The Education Secretary wants to amend the Religious Studies GCSE course, which stipulates that pupils should study one ‘world religion’ – usually restricted to their school’s faith. Mrs Morgan wants students to learn about a minimum of two religions to ensure that Muslim pupils become aware of ‘different perspectives’. Mr Pickles – backed by the heads of the Catholic and Jewish faiths in the UK – has pointed out that the plan could also compel other faith schools to teach pupils about Islam. A Government source said: ‘Eric has really gone off on one over this. Home Secretary Theresa May, left, is supporting the plans, while Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, is against . ‘He thinks that it is just meddling, and it will have a knock-on effect on the freedom of Catholic and Jewish schools to restrict their teachings to just their faith and preserve their distinctive ethos. Theresa however has been fully supportive. She thinks the most important thing is to stop a new generation of Muslims from being lost to the extremists.’ The Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis is expected to raise the proposal at a meeting with the Prime Minister later this month. The Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, the Most Rev Vincent Nichols, is also understood to have privately expressed his concerns over the reform, while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, is ‘broadly supportive’ of the move. Last night an ally of Mrs Morgan defended the plan as essential to stop the radicalisation of children. The source said: ‘We saw in Birmingham the dangers of allowing schools to inculcate an intolerant and ultra-Conservative version of their faith in young and impressionable pupils. ‘If they are obliged to learn about another religion – in an even-handed manner – it will help to stop them from being brainwashed.’ The Chief Rabbi and the Archbishop of Westminster declined to comment last night.","Nicky Morgan's proposal are intended to stop 'brainwashing' of children .

"Breastfeeding cuts a woman's risk of breast cancer by up to a fifth, a major study has found. Thousands of cases could be avoided if more mothers persevered feeding their babies breast milk for six months, experts say. Research involving almost 37,000 women found those who had breastfed were 10 per cent less likely to get the disease. Research has found that women who had breastfed were 10 per cent less likely to get breast cancer and 20 per cent less likely to develop one of the worst forms of the disease, known as triple negative . And they were 20 per cent less likely to develop one of the worst forms of breast cancer, known as triple negative. In Britain, just 23 per cent of women breastfeed for six months, often giving their babies some formula milk as well. But the World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding alone – with no formula – for six months. US researchers at two charities and Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, analysed 27 studies covering 36,881 women. Those who had breastfed for any length of time reduced their risk of breast cancer by 10 per cent. Scarlett Johansson (pictured) claims breastfeeding helped her get her  figure back after birth . Scarlett Johansson claims she got her figure back after giving birth by breastfeeding her baby daughter. Speaking in an interview, she described it as the 'best way to get back into shape', adding that she 'loves' nursing. The slender star gave birth to Rose at the start of September, reportedly marrying her French partner Romain Dauriac, 32, not long after. And despite her busy schedule, the 30-year-old told American TV channel ABC that motherhood is 'wonderful'. 'It's very, very magical – and exhausting,' she said. 'The love is unbelievable. It's very overwhelming.' She added that she doesn't shy away from late-night feeds and changing nappies either. 'I do the whole bit,' she said. 'I'm nursing and I love it.' Crucially, they were also a fifth, or 20 per cent, less likely to get triple negative cancer, which makes up 15 to 20 per cent of cases and is very hard to cure. It is called triple negative because it does not respond to any of three powerful treatments. Breastfeeding lowers levels of the hormone oestrogen, which can trigger cancer. Some scientists also believe the process of producing milk stops cancer cells forming. The researchers said nursing for three months would 'significantly reduce the risk' of breast cancer. Dr Graham Colditz presented the findings at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas. He said: 'Importantly breastfeeding was clearly protective for triple negative breast cancer – the subset of this disease for which we have limited treatment options.' He called for 'greater public health support' for breastfeeding. NHS figures show 82 per cent of mothers start to breastfeed, but only 55 per cent do it for six weeks and just one in 100 carries on with no formula milk for six months. Last week mothers protested outside the prestigious Claridge's hotel, in London, after a nursing woman was told to cover herself up in its restaurant. Ukip leader Nigel Farage waded into the row by suggesting on radio that breastfeeding mothers should 'sit in a corner' In Europe, only France, Malta, Ireland and Belgium have lower rates. Breastfed babies are less susceptible to infection, allergies and obesity. Nursing promotes bonding with the child and helps a mother shed pregnancy weight, since making milk burns calories. But many find it uncomfortable or say they are too embarrassed to do it in public due to prejudice. Last week mothers protested outside the prestigious Claridge's hotel, in London, after a nursing woman was told to cover herself up in its restaurant. Ukip leader Nigel Farage waded into the row by suggesting on radio that breastfeeding mothers should 'sit in a corner'. One in eight British women will develop breast cancer, with 50,000 cases and 11,500 deaths a year. Dr Anees Chagpar, of Yale University, said: 'When Britain has one of the lowest rates (of breastfeeding) you have to ask the question, why? Are British women educated enough about breastfeeding, or are there other barriers getting in the way?'","Women who breastfed are 10 per cent less likely to develop breast cancer .

"Blundering French transport chiefs have wasted millions on underground escalators that are 10cm too wide. The news of the ineffective escatlors comes just months after buying trains that are too wide for the platforms . Now 30 of the escalator stairs on the Paris Metro will have to be replaced at a cost of six million euros. They were installed in 2005/2006 but have been subject to frequent breakdowns ever since. Blundering French transport chiefs have waste millions on a new underground escalators that are 10cm too wide just months after buying trains that are too wide for the platforms . 'The steps of the recent models are one metre wide instead of 90cm,' explained David Courteille, who is in charge of electromechanical engineering for RATP, reported Le Figaro. The escalator was designed to be 10cm wider to accommodate more users, but this has prevented them from working properly and they consistently break down to the chagrin of commuters. The constant repairs cost RATP tens of thousands of euros each year so the operator has decided to cut its losses and will begin replacing the faulty escalators over the next year. According to Le Figaro the Paris transport company has opened up legal proceedings against suppliers CNIM (Constructions industrielles de la Méditerranée) with the aim of forcing the company to stump up part of the costs. France is already facing a multi-million pound bill after ordering 2000 new trains which are 3cm (0.11 inches) too wide for many of its platforms . But today RATP chiefs denied Mr Courteille's claim and insisted claims the regular breakdowns are due to the fact parts of the machinery are too fragile. France is already facing a multi-million pound bill after ordering 2000 new trains which are 3cm (0.11 inches) too wide for many of its platforms. The incredible mistake means that 1300 stations will have to be upgraded so as to accommodate the trains. Rail operations ordered the new trains for the country's regional network – one which traditionally has a reputation for being one of the best in the world. But they are too wide to travel through the nation's stations, a report in the investigative weekly, Le Canard Enchaine, reveals. Repair work has so far been carried out on 300 of the platforms that need adjusting, and hundreds more are on a waiting list. On average, the trains are 3cms too wide. RFF, the organisation responsible for rail tracks in France, has set aside the equivalent of more than £45m to deal with the mistake, but the figure is likely to be well above £100m once it is finished.","30 of the recently installed escalator stairs on the Paris Metro to be replaced .

A multi-millionaire businessman starts a controlling love affair with a woman several years his junior, flying her away to expensive destinations and picking out beautiful clothes for her to wear. But with the perks come the demands in the bedroom, the requests to indulge in sexual activities that would otherwise have gone unexperienced.

Lily is a beautiful young city worker who was sucked into a controlling affair with a high-flying, highly-sexed banking executive who dictated how she looked and behaved. The only big difference between this story and E.L James's fictional account is that Lily’s Mr Grey was married. But while Anastasia ended up marrying her lover, Lily gave up her well-paid job and left the profession after her partner's controlling behaviour proved too much. Much like Anastasia, Lily was a young woman swayed by the power and success of her partner, who we will call Patrick Harrington. He was a big-shot in the world of banking, where excess and bravado were key players, and the power was intoxicating. Scroll down for video . Lily worked in finance in the back office of one of the UK's biggest banks, where high-rolling traders spent tens of thousands of pounds on lavish dinners and were given bonuses in the millions. Patrick was one of the senior executives at the company; he had a reputation as a ladies' man, a top floor office and an expense account that ran into hundreds of thousands. Lily and Patrick (fake name) had a romance was very similar to the relationship between Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey in Fifty Shades Of Grey (pictured) Lily wasn’t alone in falling for Patrick – in the City environment, the heady mix of long hours, big money and office intimidation often leads to affairs. She told MailOnline: 'Infidelity was rife. I don't know if the wives at home knew of it or were just blissfully unaware. 'I'd go out with men from the office to a bar and see them slipping their wedding ring in their pocket as they walked inside. 'It was almost like an unspoken law in some ways. There were the high-rolling men who would buy Champagne for a certain set of women, knowing that was enough to guarantee them something at the end of the night. 'Or they would fly an assistant or administrator away with them on a business trip with expectation that although they had a wife at home, they would be the girlfriend for a week. 'When an all-expenses-paid trip to New York presents itself to someone who has never been first class or slept in five-star hotels, they do get swayed by it.' Lily worked in finance in the back office of one of the UK's biggest banks, where high-rolling traders spent tens of thousands of pounds on lavish meals (picture posed by models) It was at one of these alcohol-fuelled meetings in a bar near work that Lily first fell for the charms of senior executive Harrington. A low-maintenance girl from the countryside, Lily had never imagined she would be one of the women easily bought with expensive Champagne and material gifts. She said: 'I always thought that he was one of those old charmers - he spoke very well and was had a reputation as a ladies' man. 'But it wasn't until we were in drinking situations that he made it clear he wanted to take me out to dinner. 'I was very resistant initially because I knew where it was going to lead, but I eventually just got won over by expensive gifts and amazing holidays. 'I do have my head screwed on and I wanted to pursue a career and settle down, but my head got turned.' Patrick convinced Lily to have dinner with him and the romance escalated from there (posed by models) Soon, Lily was being whisked away on countless five-star holidays, from a Bergdorf Goodman shopping weekend in New York, to break in Tuscany, Paris or the Caribbean. She said: 'He knew my dress and shoe size and my closet and shoe cabinet is all the better for it. 'We would go and buy six or eight dresses from Dolce & Gabbana, Prada, or wherever it was. 'He was very up on style, so he already had an idea in his head that he wanted me in a short cocktail dress or something body-hugging or whatever. 'It was amazing, because we would go and spend a weekend in New York and I would come away with these pretty dresses and matching shoes.' Soon, Lily was being whisked away on five-star holidays. He would also treat her to expensive jewellery and designer clothes (picture posed by models) But the expensive luxury masked a more sinister side to Patrick's personality. Soon, he was dictating the way that Lily dressed, how she wore her hair, even the shade of nail polish. She said: 'He was very controlling. 'There was an expectation that I was dressed a certain way and that my hair and nails were done and that I was well presented. 'Once, I went to the nail salon at work and I came back with a French manicure. 'He said to me, ""I told you to get red"". 'I just looked at him and thought, this makes no odds and I don't know why we're arguing about the colour of my nails, it was just a point to prove there was control there.' The heady mix of long hours, big money and office intimidation in the City inevitably leads to office affairs . The control also reached into their sex lives, with Patrick pressurising Lily into sordid sex games. She said: 'The guy that I was with was incredibly highly sexed and there was an attempt to groom me into participating in swingers' parties and that sort of thing. 'He had a real reputation among the women in the company for his sexual nature. 'I wouldn't be surprised if he had been sleeping with other people from the business while we were together and even prostitutes.' Lily's view of her partner and the business they worked in only started to break down completely when the financial crisis fully took hold. As members of the public struggled to keep their jobs and homes as a result of the recession, many City workers were still spending with reckless abandon, including Patrick, who thought nothing of splashing thousands of pounds of the company’s money on fancy weekends away. The expensive luxury masked a more sinister side to Patrick's personality. Much like Christian Grey in Fifty Shades of Grey (pictured), he tried to coerce Lily into sex games . She said: 'You either stay and are complicit or you fully take yourself out of it and I decided to take myself out of it - both the job and the relationship.' Putting an end to the romance was easier said than done though and Patrick refused to accept their affair was over. Lily eventually had to quit her job and move counties, changing phone numbers and emails to escape his constant messages. Sex, Lies & Banking by Lily Temperley is out now . She said: 'It proved to be difficult for a good 18 months afterwards. 'He couldn't handle that he wasn't in control of this situation - he always had to be in control.' But after leaving the industry and blocking his access, she finally was free two years after ending it. She has since decided to write a book, out now, based on her experiences. Lily hopes it will serve as a warning to young women who are considering getting involved in a relationship with a married man. But she also wants the tale to serve as an anchor for City workers who have started to become lost in the excess and greed. She said: 'The book is basically a high flyer's diary. 'It really is an insight into banking, the greed and extravagance, but with names changed so that people can't be identified. 'But I hope it will ring some bells for anyone who finds themselves in the same position.' Sex, Lies & Banking by Lily Temperley is out now published by Clink Street Publishing. Pay packets and tax-dodging: . Lily: 'I worked in finance and had access to a lot of financial data, so I could see what the bank was paying employees - we're talking about people who would win the lottery every year and then some. 'I would always wonder why these people were coming back to work after they've just been given seven-figure bonuses - people were being paid tens of millions in one year alone. 'There was also a handful of people who got paid in tax effective schemes to maximise their net take home, they were domiciled in various countries like Cayman Islands or Monaco, where the tax rates are low or non-existent. 'So these people were being rewarded for what they brought to the bank but also what they took home was the majority of it.' Expenses: . Lily: 'They would put business dinners on expenses where the food was often thrown in for free because they had spent so much money on the alcohol. 'I saw one case where people ended up getting disciplined after spending £40,000 on a single meal for six people. 'Expenses were used on personal trips away, on things that definitely had no purpose for the business, and there was a very high emphasis placed on extravagance and glamour.' Bullying: . The more senior staff took pride in shaming newer recruits, seeing how long they took to break. Lily said: 'One of the senior management used to come into our department where he would trawl the floor, lifting the ties of different men to see what brand they were wearing. 'He was carrying a pair of scissors and if he didn't like the brand he saw, he would snip the tie off just under the tie knot. 'Then he would tell them to go shop in Hermes or somewhere similar and not in Marks and Spencer or Thomas Pink.'","Lily Temperley from London embarked on affair with powerful married man .

'I'm obsessed with Sophia and she is such a good baby that she can come everywhere with me,' Tamara said. Polished Tamara is even taking a more relaxed approach to her beauty regime now that she's a mother - and doesn't even wear make-up on her off days. She said: 'Since becoming a mother, I can get ready in 45 minutes and I'm a pro at fishtail plaits now because Sophia is such a hair destroyer.

Despite showcasing an enviably toned physique in recent months, Tamara has been so focused on little Sophia that she maintains she hasn't worked out since March. 'I haven't done any exercise since giving birth. I walk her in her pram around the park but other than that, I've done none,' she said. She does, however, plan on taking up more exercise next year. 'December is all about eating because it's cold and Christmassy but I will get back into my healthy regime in January; life is too short to say no to everything,' she said. 'It's my New Year's resolution to start pilates because my back is so stiff from carrying Sophia.' Tamara's first and foremost priority is her daughter Sophia, who she had in March with husband Jay Rutland . Next year is certainly looking bright for Tamara, who cites Sophia Loren and Brigitte Bardot as her beauty icons.

"Paul McGinley wants his Team Europe stars to be inspired to Ryder Cup victory by the words of the legendary Bob Torrance. The home captain, who dropped a minor selection bombshell by floating the idea of dissolving the Rory McIlroy-Graeme McDowell partnership, revealed on Monday that one of the recently-departed Torrance’s favourite quotes had been given pride of place in the European team room at Gleneagles. McGinley, a former pupil of the coaching great who passed away during this year’s Open Championship, said: ‘It’s just a simple message. It’s the last message they see before they leave the locker room and it’s a quote from Bob Torrance, who unfortunately passed away a couple of months ago, as we all know. The late, great coach Bob Torrance's words will be printed in the Team Europe locker room . Paul McGinley played under Torrance and hopes the legendary coach's words will inspire his team . ‘He used to say to every player on the range, as we walked to the first tee, he would shake your hand and say: “Happiest days of your lives.” And that’s the quote, that’s the last thing they will see as they leave the locker room.’ The fact that McIlroy and McDowell are involved on opposite sides of a contractual dispute involving McIlroy’s former management company has been repeatedly downplayed by McGinley, who again insisted yesterday that the pair being at loggerheads in court wouldn’t prevent him from pairing the Northern Irishmen together again. But, alluding to a points tally that belies the general view of the Rory-G Mac axis as a power duo, he said he may have good golfing reasons to break them up. Speaking about the court case, McGinley said: ‘It’s not an issue and it’s not been an issue for me in terms of Ryder Cup captaincy over the last year, certainly, since these court proceedings started. Both of them have assured me all along that there are no issues and that’s the way I’ve always seen it. World No 1 Rory McIlroy may not be paired with fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowell at the Ryder Cup . ‘Whether they come together or not is another story. Three or four months ago, I had a very strong view that they would have been but, the more I look at their statistics and the more I look at the different value I have with them, I’m thinking there may be a value in not doing it. ‘But if I don’t do it, it certainly won’t be because of any issues. As both of them have said, there are no issues between them and both of them will be happy to play together but it will be my decision ultimately. McIlroy could be partnered with Ian Poulter instead if McGinley opts for a different approach at Gleneagles . ‘I’ve got lots of options with them. But if I don’t decide to play them, it would be for tactical reasons. It won’t be for any other reasons. ‘They have played six Ryder Cup matches and they have only won two together. It’s not like these guys are written in stone. They are not a formidable fourball pairing that’s unbeatable. ‘Having said that, there’s no reason why they wouldn’t play together. When I was captain of the Seve Trophy I had them paired together and they played very well in that. So I’ve got lots of options with them - but it doesn’t have to be that they have to be together.’ VIDEO Pundits provide insight into potential pairings .","Paul McGinley reveals that Bob Torrance's mantra, 'Happiest days of your lives' will be printed in the Team Europe locker room .

"A new study has warned sugar is a greater enemy than salt, and is more likely to cause high blood pressure, stroke and heart disease . Sugars added to processed foods and fizzy drinks poses a greater threat to the heart than salt, it has been claimed. Doctors have called for dietary guidelines to focus more on the dangers of sugar, and less on salt. A new study warns added sugars - rather than than added salt - are likely to have a greater role in raising blood pressure, as well as triggering heart disease and stroke. In the fight to curb the prevalence of heart disease, the experts warn the dangers, particularly linked to fructose, must be highlighted. Heart disease is the number one cause of premature death in the developed world. And high blood pressure is its most important risk factor, accounting for almost 350,000 deaths in the US in 2009 and costing more than $50 billion each year. Dietary advice to help lower high blood pressure has historically focused on cutting salt intake. But the potential benefits of this approach are 'debatable', the authors of the new study said. They said the average reduction in blood pressure as a result of restricting salt intake, tends to be relatively small. Some evidence suggests that 3 to 6g of salt each day may be optimal for health - in fact, anything less than 6g is actually harmful. Most salt in a person's diet comes from processed foods, which also happen to be a rich source of added sugars, the scientists argue. 'Sugar may be much more meaningfully related to blood pressure than sodium, as suggested by a greater magnitude of effect with dietary manipulation,' the study found. 'Compelling evidence from basic science, population studies, and clinical trials implicates sugars, and particularly the monosaccharide fructose, as playing a major role in the development of hypertension (high blood pressure). 'Moreover, evidence suggests that sugars in general, and fructose in particular, may contribute to overall cardiovascular risk through a variety of mechanisms.' The researchers point the finger at high fructose corn syrup, which is the most frequently used sweetener in processed foods, particularly fruit-flavoured and fizzy drinks. The study states: 'Worldwide, sugar sweetened beverage consumption has been implicated in 180,000 deaths a year. Around 300 years ago, people only consumed a few pounds of sugar a year, they add, whereas current estimates suggest that average consumption in the U.S. is between 77 and 152lbs a year - equivalent to 24 to 47 teaspoons a day. The evidence suggests that people whose dietary intake of added sugars adds up to at least a quarter of their total daily calories have almost triple the cardiovascular disease risk of those who consume less than 10 per cent. And a daily intake of more than 74g of fructose is associated with a 30 per cent greater risk of blood pressure above 140/90 mm Hg and a 77 per cent increased risk of blood pressure above 160/100 mm Hg. Most of the salt in the diet comes from bread, processed meat, pickled foods and salt added during food preparation and at the table . A high fructose diet has also been linked to an unfavourable blood fat profile, higher fasting blood insulin levels, and a doubling in the risk of metabolic syndrome. Some dietary guidelines do include recommendations about daily intake of added sugars, but are not stringent enough, nor do they make specific recommendations about fructose, say the authors. And it's high time they did. Of particular concern, they say, is that UK and U.S. teenagers may be consuming added sugars up to 16 times the recommended limit. They emphasise that naturally- occurring sugars found in fruit and vegetables are not harmful to health. Eating fruit and vegetables is almost certainly beneficial. 'Just as most dietary sodium does not come from the salt shaker, most dietary sugar does not come from the sugar bowl. Reducing consumption of added sugars by limiting processed foods containing it, made by corporations, would be a good place to start,' said the authors at the Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Missouri. And they go on to warn: 'The evidence is clear that even moderate doses of added sugar for short durations may cause substantial harm.' Professor of cardiovascular medicine, Francesco Cappuccio, from the University of Warwick said high-sugar diets can contribute 'substantially' to cardiovascular disease. But he warned placing too great an emphasis on reducing sugar, and not salt, is 'disingenuous'. 'Both should be targeted at population level for an effective approach to cardiovascular prevention,' he said. Heart disease is the number one cause of premature death in the developed world.And high blood pressure is its most important risk factor, accounting for almost 350,000 deaths in the US in 2009 and costing more than $50 billion each year . 'Unlike sugar, salt is not a nutrient but a chemical added to food in recent evolutionary time. 'Our bodies need no more than a tenth of the salt we currently eat.' He warned there is 'absolutely no evidence' to support the authors' claims that lowering salt levels in processed foods could spark an increase in the consumption of starches and sugars. 'This shift in attention from salt to sugar is scientifically unnecessary and unsupported, and it reminds me of a well-rehearsed tactic used by industry and pseudoscience to divert public attention. 'It is inappropriate in a scientific publication.' He added: 'We must stop this false argument about reducing either salt or sugar. 'Both must be reduced if we are to meet the UN targets of a reduction of cardiovascular disease of 25 per cent by 2025.' But experts have warned both sugar and salt levels must be tackled together to reduce deaths from cardiovascular disease . Professor emeritus of nutrition and dietics at King's College London, Tom Sanders, echoed Professor Cappuccio's thoughts. He said the effects of added sugars are 'exaggerated' in the study. 'Cutting salt intake and losing weight will lower blood pressure, but the evidence for a direct effect of added sugar is tenuous,' he said. 'Most of the salt in the diet comes from bread, processed meat, pickled foods and salt added during food preparation and at the table. 'Salt intake has fallen in the UK as manufacturers have reduced the amount of salt added to food. 'This has also been accompanied by a fall in blood pressure. 'Added sugar intake is derived mainly from sugar-sweetened beverages, confectionery, cereal products (cakes and biscuits). 'As far as I am aware there is no evidence to show that blood pressure is lowered when sugar-sweetened beverages are replaced by artificial sweeteners. 'To add to the Christmas cheer, alcohol definitely increases blood pressure and is probably a bigger cause for concern.' Gaynor Bussell, dietitian and public health nutritionist, added that the study is not based on original work, 'nor has the evidence presented been balanced to include all evidence on the causes of hypertension'. 'It's not just sugar or salt that need addressing but also issues such as total calorie intake, fibre, fats and vitamin and mineral intake also,' she said. The study was published in the journal Open Heart.","Sugar added to processed foods and fizzy drinks is greater threat than salt .

"The 24th Bond film, Spectre, is due to start filming in the Austrian Triol over the next few weeks. Daniel Craig, along with other stars from the cast and crew, will be arriving in the ski resort of Sölden, in the Ӧtztal and Obertilliach, in the East Tirol region. Those who book in time might catch a glimpse of Daniel Craig, playing Bond for the forth time, darting about the alpine landscape. Filming for the 24th Bond film is due to start in the Austrian town of Obertilliach in the next few weeks, causing great excitement in the area . As the largest film production ever to be made in Tirol, the news is understandably causing a bit of a stir. Local authorities hope it will bring immediate economic benefits to the region and create future film-tourism opportunities. Other Spectre cast members include Ralph Fiennes, Christoph Waltz, Monica Bellucci and Lea Seydoux, with Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes (of American Beauty, Revolutionary Road and James Bond - Skyfall). Since January this year suitable filming locations for these scenes were surveyed around the world, including in Norway and Italy. Eventually, help from a mixture of the Location Austria (FISA Film Location Austria), local communities, tourist boards and mountain railway companies helped swing the balance in Tirol's favour. An aerial shot of Obertilliach in East Tirol shows the beautiful mountainous backdrop which drew film director Sam Mendes to the location . As a result Sam Mendes chose the locations of Oetztal and East Tirol to film. In August the production office was set up in Sölden, ready to co-ordinate the planned filming, which is scheduled to take place from mid-January to February 2015. A total of 22 filming days is planned in the Tirol, and at its peak the film crew will consist of 500 people, including 150 local filmmakers covering various positions. A total of 26,000 overnight stays will be generated for the region. In August a production office was set up in Sölden ready to co-ordinate the filming, which will take place from mid-January to February 2015 . Those who book quickly may see Daniel Craig or some of the many cast and crew who are staying in Ӧtztal and Obertilliach . The immediate economic effect will be large. It is estimated that – taking into account  production costs, accommodation and meals, as well as transportation and the salaries of local Tirolean filmmakers – €6 million, around £5million, will be spent in Tirol. 'I am very excited that the joint efforts, help and support will result in the most famous secret agent in the world on location in Ötztal and East Tirol,' says Josef Margreiter, Founder of Cine Tirol. 'The last Bond film, Skyfall, was watched by over 130 million in cinemas around the world. This fills us with great confidence that the action-packed scenes for the new Bond film will be seen by an audience of millions when the film is released in Autumn 2015 and that will make people want to visit the locations for themsleves in the Heart of the Alps.' Tirol is surrounded by Lienz dolomites and two large Austrian mountains: the Großglockner (12,500ft) and Großvenediger (12,000ft) A total of 22 filming days is planned in the Tirol, and at its peak the film crew will consist of 500 people, including 150 local filmmakers . Cine Tirol Director, Johannes Köck, reiterates: 'James Bond in Tirol is the ultimate accolade for Cine Tirol, as the driving force for the region of Tirol as a filming location: this movie will draw the attention of the entire film industry to our region and help facilitate the acquisition of further international follow-up projects. He also adds: 'Even though this will be the first time that agent 007 will be filmed in Tirol, there is an enduring connection between the most famous secret agent of all time and our region. Ian Fleming, the author of the Bond novels, lived in Kitzbühel in the 1920s and studied at a private school.' Solden in Oetztal is one of the most snow-sure ski areas in the Alps thanks to it's glacier but visitors can also enjoy hikes and tobogganing . Solden is one of the most snow-sure ski areas in the Alps thanks to its glacier and has over 140km of slopes. The idyllic resort is surrounded by Lienz dolomites with the two largest mountains in Austria; the impressive Großglockner 12,500ft (3,798 m) and  Großvenediger 12,000ft (3,674 m). It's also remained largely unspoiled by mass tourism, unlike elsewhere in the Alps. Alongside carving deep turns into pisted slopes, winter visitors can toboggan, hike or enjoy one of the resorts many restaurants. East Tirol borders the states of Carinthia in the east and Salzburg in the north, while it also shares borders with the Italian provinces of South Tirolin the west and Belluno (Region of Veneto) in the south.","Huge cast and crew due to arrive in the ski resort of Sölden, in the Ӧtztal and Obertilliach, in the next few weeks .

"There are few coaches in world football who can boast a better c.v. than Louis van Gaal but at the moment it looks like he is working from only one half of the coaching manual. As good as Manchester United looked going forward against Leicester, they looked just as bad in defence. There is no balance to their play and they are too easy to exploit. Van Gaal needs to fix these defensive frailties — and quickly. Robin van Persie (left) and Radamel Falcao look dejected during Manchester United's defeat by Leicester . Louis van Gaal wonders where it all went wrong after United threw away a two-goal lead against the Foxes . The weakness in United’s defence was apparent throughout the match. Daley Blind was the only non-defender not bombing forward the whole time. I felt really sorry for him: it was like he was on a boat with holes springing up everywhere and he was trying to empty out the water on his own with a small bucket. United just didn’t have enough players back and Ander Herrera in particular needs to learn to sit deeper. Of the front players, Wayne Rooney was the only one really tracking back, and that is unacceptable. United’s multi-million forward line need to be the first line of defence. I admire the fact Van Gaal is trying to stand by United’s attacking traditions but look at how Manchester City and Chelsea set up — you have to occupy all parts of the pitch, not just charge forward in search of goals. That’s why James Milner played instead of Samir Nasri for Manchester City against Chelsea — he’s less skilful but harder working and was terrific. Manchester United’s back four lack leaders and this image above from Match of the Day 2 is a fine example. Here, five United players are pointing to the two unmarked Leicester players in the penalty area, seemingly asking each other to take responsibility and pick them up. They have no sort of straight defensive line either . This shows United’s dismal attempt at organising their back line. The players marked 1 (Smalling), 2 (Blackett), 3 (Rojo) and 4 (Rafael) are United’s back four in the second half. But rather than standing in a straight line, looking to catch opponents offside, United’s players have formed a diamond. It sums up the lack of shape, communication and organisation. Louis van Gaal has a big job on his hands . Daley Blind (left) was left on his own in defence at times while Ander Herrera needs to learn to sit deep . Wayne Rooney (centre) was furious with his Manchester United defence as they capitulated at Leicester . Manchester United are worse off after Louis van Gaal’s first five league fixtures than they were at the same stage under David Moyes last season. 12th At this point last season, United were eighth and five points off the lead. They are currently 12th, eight points behind table-topping Chelsea. 4 Moyes's United never conceded more than four goals in a league game, and when they did ship four it was against eventual champions Manchester City. It gets worse for Van Gaal when you compare his fixtures to Moyes’s. The Scot faced Chelsea, Liverpool and Man City in his first five games. Only QPR and West Brom (8) have used more defenders than United’s seven this season. And Van Gaal’s defenders have averaged the fewest minutes on the pitch. It is going to take a long time to erase the memory of the Leicester defeat. Teams now know there is a weakness to exploit and that if you get at Manchester United, they will crack. They used to have an aura, they used to find a way to win or get lucky. Now, they are seen as being soft at the back. Just when it looked like United had turned a corner, all the failings have come back to haunt them. Leicester were superb and took advantage brilliantly but things have changed. In the past, one penalty being given against United was a miracle. On Sunday, there were two. Whatever Van Gaal is telling his team it is clearly not sinking in. The Dutchman seems to have all the answers after each bad result, telling us why they lost and what went wrong. Perhaps he should try coming up with solutions before games and equip his players better so they stop losing. He also needs to encourage the players to have a voice of their own, so they take responsibility on the pitch. Players need to cross that white line and think, ‘I’m on the pitch, not you, and I’m going to take charge’. At the moment it seems United’s players are just hearing Van Gaal’s voice as they play and not developing their own. I’m sure he will turn things round because he is such a successful coach but sometimes from the players’ perspective, less is more from your manager. One of Van Gaal’s biggest problems is the group of defenders he has to pick from. It is ludicrous that United allowed Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra — with a total of 1,134 appearances for the club — to all leave in the same summer. On top of that they have failed to bring in a dominant figure to replace these senior men, despite signing two left backs in Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo. Jamie Vardy peels away to celebrate after exposing United's defence to put Leicester in front on Sunday . Leonardo Ulloa fired home Leicester's fifth goal from the penalty spot to rub salt into United's wounds . Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra were all allowed to leave Old Trafford over the summer . An influential defender is vital for any team. From the back you can see the game unfold in front of you. You can cajole, you can demand a performance from your team-mates and you can encourage them. Brian Clough, Jose Mourinho and George Graham are just a few of the managers who built their teams from the back. Instead, United have a naivety in defence. Rafael is particularly guilty. Too often he’s involved in goals United concede and too often he is unreliable. He has played 158 times for United so he’s experienced but he needs to learn fast. Ferdinand and Vidic used to coach him through games. Now he needs to be a senior member of the back four. He’s not developing enough. When I was at Arsenal with all those great players in front of me weaving pretty patterns and scoring great goals, I felt that if I didn’t keep a clean sheet then I was on borrowed time. United’s defence need that attitude. They need to defend their goal like I did, thinking their futures depend on it. Chris Smalling (right) was expected to be a long-term replacement for Ferdinand and Vidic in defence . Luke Shaw (left) has struggled to make an impact while Marcos Rojo's best position is not yet known . The long-term replacements for Ferdinand and Vidic were supposed to be Chris Smalling and Phil Jones. But they were still second choice to the veteran defenders last season and they have not trained on. They perform like bit-part players, which is what they have been for a few years. They need to get a proper run in the team and be trusted because they can still be very good players. Indeed Van Gaal needs to choose his first-choice defence, and give the players time to develop together. Does he rate Luke Shaw? Is Rojo a left back or a centre back for him? These questions need answering. There is a silver lining in the form of Tyler Blackett. Yes, he was sent off and is learning the harsh realities of the Premier League. But he is strong with and without the ball, has a bit of nastiness about him — which I like — and has good pace and technical ability. He just needs to be stronger in the air and show his determination over 90 minutes, not just in flashes. Facing Jamie Vardy, who was a bit like Craig Bellamy — annoying to play against but outstanding — was tough. United are buying big players as they battle to avoid years in the wilderness like Liverpool experienced. But you can’t buy a determination not to be beaten and there isn’t enough of that at United right now.

"Britain’s MINI is to ‘go Dutch’, German owners BMW announced today. The news that MINIs are to be built in Holland came as the car giant announced it was investing a further £250million in its three UK Mini factories which will remain ‘the heart’ of the popular car. The new money will be invested in manufacturing operations by the end of 2015 at the German car maker's manufacturing plant in Oxford, steel body pressings operation at Swindon and engine plant at Hams Hall near Birmingham. Going Dutch: Britain's MINIs are to be built in Holland as BMW announces a £250million investment in its three factories in Oxford, Swindon and Birmingham . The firm said it would not create more jobs but would help safeguard and secure the 5,500 already there at the plants. The company also announced a boost in production with up to 10 different Mini models that will have potential for additional production capacity at Oxford. The moves were welcomed by Prime Minister David Cameron and Business Secretary Vince cable as a vote of confidence in Britain. But behind the UK investment it also slipped out that it was to build MINIs abroad with a ‘contract manufacturer’ at the Nedcar plant in The Netherlands to help cope with booming demand and lack of capacity in the medium term. MINI already builds the large MINI Countryman estate in Graz, Austria, in Austria in a contract deal with Magna Steyr. The move helps ease a production bottle neck but will also be viewed as a means for BMW not to put all its MINI production eggs in one currency basket. BMW said it always built close to its markets and that the MINI was a great blend of British heritage and BMW quality. Still British? The move to the Netherlands will help ease a production bottle neck . Harald Krueger, member of the board of management at Munich-based  parent firm BMW Group, said: ‘A year ago we announced a further investment of £500 million in our UK production network by 2014 and today we are announcing an additional £250 million, taking us through to 2015. This brings the total to £1.75 billion since 2000.’ He said: ‘Over the last 11 years, Mini has been a unique global success and the BMW Group has even greater plans for the future development of the brand.’ He added: ‘Plant Oxford has played a major role in this with cars being exported to over 100 countries around the world. 'This additional investment is great news for all our employees in the UK and shows the BMW Group's commitment to Britain as a vital manufacturing base for us.’ Referring to its plans to build MINIs in Holland, BMW said the extra volume for its growth plans for the Mini and the complexity of new models means that additional production beyond Oxford's maximum capacity was needed in the medium term and the company was now considering how to achieve this. Boost: Business Secretary Vince Cable said at the Oxford factory this morning that he welcomed the investment and it was a vote of confidence in Britain . ‘Our preferred option is to establish a contract manufacturer as a satellite production as close to our UK operations as possible, at the Nedcar plant in The Netherlands, with whom BMW is in discussions.' Mr Krueger said: ‘Oxford will provide special Mini production expertise for any new operation, particularly in the areas of dealing with the high complexity and customer individuality which Mini demands and in operating state-of-the-art, multi-model production lines. 'Just as Munich is the centre of the BMW world, Oxford is and will remain the home and the heart of Mini.’ Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'I am delighted that BMW has chosen to make such a significant investment in the UK. This demonstrates confidence in British manufacturing, provides a fantastic boost for the workforce, and shows we are making real progress in rebalancing the economy.’ Business Secretary Vince Cable, who is visited the Oxford factory said: ‘BMW's ambitious plans for Mini will ensure its UK sites at Oxford, Swindon and Hams Hall remain at the centre of Mini production worldwide. 'The investment of £250 million in addition to the £500 million last year demonstrates BMW's commitment to the UK and safeguards jobs for the future.’ Unite assistant general secretary Tony Burke said: 'This major boost in investment is tribute and reward for the dedicated and hard-working workforce at Oxford, Swindon and Hams Hall. ‘The British car industry is once again a ray of sunshine in gloomy times for British manufacturing. ‘The Government urgently needs to learn the lessons that the UK car industry has to teach and start supporting the wider manufacturing sector. ‘The UK has the potential to be a manufacturing success story if we had a government which was prepared to roll its sleeves up and intervene to support employers up and down the UK.’ The Oxford MINI  factory last year built 191,474  vehicles and has capacity for 250,000 MINIs a year. BMW builds 100,000 MINI Countryman models a year in Austria. The new Dutch factory is likely to build new  niche sports  models of the MINI though the firm said it was ‘too early’ to say which models and how many. BMW is providing more than 4,000 vehicles – including MINIs and bicycles – as part of its exclusive deal to provide transport for Olympic VIPs and athletes . BMW’s Olympic cars will have exclusive use of more than 250 miles of some of Britain's busiest roads which are to be specially reserved for elite Olympic VIPs. Up to 80,000 officials, sponsors, politicians and athletes - dubbed 'the Games Family' -  will be whisked seamlessly down specially reserved congestion-free lanes - stretch from London to as far as Weymouth in Dorset  and encompassing parts of the M25 - while millions of motorists sit in gridlock.","Firm lets slip Minis will be built in the Netherlands to cope with booming demand and lack of capacity .

"CLICK HERE to watch Radamel Falcao's Top 10 goals... It took just one moment of magic, one goal in his first training session as a Manchester United player, for Louis van Gaal to appreciate that Radamel Falcao could be an awful lot of money well spent. ‘When you can hire or buy a player like Falcao then I don’t have doubts because he is, for me, one of the best strikers in the world. When you see his record it is unbelievable,’ said Van Gaal at a press conference to unveil the 28-year-old Colombia striker. ‘At training he got one ball and it was in the goal. He confirmed it in his first training session with me. But when I say that, I put too much pressure on him and that’s not good.’ You can like our Manchester United Facebook page here . VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester United's new signings on joining the club and thoughts on Louis van Gaal . Reds revolution: Louis van Gaal (C) prepares to unveil his final two summer signings Radamel Falcao (L) and Daley Blind (R) at Old Trafford . Get shirty! Radamel Falcao (L) and Daley Blind (R) pose with the famous shirts as they are introduced at the Theatre of Dreams . Staying power: Monaco striker Radamel Falcao revealed that he would like to stay at Manchester United for many years . Will they make the difference? The signings of Radamel Falcao and Daley Blind took Louis van Gaal's summer spending to over £150million . Tunnel of love: Louis van Gaal leads Daley Blind and Radamel Falcao out on to the pitch at Old Trafford, a walk they will soon become used to . Theatre of Dreams: Manchester United's new signings take a look around the stadium where they hope to win over fans in weeks to come . United have spent £6million to ‘hire’ Falcao from Monaco this season, during which time the striker will earn £280,000 a week at Old Trafford. It will cost them another £46m to exercise an option to buy him outright next summer. Angel di Maria, Ander Herrera, Marcos Rojo, Luke Shaw and Daley Blind — whose appearance on Thursday was rather overshadowed by the man sitting to his left — also came through the door as part of a £150m summer spending spree. This has inevitably led to questions about United’s transfer policy under Van Gaal and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. That is unlikely to faze Falcao. After all, this is the fourth time he has moved clubs in the last five years. This time last year he was being paraded as Monaco’s record £48m signing. At least the former Porto and Atletico Madrid player expressed a desire to hang around a little longer this time. ‘I hope to stay many years in Manchester United and make history at this club,’ said Falcao, whose record of 220 goals in 356 career games compares pretty well against Danny Welbeck’s strike rate of 29 goals in 142 games — brought up rather surprisingly by Van Gaal yesterday. ‘When I was at Porto and Madrid I always wanted to improve and I dreamed about playing in a team like this,’ added Falcao. ‘It’s a new process and a new team. Some players have come and Manchester United are building a big team this season and future seasons. ‘I would like to be here and be part of the project. I am very happy to be here. It’s a big challenge for me for my career. I always dreamed to be in a club like Manchester United.’ Dawn of a new era: New signings Marcos Rojo (R), Angel di Maria (2R) and Ander Herrera (3L) join their United teammates for training at the Aon Complex . Colombian connection: Louis van Gaal speaks to Radamel Falcao after hinting he would like to sign the Monaco striker on a permanent deal . Last in: Versatile Dutchman Daley Blind (L) and free scoring Colombian Radamel Falcao were both signed by the club on transfer deadline day . Fighting fit? Radamel Falcao insists he has recovered from the cruciate ligament injury that forced him to miss the 2014 World Cup in Brazil . Falcao has made six appearances and scored two goals for club and country since rupturing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee playing for Monaco in a French Cup tie in January, but has yet to complete a full game. His brief appearance for Colombia as a substitute against Brazil in Miami on Friday took his total playing time to 217 minutes — an average of 38 minutes per game — but he insists he is fully recovered. ‘Yes, I feel well,’ he added. ‘I started to play two months ago with Monaco and I have improved in the last month a lot. I scored goals, and that is important to strikers. ‘I’m confident with my physical form and I’m comfortable with my knee. I feel good in myself.’ Questions have been raised about how Van Gaal can fit all his new signings into the same team alongside the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata, who has only been at United eight months since a £37.1m move from Chelsea. There could be up to four of them making home debuts against QPR on Sunday. Multi-talented: Daley Blind can play in a variety of positions across defence and midfield, although a central holding role is his preferred position . Dutch master: Louis van Gaal (C) speaks to his players during training, including defender Luke Shaw (R) who could make his debut against QPR . On the mend: Manager Louis van Gaal (R) will be pleased that Michael Carrick (L) has recovered from injury to take part in training . Falcao does not foresee any problems, however. ‘When you’re talking about settling in, when you’re talking about top-quality players, it makes settling in more easy,’ he added. ‘I think I will need not much time because Manchester United has very good players and it’s easier to play football. I’m used to life in cities like this. I don’t think I will have a problem adapting. ‘I see the club in a period of everyone needing to get to know one another. But they are top-quality players and very intelligent players who can apply what the coach has in mind for us on the field quickly. ‘In terms of where I play, that is something the manager will have to decide for me. ‘I’ve been fortunate to play at some big clubs all over the world in big games and finals. I would rather focus on enjoying my football and making the most of the opportunity United have given me. I tend to set myself personal targets and goals and that’s how players challenge themselves.’ Falcao was reluctant to talk about the other clubs linked with him this summer, including Real Madrid, Manchester City and Arsenal. All three teams are playing in the Champions League in United’s absence. For Falcao, it will be a fifth season in a row outside the European elite, but he does not expect to be kept waiting much longer. ‘It’s true, every player wants to play in the Champions League,’ he said. ‘This year it’s not possible in Manchester but we are confident that we will qualify next season. ‘I don’t want to talk about other teams. I can say that I’m very happy here and believe in this project. United are the best club for my style of play and I am sure it will be a great period for us in the future.’ Next generation: United youngsters Adnan Januzaj (L) and Luke Shaw (R) get to know each other ahead of United's next game against QPR . Made in South America: Argentinians Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo (R) are joined by Colombia international Radamel Falcao (L) Old school: Manchester United and England captain Wayne Rooney spaeks to Ryan Giggs (L) after returning from a successful international break . United’s new signing spoke mainly in broken English but answered a couple of questions from the South American media more fluently in Spanish. As he got up to leave at the end, Van Gaal grabbed him by the right arm and addressed his audience. ‘What do you think about his English?’ asked the former Barcelona coach. ‘Because I had the same situation in Spain. In my first year I spoke English, in my second year Spanish. And he is coming here and he is speaking English for you. Yeah, OK?’ It brought a round of applause but, for this kind of money, United supporters will expect Radamel Falcao to do his talking on the pitch.

"Zara Phillips may come across as the wholesome, down-to-earth outdoorsy type but it seems there's more to the royal than she lets on. The 32-year-old has revealed that not only has she read racy novel 50 Shades of Grey - she thought it was tame. 'Oh yes, I read it,' said the mother-of-one, before adding, slightly sarcastically: 'I thought it was goooood.' Scroll down for video . Fan: Zara Phillips, pictured here with husband Mike Tindall, admits she has read Fifty Shade of Grey . But not everything was quite to her taste. 'I think, when I read it I was expecting it to be amazing,' she continued. '[And then] it was a bit like, oh, is that it?' The royal, who is 15th in line to the throne, was speaking in an interview with the Telegraph to promote Owlient, a tech company that she fronts. Despite declaring her intention to put second-time motherhood on hold until after the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in 2016, Zara happily discussed her penchant for the naughty novel, which has sold millions of copies worldwide. She would not, however, reveal whether or not she plans to see the imminent film adaptation of the book, which is scheduled for release in February 2015 . Talented: Zara said she wants to leave having more children until after the Rio 2015 Olympics . Fit: Zara, seen with husband Mike, has had a fight on her hands to regain her athletes body after Mia's birth . Racy: 50 Shades of Grey raised eyebrows over its explicit sex scenes involving bondage . Instead, the royal's focus is on her eventing career and she hopes to improve on the team silver achieved at the London 2012 Olympics. She is also working on her fitness which, she says, took a hit following the birth of daughter Mia in January this year. 'After I had my daughter, I was very weak,' she says. 'Physically weaker but mentally weaker, too. Everything wasn’t 100 per cent. I wasn’t at my best, I hadn’t ever not ridden for that long. 'I didn’t realise how fit I was before and how many different muscles you use.' Now back to winning ways, the equestrienne has just over a year to go before the Olympics commence but has already begun a campaign to impress the Team GB selectors. Her most recent attempt came in August when, at the World Equestrian Games in Normandy, she managed to finish strongly - with a little help from her 13-year-old horse, High Kingdom. Speaking afterwards, she said: 'I wasn’t nervous. 'I knew what I was sat on. He’s just a fantastic horse and he just kept jumping and got me out of trouble. 'All credit to him, he was in charge really. I was just steering and trying to hang on.' The 33-year-old is now hotly tipped for for the Rio Olympics and has seen her career come on in leaps and bounds since the end of her more rebellious twenties. She does, however, still like to do things her own way, not least when she sold pictures of Mia to a celebrity magazine for a reported fee of £150,000. Senior officials at Buckingham Palace were not made aware of the lucrative deal with Hello Magazine in advance and were taken by surprise when the pictures appeared in March.","Zara has admitted to reading the enormously popular erotic novel .

"The Professional Footballers' Association has launched a major political drive for rule changes to ensure a minimum of four home-grown players in starting line-ups for every club match from the Premier League down. PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor met Jon Cruddas, the MP leading the Labour Party's policy review, on Monday to push the union's position aimed at increasing the number of English players at the top of the professional game. Taylor also plans to meet the Government to argue the case for quotas of home-grown players, with each starting XI having four with at least one trained by the club. James Milner was one of only four home-grown players on the pitch when Manchester City met Chelsea . Gordon Taylor says Milner's man of the match performance shows English players should get a chance . It would need the agreement of the Football Association, the Premier League and the Football League to bring in the rules, but winning political support from the main parties would be a big boost to the PFA. Taylor said FA chairman Greg Dyke's announcement of moves to reduce the number of non-European Union players in English football was welcome but 'a drop in the ocean' and that radical action is needed. Taylor told Press Association Sport: 'The key is starting on the field of play and to have at least four home-grown players of which one should be club-grown. With so much money going into youth development we need to see some return from that. 'Look at Sunday, there were only four English players in the Manchester City v Chelsea teams and the best player on the pitch was one of them, James Milner. 'We have a meeting with the head of the Labour Party's policy review about our concerns on youth development. The fall-out rate has been so high that if we were a university we would probably have been closed down. PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor complained that the fall-out rate for English talent is much too high . Greg Dyke has announce plans to limit the number of non-EU players but the PFA say it isn't enough . 'Unless we tweak the system with regards to quotas I don't see how that's going to improve. 'Earlier this month I saw England Under-19s draw with the German Under-19s who were the European champions - we were the best team and I was so impressed but you wonder what opportunities they are going to get in senior football. 'We will also be approaching the current Government on these issues as well.' Taylor also wants political support for the PFA's backing of the 'Rooney rule' to encourage more black and ethnic minority coaches - there is only one black manager in the 92 league clubs, Chris Powell at Huddersfield. The 'Rooney rule', used in American football, would oblige clubs to shortlist at least one black/ethnic minority candidate for each coaching position. Raheem Sterling is one of very few young English players who have broken through to first team football . Danny Welbeck had to move clubs after finding his path to first team football blocked by expensive imports . Taylor is also pushing for the FA board to include representatives from the PFA, fans and the League Managers' Association. The PFA chief said the FA's move to toughen up the work permit rules for non-EU players was to be welcomed but would only have a very limited effect on the number of English players in the top flight. He added: 'The fact is there are so many countries that are either in the EU, or have trade agreements that are permit-free, and then you have Argentinian players with passports from Spain and Italy, and Brazilians with Portuguese passports. 'It's just going to be a drop in the ocean.'","Footballers union wants at least four home-grown players in starting XI .

"Getting humans to Mars will be no easy feat - it will take upwards of nine months to get there, and a complex spacecraft will be needed to land on the red planet and return the astronauts home. But with a view to one day making the journey a reality, Boeing has released a video that shows the steps that will need to be taken to get there. They explain how two of the six pieces needed for Mars travel, Nasa’s SLS and Orion, are in production now - but we’ll need a much bigger spacecraft to make the dream a reality. Scroll down for video . Washington-based Boeing has revealed how to get to Mars. In a video they have outlined the six steps needed to land and return (illustrated). Two are already in production - the Orion spacecraft and SLS rocket. The other four things needed are a large 'tug' spacecraft, a habitat, lander and an ascent vehicle . 1. Orion (in production) 2. SLS rocket (in production) 3. Habitat (concept) 4. Mars ascent vehicle (concept) 5. Space tug (concept) 6. Inflatable heat shield (in testing) ‘Today somewhere out there in the world, in a classroom, somewhere between the age of 10 and 20, the person who’s going to be the first person to set foot on Mars is out there,’ explained Boeing’s director of Space Exploration Systems, Michael Raftery, in a video for Boeing. ‘And it’s really exciting to think what that person’s life will be like, and how they will live after this big mission.’ Boeing is heavily involved in a future Mars mission; as the prime contractor for Nasa’s huge Space Launch System (SLS), they are building the rocket which will be a necessity for getting to Mars. It’s not just technology that will be an issue with getting to Mars ; owing to the orbits of Earth and Mars there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place. Our planets come as close to each other as 33.9 million miles (54.6 million km), but can be as distant as 250 million miles (400 million km). For this reason spacecraft to Mars, such as the Curiosity rover, have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned. The next window is open from January 2016 to April 2016, and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet. For a future manned mission, they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in one, which will take two years in total. Just getting there will take seven or eight months. The astronauts will be there waiting for a year until they can come back. But SLS is just one piece in a complex six-piece puzzle that includes the recently launched Orion spacecraft. Nasa is committed to getting astronauts to Mars in the mid 2030s, and Mr Raftery explained that what is needed in the intervening 20 years will be proving ground missions to make it a reality. ‘It takes six pieces to get to Mars,’ he said. The current plan begins with SLS and Orion - these are the two pieces needed to escape and return to Earth. ‘If you’re going to go to the moon or farther you need a really big rocket to do that, and that’s what the SLS is all about,' he continued. Getting to Mars, though, will probably require ‘five or six’ SLS launches according to Mr Raftery. The next piece that will be needed is a deep space tug of some kind. This will be a large spacecraft that carries Orion and the other equipment. This deep space transportation system will be powered by huge solar panels and will probably use solar electric propulsion (SEP), or ion propulsion. ‘It uses the power from the sun to drive the propulsion system, so they look like large sailing ships,’ explained Mr Raftery. Attached to the sailing ship will be a ‘habitat’ where the crew will live. Although not specifically mentioned by Boeing, it’s thought this habitat may rotate in order to provide the crew on board with some form of artificial gravity, to prevent their bones degrading too much on their lengthy mission. Illustrated here is the entire spacecraft that may one day take humans to Mars. It would use solar electric propulsion (SEP), or ion propulsion, to get to the red planet. Giant solar panels will draw power from the sun, while a habitat (seen to the left of the spacecraft) would house the astronauts during the journey . A huge inflatable heat shield (illustrated), different from the one Orion used to return to Earth, will take astronauts safely to the surface of Mars. Nasa has been testing the technology for such a heat shield through their Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) programme . The crew will ride on the habitat on their way to Mars before detaching once they have reached their destination. Once arrived they will leave the habitat in orbit while the crew goes down to the surface. The last two pieces that are needed for the mission are a lander, and an inflatable heat shield. The huge inflatable heat shield, different from the one Orion used to return to Earth, will take them safely to the surface of Mars. Nasa has been testing the technology for such a heat shield through their Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) programme. Rockets will enable the lander to touch down on the surface after it drops the heat shield, ‘much like the lunar lander did on the moon’ said Mr Raftery. A mission to Mars will take about two and a half years. Astronauts will spend about eight months getting there and eight months back, and probably about a year on the surface (illustrated) ‘Today somewhere out there in the world, in a classroom, somewhere between the age of 10 and 20, the person who’s going to be the first person to set foot on Mars is out there,’ explained Boeing’s director of Space Exploration Systems, Michael Raftery (pictured) The Space Launch System heavy lift rocket (illustration shown) is being built by Boeing. It will be a necessity for a future manned mission to Mars, and will fly for the first time in 2019 . Eventually, once their operations on the surface are complete, they will use a ‘little rocket’ to return to the habitat in orbit and, ultimately, to Earth. Together, all of this infrastructure will allow a group of humans to take the first footsteps on Mars. And some, including Mr Raftery, believe this may be the first step to colonising the red planet and having a permanent human settlement there. ‘I think we’ll be able to colonise Mars some day,’ Mr Raftery concluded. ‘It may take hundreds of years, but that’s not unusual for humans. ‘It’s really about establishing a human foothold on the planet. It’s a natural evolution of humanity to take this challenge on.' Orion is one of the six pieces of the puzzle to get astronauts to Mars. It will be used to take astronauts out of Earth's gravity well, and return them home after the mission is completed. Last Friday it completed its first test flight, successfully entering into a high orbit before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean (shown)","Washington-based Boeing has revealed how to get to Mars .

"The chance of dying in a plane crash may been cut by advances in aircraft design, but a plane's growing reliance on technology is posing a new type of risk. Now, a group of industry heavyweights has warned that cybercrime is a serious threat to safety in the skies, and have vowed to fight the growing scourge before it causes a catastrophic incident. The warning follows a series of suspected attacks, including theories that the missing Malaysian Airline planes may have been hijacked by cyber criminals. Fear of flying: A group of industry heavyweights have warned that cybercrime is a serious threat to safety in the skies, and have vowed to fight the growing scourge before it causes a catastrophic incident . The International Air Transport Association (IATA) and the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) recently signed a new cyber security agreement, formalising their front against cybercrime. 'Our common goal in developing this agreement is to work more effectively together to establish and promote a robust cyber security culture and strategy for the benefit of all actors in our industry,' said Raymond Benjamin, secretary general of the ICAO. He added: 'As technologies rapidly evolve and become more readily accessible to all, cyber threats cannot be ignored. 'This is an important new area of aviation security concern and our global community will ensure that it is met with a strong level of commitment and response.' Risk: In theory, study shows a hacker could use a plane's onboard Wi-Fi signal or inflight entertainment system to hack into its avionics equipment, potentially disrupting or modifying satellite communication . Earlier this year, a chilling theory was put forward that the missing Malaysian Airlines plane could have been hijacked using a mobile phone or USB stick. An anti-terror said he believes the speed, altitude and direction of the aircraft could have been changed, simply by sending radio signals from a small remote device. A framework of 'codes' created by cyber terrorists would also be able to get into the plane's in-flight entertainment system and override the security software. It is also believed, once the systems have been successfully hacked, the plane could be landed by remote control. Panic: The tweet from hacker Lizard Squad in August was sent shortly after the person or group claimed credit for an attack on Sony's Playstation Network . A bomb threat in August seemingly targeting the president of Sony Online Entertainment forced an American Airlines flight from Dallas to San Diego to divert its path to Phoenix Sunday. The threat was posted to Twitter and specifically called out Sony Online Entertainment president John Smedley. '@AmericanAir We have been receiving reports that @j_smedley's plane #362 from DFW to SAN has explosives on-board, please look into this,' read the tweet from hacker 'Lizard Squad.' The threat came after the Sony Playstation Network service was taken down by 'an attempt to overwhelm our network with artificially high traffic,' the company said. The Dallas Morning News reported at the time that 'Lizard Squad' - which could be a single person or a collective - took credit for the hack. Sony maintains no personal data was compromised. Smedley later wrote on Twitter that his flight had been diverted but he did not comment on the bomb threat. While threats such as this are a concern to passengers, aviation chiefs have warned that far more sophisticated cyber attacks could be on the cards. The theory emerged as the search for flight MH370, which went missing eight months ago, continues to draw blanks. Dr Sally Leivesley, a former Home Office official, said: 'It might well be the world's first cyber hijack.' In August, a Berlin-based hacker claimed to have found a way to infiltrate communication systems on planes through Wi-Fi and inflight entertainment systems. Ruben Santamarta, a consultant with cyber security firm IOActive, said he discovered the vulnerabilities by 'reverse engineering' - or decoding - highly specialised software known as firmware, used to operate communications equipment. In theory, a hacker could use a plane's onboard Wi-Fi signal or inflight entertainment system to hack into its avionics equipment, potentially disrupting or modifying satellite communications. This could interfere with the aircraft's navigation and safety systems, Mr Santamarta said. 'Cyber terrorism may replace the hijacker and bomber and become the weapon of choice on attacks against the aviation community,' German insurer Allianz said in a review of aviation safety published last week. Exposing threats: Cybersecurity researcher Ruben Santamarta says he has figured out how to hack the satellite communications equipment on passenger jets through their WiFi and inflight entertainment systems .","Groups have signed international aviation agreement to fight cybercrime .

"Ipswich striker Conor Sammon decided against copying Frank Lampard and celebrated with glee after scoring against former club Wigan. Unlike Lampard, who stayed stony-faced after scoring for Manchester City against Chelsea on Sunday, Sammon rushed over to the Ipswich fans arms aloft after sealing a win that took Mick McCarthy's Tractor Boys up to seventh, only a point outside a play-off position. The 27-year-old was roundly booed by the home fans who remembered he scored only once for them in 18 months after being brought down from Scotland by Roberto Martinez. Ipswich striker Conor Sammon decided against copying Frank Lampard and celebrated  scoring against Wigan . Conor Sammon rushed over to the Ipswich fans after sealing a win that took Mick McCarthy up to seventh . Ipswich moved into seventh position, only a point outside a play-off position, but it's not so good for Wigan . Wigan Athletic: Carson 5.5; Boyce 6.5, Ramis 6, Kiernan 6; Perch 5.5; Kvist 5.5, Forshaw 6, Cowie 5.5; McManaman 5.5 (McClean 36), Delort 4.5 (Waghorn 72 6), Maloney 5.5 (Riera 64 6) Unused subs: Al Habsi (Gk), Tavernier, Taylor, Barnett .

Booked: Berra (22), Mings (39) Goals: Hyam (20), Sammon (63) Manager: Mick McCarthy 7 . Referee: Andy Woolmer 7 . Meanwhile, Wigan boss Uwe Rosler must hope chairman Dave Whelan is more patient with him than Owen Coyle, who was sacked after a similarly poor start last season. Wigan have declined steadily since winning the FA Cup at Wembley just over a year ago and started Monday night 17th in the Championship. To try and stop the rot, manager Uwe Rosler gave home debuts to three deadline day signings; French striker Andy Delort, his former Brentford midfielder Adam Forshaw, and Danish international William Kvist, who has been capped 48 times by his country. History was against visitors Ipswich who had never won at Wigan, but form was on their side after two consecutive victories, both with clean sheets. Their hardy fans who'd made the 475-mile round trip for a Monday televised game had something to shout about when Daryl Murphy tested Scott Carson with a fierce drive and  Sammon headed narrowly wide as the visitors started as brightly as their orange shirts. Their reward came after 20 minutes. David McGoldrick, who nearly joined Leicester City in the transfer window, crossed low from the left and Luke Hyam timed his run into the penalty area perfectly to convert from six yards. It was only the third goal of his career. Luke Hyam gives Ipswich the lead after 20 minutes as Wigan lose in the home Championship match .

Wigan Athletic were on the back foot from the get go and were put 1-0 down after just 20 minutes . A frustrated Scott Carson looks on after the Wigan goalkeeper could do little to stop Ipswich from going 1-0 up . Shellshocked Wigan tried to rally and winger Callum McManaman, their best player when they won the FA Cup, was taken out by Christophe Berra as he sprinted down the flank to chase a quick equaliser. Berra was booked and McManaman had a not-so-friendly word in his ear once he'd got up. The England under-21 international didn't fully recover and was replaced by James McClean after 36 minutes. And Wigan felt further aggrieved when Shaun Maloney was knocked over by Tyrone Mings when advancing on goal, the defender receiving only a yellow card. McCarthy and Rosler both had successful playing careers at Manchester City but it was the Wigan boss left feeling Blue when Forshaw failed to level with a 20-yard drive. Ipswich then added a second after 64 minutes when Sammon raced onto McGoldrick's pass. Sammon hit Carson with his first effort but the ball ricocheted to him kindly so he could tap in the rebound from close range.

"Felix Magath admits he told Brede Hangeland to use cheese to nurse his knee injury, but the former Fulham manager remains adamant the allegations are 'laughable'. Magath, sacked  on Thursday with Fulham currently bottom of the Championship, believes the accusations are because Hangeland is 'not performing on the pitch' and 'not in the spotlight'. Despite it being Danny Murphy who confirmed Hangeland was told 'to put a lump of cheese soaked in alcohol on his thigh and to leave it overnight' on Match of the Day 2 Extra, the German manager aimed his retaliation at the now-Crystal Palace player in question.

'He had an injury to the knee (inflammation) and I mentioned that he could try using an old technique of wrapping the knee with quark, which is used to decrease the inflammation. 'I would never tell a doctor how he should manage the injury to a player, but it seems that this story has been wrongly told and blown completely out of context.' Magath, replaced by Kit Symons at Fulham, labelled Hangeland's statements 'completely wrong'. He continued: 'It seems to me, that often players who are not performing on the pitch and are not in the spotlight, will make such ridiculous accusations. 'A world class player in the mold of Michael Ballack or Raul, would never ever make such statements, class speaks for itself.' Felix Magath says the accusations against his unorthodox methods on Brede Hangeland are 'laughable' VIDEO Magath gone from Fulham . And Magath hit back at his 'apparent tough handling' of the Fulham squad and staff, too. He added: 'Steve Wigley a former employee and ex-coach of Fulham and current coach of Nottingham Forest, who worked with me at Fulham, stated recently: ""I liked Felix, he was during my time with him, very good to me."" 'It is very important in my profession to be judged objectively, as I can imagine all of you would also expect. I have no problem with constructive criticism, but malicious gossip just goes too far in my opinion. 'And I will most certainly defend myself against a defamation of character, which is put out to damage my reputation.' Fulham currently sit bottom of the Championship, having lost seven of their eight matches so far, drawing the other.

"Birds can pose a real threat to aircraft leaving and arriving into airports. So the ingenious folk at Southwest Florida International Airport have employed a very capable new member of staff to take matters into her own paws. Meet Aero, a one-year-old border collie, is the fourth in a line of four-legged bird chasers employed by the airport in Fort Myers. One-year-old border collie Aero is Southwest Florida International Airport's new bird-chaser . In her day-to-day job, Aero stalks birds on the airfield, using her herding instincts to chase them away from the runway. 'She acts as a natural predator, as opposed to some of the other techniques we use,' said Derek Faulkner, a Lee County Port Authority operations agent who works with Aero. And the hard-working hound is unafraid of putting the hours in, working an eight-hour shift seven days a week - more than her human counterparts. The hard-working dog puts in an eight-hour shift seven days a week at the airport in Fort Myers, Florida . Aero, who cost $9,750 (approximately £6,200), including training, is rewarded with water breaks and rides in an air-conditioned fleet vehicle between bird chases, but unlike most employees, Aero doesn't get to take a holiday. According to her employers, the collie is more than happy in her role. 'She leads a plush lifestyle. And there's nothing bad in her employee file,' airport spokeswoman Victoria Moreland told News Press. Dog handler Derek Faulkner plays with Aero, who cost the airport  £6,200, including training . Methods used by airports to scare away birds include sirens, pyrotechnics and fake owls, and wildlife is kept away from danger zones by limiting the amount of trees and shrubs nearby. But Southwest Florida International is the only US commercial airport with a bird dog. According to statistics from the Federal Aviation Administration, wildlife strikes on commercial aircraft more than quadrupled between 1990 and 2013. The Fort Myers airport has averaged at 35 a year, with fewer than three  causing any damage to aircraft since they began using bird dogs in 1999, News Press reported.","One-year-old border collie, Aero, uses herding instincts to chase birds .

"Superbugs could claim the lives of 10 million people each year, as well as hundreds of trillions of dollars by 2050, a new report has warned today. Vicious infections resistant to drugs already kill hundreds of thousands of people across the globe every year. But a review by economist Jim O'Neill claims the trend is set to get worse if urgent action is not taken. Mr O'Neill heads the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, which was set up in July by Prime Minister David Cameron and publishes its findings today. Antimicrobials are a class of drugs that includes antibiotics, antivirals, antiparasitics and antifungals. Scroll down for video . The first paper from the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance, chaired by economist Jim O'Neill found 700,000 deaths across the world each year are attributed to resistance to antimicrobials - a class of drugs that includes antibiotics, antivirals, antiparasitics and antifungals . By 2050 the report estimates that number could soar to 10 millions if urgent action is not taken . The report cites an example of E.coli that has now become resistant to the last-resort antibiotics, carbapenems. It said there are no effective drugs currently available to treat patients with that strain of the disease. Mr O'Neill said the review team, which based its analysis on work by researchers RAND and auditors KPMG, will search for 'bold, clear and practical long term solutions' to tackle the problem. Further papers will be published in the coming years looking at various ideas including the potential for the use of alternative therapies and boosting the development of new drugs, before a final report in 2016. Mr O'Neill stressed the importance of nations across the world working together to avert the potential economic and health crisis. He said: 'Drug-resistant infections already kill hundreds of thousands a year globally, and by 2050 that figure could be more than 10 million. 'The economic cost will also be significant, with the world economy being hit by up to 100 trillion US dollars (£63.6 trillion) by 2050 if we do not take action. In 1928 a piece of mould fortuitously contaminated a petri dish in Alexander Fleming's laboratory at St Mary's Hospital. It produced a substance, later called penicillin, that killed the bacteria growing in the dish. Twelve years later Fleming and others had taken this finding and created the 'wonder drug' of their time, which could cure patients of bacterial infections. Further antibiotics were developed, revolutionising healthcare and paving the way for many of the most notable medical advances of the 20th century. The breakthrough meant illnesses like pneumonia and tuberculosis, which until then had been deadly, could be cured. A small cut no longer had the potential to be fatal if it became infected, and the dangers of childbirth and surgery were greatly reduced. In recent years, advances in antiviral medications, have transformed HIV from a probable death sentence into a largely manageable lifelong condition. But bacteria and other pathogens are constantly evolving to resist new drugs. Resistance is increasingly becoming a problem, because the pace at which scientists are discovering new antibiotics has slowed drastically, while antibiotic use is rising. It is a problem not solely confined to bacteria, all microbes have the ability to mutate to beat drugs. The great strides made in the past could be reversed, with diseases including malaria, TB, pneumonia once again spiralling out of control. 'We cannot allow these projections to materialise for any of us, especially our fellow citizens in the Bric (Brazil, Russia, India and China) and Mint (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey) world, and our ambition is such that we will search for bold, clear and practical long term solutions.' He told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, 'whatever we do in the UK, we are not going to solve the problem on our own', adding that the picture 'gets bleak' if the world does not take steps to counter the problem. As well as stressing the importance of international cooperation, he suggested that an 'innovation fund' could help with the huge costs involved in developing new medicines. Politicians and scientists have warned of the need to find a cure for infections that have become resistant, with Mr Cameron this year stating it was a 'very real and worrying threat' that could send medicine 'back into the dark ages'. Professor Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, said the latest research is 'compelling'. She said: 'We all know that antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is important. 'This is a compelling piece of work, which takes us a step forward in understanding the true gravity of the threat. 'It demonstrates that the world simply cannot afford not to take action to tackle the alarming rise in resistance to antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs we are witnessing at the moment. 'I look forward to the ideas that Jim will recommend in due course for how we can begin to turn this tide globally.' Professor Anthony Kessel, director for International Public Health at Public Health England, said 'if ever we needed a reminder of what a public health catastrophe looks like, then this has to be it'. 'Stopping resistance developing should be straight forward: prescribing the right antibiotic for the right infection for the right time and stopping infections spreading by practicing good infection control,' he said. 'However, in reality this can be difficult to achieve, particularly in countries where antibiotics are freely available or there is lack of sanitation and healthcare is limited. 'For bacteria, the development of resistance to antibiotics is a natural evolutionary process in terms of survival. Among those bacteria that are already showing worrying signs of resistance is E.coli, pictured, which is responsible for causing food poisoning. It has now become resistant to the last-resort antibiotics, carbapenems, the report states . The report, published today, predicts  the world economy will be hit by up to 100 trillion US dollars (£63.6 trillion) by 2050 if we do not take action . 'You cannot undo that process only manage it. Once resistant bacteria are widespread in the population; in the healthcare setting or in the environment a strident response is required. 'Given that bacteria can grow and mutate at a considerable rate, we have to be swift and decisive in our response.' Nick Stern, president of the British Academy, IG Patel professor of economics and government at the London School of Economics and former chief economist of the World Bank, said the review is profoundly important in tackling a huge challenge for the future. 'Wise policy looks ahead and tries to manage risks, particularly the big ones,' he said. 'There can be no doubt now that antimicrobial resistance is one of the biggest that we, all of us, face. 'The work of the group led by Jim O'Neill is of profound importance and this paper shows very convincingly the great scale of the risks, in terms of human lives and the economy, that are posed by this deeply worrying phenomenon.' David Heyman, head of The Chatham House Center on Global Health Security, said the world was already in 'dire straits' adding that there had been examples of people who could not be treated for malaria and who were having problems being treated for HIV. He also pointed to the need to work with the plant and animal industries, which also use large quantities of antibiotics. As well as the need to develop antibiotics and vaccines, he stressed the importance of carrying out 'point of care' diagnostic tests before treatment.","Review on Antimicrobial Resistance published its first report today .

Pascal and Sony have refused to comment on the leaked emails, though Rudin did give a statement to the New York Times. 'This is not about salacious emails being batted around by Gawker and Defamer,' the disgraced producer said on Wednesday. 'It’s about a criminal act, and the people behind it should be treated as nothing more nor less than criminals.' Racist comments: Pascal asks Rudin if she should talk with President Obama about the 2012 slavery film Django Unchained (above) Racist response: Rudin suggests that Pascal maybe talk with the President about 12 Years a Slave (above) Not good: The email exchange also finds Rudin commenting that President Obama 'likes Kevin Hart' In other leaked emails, these having to do with Rudin's upcoming Steve Jobs biopic Jobs, screenwriter Aaron Sorkin has some not so kind words for the man now set to star in the film, Michael Fassbender. 'I don't know who Michael Fassbender is and the rest of the world isn't going to care,' Sorkin tells Pascal when informed of the studio's desire to cast the actor, who also starred in 12 Years a Slave. Cyber attackers breached Sony's computer network on November 24. North Korea has denied any involvement in the attack, despite their anger over Sony's planned movie 'The Interview'. Hackers released online several upcoming Sony movies including the family hit Annie. The personal details of thousands of employees were also released. Hackers also revealed the various aliases used by celebrities when they book into hotels to protect their anonymity. Dozens of highly embarrassing emails were released - including one which described Angelina Jolie as a 'minimally talented spoiled brat'. Another email claimed 'nobody' knows the identity of Hollywood star Michael Fassbender, though one man does praise the size of his genitalia. One man who is clearly a fan of Fassbender however is producer Michael De Luca, who says of the Irish actor in one email, 'He just makes you feel bad to have normal-sized genitalia.' On a more innocuous note, another email exchange released on Tuesday involving Sony Pictures Television president Steve Mosko revealed that Community star Joel McHale was trying to get a discount on an $8,000 Sony television shortly after his show Community was originally cancelled by the studio after five seasons on the air. According to a report on BuzzFeed the emails formed part of the November 24 cyber attack on Sony Pictures. As for the fundraising event, which took place last November, President Obama did indeed talk about the film industry, saying: 'Believe it or not, entertainment is part of our American diplomacy. 'If they’re watching an old movie — Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,The Mary Tyler Moore Show, or Will and Grace and Modern Family — they’ve had a front-row seat to our march towards progress. Even if their own nations haven’t made that progress yet.' According to public records, Pascal donated $5,000 to President Obama's re-election campaign and gave a further $30,800 to the Democtratic National Committee. Obama made no mention of the films Django Unchained, 12 Years a Slave, Lee Daniels' The Butler, Think Like a Man or Ride Along in his speech at the event. Clint Culpepper, pictured, described Kevin Hart as a 'whore' after the star wanted more money . Actor Kevin Hart, was branded 'a whore' by a senior Sony Executive after the star asked for more money to promote a new movie.. The email exchange between Sony studio executive Clint Culpepper and Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal and Sony Entertainment chief executive officer Michael Lynton, was leaked following a major cyber attack on the company. According to Gawker: 'I'm not saying he's a whore, but he's a whore.' The email continued: 'It's not as if we paid him 3M and 4M respectively for his last 2 films thinking he might be nominated. We paid for his ability to open a film which included his social media savvy. 'I feel like this is something that should be negotiated going into the film as opposed to after the fact. It feels tantamount to buying a car and then upon picking it up being told that the engine will cost extra. I'm tempted to suggest we call his bluff. 'If he doesn't do his normal routine, his film will not open as well and his brand will appear diminished and he will- in fact - be f****** himself because we have his next 2 immediate films. And then there's the social media precedent we're setting...especially in light of the fact that Channing is at the same agency.'","Scott Rudin and Amy Pascal mock President Obama in a new series of emails that have been released .

"SpaceX has long spoken of its ambition to make rockets reusable. And on Monday, the firm plans to reach a major milestone as part of this endeavour when it brings back part of one of its Falcon 9 rockets after launch. If all goes to plan, the first stage of the rocket will gently lower itself and land on solid ground for the first time ever. SpaceX is planning to land a rocket at Cape Canaveral on Monday. The first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket will attempt to touch down on a barge (illustration shown) after launching a Dragon capsule into space. It is the first ever attempt at landing a rocket on solid ground after launch . The attempt will occur during the launch of the latest cargo-carrying Dragon capsule to the ISS at 7.31pm GMT (2.31pm EST) on Monday 16 December. The Falcon 9 rocket carrying Dragon will take off from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. After launch, at a height of about 56 miles (90km), the first stage of the rocket will separate from the second stage. While the latter continues its mission into orbit, the former would usually be left to fall back into the ocean - as is the case on all other rocket launches. However on this flight, for the first time ever, SpaceX will instead use a specially designed first stage capable of landing itself on a floating barge. In a previous flight, a Falcon 9 first stage hovered above the surface of the ocean - without a barge - in a successful demonstration of the technology. On that flight, the first stage was left to fall into the ocean after proving it could hover above the ground. But on this next flight, the rocket will touch down on a floating barge. The upgraded Falcon 9 v1.1 has engines that are 60 per cent more powerful than previous versions . Private spaceflight company, SpaceX, successfully launched the first of its newly-improved Falcon 9 rockets in September. The nine-engine rocket is its most powerful to date and designed to test the viability of using fully reusable launch vehicles for future missions. Currently, after delivering their payloads into orbit, booster rockets tumble back toward Earth and essentially explode mid-air before crashing into the sea. This is a costly operation causing the price of launches to top £280 million ($440 million). SpaceX, however, is attempting to develop rockets that can make soft landings back on Earth so they can be recovered and recycled. After September's launch, three first-stage engines were reignited, to see if they could bring the first-stage of the rocket segment down through the atmosphere intact. Another engine was then used to try to slow the stage still further just before it touched the water. 'The most revolutionary thing about the new Falcon 9 is the potential ability to recover the boost phase, which is almost three-quarters of the cost of the rocket,' said SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. The incredible attempt will occur during the launch of the latest cargo-carrying Dragon capsule to the ISS at 7.31pm GMT (2.31pm EST) on Monday 16 December, from Florida’s Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Pictured is a previous Falcon 9 launch on 14 July 2014 . Grid fins (seen here) on the side of the first stage of the rocket will keep it steady as it descends to Earth, while it will save 15 per cent of its initial fuel in order to lower itself slowly to the ground . The barge measures about 300 feet (90 metres) long by 100 feet (30 metres) wide, and also has wings that extend out to another 170 feet (50 metres). According to SpaceX chief Elon Musk, it also has ‘thrusters repurposed from deep sea oil rigs’ that can hold it in position within 10 feet (three metres) even in a storm. To control the rocket as it lands, grid fins on its side are used, which control its pitch, yaw and roll. These are ‘stowed on ascent and then deploy on re-entry for “X-Wing” [from Star Wars] style control,’ according to Musk. And to slow it down as it descends it will save 15 per cent of its original fuel, allowing it to lower itself towards the ocean without the use of a parachute. The barge (shown) measures about 300 feet (90 metres) long by 100 feet (30 metres) wide, and also has wings that extend out to another 170 feet (50 metres) However, as the mission has never been tried before, he added that there was only a 50 per cent chances of the platform landing being a success on this first attempt. Whatever the outcome, though, SpaceX will use the data they glean to improve their technique and one day plan to perform this manoeuvre during every launch. Cameras on board the barge will capture the entire descent, although it’s unclear how much - if any - of this footage SpaceX will make public. Eventually, they will start bringing the upper - or second - stage of the rocket back as well. The ultimate goal is to make the entire rocket reusable - which will drastically reduce the cost of going to space. SpaceX has a £1billion ($1.6 billion) contract with Nasa to resupply the ISS. This launch of the Dragon capsule will be the fifth of 12 scheduled missions. Elon Musk (pictured) said the ambitious attempt has a 50 per cent chance of working. SpaceX ultimately wants all of its rockets to be reusable in order to reduce the cost of going to space .","SpaceX is planning to land a rocket at Cape Canaveral on Monday .

"There are countless optical illusions that make objects appear to spin, change colour and move of their own accord - but this may be the most powerful one yet. The video creates what is known as a motion after-effect (MAE) and is a phenomenon often called the ‘waterfall illusion’ after being spotted at a waterfall in Foyers, Scotland in 1834. It causes cells in the brain that are sensitive to a certain direction of movement to tire, which then activates the cells that respond to the opposite direction. This makes stationary objects appear to move. Warning: Video below contains images that can cause strong natural hallucinations . The video (grab pictured) creates what is known as a motion after-effect (MAE). It causes cells in the brain that are sensitive to a certain direction of movement to tire, which then activates the cells that respond to the opposite direction. This makes stationary objects appear to move in that opposite direction . The illusion itself isn’t new. It was first referenced in ancient Greek texts, although the origin is debated. Many scientists agree Aristotle first mentioned the visual illusion in his Parva Naturalia, but the correct direction was said to be first reported by Lucretius in his poem De Rerum Natura. The first clear description of the motion after-effect was recorded by Jan Evangelista Purkyně in 1820, who observed it after looking at a cavalry parade. Robert Addams then observed and reported the effect in 1834 while watching a waterfall at Foyers in Scotland. This demonstration was created from a view of the Falls of Foyers. Mr Addams noticed that the effect can be seen when staring at a waterfall while keeping eyes steady. The motion after-effect (MAE) can be explained by changes in visual neurons that respond in certain ways to moving parts within an image. In the brain, there are cells are tuned to respond to different features and directions of an image or stimulus. For example, there are cells in the brain that are sensitive to motion in a clockwise direction, but there are also cells that are sensitive to motion in the opposite direction. When there is no movement within an image, these cells produce roughly the same response. But, in the case of a simple MAE illusion, as the circles spin in a clockwise motion, the cells that are sensitive to this direction use energy and become tired. When the spinning stops, the cells sensitive to motion in an anti-clockwise direction take over and become active - in a bid to restore the balance. This causes even stationary items to look like they’re moving in that opposite direction for a short time. Versions of the spiral were then used in 1849 by the Belgian physicist Joseph Plateau. During the video the outer rings spin anti-clockwise. A five-point shape features rings that move clockwise, while letters appear in the centre. There is also another spinning circle around the letters. The motion after-effect (MAE) can be explained by changes in visual neurons that respond in certain ways to moving parts within an image. In the brain, there are cells are tuned to respond to different features and directions of an image or stimulus. For example, there are cells in the brain that are sensitive to motion in a clockwise direction, but there are also cells that are sensitive to motion in the opposite direction. When there is no movement within an image, these cells produce roughly the same response. But, in the case of a simple MAE illusion, as the circles spin in a clockwise motion, the cells that are sensitive to this direction use energy and become tired. When the spinning stops, the cells sensitive to motion in an anti-clockwise direction take over and become active - in a bid to restore the balance. This causes even stationary items to look like they’re moving in that opposite, anti-clockwise direction for a short time. The longer the spinning, the more fatigued the clockwise cells get, and the more the opposite cells will be active to try and correct the imbalance of energy. In the case of this video, uploaded by Science Forum, focusing on the letters causes the cells to stay tuned on the motion. The variety of motions throughout the clip causes the cells to tire at different speeds, and the length of the clip combines to create an illusion that causes objects to move in a variety of directions. When looking directly at a ring, our brains notice the motion of the spots, not the stripes inside the spots. As a result the circles move anticlockwise. When looking at a ring in the peripheral vision, the brain processes the motion of the stripes, and the circles move in the same direction, which in this case is clockwise . And it explains why the affect can last for a significant time. The video does come with a warning that the affect can last for a ‘few seconds’ but this can be longer. It is thought that stationary black and white so-called ‘afterimages’ originate in nerve cells in the retina. The motion after-effect was first referenced in ancient Greek texts, although the origin is debated. Many scientists agree Aristotle first mentioned the visual illusion in his Parva Naturalia, but the correct direction was said to be first reported by Lucretius in his poem De Rerum Natura. The first clear description of the motion aftereffect was recorded by Jan Evangelista Purkyně in 1820, who observed it after looking at a cavalry parade. Robert Addams then observed and reported the effect in 1834 while watching a waterfall at Foyers in Scotland. This demonstration was created from a view of the Falls of Foyers. Mr Addams noticed that the effect can be seen when staring at a waterfall while keeping eyes steady. This means that these afterimages don’t transfer from one eye to the other. But, research on monkeys revealed that neurons that respond to visual motion and direction take place in the primary visual cortex. This suggests the motion after-effects are due to cortical, and not retinal, processing. Another similar illusion that uses directional cells is called Rotating Reversals. The trick was originally presented at the Society for Neuroscience conference in 2008 and is so famous, neurologists, psychologists and philosophers have been studying why these visual 'changes' seem to occur for years. There are two sources of visual motion present in the illusion. This includes the circles themselves, and stripes within each circle - known as what’s called ‘first’ and ‘second order’ motions. The black and white stripes in the spots move around an axis, and these spots move around the central dot. The stripes on the left-hand, or red, side are moving in the same direction as the spots, but on the right-hand, or yellow, side the stripes and spots move in opposite directions. Looking directly at a ring of circles, our brains notice the motion of the spots, and not the stripes, and as a result the circles move anticlockwise. In this instance, the stripes appear to flicker rather than move. However, when looking at a ring in the peripheral vision, the brain process the motion of the stripes within the spots, and the circles appear to move in the same direction as the stripes, or clockwise. In the case of a simple MAE illusion, as the circles spin in a clockwise motion, the cells that are sensitive to this direction use energy and become tired. When the spinning stops, the cells sensitive to motion in an anti-clockwise direction take over. This causes even stationary items to look like they’re moving . The motion after-effect was first referenced in ancient Greek texts, although the origin is debated. The Greeks were said to have used optical illusions in their architecture, including the Pantheon (pictured). Each of the columns was built with a slight bulge in the middle, to make them appear straight and uniform .","The illusion causes what’s known as a motion after-effect (MAE)

"The one-eyed terrorist who masterminded the murder of six Britons in Algeria has been killed, it was claimed today. Mokhtar Belmokhtar – nicknamed Mr Marlboro after amassing a fortune by smuggling cigarettes and drugs across the Sahara – is said to have died along with 14 of his men in an attack by soldiers on a mountain stronghold. DNA tests are being planned to check the Al Qaeda fanatic really is among the dead, and that he did not manage to slip away during the gun battle in northern Mali. Mokhtar Belmokhtar, the leader of  the group that claimed to have taken around 41 hostages at the British Petrolium (BP) Gas Field in Algeria, has been killed in Mali . Belmokhtar, sometimes known as ‘the Uncatchable’, became one of the world’s most wanted men after directing the January attack at the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria. Six British hostages were among more than 60 who died. France has since redoubled its military efforts against Islamist rebels who had taken over neighbouring northern Mali. On Saturday, troops from Chad, who are assisting the French, stormed a cave encampment in the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains. It was announced today on Chadian TV that Belmokhtar, believed to be in his 40s, had been killed in the attack. A French Army source said: ‘The Chadians are positive they have killed Belmokhtar, but there is no absolute verification.’ Chadian armed forces spokesman General Zacharia Gobongue said in a statement read on national television: 'Chadian . armed forces operating in northern Mali completely destroyed a terrorist . base. 'The toll included several dead terrorists, including their . leader Mokhtar Belmokhtar.' Chadian troops are fighting Islamist militants in Mali as part of an international force led by France. Belmokhtar's death will be a major . blow to Islamist rebels in northern Mali who have been pushed into their . mountain strongholds by the French and African forces. The terrorist leader was an influential figurehead for the rebels and is said to have masterminded the attack at a gas plant in Algeria that led to the hostage crisis in January which claimed the lives of six Britons. A total of 37 foreign workers died at the remote oil facility - part-operated by BP - which was overrun by heavily-armed terrorists on Wednesday January 16. Some 22 Britons escaped the attack, which took place between January 16 and 19. Some 29 of the hostage-takers died, while three were captured by Algerian troops during a special forces mission to end the four-day stand-off. Belmokhtar had been sentenced to death in his absence in his home country of Alergia twice - in 2008 for murder and 2012 for acts of terrorism. It is believed Belmokhtar first became interested in jihad as a schoolboy before travelling to Afghanistan to support the mujahadeen fighting in the Civil War. He later joined the Islamist GIA fighting in the Algerian Civil War where he lost his left eye while mishandling explosives. His reputation as a 'gangster-jihadist' involved in arms and cigarette smuggling earned him the nickname 'Mister . Malboro' among locals in the Sahara. Belmokhtar then became a commander in the Mali-based Islamist Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb before heading his own Islamist organisation, dubbed the Al-Mulathameen or Masked Brigade. It was this group that claimed responsibility for the Algeria gas plant attack.

In fear of their lives: Hostages put their hands up, in dramatic footage of their ordeal broadcast on Algerian TV . Victim: Sebastian John, pictured left, was one of six British workers killed in the Algeria hostage crisis in January . In a chilling video message filmed at the height of the crisis, Belmoktar said: 'We in Al Qaeda announce this blessed operation. The ruthless Al-Qaeda kingpin behind the Algerian hostage crisis, Mokhtar . Belmokhtar, is said to have once employed a 3ft 6ins-tall killer named . 'Mohamed the Dwarf' during a terror campaign in the 1990s. One-eyed . fanatic Belmokhtar, 40, who has a son named after Osama bin Laden, . reportedly used the axe-wielding dwarf to slit the throats of 31 victims . and behead them in public in the 1990s. At the time Belmokhtar . was a commander in the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria, known as the . GIA, and used the dwarf as part of his failed campaign to impose a . strict Islamic government in Algeria. Hundreds . of executions are believed to have been carried out by the axe-wielding . dwarf who murdered men, women and children after they had been dragged . from their beds. The dwarf and 50 heavily-armed extremists once dragged entire families into the street and forced them to line up for execution. A . survivor said: 'No one was allowed to speak as they were dragged out . into a back street. Then the victims were made to stand in a queue to be . killed. 'At the head of the line was a dwarf, wearing a canvas hood and a scarf covering his face. 'He had a large knife in one hand and an axe in the other. 'As people were brought forward he slit their throats then chopped off their heads with the axe.' The carnage then continued until an army patrol arrived and the terrorists fled. In . another massacre, the dwarf is said to have hacked the heads of 86 . people in a single night. There are no reports of the tiny butcher ever . having been caught. 'We are ready to negotiate with the West and the Algerian government provided they stop their bombing of Mali's Muslims.' The latest clash comes just one day after reports that another senior Al-Qaeda member was killed in Northern Mali. Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, a senior commander in Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), was killed among 40 other Islamist fighters four days ago in the foothills of the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains. Speaking on Friday, Chadian President . Idriss Deby said his forces 'killed two jihadi leaders, including Abou . Zeid,' but did not give any further details. Algerian national Abdelhamid Abou Zeid, whose real name was Mohamed Ghadir, was one of the top three commanders in AQIM. The former smuggler turned jihadist is . believed to be behind the kidnapping of more than 20 Westerners in the area over the last five years, and is thought have executed British national Edwin Dyer in 2009. French and Chadian troops have been hunting AQIM fighters in the mountains on the border to Algeria after a lightning campaign to dislodge them from northern Mali. France's . Elysee presidential palace has declined to comment on the AQIM leader, . but a French army official confirmed that about 40 Islamists had been . killed in heavy fighting over the last week in the mountainous Tigargara . region. The official said 1,200 French . troops, 800 Chadian soldiers and some elements of the Malian army were . still in combat to the south of Tessalit in the Adrar mountain range. Ten logistics sites and an explosives factory had been destroyed in the operation as well as 16 vehicles, she said. France launched the assault to retake . Mali's vast desert north from AQIM and other Islamist rebels after a . plea from Mali's government to halt the militants' drive southward. The . intervention swiftly dislodged rebels from northern Mali's main towns . and drove them back into the surrounding desert and mountains, . particularly the Adrar des Ifoghas. Serious blow: Abou Zeid, one of the leaders of  Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), was killed by French and Chadian troops in the mountains in northern Mali . Confirmed: Abou Zeid was among 40 militants killed four days ago in the foothills of the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains, pictured, the president of Chad said .

"He brought the world the brink of nuclear war but that hasn't stopped the former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro from being awarded China's version of the Nobel Peace Prize. Hailing the aging revolutionary icon's 'important contributions' to world peace, he was selected to win the Confucius Peace Prize, the state-run Global Times newspaper reported. 'While in office, Castro didn't resort to violence or force to settle disputes in international relations, especially with the United States,' the paper wrote, seemingly forgetting the Cuban missile crisis. Scroll down for video . Cuban leader Fidel Castro was awarded the Confucius Peace Prize China's version of the Nobel Peace Prize, on Tuesday. He was praised for his 'important contributions' to world peace . Pictured with former Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, when Castro allowed the Soviet Union to build sites for nuclear missiles on Cuban soil, it sparked a 13-day confrontation with the United States. It is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating in a full scale nuclear conflict . Castro now 88-years-old, rarely makes appearances in public. He did not attend the Confucius Peace Prize award ceremony. A Cuban exchange student accepted the award on his behalf . The 13-day confrontation with the United States arose after Castro allowed the Soviet Union to build sites for nuclear missiles on Cuban soil in 1962. It is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full scale nuclear conflict. 'After his retirement, he has been actively meeting with leaders and groups from all over the world and has made important contributions to emphasising the need to eliminate nuclear war,' the Global Times continued. A total of nine judges from a panel of 16 experts and scholars picked the 88-year-old to win, it added . However, the former communist leader who has been looking increasingly frail in recent years, did not collect the award in person. A Cuban exchange student received the prize on his behalf at the ceremony on Tuesday, one day before Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi accepted their Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo. Miss Yousafzai became a household name after her campaigning for girls' right to education led to an assassination attempt by the Taliban two years ago, and has worked tirelessly as a human rights campaigner following her recovery. Castro was given the award a day before Malala Yousafzai was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Here, the-17-year-old from Pakistan receives her  award from Chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Thorbjorn Jagland . Malala was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with Indian children's rights advocate Kailash Satyarthi. Here they hold up their  medals during the award ceremony . She currently lives with her father, mother and two brothers in Birmingham, attending a local school. Castro who ceded power to his brother Raul in 2008 after a nearly fatal health crisis in 2006, has kept a low profile in recent years. It even fuelled rumours that he may have died but he has made short occasional appearances. He has also written books and articles for the official press in Cuba. Besting more than 20 nominees to win the Confucius Peace Prize, he beat other candidates including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and South Korean President Park Geun-Hye, the Global Times reported. Previous winners of the five-year-old award include Russian leader Vladimir Putin. The shadowy prize emerged in 2010, when it was suddenly announced by the panel two days before jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel to Beijing's anger. Organisers of the prize denied links to the government, but the award's executive chairman Liu Haofeng told AFP later that it had been set up by an association overseen by China's culture ministry. The Confucius Peace Prize was established in 2009, seemingly with official backing from Beijing, shortly after the Nobel committee announced it was awarding the peace prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. The long time human rights activist was given the award in 2010 for 'his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China,' while serving his fourth prison term for inciting subversion of state power. Chinese authorities were reportedly enraged by the decision. Perhaps the most famous winner of the five-year-old prize is Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who scooped the award in 2009. 'This year's peace prize was given to him because his act this year was outstanding in keeping world peace,' a spokesman told the AFP news agency at the time. Other winners include former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and Yuan Longping, a Chinese agricultural scientist, known for developing hybrid rice varieties. Yi Cheng, a Zen master who is the honorary head of the Buddhist Association of China, was awarded it last year.","Former Cuban dictator hailed for not resorting to violence .

"A Romanian woman who was left for dead after being raped and stabbed in the neck with a screwdriver managed to tell police the identity of her alleged attacker before slipping into a coma. Eliza Dragne, 30, met 29-year-old Nicu Alin Cristea on Facebook, where he claimed to be a humanitarian worker helping orphaned children. In fact he was a newly married construction worker who persuaded Miss Dragne to go no a date with him and arranged to pick her up in his car. Scroll down for video . Eliza Dragne, 30, met with 29-year-old Nicu Alin Cristea after speaking with him on Facebook and believing he was a humanitarian worker who helped orphan children - when he was in fact a newly married builder . Miss Dragne had kept the new relationship secret from friends and family, who had no idea where she was going. Cristea arrived as planned, but instead of driving to the bar the pair had picked for the date, he took her to a remote spot near Alexandria, southern Romanian, before attacking her, it is claimed. Miss Dragne agreed to meet him and he picked her up in his car, but instead of driving to a bar, he went into the countryside where he attacked her . According to police Miss Dragne was savagely beaten and raped, before being strangled and repeatedly stabbed in the neck with a screwdriver. Thinking she was dead, Cristea took her mobile, logged in to her Facebook account, deleted all of his messages to her, then abandoned her in a field police say. But Miss Dragne survived the attack and crawled naked through the countryside  to a main road were she caught the attention of a passing driver who called police. Investigators estimate that it could have taken her as long as two hours to reach the spot after being abandoned. Friends had no idea about the relationship or the meeting, and so did not alert the authorities. Because of the extent of her injuries, officers were forced to call for an air ambulance to take her to hospital in the capital of Bucharest. While she was being rushed to hospital she managed to reveal the identity of her alleged attacker to officers riding alongside her. Shortly after arriving at Bagdasar-Arseni Hospital Miss Dragne slipped into a coma, and despite the efforts of surgeons, passed away. Meanwhile police officers had tracked down Cristea, and when they arrived at his home, found him in the middle of a one month anniversary party with wife Elena, 28. Cristea strangled Miss Dragne before stabbing her repeatedly in the neck with a screwdriver. He took her phone, deleted all his Facebook messages to her, then left her for dead in a field . In fact Miss Dragne survived and crawled naked through the countryside for two hours to a road where she was spotted by a passing motorist . He initially denied ever having met the victim, but was told by officers that she had lived long enough to name him as the attacker. A judge ruled that Cristea be kept in prison for a month while police continue their investigation. Since news of the arrest, other alleged victims of Cristea have come forward claiming that they were also assaulted by him. One woman, who has not been named, said he came to her house to do some building work, but when he realised she was alone, he raped her. She claimed she was left with a fractured skull and broken hand after the attack, and was terrified that if she went to the police he would return and kill her. While Miss Dragne was being airlifted to hospital she told police Cristea's name. When officers arrived at his home, they found him having a one-month anniversary party with his wife, Elena (pictured) While police arrested Cristea (pictured with his wife) Miss Dragne slipped into a coma, and despite surgeon's efforts to save her, died in hospital . She said: 'There was blood everywhere. I was lucky to survive. I believe he wanted to kill me.' Rodica Dragne, Eliza's mother, 53, added: 'What can a mother feel when she sees her child like this? Why did he have to kill her and destroy her? 'He had a home and a marriage so why destroy my daughter's life and chance of having the same?' After being told that he daughter would not survive her injuries, Ms Dragne gave permission for her organs to be donated, which doctors say saved three other lives. Cristea (pictured with his wife) initially denied the attack, but was told by police that the victim had named him. Since his arrest, other victims have come forward, saying he raped and tried to kill them .","Eliza Dragne, 30, began speaking with Nicu Alin Cristea via Facebook .

"Roma's 2-0 home defeat to Manchester City on Wednesday night was a painful remainder that they are well short of the European elite as the Serie A side crashed out of the Champions League in the group stages. Roma made a premature exit following a poor campaign in which they won only one match in six games which included a 7-1 drubbing at home by Bayern Munich. Roma's elimination leaves Juventus as Serie A's only representatives in the Champions League in what has become a sadly familiar scene for Italian football as La Gazzetta dello Sport lead with the headline: 'Goodbye Roma, now only Juventus remain'.

'We have to improve the squad to reach this standard,"" said coach Rudi Garcia. 'This is not our standard at the moment and that is normal when you take our revenue into account. '(Manchester City) have more experience and maturity, but I have no regrets. The Europa League is also a high-level competition and we will try to go as far as possible.

"People with back pain are being prescribed a drug which does nothing to help their discomfort. A study has found a drug commonly prescribed to treat lower back pain is actually ineffective. The drug pregabalin works no better than a placebo to control pain, doctors discovered. Pregabalin, which is marketed by pharmaceutical company Pfizer under the name Lyrica, is commonly prescribed all over the world to treat chronic lower back pain syndromes such as lumbar spinal stenosis. A drug called pregabalin - marketed under the name Lyrica - which is commonly prescribed to treat back pain, is actually ineffective, doctors have found . This syndrome, which is the leading reason why elderly people have spinal surgery, causes shooting or twinging pains, tingling, and numbness in the lower back, buttocks, and legs. These symptoms are often called sciatica. The pain is caused by a compression of the nerves in the back, which usually happens because the spinal canal – the space the spinal cord goes through – becomes more narrow as vertebrae, discs, muscles and ligaments in the spinal column are worn away with age. As part of the study, researchers asked people with lumbar spinal stenosis to report on their pain levels while walking on a treadmill. This is because the pain associated with the condition normally occurs when the person is standing or walking, and it usually feels better by bending forward at the waist. This is why the elderly are often seen hunched over with a cane or a walker. Researchers found there was no significant difference in the levels of pain experienced by those taking the drug and those that were given a placebo. Meanwhile, common side effects include headaches, dizziness and feeling sleepy, but less commonly, blurred or double vision, co-ordination and balance problems and weight gain can occur, amongst many others. Doctors often prescribe pregabalin, even though it is not technically approved to treat back pain. This is one of it's 'off-label' uses, a common and practice where doctors prescribe a medicine they think might help, but have not been tested in official clinical trials. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a condition where  the spinal canal becomes narrowed. If the narrowing is substantial, it causes compression of the spinal cord or spinal nerves, which causes the painful symptoms. Patients can develop low back pain as well as pain, tingling, weakness, and numbness or decreased sensation in the legs. Surgery is recommended when treating pain with drugs has failed and for patients with increasing weakness of the legs or loss of bowel or bladder function. However, while surgery usually initially works, the pain may return within a few years. This is because there are few other treatments for lumbar spinal stenosis, which can sometimes be so severe it leaves people unable to walk. They may also lose their bladder or bowel functions. In such cases, patients might try strong pain medications and epidural steroid injections, which are given to help with back pain. Some patients decide to have an operation to remove a part of the bone or disc in the back to give the nerve roots more room and stop the pain. This procedure – called a lumbar laminectomy – is the most common reason for spine surgery in people over the age of 60. Lead author Dr John Markman, of the University of Rochester, said: 'Chronic low back pain is one of the most common reasons why older adults go to the doctor and lumbar stenosis is the leading indication for surgery in this age group.' Doctors have looked for alternatives to opioids, a group of drugs used to control pain but that are addictive and have many side effects, he said. So they have increasingly turned to drugs like pregabalin to help patients manage their pain, even though there has been no credible evidence to show they are effective for this problem, he added. He continued: 'Given the cost and potential side effects associated with pregabalin, it is critical that we understand the efficacy of this drug.' 'This study convincingly demonstrates a lack of relief with pregabalin for the walking pain associated with lumbar spinal stenosis.' The study was published in the journal Neurology. A study found pregabalin was ineffective at treating a common condition called lumbar spinal stenosis, which is where the nerves in the back become compressed, causing pain, tingling and numbness in the back, buttocks and legs. Some people are unable to walk or lose their bladder and bowel function .","Drug pregabalin - marketed under the name Lyrica - is prescribed globally .

"Wisconsin Republican Governor Scott Walker sent a letter to a prominent Jewish attorney that was signed: 'Thank you and Molotov.' 'My guess is it was a typo,' Walker, who is considering running for president in 2016, said when asked about the slip-up at the governor's mansion on Wednesday. Walker presumably meant to write 'mazel tov' - a Jewish phrase to express congratulations and best wishes - when he sent the undated letter to prominent Milwaukee attorney Franklyn Gimbel. The letter, sent when Walker was Milwaukee County executive, had long been forgotten but surfaced again when documents for John Doe investigations were released in August, the Cap Times reported. He said he suspects it was written around 2003. Oops: Republican Governor Scott Walker, pictured speaking at the Republican Jewish Coalition in March, sent a letter to a Jewish attorney that was signed off: 'Thank you and Molotov' - instead of 'mazel tov' Gaffe: Walker has since claimed that the slip up - which was at the end of a letter about placing a menorah at the Milwaukee County Courthouse - was probably just a typo. He thinks the letter is from around 2003 . He was writing to Gimbel to say he would be happy to display a menorah celebrating 'The Eight Days of Chanukah' at the Milwaukee County Courthouse. 'He kinda missed the boat there,' Gimbel told the Milwaulkee Journal Sentinel. '""Molotov"" is a far cry from ""mazel tov"".' Recipient: He sent the letter to attorney Franklyn Gimbel, who called the error 'pretty basic' Gimbel added that he can't recall the letter and likely stopped reading after seeing Walker had accepted the menorah proposal. If he had seen the mistake, he would have called him to point it out, he said. 'That's pretty basic,' Gimbel said. Walker, the son of a Baptist preacher and a practicing Christian, has been courting Jewish voters ahead of his potential bid for the presidency. Walker spoke at the Republican Jewish Coalition spring meeting this year and, in an attempt to woo the audience, mentioned that the governor's mansion has a 'menorah candle'. He said on Wednesday that menorah is the same one that he displayed at the Milwaukee County courthouse following the request from Gimbel. In the speech, he also vaguely signaled his support for Israel and said that the name of his oldest son, Matthew, comes from the Hebrew word for 'gift from god'. On Wednesday, Walker likened discussion of the 'Molotov' typo to discussion during his re-election campaign about why his thumb had a bandage on it and comments he made about his bald spot being caused by hitting his head on a cabinet. 'My thumb has healed up and my bald spot is boring now, and they have to talk about things like that,' he said.","Walker presumably meant to write 'mazel tov' when he wrote the undated letter to a prominent Jewish attorney in Milwaukee .

But Button believes he and fellow former world champion Alonso, who left Ferrari after a disappointing season, can now bring the good times back at McLaren, under new engine suppliers in Honda. The British driver had strongly hinted at pursuing life outside of the sport, though he now seems excited at the prospect of leading Ron Dennis' new line-up for 'many years to come'. 'I thought about life outside of Formula 1 but it's nowhere near as fun as inside of it,' Button said at McLaren's HQ at a media event on Thursday. 'My heart has always been with racing with McLaren and Honda.' 'Sometimes the best things in life are worth waiting for! This is a really, really exciting challenge. To race alongside this guy [Alonso] really does mean a lot to me.' Earlier in the day, Button comically tweeted 'just woken up, what's going on??' after the confirmation.

'McLaren's policy has always been to assemble the strongest line-up possible, and in Fernando and Jenson I firmly believe that is exactly what we have,' he said. 'For many reasons our negotiations with Jenson took quite a long time, but, now that they have been concluded, we are confident that our collaboration with him will continue to thrive in the future every bit as well as it has in the past.

"A gay churchgoer has spoken of his torment at the hands of fellow members - who kidnapped and beat him in an attempt to 'rid him of homosexual demons'. Matthew Fenner said the group, who belong to The Word of Faith Fellowship church in Spindale, North Carolina, beat and strangled him for being gay last year. Five people - Sarah Covington Anderson, Adam Christopher Bartley, Brooke McFadden Covington, Justin Brock Covington and Robert Louis Walker Jr.- have been indicted on simple assault and kidnapping charges. Scroll down for video . Matthew Fenner, pictured speaking via Skype, claims five fellow members of the Word of Faith Fellowship attacked him for being gay .

My head was like being flung back, my vision was going brown and black. 'I couldn't breathe and I'm sitting here thinking if I don't get out of this, I'm probably going to die.' He also claims that what happened to him is not an isolated incident and he hopes by pushing his case, he can shed light on the truth. The church, which was established in 1979, owns a 35-acre property in Spindale, North Carolina . In an affidavit, Mr Fenner said Sarah Covington Anderson told him he was 'disgusting' because of his sexual orientation. He continues that the vicious beating he received was intended to ‘break me free of the homosexual ""demons""'. But the church's attorney Josh Farmer insists Mr Fenner was never harmed and the indicted members are 'innocent of the charges leveled against them'. 'We are adamant that no one ever physically harmed Mr. Fenner,' he told WSPA. 'The church does not target members who are gay.'

"It might have been a smart choice for an upmarket restaurant, but Lord Snowdon's tweed jacket was not enough to keep out the cold as he waited for a taxi after enjoying Sunday lunch. The former royal photographer was caught out by the winter weather as he left La Famiglia, in Chelsea, where he dined with his former wife, Lucy, the Countess of Snowdon, last weekend. It was so chilly that Ms Lindsay-Hogg, to whom Lord Snowdon was married for 22 years, had to give the frail 84-year-old her coat as they strolled through the London borough after the meal.

But they looked relaxed in each other's company as they made their way out of the restaurant on Sunday - with Lord Snowdon being wheeled out by the Maitre d' after the meal.

After his divorce to Princess Margaret amid rumours of her extra-marital affair, Lord Snowdon married Ms Lindsay-Hogg, the former wife of film director Michael Lindsay-Hogg. The marriage ended in divorce in 2000, this time facing allegations that Lord Snowdon was having an affair. There have been a number of similar claims made over the years. Earlier this year, Lord Snowdon donated a series of his photographs, including ones of David Bowie, Dame Maggie Smith and Sir Laurence Olivier to the National Portrait Gallery. The photographer turned his lens on the worlds of theatre, fashion and high society when he began his career in the 1950s. He later became the royal photographer after his marriage to Princess Margaret. He is known for his six-decade association with Vogue and in the early 1960s worked with the Sunday Times Magazine on documentary subjects from mental health to loneliness. The donation of 130 photographs from Lord Snowdon's archive is one of the largest gifts ever received by the gallery, and several of the portraits went on display for the first time this autumn. They are open to view in an exhibition, titled, Snowden: A Life in View, until June 2015.","Lord Snowdon enjoyed lunch at Chelsea stalwart La Famiglia on Sunday .

Taking the lead: Michael Keaton's drama Birdman, about a washed-up Hollywood actor who once played the superhero Birdman, has been nominated seven awards . Marion Cotillard, who has won many critics awards for her leading role in Two Days, One Night has been snubbed in the category. Selma - starring Oprah Winfrey and David Oyelowo - had been ignored at the Screen Actor's Guild nominations a day earlier. In the Best Picture, comedy or musical, category, Birdman was joined by St. Vincent, Grand Budapest Hotel, Into the Woods and — in a surprise — the independent British film Pride.

Golden Globe and Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon is up for her role in Wild . One of the surprise winners of the day was Grand Budapest Hotel. Along with a Best Picture nod in comedy, it earned nominations for Ralph Fiennes as best actor, and Wes Anderson for screenplay and director.

"Many people avoid their work Christmas party like the plague but the reality is a lot of relationships can begin in the office environment. So if you're single and looking for love - instead of making excuses to not turn up to your work breakup party or plan to leave early to meet up with your mates - why not see it as an opportunity to not only strengthen relationships with co-workers, but potentially meet ‘the one’? Interestingly, online dating site eHarmony reveals over two thirds of Aussies feel the qualities that make for lasting romantic relationships, such as humour and emotional support, are similar to those that make for strong bonds with colleagues – suggesting workmates could make for ideal partners. Over two thirds of Aussies feel the qualities that make for lasting romantic relationships, are similar to what make strong bonds with colleagues . However, there is no room for excuses the morning after, with poor performance (66 per cent) listed as the biggest workplace irritation. With company parties in full swing, the research finds 75 per cent of Aussies agree that being flirtatious or drinking at work events won’t damage relationships with their peers. Daily Mail Australia speaks to psychologist and eHarmony dating and relationship expert, Melanie Schilling, about tips on what you can do capitalise on making the most of your work Christmas party this year and maybe even going home with a few phone numbers. REVEAL A NEW SIDE OF YOURSELF: . 'You need to think that you are already in a reasonably good pool to fish in if you like because there is the similarities that have drawn us together in the workplace.' 'So there's an opportunity to start representing a slightly different version of yourself for example a lot of people reserve aspects of themself for the weekend from really practical things - like the way they dress to their interests and passions - that you might like to experiment with and bring out at the party to show a different side of yourself.' No room for excuses the morning after, with poor performance (66 per cent) listed as the biggest workplace irritation . DON'T JUST TALK SHOP ALL NIGHT . 'Don't just focus on networking - rather than just talk about work start experimenting a little bit with questions that might bring out the person.' 'If you are someone that family is really important to you put in a few questions about how they will be spending Christmas with their family and finding that commonality there.' DRINK TO RELAX NOT TO DISGRACE: . 'Also alcohol can be involved so defenses can be a little bit down so there is that fine line to walk.' 'It's great to be able to open up and be a different version of yourself but I guess the word of caution there is to keep in mind that any HR policies that are in place in the workplace still relate to the party.' 'That's the tricky bit because boundaries and certain behaviour and still apply. Put your flirty pants on but be aware of appropriate workplace behaviour.' 75 per cent of Aussies agree that being flirtatious or drinking at work events won’t damage relationships with their peers . BE CLEAR ON WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR: . 'What is important to you or the things in your life - your values - so that when you are out there in that social world you can use that as a bit of criteria for screening people so you are not just responding to people who might be interested in you.' 'That way you are actually being quite proactive and empowered so you ask the right questions to determine whether you are interested in them.' 1. Approach the festive season with a new mindset – swap your cocktail small talk for some subtle values exploration and keep an eye out for who makes you laugh . 2. Network, network, network – use your networking skills to not only build your professional relationships but also explore potential dates. Perhaps your colleague can introduce you to someone in their network? 3. Showcase your assets – it’s a great opportunity to show a side of yourself you don’t typically display at work. Highlight a favourite part of yourself, wear something you feel confident in, and show a side of your personality usually reserved for the weekends . 4. Watch the alcohol – remember that the Christmas Spirit can diminish your usual social filters and you don’t want to create unnecessary awkwardness at the office . 5. Know the HR policy – work parties are an extension of the workplace and although there is often some leeway, all workplace policies apply . Try to strike up non-work conversations with colleagues to see if there are any similar interests .","Over two thirds of Aussies feel the qualities that make for lasting romantic relationships,  are similar to what make strong bonds with colleagues .

"It's no secret that men tend to see younger women as more attractive, but the extreme to which this holds true is somewhat alarming. According to a graph based on data from OKCupid dating profiles, women tend to be most attracted to men who are around their same age. But the case is drastically different for men; the graph shows that once a woman passes the age of 22, she becomes exponentially less attractive to men. Scroll down for video . Depressing data: According to a graph based on data from OKCupid dating profiles, once a woman passes the age of 22, she becomes exponentially less attractive to men . OKCupid president and co-founder Christian Rudder presents these results in his forthcoming book Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking, which hits stores on Wednesday. At an event in mid-August, Mr Rudder, 39, explained the results to a dumbfounded crowd. 'Women who are, say, 28, find guys who are also 28 about the most attractive, and so forth. Up until about 40, when that's getting too old,' he said. By contrast, women begin to decline in attractiveness - from the perspective of men - as soon as they hit their early twenties. 'It is kind of terrible,' he admitted. 'From the time you're 22 you'll be less hot than a 20-year-old, based on this data. So that's just a thing.' The opposite sex: By contrast, women tend to be most attracted to men who are around their same age - until they hit about 40 years old . While these stats may be depressing, Mr Rudder clarifies that it doesn't mean all women over 22 should necessarily expect to be left high and dry. 'This is just measuring people's opinions, not what they actually go out and do,' he told NPR. Read about it: OKCupid president Christian Rudder presents these results in hist forthcoming book Dataclysm, which hits stores on Wednesday . 'What you see when you actually look at what people do, you see the realism set in. So these 40-year-old guys... the people they actually have the courage to actually go out and message are a lot older: it's 30, 35-year-old women.' On his blog, OKData, he delves into this pattern even further, explaining that as men get older they tend to search for younger and younger women. 'The median 31-year-old guy, for example, sets his allowable match age range from 22 to 35 - nine years younger, but only four years older, than himself,' he writes. 'This skewed mindset worsens with age; the median 42-year-old will accept a woman up to 15 years younger, but no more than three years older.' Apart from data about age, Mr Rudder's book also details a number of other fascinating ways we interact and perceive each other. 'If there's one thing I sincerely hope this book might get you to reconsider, it's what you think about yourself,' he writes in the introduction. 'Because that's what this book is really about. OKCupid is just how I arrived at the story.'","According to a graph made using OKCupid data, women are most attracted to men around their same age, until they reach about 40 .
By contrast, men of all ages up to 50 are most attracted to women who are no older than 24 ."
"A yoga ashram that initially offered a 'healing' fire ceremony to cleanse people who had been drugged, raped and beaten as children at the retreat say they will now offer compensation to victims years after they were sexually abused. Disturbing details have emerged at a royal commission into the sexual abuse of children in the 1970s and 1980s at the Mangrove Yoga Ashram on the NSW Central Coast. The commission has heard from nine abuse victims who have told how the former spiritual leader at the isolated retreat in the foothills of Mangrove Mountain, Swami Akhandananda, used them for his sexual gratification. Disturbing details have emerged at a royal commission into the sexual abuse of children in the 1970s and 1980s at the Mangrove Yoga Ashram on the NSW Central Coast . One victim revealed last week that she was held down naked at seven years of age and had the skin between her breasts cut during an initiation ceremony, before a swami licked the blood and had sex with her. Child victims have also given evidence of the second in charge, known as Shishy, allegedly subjecting them to fierce beatings and summoning teenage girls for sex with Akhandananda. Shishy admitted to slapping the children at the royal commission, but couldn't recall some of the more vicious assaults described by the victims. Akhandananda came to Australia from his native India in the mid-1970s to start the ashram as a disciple of the well-established Satyananda Yoga movement. Shishi told the commission last week that, even though sex was banned by the movement's head, Swami Satyananda Saraswati, she began a sexual relationship with Akhandananda in secret when she was a teenager. She said she was also expected to have sex with Satyananda when he was visiting Australia . Child victims have given evidence of the second in charge, known as Shishy (centre), allegedly subjecting them to fierce beatings and summoning teenager girls for sex with leader Swami Akhandananda . The commission has heard from nine abuse victims who have told how the former spiritual leader, Swami Akhandananda, used them for his sexual gratification . Sarah Tetlow, chief executive of the Satyananda Yoga Academy, said on Wednesday she had no idea until now 'of the depth of the impact that this (the abuse) has had on people' and agreed the initial response should have been different. The ashram's response to those who came forward to tell of sexual, emotional and physical abuse by Akhandananda and his 'handmaiden' Shishy has come under fire during seven days of evidence at the public hearing in Sydney. Mangrove Yoga Ashram posted a generic apology on Facebook, then blocked abuse survivors from posting responses and sent letters threatening legal action to others. It then invited all victims to a havan - a ritual fire ceremony to help them heal as part of the ashram's 40th anniversary celebrations. In reply to Peter O'Brien, solicitor for six of the victims, Ms Tetlow said she appreciated why his clients would be extremely sceptical of an organisation whose response was to have a fire ceremony to deal with their trauma. 'We were trying to do things that were helpful,' she said, adding she realised they had not done the right thing and welcomed the commission's inquiry. One victim revealed last week that she was held down naked at seven years of age and had the skin between her breasts cut during an initiation ceremony, before a swami licked the blood and had sex with her . Mangrove Yoga Ashram invited all victims to a havan - a ritual fire ceremony to help them heal as part of the ashram's 40th anniversary celebrations . Mr O'Brien has since sent the Mangrove Yoga Ashram lawyers an assessment of damages, seeking $1 million compensation for each of his clients. The amount has yet to be worked out and Ms Tetlow said they expected compensation would be part of any redress. The academy's assets exceed its liabilities by $5.6 million. It has two ashrams, Mangrove Mountain, and one in rural Victoria, as well as a school at Manly and three other properties held in two trusts. In October, the Australian academy received an email from head office in India upbraiding it for not taking responsibility for the abuse and tarnishing the name of the current leader - Swami Niranjan Saraswati. Shishi told the commission last week that, even though sex was banned by the movement's head, Swami Satyananda Saraswati (pictured), she began a sexual relationship with Akhandananda in secret when she was a teenager . The Bihar School of Yoga, the international centre of the Satyananda movement, threatened to withdraw all support to its Australian branch and demanded an apology. A lawyer representing the India-based school told the commission on Wednesday that until the hearing his client did not know the appalling extent of the abuse. One yoga devotee told the royal commission on Tuesday they didn't think the ashram should be held responsible for abuse inflicted on children by its former spiritual leader and his second-in-command - Akhandananda and Shishi. Muktimurti, a longtime resident of the Mangrove Yoga Ashram said she did not really believe the allegations against  Akhandananda when he was brought to trial. She said in her statement to the commission she found it 'morally questionable' for victims to now seek financial compensation. 'I don't agree with the ashram being held to ransom for something that none of us in the ashram community have anything to do with,' she said. Commissioner Justice Jennifer Coate during the opening address at the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse public hearing  into the ashram at Mangrove Mountain . Muktimurti said she believed compensation would imply the ashram had done something wrong. Akhandananda, who has since died, was jailed in 1989 for abusing four girls but the conviction was overturned on a technicality in 1991. He died in 1997 . Muktimurti, who lived at the ashram from 1978 to 1996 and is back there in an administrative position, was Shishy's assistant and denies she ever brought girls to Akhandananda's bedroom for sex on Shishy's instructions. 'All I know is that my experience, my own experience of living in the ashram has had nothing to do with anything like that,' she said. Tearfully, she said she found the hearing distressing because if the acts were true, it was dreadful and if they weren't, those making the allegations were being 'venal'. Earlier, the commission heard from a doctor who was a resident at Mangrove in the 1980s. Henry Sztulman said he never saw any 'overt behaviour' indicating abuse of the children and denied allegations he prescribed morphine regularly for minor ailments such as an infected toe. The hearing continues.

"Liverpool's poor performance in this season's Champions League has dealt the Anfield club a seedings blow for the Europa League last-32 draw. As a result of being one of the four worst performing third-placed teams, Brendan Rodgers' side are unseeded for the draw, which will be held in Nyon on Monday at noon. The Europa League has added importance this season with the winners receiving entry to next season's Champions League. Brendan Rodgers shows his frustrations as his Liverpool side are knocked out of the Champions League . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard looks dejected as the Anfield club draw against Basle on Tuesday . Seeded: Olympiacos, Zenit St Petersburg, Sporting Lisbon, Athletic Bilbao, Red Bull Salzburg, Dinamo Moscow, Everton, Inter Milan, Fiorentina . Unseeded: Anderlecht, Ajax, Liverpool, Roma, Celtic, PSV . *The full seedings will be confirmed after the completion of Thursday's Europa League group stage matches . And with Liverpool currently languishing in ninth in the Premier League, many consider this to be their last shot at qualifying for UEFA's flagship club competition next season. But a number of potential tough draws await on Monday due to their unseeded status, including a reunion with former manager Rafael Benitez at Napoli. Nine teams have already secured a seeding for Monday's draw by virtue of winning their Europa League group or being one of the four third-placed teams in the Champions League with the best record. They include Roberto Mancini's Inter Milan, Zenit St Petersburg, Olympiacos, Sporting Lisbon and Fiorentina. Napoli will also be seeded if they can clinch top spot in Group I with a home win against Slovan Bratislava on Thursday night. Napoli head coach Rafael Benitez speaks at a pre-match press conference in Naples on Wednesday . Inter Milan head coach Roberto Mancini looks in good spirits ahead of the match against Qarabag Agdam . Although city rivals Everton will also be seeded after winning Group H, there will be no Liverpool derby in the last-32 as teams from the same country cannot play each other at this stage. It could, however, happen if both teams progress to the last 16, at which stage country protection is removed and the draw is free. There will be no 'Battle of Britain' between Liverpool and Celtic as the Scottish club could only finish second in Group D and so will be unseeded. La Liga clubs Sevilla and Villarreal are potential opponents for Liverpool if they can go top of their respective groups on Thursday. Everton take on Liverpool earlier this season - but there will be no derby clash in the Europa League last 32 . Johan Mjallby (left) tackles Michael Owen during the UEFA Cup quarter-final between Liverpool and Celtic in 2003. Both teams are unseeded for Monday's Europa League last-32 draw . A match against Henning Berg's Legia Warsaw is also a possibility if the Polish club seal first place in Group L with a draw at home against Trabzonspor. If Liverpool go all the way and win the trophy in Warsaw on May 27, they would enter next season's Champions League  at the earliest in the play-offs. There is a possibility, though, that the Europa League winners will go straight into the group stages if this season's Champions League victors qualify automatically for group entry through their own domestic league. The Europa League last-32 first legs will be held on February 19 with the unseeded team at home first, before travelling away for the second leg seven days later.","Liverpool are unseeded for Monday's UEFA Europa League draw .

"President Barack Obama has stepped up his battle to close Guantanamo Bay, summoning top officials to the White House to push for the notorious detention centre to close. But the President, who made a pledge to close the prison on the day he took office in 2008, is likely to face tough opposition from Congress which has ruled out transferring any prisoners to the U.S. This means Obama may have to send inmates abroad if he wishes to close the jail, but the administration does not want to release all prisoners - including five suspected 9/11 plotters. Scroll down for video . President Obama has stepped up his battle to close Guantanamo Bay (pictured), summoning top officials to call for the prison's closure . The President, who made a pledge to close the prison on the day he took office in 2008, is likely to face tough opposition from Congress in his bid to shut down Guantanamo . At the meeting, last month, Obama lectured officials on his own administration's failure to close down Guantanamo, where more than a hundred prisoners remain interred. Since that meeting, a dozen prisoners have been transferred overseas, with another five expected to leave the U.S. naval base in Cuba before the end of the year. The prison population is at its lowest point since shortly after it opened in 2002, with just 136 left, of which half are cleared to leave the detention centre. At its peak, Guantanamo held 700 suspects. But actually closing Guantanamo would either require approval from Congress, which has prohibited transferring any prisoners to the U.S., or the transfer of potentially dangerous individuals to other countries - which Obama's opponents are warning him against but administration officials say hasn't been ruled out. 'We're working on it,' Obama said at a bookstore over the Thanksgiving weekend when a shopper expressed hope Guantanamo will close. The President wants to close the detention centre because he believes it is unnecessary, expensive at more than $440million a year, and to be a propaganda tool for the country's enemies. Actually closing Guantanamo would either require approval from Congress or the transfer of potentially dangerous individuals to other countries . The prisoner population is at its lowest point since shortly after it opened in 2002, with just 136 left, of which half are cleared to leave the detention centre . But members of Congress argue that it should remain open to hold and question terrorism suspects, and that dangerous inmates should not be moved to America. Most prisoners cleared for transfers are from Yemen, where a violent al-Qaeda-linked group makes it too unstable to send them home. But the day after Obama's meeting, Georgia and Slovakia accepted the first Yemenis to leave since 2010, proving that resettlement elsewhere is an option. Administration officials say more prisoners who previously were classified as too dangerous to be let out are expected to be cleared for transfer in an ongoing review. But the administration doesn't want to release some detainees, including the prisoners facing trial by military commission for war crimes — a group that includes five men charged with planning and aiding the 9/11 attacks. Administration officials said the president's message in the November 19 White House meeting was primarily directed at Hagel, who was reluctant to sign off on guarantees that those transferred would not pose a security threat. Five days after that meeting, Hagel resigned under pressure, with administration officials saying Guantanamo was one of the issues behind his departure. His replacement, Ashton Carter, would not have been chose for the job if he did not understand closure of the prison was a priority, an anonymous official told the Associated Press.","President Obama steps up his drive to shut down Guantanamo Bay .

"The chalet ski holiday is a quirk of British culture - and my goodness, it's a survivor. Most civilised countries think being cooped up in a poky wooden house with eight or ten others, sometimes sharing bathrooms and eating food cooked by gap-year students, has all the ingredients of a ghastly TV reality show. But as a nation, we can't get enough of it. A hideaway on the edge of the slopes: Nid d'Aigle is perfectly positioned for skiing in Courchevel 1650 . Yes, things can go wrong (I remember coming down early one morning and seeing a young man rushing up from the basement where the chalet girls stayed. ""Sorry, forgot my trousers,"" he said.) But standards have risen greatly since the Seventies when Colin Murison-Small pioneered this kind of holiday with the help of his Sloaney 'Muribirds'. Powder White has been in the game more than ten years and operates in the ski world's Big Five - Val d'Isere, St Anton, Verbier, Meribel and Courchevel. It's a super-efficient and flexible company. Come on in, the fire's lit: The chalet has a cosy atmosphere in its main lounge space . If you want only three or four dinners in the chalet, rather than six, that's fine (the price is adjusted accordingly) and if you book ski and boot hire in advance, a man appears on your first evening with all the clobber. We opted for chalet Nid d'Aigle in Courchevel 1650, where eight of us snuggled down in four double rooms, all with en-suite bathrooms. Chalet girls Antonia and Hannah, who had been at school together, were charming and rustled up simple, but delicious, food (freshly baked cakes for tea) and the selection of wines (included at no extra cost) was greatly appreciated. We drank vast quantities. A lot has been said about the Russian invasion of Courchevel 1850, the next valley along from 1650 - and it's all true, with Prada, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Bulgari et al setting up shops beside the piste. A space to relax away from the slopes: The chalet has space for eight people in four double rooms . But Courchevel 1650 is a different world entirely, with a few simple bars and restaurants, one or two hotels and lots of chalets on the hill. What's admirably swanky, however, are the escalators that save you walking long distances with your gear to and from the main bubble lift up the mountain. The Three Valleys (Courchevel, Méribel, Val Thorens) is such a large area it's worth spending a day or even half day with a reputable ski guiding company. We chose Marmalade and not one, but two, qualified ski instructors arrived - the boss Derek and colleague Nick. They skied with effortless style and were good company, too. While lots of people make for the dizzy heights of Val Thorens, we tended to ski mainly in 1650 and then found some superbly uncrowded runs through trees down to La Praz and La Tania. The challenge most days was to find places to eat on the mountain that were accessible to non-skiers such as my wife, for whom even sitting upstairs on a double-decker bus is something of a vertigo challenge. Out on the terrace: The chalet offers the opportunity for al fresco dining - if you feel it's warm enough . This proved remarkably easy. Le Bel Air, at the top of the Ariondaz bubble lift, has a gorgeous balcony and the food is top-notch without charging Russian prices; the newly opened Les Chenus restaurant in 1850 is another good option if you're happy with a fancy burger and there's a decent and lively restaurant at the top of the La Tania bubble. Sadly we could not get to my favourite, Les Cretes, where the Jacquemard family has been in business more than 25 years. On the chalet girls' day off, the younger members of our group enjoyed a fondue at Le Petit Savoyard, while my wife and I checked out 1850's newest hotel, L'Apogée. My goodness, it's plush. Wonderful food. Gorgeous pool. Stay here and your skis are put out for you in the morning and there is even a small drag lift so you don't have to walk uphill for all of 20 yards. A mountain marvel: Courchevel is one of the most fabled ski resorts in the French Alps . Life was a little more simple back in our chalet - and a lot more British. But just as wonderful.

"Perhaps the sight of those frenzied shoppers wrestling each other over a discounted TV set has left you wondering where all the traditional Christmas good cheer has gone. The answer is: Dresden. Christmas markets started in Germany, and Dresden is one of the oldest of the lot. It is also one of the most glorious. There is not a whiff of Christmas fatigue, no suggestion of a terse ‘let’s do something different this time’ or a tetchy ‘I’m not hosting again after last year’. City of lights: Dresden really comes to life in November and December, when stalls fill its Altmarkt square . Dresden is delighted to host and celebrate all things Christmas from late November, with most markets closing on Christmas Eve. It feels like its entire population (at about half a million) is on board. There are 11 markets dotted around the city, ranging from a handful of stalls lining a small passageway to the River Elbe to large affairs with mini fairground rides and candyfloss. The oldest (now in its 580th year) and most celebrated is the Striezelmarkt on Altmarkt Square in the old town. We gather here as daylight fades for the grand opening. It involves a welcome speech from the city’s mayor, songs from a young woman in huge angel wings and a man dressed as a miner, a band, and then, as darkness falls and fairy lights in the fir trees twinkle, an enormous stollen cake (2,014 cm long in honour of the year, and pictured right) is brought to the stage by the city’s bakers. Stollen cake (well, the original and authentic version anyway) is exclusive to Dresden and Christmas. This one arrives with such fanfare that it should come with police outriders. Gifts of all shapes and sizes: Visitors can pick up all manner of Christmas presents at the Striezelmarkt . Love hearts and sugary serenades: Baked goods are always a key element of any German Christmas market . There is an almost tangible sense of festivity and community as young families, couples and groups of friends wander around nearly 250 wooden stalls. There is also a strong and irresistible aroma of warm gluhwein, roasting chestnuts, bratwurst, and an entire cow roasting on a spit. Between the food and the handbags, sweets, handmade jewellery, blown-glass ornaments, woollen hats, scarves and gloves, pottery, toys, candles and sheepskin slippers, you could wrap up most of your Christmas shopping here in an afternoon. It is one big, romantic, cosy grotto, and there’s something touchingly sincere about the market. Perhaps this is because so many of the stalls are selling handmade things. There are no madly hiked prices and nothing that looks like it would break the minute you got it home. Much smaller than the Striezelmarkt, and completely charming, is the medieval Stallhof market in the shadow of the castle. It is tucked away down a passageway and, as well as handmade jewellery and bunches of mistletoe, it is full of surprises. Fun for visitors of all ages: Dresden's markets are a magical affair for even the youngest of visitors . There are crates of wine in bottles like huge bell-bottomed test tubes, a stall devoted to ropes and twine, a smithy with antique bellows the size of a VW Beetle, and a wooden toy stall where I spy primary-coloured catapults, bows and arrows and even an axe, which would make for a lively Christmas. We are staying at the swish Swissotel in the old town, and it’s a pleasure to stroll the quiet streets amid the spectacular skyline of spires and domes — rebuilt, original brick by original brick where possible — after 15 sq miles of Dresden’s centre was almost levelled in 1945 by the Allied bombing raids. Our guide, Cosima, shows us black-and-white photos of the rubble and craters. It’s affecting. The Zwinger Palace, Frauenkirche (Church) and the Semper Opera House look even more mighty and imposing when you realise how painstakingly they were put back together. We pass the baroque Hofkirche, built on the orders of the 17th-century ruler August the Strong. August’s heart is buried in a silver capsule in the crypt and will, according to Cosima, beat again when a beautiful woman walks past it. It seems a fitting test, as August apparently had 12 mistresses and a wife, all of whom he built palaces for. Local delicacy: Stollen cake originated in Dresden, and is still a key feature of the city's Christmas markets . His favourite mistress was ensconced in Taschenberg Palace (now a hotel), though she overstepped her place and spent the last 49 years of her life in prison. But we don’t dwell on her fate. It’s Christmas, after all, and Dresden is one big irresistible advent calendar, with a Santa’s hat on top. And not a flat-screen scrap or an Xbox brawl in sight. Double rooms at the Swissotel Dresden Am Schloss (0049 351 501 200, www.swissotel.com/dresden) start at £102 B&B per night.

"For most people, Christmas is a time for loosening their belts and indulging in calorific treats. But for those wanting to watch their figure over the festive season, one chef has created a guilt free Christmas lunch, which contains fewer calories than a bag of nuts. Gurpareet Bains has come up with the three-course meal called the 'Guilt-Free Gala' by replacing traditional ingredients with superfoods, meaning it only contains 930 calories, around one third of a classic lunch. Scroll down for video . The turkey breast poached in mulled wine spices and baby roast potatoes with seaweed and rosemary crust created by chef Gurpareet Bains, which contains just 470 calories . It includes turkey with roast potatoes and all the trimmings, a lobster and vegetable starter, and a rich fruit pudding with mascarpone cheese for dessert. And not only is the meal gluten free, it also contains 11 portions of fruit and vegetables, more than double the government's recommended five-a-day and is said to taste 'exquisite'. A normal Christmas dinner, with fat-soaked spuds, sugar-coated parsnips, Christmas pudding and canapes, would weigh-in with an average of 3,200 calories, 2.5g of salt, and anything up to 90g of fat - more than a woman's entire recommended daily allowance of 70g. The banquet includes a starter of butternut squash and pear soup with lobster (150 calories), a main of turkey breast poached in mulled wine spices with blueberry sauce and all the trimmings (470 calories) and a dessert of superfruit Pudding with green tea and chia seeds (310 calories). To keep the calorie content lower nutritionist Mr Bains replaced traditional, oily ingredients with healthy superfoods to reduce its calorific content by 71 per cent.

The entire meal contains just 19 grams of fat - the equivalent of three mince pies or a single serving of cheese and biscuits. By comparison, a 200g bag of Tesco salted mixed nuts contains 1,300 calories and 116g of fat. Mr Bains, an award-winning Anglo-Indian chef and bestselling cookery author, first hit the headlines in 2009 after creating a cancer-fighting curry. His fans now include a host of celebrities including DJ Chris Evans and designer Vivienne Westwood, and the Royal Family. A classic Christmas dinner, pictured, combined with dessert and canapes can contain over 3,200 calories . Mr Bains, who has been perfecting the Guilt-Free Gala since 2012, says that he understands that people want to indulge over the festive period but he says this can be done without ruining your waistline. 'Christmas is a time for indulgence and for enjoying the finer things in life. But that enjoyment doesn't have to come at the expense of your waistline or cholesterol levels. 'It's incredibly easy to go overboard at Christmas, but this meal means that we can still eat indulgently and try new flavours without worrying about the waistline. 'I set out to create a traditional Christmas dinner with a twist, and one that is not just better for you than classic lunches but that is actually good for you. 'The Guilt-Free Gala is the culmination of two year's efforts and, I'm very pleased to say, my testers say it is exquisite.

According to research, Britons will unwittingly consume a shocking 7,000 calories on Christmas Day alone, with some exceeding the daily recommended allowance before sitting down for dinner. The endless supply of chocolate, snacks, mince pies and festive drinks also means the average British person will gain 6lbs in the eight days between Christmas Eve and New Year's Day.

"Hundreds of protesters angered at the killing of unarmed black men by white police officers again marched through downtown Berkeley streets on Tuesday night as protests continued to rage in Northern California. Disturbing footage has emerged showing one man, believed to be a Berkeley doctor, knocked out cold after another man hit him in the head with a hammer. The man, who was trying to stop demonstrators from smashing up a Radio Shack, can be seen fighting with the other man in the footage before he is hit. He was rushed to Highland Hospital.

Protest: Demonstrators in Berkeley blocked traffic on I-80 for over an hour on Monday night . Demonstrators stopped at City Hall, where a city councilman addressed the crowd and said he will ask for an investigation into police response to the protests over the weekend, when the latest wave of protests started. Bay Area Rapid Transit officials said the station in downtown Berkeley was closed as a precaution. A City Council meeting scheduled for Tuesday night was canceled after threats to disrupt it, said Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates. One man, a doctor from Berkeley, was hit in the head with a hammer while trying to stop looters from smashing into a Radio Shack. A California Highway Patrol official said 80 percent off its available staff would be deployed to monitor the protest in Berkeley after a crowd of about 1,500 blocked all lanes of Interstate 80 and blocked an Amtrak train Monday night. The agency arrested 223 people Monday on suspicion of resisting arrest, obstructing police and other charges, said Ernie Sanchez, assistant chief of the CHP's Golden Gate Division. Berkeley police arrested another nine people. Sanchez told the San Francisco Chronicle the agency will also ask the Alameda County district attorney's office to increase bails and charges. Those arrested face bails of up to $50,000, and many remain in custody, he added. Dangerous: Protesters block an Amtrak train in Berkeley on Monday . Bold statement: Hundreds of people marched through downtown Berkeley Monday in reaction to the grand jury decisions not to indict white police officers in the deaths of two unarmed black men . A large group of demonstrators destroyed highway perimeter fencing, flooded lanes, and threw rocks and other objects at officers. It took about an hour and a half to clear the interstate, and no major injuries were reported, the CHP reported. A woman stuck in traffic went into labor during the protest, but fire crews were able to get her to a hospital, KPIX-TV reported. 'The CHP respects the public's right to gather and demonstrate, but it needs to be done in a safe manner,' Sanchez said. 'At this point, they've made their statement and we respect that. 'Now, we're asking them to stop.' Although many activists in other parts of the country have gone home, protests in Berkeley and Oakland are still active, reflecting the area's long history of protest dating to the 1960s. The protests started after a grand jury on Nov. 24 declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. A New York grand jury on Dec. 3 declined to prosecute a police officer captured on video applying a fatal chokehold on Eric Garner. That decision set off more demonstrations nationwide.

The California Highway Patrol also deployed tear gas against protesters on Sunday after explosives were thrown at them. Tear gas was also used against the protesters on Saturday, which Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates admits may have been an overreaction. Police kept a noticeably wider distance on Sunday, but that only led to more businesses getting vandalized. On Monday, many business owners closed early and boarded up in preparation for the march, and nearby UC Berkeley sent out an email to staff suggesting they leave campus by 4:30pm. 'It was really disturbing,' Bates said of the weekend protests, as reported by ABC 7. 'It turned violent and it turned violent in a way that we haven't seen here for a long, long time. Over the weekend, over 16 various stores were trashed, not just major businesses, but small businesses.' Berkeley has a history of civil disobedience, as one of the focal point for protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s. Because of this history, local police are not allowed to have search dogs, stun guns or helicopters. 'The people in the Bay Area are sensitive to worldwide issues,' Bates said, according to NBC Bay Area. 'Unfortunately, there is a small element that uses violence at times to make their point.'

"A paedophile who grabbed a four-year-old girl while she was on a bus with her mother and sister and kissed her on the lips has been jailed. Robert Colclough, 44, had set next to the child while she was travelling on the single decker bus in the Hanley area of Stoke-on-Trent. He let the girl look at a game on his mobile phone before asking her to give him a kiss on January 18 this year. Robert Colclough was arrested at Hanley bus station, pictured, after kissing the four-year-old girl on the lips while travelling on a bus in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent . She quickly tried to move away but Colclough grabbed her and spun her around before kissing her on the lips. The young girl then pointed Colclough out to her mother when they left the bus and she called the police, who arrested him. Officers then searched his home in Bentilee in Stoke-on-Trent and discovered thousands of indecent images of children on three mobile phones. At Stoke Crown Court he pleaded guilty to sexual assault of a child and nine charges of possession of indecent photographs of children. Yesterday, he was jailed for eight months to run consecutively to a three-year sentence he received for robbery in April. Colclough was also made the subject of a five year sexual offences prevention order and will be on the Sex Offenders’ Register for 10 years. Prosecutor Fiona Cortese told the court the young victim was sitting near the back of the bus in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, with her sister while her family were towards the front. She added: 'He sat next to the girl and engaged her and her sister. Colclough was sentenced to eight months in prison at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court, pictured, after admitting sexually assaulting a child and possession of indecent images of children . 'He asked about the game they were playing. She said she was four years old. He allowed her to see a game on his mobile. 'He asked the girl to give him a kiss. She tried to walk away. He grabbed her by the hand, turned her round, and kissed her on her lips.' Police arrested Colclough at Hanley bus station but also attended his home the next day after he self-harmed. He told police officers he had downloaded indecent images of children and was addicted to the photographs, adding that he 'wasn’t right in the head.' His mobile phones were analysed and found to contain two category A images - the most serious - two at category B and 2,332 at category C. In his police interview, Colclough said kissing the girl on the lips was 'a silly thing to do' and admitted it wasn’t appropriate behaviour. He told officers he was single, didn’t have children, and collected Thomas the Tank Engine trains. Robin Lichfield, defending, said: 'He accepts what he has done is wrong and that there are no excuses at all. 'It was at a time when he was under particular stress at work and he had been drinking. 'He has expressed he is sorry and hopes she is not traumatised and is sorry to the family - these are his words.' But during sentencing, Judge David Fletcher said: 'The timing of the early guilty plea is relevant to the sentence as it was given at the first opportunity. 'A report from Dr Sebastian said you had no medical conditions - but it confirms to me that drinking heavily has affected your well-being. 'The vast majority of images were of a less serious categorisation but one image is particularly grotesque and you should be ashamed.'","Robert Colclough sat next to the girl aged four on a bus in Hanley, Stoke .

"Al Qaeda has released a professionally produced propaganda video blaming U.S. President Barack Obama for the recent deaths of an American and South African hostage in Yemen. The video clip features Nasr bin Ali al-Ansi, a top commander for Al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, accusing Obama of recklessness and warning the United States against attempting to carry out rescue raids on hostages in future. Al-Ansi's comments mark the first time Al Qaeda has made a public statement since British-born U.S national Luke Somers and South African Pierre Korkie were killed when U.S. special forces attacked an Al Qaeda safe house in a failed attempt to rescue the two men last week. The six-minute video - released by the terror group's in-house Al-Malahem media centre - appears to have been shot using an expensive HD camera in the style of the professionally produced and edited films put out by Al Qaeda's Islamic State enemies in Syria and Iraq. Shared on the terror group's social media websites, the slick effort marks a significant step up in professionalism from the grainy films previously released by Al Qaeda and its affiliates. Scroll down for video . Propaganda: The video shows Nasr bin Ali al-Ansi, a top commander for Al Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula, warning Barack Obama Obama  against attempting to carry out rescue raids on hostages in future . Al-Ansi's comments mark the first time Al Qaeda has made a public statement since British-born U.S national Luke Somers (left) and South African Pierre Korkie (right) were killed last week . Speaking in front of a black screen with the chilling sight of the terror group's flag hanging behind him, al-Ansi said he warned the U.S. against attempting to rescue the hostages after a first  operation to do so failed last month. The terror commander accused Obama of recklessness, and said the raid 'caused things to go in a completely different way than we wanted.' Obama previously said he ordered the raid because Somers, a 33-year-old journalist, was believed to be in 'imminent danger.' The president condemned Somers' killing as a 'barbaric murder.' U.S. officials said that about 40 American special forces were involved in the rescue attempt, which followed U.S. drone strikes in the area. The rescuers, backed by Yemeni ground forces, advanced within 100 meters of the compound in Shabwa province when they were spotted by the militants. A firefight ensued, and the raid was over in about 30 minutes, they said. Hard decision: Barack Obama previously said he ordered the raid because Somers, a 33-year-old journalist (pictured in a recent Al Qaeda propaganda video), was believed to be in 'imminent danger' Al-Ansi described the rescue operation as an 'execution order' and that poorly equipped militants fended off heavily armed US forces for nearly three hours. Initial Al Qaeda demands were never clear, but al-Ansi said the terror group wanted to negotiate the release of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay. He also mentioned Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, known as the 'Blind Sheik', who is serving a life sentence in the United States on a terrorism conviction. 'They could have at least negotiated with us about some clauses or show sincerity,' he added. Best laid plans: Navy SEALs made it to within 100 yards of Mr Somers and fellow captive Pierre Korkie but they were executed by their captors before the team could reach them . Al-Ansi also warned that Al Qaeda would continue to 'put the lives of all Americans in danger inside and outside of America ... in the air, on the ground and in the sea.' Washington considers Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to be the most dangerous affiliate of the terror group founded by Osama bin Laden. The group has been linked to several sophisticated plots to attack the U.S. homeland that were either botched or foiled. With the permission of Yemen's government, the U.S. has for years launched drone strikes against militant targets in the country and provided Yemen with hundreds of millions of dollars in security assistance. Civilian casualties from the drone strikes have stoked anger. Hours before the release of the video, the group said that it shelled a Yemeni air base used by U.S. forces. It was not immediately clear if there were casualties. Al Qaeda has issued a veiled warning to ISIS propaganda chiefs by attacking sickening beheading videos as damaging to the international image of Islamic terrorism. In a 43-minute long filmed statement released earlier this week, senior Al Qaeda commander Nasr bin Ali al-Ansi said the terror group would no longer be beheading captives - adding that in future hostage executions would be carried out 'with a bullet'. Although he did not name ISIS, al-Ansi's message - which he said made on behalf of Al Qaeda as a global organisation, not just his  Arab Peninsula branch - was clearly aimed at the terror group led by self-appointed caliph, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. 'No doubt, some of our brothers were affected by seeing scenes of beheadings that were spread recently. We do not accept and we strongly reject them,' he said in a clear reference to ISIS' brutal filmed murders of Americans James Foley, Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig, Britons David Haines and Alan Henning, and 22 Syrian soldiers by the group's executioner in chief, Jihadi John. 'Recording such acts, and spreading them among the people in the name of religion and jihad, we see as a big mistake. It is not acceptable, no matter the justification,' al-Ansi added.","Al Qaeda commander says Obama's 'recklessness' was to blame for deaths of U.S national Luke Somers and South African Pierre Korkie .

"Arsene Wenger knows only too well the importance of finishing top of a Champions League group, which is why it remains so baffling that Arsenal keep qualifying in second position. The Gunners have been eliminated in the last 16 of the competition for the last four seasons after being handed tough draws against Barcelona, AC Milan, Bayern Munich and Bayern again. On three of those occasions Arsenal had finished second in their group. And the bad news for Wenger is that his side are more likely to draw their conquerors of the last two seasons, German giants Bayern, than any other team in the last 16 of this year's Champions League. Arsene Wenger is facing another tough draw in the Champions League last 16 on Monday . Bayern Munich are the team the Gunners have most chance of being drawn against . Sportsmail has brought out the calculators  (with more than a little help from MisterChip) ahead of the draw, which takes place on Monday at UEFA's HQ in Nyon, to work out the probability of each club meeting the other in the next round. The percentage chance of each draw can be seen in the table below. A full explanation of how the draw works can be found below but the upshot will make depressing reading for Wenger and Arsenal fans in particular, with the Gunners' chances of drawing Bayern being 25 per cent. Still, it's not like Wenger hasn't been warned over the last few years. One crumb of comfort comes from the fact that Real Madrid are their joint least likely opponents in the next round. The chance of Arsenal drawing the European champions are just 14 per cent, the same as their chances of facing Atletico Madrid and Porto. Chelsea topped their group so are most likely to face Bayer Leverkusen in the next round . Meanwhile, Jose Mourinho will be delighted to learn that the consequence of Chelsea comfortably topping their group means their most probable opponents are Bayer Leverkusen, the Bundesliga club who remain a shadow of the side which reached the final of this competition in 2002. Indeed, that pairing is the most likely of all the possible match-ups in the last 16, on 29 per cent. Manchester City are also likely to face German opposition, with a 25 per cent chance of drawing Borussia Dortmund. The least likely draws, apart from those which are impossible due to UEFA rules, are: Real Madrid vs Juventus or Shakhtar Donetsk: Barcelona vs Juventus, Shakhtar or Basle; Atletico Madrid vs Shakhtar or Basle; and Porto vs Juventus or Basle. And if you don't believe us, Arsene, just ask Carol Vorderman. * Figures have been rounded to the nearest percentage point. How the Champions League last 16 draw works . Group winners will be drawn against runners-up, with the exception that teams from the same association as well as the same Champions League group cannot face each other. This means Arsenal cannot play Chelsea, Manchester City or Borussia Dortmund . Chelsea cannot play the other English clubs or Schalke, while City will avoid their domestic rivals and Bayern Munich. Seeded group winners will be away in the last-16 first legs on 17/18 and 25/26 February and at home in the return matches on 10/11 and 17/18 March. The draw will take place on Monday at 11am GMT.

"Back in the time when Istanbul was known as Constantinople, it was chariot racing that divided the city. There were four teams - the Blues, the Greens, the Reds and the Whites - and one hundred thousand enraptured spectators, from commoners to the Emperor himself, would assemble at the giant Hippodrome to witness the thunderous clatter of hooves through the blood red dust. But loyalties ran far deeper than raceday. It was a way of life. One did not simply swap allegiances. Each of the teams represented a particular social group, religious denomination or political faction and each inspired and demanded loyalty. Besiktas fans, pictured during their Champions League play-off against Arsenal, are a passionate bunch . Mauricio Pochettino (centre) leads his Tottenham players in training at the Ataturk Stadium on Wednesday . Follow all the latest #UEL action on: . Facebook: UEFAEuropaLeague . Twitter: @EuropaLeague . And at uefa.com . The sport may have changed quite drastically but Istanbul remains a city split into loyal factions. It is a European outpost where football is the way of life and rouses great passions. Like the fans of the chariot teams in Byzantine times, the followers of Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas - to take the city and the whole country's three most successful teams - will always go that extra mile to try and outdo one another. And like those teams of equine chargers, fortunes are always fluctuating. Right now, it is Besiktas, who take on Tottenham Hotspur at the Ataturk Stadium in the UEFA Europa League, who are in the ascendancy. Kyle Walker (left) could make his long-awaited return from injury against the Turkish side on Thursday . Tottenham striker Harry Kane scores against Besiktas during their first Europa League clash in October . Besiktas currently top the Turkish Super Lig. They have lost just two of their 12 league matches so far and in both were handicapped by having a man sent off. The Europa League has brought further gains for their manager Slaven Bilic, formerly of West Ham and Everton during his playing days. Like Spurs, they remain unbeaten in Group C and know one last win will take them through as winners. And so those passionate fans will take it as their duty to create one of those formidable and fearsome Turkish atmospheres that have cowed so many visitors in the past. It's a given we will see the booming drums and exploding pyrotechnics within the cavernous 76,000-seater Ataturk - the venue where Liverpool so miraculously won the Champions League in 2005 - on Thursday night. Besiktas don't seem to have been affected by being in a state of flux this season. They left their crumbling Inonu Stadium, on the banks of the Bosphorus and close to the Dolmabahce Palace and Taksim Square, last year to take up temporary residence at the big Olympic arena out of the city centre. Home fans at the Ataturk Stadium light flares as they get behind the Turkish giants back in August . Kane, who is second top scorer in the Europa League this season, celebrates his goal against Besiktas . Kick-off: Thursday, December 11, 6pm . TV: ITV 4 . By the end of the campaign, their new home, the Vodafone Arena, is due to be completed - with 9,000 more fans to be accommodated. Spurs would already have sewn up the group if not for Demba Ba's last-gasp penalty at White Hart Lane. The former West Ham, Newcastle and Chelsea hotshot has been scoring everywhere for Besiktas and has 16 goals in 18 matches since leaving Stamford Bridge. Luckily for Mauricio Pochettino and his all-too-often shaky defence, Ba is likely to be ruled out of the match with an injured toe. Not that Spurs are at all fazed by such hostile places. They are unbeaten in 18 Europa League group stage matches, surviving and thriving in such cauldrons as Lazio, Panathinaikos and Partizan Belgrade in the recent past. Besiktas striker Demba Ba, pictured scoring from the spot against Spurs, will miss the game with a broken toe . The Europa League has certainly served as a springboard for Harry Kane. His seven goals in the competition seem to have finally convinced Pochettino to install him as the club's No 1 striker in the Premier League as well and the England Under 21 man should prosper. He is the group phase's second top scorer, behind Alan of Red Bull Salzburg and so has personal glory to chase in Turkey's largest city. For both these sides, there are incentives to finish on top of the group. In the last 32 draw the 12 group winners are combined with the four teams with the best records dropping down from the Champions League. Inter Milan and Fiorentina are just two of the teams they would avoid. And, for the first time, the winners of the Europa League will gain entry into next season's Champions League. A particularly important prize for Spurs, given their disappointing Premier League form. So, in this bustling, historic metropolis of 14 million people at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, there is, as there has always been throughout time, everything to play for.","Besiktas host Tottenham in the Europa League on Thursday, KO 6pm .

"It is a tradition going back 150 years, with hardened swimmers jumping into the sea at Brighton on a crisp Christmas Day. But Brighton and Hove City Council has decided it will close the beach on Christmas Day over 'safety fears' after a man got into difficulty in the waters earlier this year and another swimmer had to be rescued while taking part in the event three years ago. Brighton Swimming Club agreed to follow the council's lead and cancel its annual festive swim after its dedicated group of 30 experienced swimmers taking part has swelled to 4,000 revellers turning up at the beach in fancy dress and after heavy drinking in recent years. Scroll down for video . Brighton and Hove City Council has banned a Christmas day swim after two previous incidents and will be closing its beaches around Palace Pier to prevent revellers taking part in the swim, as they did in 2011 . The Christmas Day swim in Brighton has seen thousands turn out to take part, like this reveller in 2010 . A spokesman for the council said: 'This year the council will be taking extra measures to discourage swimmers from taking a Christmas Day dip by closing the beaches around the Palace Pier.' The council said it had decided to close the beach after fears over the safety of people getting into the water on Christmas day. An experienced male swimmer had to be rescued in October and a spokesman said they were concerned a similar thing could happen during the festive swim. Also in 2012 a woman died during a similar swim in Hastings and a year earlier a man had to be rescued. Seafront Manager Chris Ingall added: 'Sea swimming takes skill, stamina and knowledge of the physical dangers and should only be for the very experienced, using suitable wetsuits, in very calm conditions and with a friend. 'Even on a calm day sea currents, undertow or a sudden change in weather can create life threatening hazards without warning. 'Even experienced swimmers can get caught out.' The cancellation ends a 150 year tradition for Brighton Swimming Club. Fiona Southwell, sea swimming coach at the club, said it was a shame for club members but necessary to ensure people's safety as the event had become so large and unwieldy it was dangerous. In 2011 dozens of swimmers turned up at Brighton beach for the swim and a man had to be rescued . In 2009 a team of Santas took part in the swim, but fancy dress can make it dangerous for the inexperienced . She said there are no lifeguards on the beach on Christmas Day and it was impossible to rely on the swimming club and the RNLI to look after thousands of people who lack understanding of the tides and risks of swimming in such cold temperatures. She said: 'It's become unsafe. We have an 8C sea that people have to get into by jumping off a shelf. People are not aware of the environment and dangers. 'Hypothermia was one of the biggest problems we had and the event just became unmanageable. It went from being a club-only swim to a massive public. 'When it started there were about 30 people in our club taking part. In 2008 a Christmas day swimmer is pictured in full Santa outfit taking part in the swim in freezing waters . 'But our club basically became responsible for looking after 4,000 ridiculous people in costumes who were throwing themselves in the sea after drinking alcohol.' Ms Southwell was one of the people who rescued a man taking part in the event three years ago, who had been drinking heavily the night before and had come in fancy dress - which can often restrict swimmers once they are in the water. She added: 'The biggest turnout we ever had was when we nearly lost a member of the public. I and three other club members had to go in and save this man. That was really the end of the line. 'We fully support the council. We are sad that we've had to stop a 150 year tradition but we fully support this for health and safety reasons.' Last year as the south of Britain was battered by heavy rain and storms Brighton and Hove Council also closed the Palace Pier in a bid to stop people venturing into the sea. Members of Brighton Swimming Club, pictured in 2002, will not be able to take part in the swim after the club cancelled the event because it has become dangerous with too many inexperienced people turning up . Brighton Swimming Club said people have been turning up without knowledge of the dangers of swimming in cold waters and often after a heavy night's drinking, putting themselves in danger once they get in the sea . Ms Southwell added: 'We supported this action by the council. What we do is pretty extreme and specialised. We can't be seen as a bad example and encouraging the normal public to think it's ok to do what we do.' She said it was especially dangerous at Brighton because the pier is shelved - meaning people have to drive straight into the freezing waters to take part. At beaches like in Exmouth, where the Christmas Day swim is still due to take place this year, the risks are much lower as people are able to walk into the sea from the wide beach. Last year dozens of swimmers braved the cold to swim in the Serpentine in London for the Peter Pan Cup . Serpentine Swimming Club said the popular Christmas Day swim would be going ahead as planned this year . Serpentine swimming club, based in London, is also going ahead with an annual Christmas Day swim this year. It will be the 150th anniversary of the event, which begins at 9am as swimmers compete for the Peter Pan Cup. Author J M Barrie became associated with the Christmas Day race in 1903 and donated the first cup for the winner. The traditional Saundersfoot swim, this year with a World War One theme, will also take place on New Year's Day in Wales.","Brighton and Hove Council to close beach used for Christmas Day swim .

"A German national has been charged in federal court with sneaking onto a container ship in California in the hopes of catching a ride to South Korea to be with his pregnant wife. According to court documents, on September 21st Andreas Guenther rowed in an inflatable raft through the Port of Oakland to the Cosco Oceania. He was able to board the ship undetected at 2:30 am, but was discovered by crew members a short time later and removed by the Coast Guard. He told the Coast Guard that he attempted the voyage because his passport had expired, and he did not want to wait to get a new one. The Cosco Oceania on which Guenther attempted to stowaway . The 2008-built Hong Kong-registered vessel is 1,145ft long and has a gross tonnage of 115,776 tonnes, according to Vesselfinder.com. The San Francisco Chronicle reported on Tuesday that Guenther's story has changed since his initial interview by the Coast Guard. Originally he told them that he had purchased a $5,000 visitor pass for the ship from a man named 'Li', and that a friend had taken him to the ship. Two months later his story changed and he said that he had made his own way to the ship and that he had bought a $500 'vessel pass' from a man in San Francisco's Chinatown. The punishment for being a stowaway is a fine or up to five years in prison. Information on the website of the German Consulate in San Francisco states that passports can be renewed by appointment with between one and nine weeks' notice.

"A witness gave evidence for an hour before anyone realised she was not speaking English. Judge Nicholas Madge (pictured) was eventually told she was speaking Krio, an African Creole variant . A woman gave evidence in a rape trial for an hour before anyone realised she was not speaking English. She was testifying against a preacher who allegedly raped her and sexually assaulted her schoolgirl daughter after claiming she had been ‘cursed’ by witchcraft. Barristers asked the witness to speak more slowly and stand further from the microphone so the jury could understand her, blaming her accent and the courtroom’s ‘acoustics’. But finally court clerk Christiana Kyemenu-Caiquo realised the problem – the witness was not speaking English at all, but Krio, an African Creole variant that is native to Sierra Leone. Miss Kyemenu-Caiquo, who also hails from Sierra Leone, told Judge Nicholas Madge about the unfortunate situation about an hour into yesterday’s proceedings. In desperation, the judge swore the clerk in to interpret for the 38-year-old witness, and a new clerk was found to replace her on the bench. But the interpreter was barely used as the witness – who cannot be named for legal reasons – repeated the words ‘I can’t remember’ in response to almost every question. Gilbert Deya, 61, a Kenyan preacher who runs Gilbert Deya Ministries, is charged with four counts of rape, one of attempted rape, two of sexual assault and one of battery. His church, said to have a UK membership of 36,000, is run from a large unit on an industrial estate on the edge of Peckham, south-east London. The witness, who is originally from Freetown, Sierra Leone, claims to have been the subject of Deya’s abuse for up to eight years. But after numerous complaints during her evidence that the woman could not be understood, the judge appointed Miss Kyemenu-Caiquo to help. He told jurors: ‘Although not a standard interpretation … we are actually going to use Chrissy as something a bit like an interpreter.’ Miss Kyemenu-Caiquo then swore the standard interpreters’ oath and joined the witness in the box. A woman gave evidence at Inner London Crown Court (pictured) for more than an hour before anyone realised she was not speaking English . Inner London Crown Court has heard that Deya’s alleged victim had come to Britain from Sierra Leone in 2003 and visited his church in Peckham in January 2006. Krio is spoken by about 97 per cent of the population of Sierra Leone and unites a number of different ethnic groups in the West African nation. The language is native to the Sierra Leone Creole people, a community of about 300,000 descendants of freed slaves from the West Indies, United States and Britain. It is believed to date back to the 17th and 18th centuries when an English-based ‘pidgin’ language emerged to facilitate the coastal trade between Europeans and Africans. However, English is Sierra Leone’s official language and despite its common use, Krio has no official status in the country. She came under Deya’s influence when she was convinced by her friends he was the only man who could cure voices in her head that were preventing her from sleeping, the court has been told. But he kept the woman as a sex slave in a small room at one of his churches – forcing her to have an abortion when she became pregnant, it is alleged. The court has heard that the first rape happened in late 2006 or early 2007 when Deya may have drugged the victim’s cup of tea before attacking her. The preacher, of Peckham, later sexually assaulted her daughter by groping her breasts, the court was told. He denies all charges. A spokesman from Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service said the witness had been speaking a form of English ‘with an extremely strong accent’ that made it hard for the court to understand. The spokesman added: ‘As a result, she was asked to repeat phrases and sentences … Even then it was difficult to understand. Gilbert Deya, pictured centre, is on trial at Inner London Crown Court  charged with sexual offences . ‘The court clerk is also from Sierra Leone and could understand everything the witness said so it was agreed that the clerk would take the interpreter’s oath and assist. ‘She did not translate what the witness said but, when necessary, repeated in clear English those passages which could not be understood.’ Krio is spoken by about 97 per cent of Sierra Leone’s population and is native to the Creole people – descendants of freed slaves from the West Indies, United States and Britain. It is believed to date back to an English-based pidgin language that emerged in the 17th and 18th centuries. The trial continues.

"The co-founder of the Stereosonic music festival  has vented his frustration at the violent thugs who started a mass brawl at Sydney's Showgrounds. Frank Cotela took to his Facebook page to lay into the 'roided up' bros who took part in the vicious punch-up, which saw one man knocked unconscious amid a flurry of punches from a group of men. A video, which surfaced online shows about 20 well-built men throwing punches in the mosh pit of the stage. Cotela lashed out at the 'muscle men', warning that there will be changes on the way for festival-goers who think they can ruin the day for everyone else. Fight back: Stereosonic co-founder Frank Cotela, seen here with Katy Perry, attacked the group of men who had started a fight at his festival . He aired his frustration on Facebook about the mass brawl at Sydney's Showgrounds . 'Everyone is over The Roid up Bro's muscle culture,' he said. 'Can't they just see that they are a laughing stock… Brother EVERYONE is laughing at your Shorts, singlets, fake tans, bumbags and cartoon shaped bodies … but more importantly we are sick of the charged up violence you bring.' Cotela hinted that there may be changes at next year's Stereosonic festival, claiming organisers may profile each festival-goer at the gate and refuse entry if necessary. 'If it means that we will profile you at entry point and stop you entering - you will be stopped!' he said.

Security guards in high-vis shirts can be seen failing to apprehend the wild brawl during the video. Co-founder Frank Cotela has warned that there will be changes at next year's festival . The co-founder's post comes after journalism student Joel Bevilacqua wrote a scathing Facebook message to his followers, blasting the 'bruzzers' for their antics and shaming them for the world to see. 'This 3 minute fight will be the highlight of your sad miserable life. And guess what? You're still not getting laid.., he said, referring to the three minute video posted online. 'You bruzzers will flock in the thousands with your short shorts, cheap spray tans and expensive pingas that you were told would be 'worth it bro',' he said. 'What I don't understand is that every year you get made fun of, and yet sure enough the next year you go and do the exact same thing. 'So something must not be getting through to you, therefore let me make it very clear. We hate you.' Bevilacqua continued with his damning post, in the hope that one of the fighters would stumble across it and perhaps gain a guilty conscience over the fight. 'I hope, I really really hope that one of you 'people' in the fight sees this, and for the first time in your life you have a good long hard think,' he said. One party-goers antics went viral after he tried to take a photos with his credit card . In the disturbing video, security guards in high visibility shirts can be seen failing to stop the wild brawl, while surrounding punters barely bat an eyelid at the man who is lying unconscious, continuing to dance around him. Richard Calugay, who watched the fight first hand, told Daily Mail Australia it started with pushing. ‘Someone pushed me in the back and the whole crowd started backing up. One of the guys king hit the guy in a blue shorts and knocked him out, and then it was on’ he said. ‘The guy was knocked out cold. I saw him get carried away by his mates, and we left the stage at that point, but I heard the fight kept on going afterwards.’ Mr Calugay said security were simply outnumbered at the event. ‘I think the security were reluctant to get involved because of the size of the guys and the amount of people around. They were outnumbered and didn’t think it was worth the risk.’ Mr Calugay said he believes the type and the number of festival-goers set the scene for a brawl. ‘I think Stereosonic is a very alpha-male festival. There are a lot of big guys in there, and when you mix that with a crowd of that size, you have a recipe for violence.’ The co-founder's comments come after a video appeared online showing a woman dancing naked around the festival grounds . He said he saw other fights throughout the day that weren't filmed. The clip has received hundreds of thousands of views since being uploaded. NSW police said they were disappointed with the large number of revellers found in possession of prohibited drugs at the music festival. There were 196 people found in possession of prohibited drugs at the festival, including MDMA, cocaine, cannabis, GHB and Ketamine. It comes just a week after the music festival displayed a number of hilarious and the most shocking videos from the festival when it hit Sydney.

"EU boss Jean-Claude Juncker acted like a ‘business partner’ to Amazon when he was prime minister of Luxembourg, a former company boss claimed . EU boss Jean-Claude Juncker acted like a ‘business partner’ to web giant Amazon when he was prime minister of Luxembourg, a former company boss claimed last night. Bob Comfort, the firm’s former head of tax, reportedly said the Luxembourg government ‘helped solve problems’ for the business. In comments reported by the Guardian newspaper, Mr Comfort said: ‘The Luxembourg government presents itself as a business partner and I think it’s an accurate description. It helps to solve problems.’ He said Mr Juncker’s message was: ‘if you encounter problems which you don’t seem to be able to resolve, please come back and tell me. I’ll try to help.’ Amazon’s tax deal with the Duchy is under investigation by the European Commission over the tax arrangements granted to the firm in 2003. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by the company but the deal reportedly helped it save large sums on tax it would otherwise have paid. Mr Juncker is under pressure to clarify his part in such dealings. Yesterday British ministers released details of a new so-called ‘Google tax’ on multinational firms who divert profits out of the country to avoid paying tax. In a statement quoted by the Guardian, Amazon said it was treated the same as any other company in Luxembourg and did not receive ‘special tax treatment’. The newspaper also reported that Mr Comfort now had an official role as Luxembourg’s ‘honorary consul for the Seattle region’. Mr Juncker has come under immense pressure over his role in securing generous tax deals for dozens of major firms, and faced repeated calls to resign. Last month the scandal erupted over claims that some 340 global companies were granted deals to help them avoid tax during his 18 years in office. Firms including Pepsi and Ikea are said to have signed ‘sweetheart deals’ with the tiny country to avoid paying billions in tax in other EU countries. Amazon said it was treated the same as any other company in Luxembourg and did not receive ‘special tax treatment’. Leaked legal documents appeared to show the arrangements allowed some major companies to enjoy near zero tax rates. Mr Juncker denied he was the architect of Luxembourg’s tax regime and behind the cosy tax deals agreed with dozens of global companies. But speeches he made over the two decades he was leader of the tiny duchy showed him taking credit for bringing in major corporations. The Wall Street Journal, which uncovered the comments, said they showed he was a ‘point man for selling the country’s tax system around the world’. Mr Juncker admitted he was ‘politically responsible’ for what took place in Luxembourg during his time in charge but has denied direct involvement. He added: ‘There is nothing in my past indicating that my ambition was to organise tax evasion in Europe.’ He also survived a censure vote In the European Parliament. However, Mr Comfort’s claims leave him with further questions to answer. In May 2003, Mr Juncker told the Luxembourg parliament he had led negotiated deals with internet giants Amazon and AOL to bring them to the grand duchy. He said at the time: ‘That AOL and Amazon come to Luxembourg, that with and through them we get a new perspective to the future, is the result of a correct tax policy, of a correct infrastructure policy, but also the result of tough negotiations with the top management of the groups.’ ‘They took place in America, they took place here at home, and I did not lead them alone.’","Former exec said Luxembourg government 'helped to solve problems'

"She shot to instant fame after posting a series of racy selfies online, attracting praise from some for making politics sexy while other criticised her for cheapening it. But now Karen Danczuk, the wife of MP Simon Danczuk, 47, has decided to sell signed pictures of herself posing in a bikini on eBay. The 31-year-old mother of two and Rochdale councillor said she decided to bow to public demand and sell the  pictures of herself for £10, which she insists is simply good business sense and a way of interacting with people. Mrs Danczuk has promised each photo will be signed, scented and personally sent and is already having to order more copies after she sold 400 in less than 24 hours and attracted more than 4,000 views to the listing. Scroll down for video . Karen Danczuk, a councillor in Rochdale and the wife of MP Simon Danczuk, is selling this selfie, showing her cleavage, on eBay for £10 which she says will be signed, scented and personally sent by her . The selfie is on sale for £10 on eBay and will be personally signed and scented by the Rochdale councillor . According to the eBay listing each photo, which features the councillor in a bikini top and sunglasses, is sprayed with her favourite Chanel perfume. 'I decided to do it because I was getting a lot of messages online asking me for signed picture,' Mrs Danczuk told MailOnline. 'I'm just naturally business minded and decided it would make sense.' Mrs Danczuk had started offering a picture free to buyers of her old clothes, which she had found when she cleared out her wardrobe after losing half a stone. But she said 'demand' meant she had decided to sell just the photos on their own. She added: 'I chose it because I think it's just a nice natural photo. It's makeup-free and it's not overtly provocative or sexual. I thought if people want it why not do it. 'I've had a lot of interest and didn't actually think it would be this popular. I've suddenly realised it's less than two weeks to Christmas and I'm going to be spending my time signing and sending out selfies.' Mrs Danczuk said her husband didn't mind her selling the photo and was used to her taking a business-like attitude. Mrs Danczuk has become known for posting a number of selfies, particularly charting her exercise regime . But she said she feared she may need to order more pictures as she has already sold more than double the 200 she had printed. She also said she had decided to spray the photos with her favourite Chanel scent, likening the idea to the scented love letters people used to post. The councillor has become known as 'Mrs Selfie' for the number of snaps of herself she regularly posts online, particularly tracking her exercise regime. She has posted dozens of selfies in recent months and more than 60 since July. Her selfies have seen her rise to fame, gaining more than 20,000 followers in just a few months. Mrs Danczuk has posted a number of cleavage baring selfies on her Twitter account but said the pictures she has been sharing were 'not meant to be sexy' after the councillor was accused of cheapening politics . But the publicity has also come with its downsides. In August former Conservative MP Louise Mensch described her as 'Westminster's most embarrassing wife' and claimed she was cheapening politics for constantly posting pictures of her cleavage. Her husband however defended his wife at the time, posting on Twitter: 'Proud of my wife — brains and beauty!' And Mrs Danczuk, who owns a deli with a husband, said the pictures were 'not meant to be sexy.' She added: 'I've never done a full bikini shot and a lot of my pictures are make-up free. This is something I just do in my own time. The mother of two has posted more than 60 selfies in the last six months to her more than 25,000 followers . Mrs Danczuk married Labour MP Simon Danczuk  in 2012 and the couple, of Rochdale, have two young sons . The councillor said she had bowed to demand to sell the selfie, after first offering it free with old clothes . 'I'm very expressive as a person and I think these pictures just help to build up a picture of me. It's where we are as a society. 'It's a way of taking the blankness out of life when people are often too standoffish. At the end of the day it is just a postcard. 'A lady even said to me the other day it was ""so nice for Rochdale to be associated with glamour.""' Mrs Danczuk married Mr Danczuk in 2012 and the pair have two sons, Milton, six, and Maurice, four.","Karen Danczuk, 31, is selling signed pictures of herself for £10 on eBay .

"A New York woman is going after her millionaire husband for everything he's got after allegedly catching him cheating on her and then shutting her out of their Long Island country club membership. Sheri Astrachen is suing her husband, real estate executive Matthew Astrachen, for defamation in the Manhattan Supreme Court and is seeking $20 million in damages. She claims he humiliated her at the Old Westbury Golf & Country Club, which has a rule to publicly list the names of people with unpaid bills on notices in the locker rooms and did so with her. 'This has had the intended effect of falsely making it appear to the Old Westbury Club and its constituent members, who are also neighbors and friends of [Sheri], that [she] is without the economic resources and assets to maintain pay for membership privileges,' court papers obtained by The New York Post said. Bitter breakup: Sheri Astrachen is suing her husband, real estate executive Matthew Astrachen, for defamation in the Manhattan Supreme Court and is seeking $20 million in damages . Matthew Astrachen is the vice president of commercial real estate firm JLL (Jones Lang LaSalle Incorporated) and earns $4 million a year. He and Sheri have been married for 18 years and have three daughters. However, according to The Post, Sheri caught her husband cheating with 'one or more sales girls in New York City shops'. She then kicked him out of their $4.7 million Old Westbury home. The pair first filed for divorce last year but it is yet to be finalized. The lawsuit claims Matthew Astrachen fought back by not paying the country club bill and cancelling some of his wife's credit cards. The move was 'economic and emotional warfare', the suit said. Estranged: Sheri and Michael Astrachen were married 18 years and have three daughters, but filed for divorce last year . Sheri Astrachen maintains that she should be able to enjoy the same luxuries she did when they were married even though they are now estranged. Among the luxuries are a $150,000 Maserati, $100,000 in yearly vacations, their home, golf-club membership, $150,000 for a summer rental in the Hamptons, three housekeepers and nannies, and leases on a S550 Mercedes and Cadillac Escalade. Mr Astrachen's lawyer, Steven Schlesinger, told The Post that the lawsuit was frivolous. 'We don’t comment on frivolous litigation except to say that we intend to move to have the lawyer sanctioned,' he said.","Sheri and Michael Astrachen were married 18 years and have three daughters .

"For years, pilots flying into combat have jammed enemy radar to confuse or sneak up on their opponents - and it turns out moths do this too. Hawkmoths in Borneo have been found to emit sonic pulses, generated by rubbing their genitals on their abdomens, in response to the high-frequency sounds created by bats. Bats use this echolocation to pinpoint, with great precision, the location of its prey, but the pulses are thought to ‘jam’ these signals to confuse and disorientate the mammals. Scroll down for video . Hawkmoths in Borneo (left) create sonic pulses by rubbing their genitals on their abdomens. These pulses are designed to respond to high-frequency sounds created by bats (right). Bats use echolocation to pinpoint, with precision, the location of prey, but the pulses are thought to ‘jam’ these signals to confuse the mammals . ‘Bats and moths have been engaged in aerial warfare for nearly 65 million years,’ explained assistant professor Jesse Barber from Boise State University. ‘This arms race has produced a suite of counter-adaptations in moths, including bat-detecting ears. ‘One set of defensive strategies involves the active production of sound; ultrasonic replies to bat attack have been shown to startle bats, warn the predators of bad taste and jam their biosonar.’ Pilots typically use radar jamming and deception during warfare. Aircraft emits radio frequency signals designed to interfere with nearby radar equipment. In the case of electronic jamming, the pilots block the receiver with electrical energy signals. Mechanical jamming devices, instead, reflect radar energy back to the radar. This tricks the rival pilot into thinking the target is somewhere else on its scope. It is thought the hawkmoths sonic pulses act in a similar way to mechanical jamming on the bat's ability to pinpoint their prey. In the Conquest of the Skies footage, the bat is shown attempting to grab the moth, before missing. Professor Barber, alongside co-author Akito Kawahara from the University of Florida, have been studying this behaviour in Malaysia. By tethering a hawkmoth to a wire, and releasing a bat into a controlled environment, the team were able to track the movements and sounds of both using cameras and high-definition microphones. It was previously known that tiger moths exhibit a similar defensive strategy - using tymbals, a vibrating membrane located on the thorax - but this genital technique was the first time it was observed in hawkmoths. Slow-motion videos revealed that males make the noise by grating modified scraper scales on the outside of the ‘claspers’ against the abdomen. These claspers, or genital valves, are typically used to grab females during mating. However, it is thought that females also produce ultrasound in response to an echolocation attack. They appear to pull part of their genitalia towards their bodies, so the genital scales also rub against their abdomens. The study is published in Biology Letters, a journal of the Royal Society, and footage of the moths and bats in action features on Sir David Attenborough’s upcoming Conquest of the Skies series. Slow-motion videos reveal males make the noise by grating modified scraper scales on the outside of the ‘claspers’ against the abdomen (pictured bottom). While females appear to pull part of their genitalia towards their bodies, so the genital scales also rub against their abdomens. A recording of the signal is pictured top . ‘This is just the first step toward understanding a really interesting system,’ Professor Kawahara said. ‘Echolocation research has been focused on porpoises, whales and dolphins. We know some insects produce the sounds, but this discovery in an unrelated animal making ultrasound, potentially to jam the echolocation of bats, is exciting.’ Hawkmoths are among the fastest and most proficient flying insects, and more than 1,400 species can be found worldwide. Their long proboscis, or mouthpart, makes them important pollinators and many plants may only be pollinated by hawkmoths. This recording shows the hawkmoth responding to playback of a bat echolocation attack. Hawkmoths are among the fastest and most proficient flying insects, and more than 1,400 species can be found worldwide . ‘We think hawkmoths are a primary food source for bats because none appear to be chemically defended, which is why they have evolved anti-bat ultrasound strategies,’ Professor Kawahara continued. ‘Hawkmoths have evolved different ways of avoiding bats - I can’t even explain how amazing the system is, it is just fascinating.’ The Conquest of the Skies 3D series details the evolution of flight and also reveals how flies perform acrobatics in mid-air, how dragonflies use four wings, and how hummingbirds are able to fly sideways. The series starts 7pm, New Year’s Day, Sky 3D and in 2D on Sky 1. ‘The story of evolutionary flight is one I’ve always wanted to tell in 3D,’ said Sir David. ‘It’s a wonderful subject and a very exciting project but technically it is a huge challenge, especially in 3D.’ The Conquest of the Skies series details the evolution of flight and also reveals how flies perform acrobatics in mid-air, how dragonflies use four wings, and how hummingbirds fly sideways.

"Miami has been crowned as the most festive city in the US, topping a top ten list of holiday locations which, surprisingly, features a large majority of other warm weather locations such as Texas, Georgia and North Carolina. Despite the unlikelihood of enjoying a White Christmas in any of the five southern states featured on the list, online retailer Zulily has declared that it is the sunnier cities such as Austin, Raleigh and Tulsa which are ‘most ready for the 2014 holiday season’ because of the high numbers of festive purchases made in these locations. Using information from its own customer database, the web-based company compiled a list of the top ten cities where the most Christmas-themed products, from tree ornaments to toys, were purchased and revealed that four of the top five festive cities are all located in the south of the country. While Seattle, Washington, and Colorado Springs, Colorado, were ranked fifth and sixth respectively, Houston was ranked seventh, proving Texas has yuletide cheer to spare, with two cities on the list.

Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Las Vegas, Nevada, came in eighth and ninth, while Charlotte was ranked tenth, giving North Carolina its second spot on the list. As well as seasonal items such as Christmas ornaments and baking sheets, the list also took into account the popularity of merchandise from the hit Disney film Frozen, deemed to be one of the hottest holiday items for kids this year. In fact, Zulily’s findings also revealed the country’s top ten 'most Frozen crazed' cities, with Miami coming in at the top of that list too, followed by Colorado Springs; Portland, Oregon; Omaha, Nebraska; and Las Vegas.

Amy E. Goodman, Zulily's lifestyle editor, said that residents of the cities included on both lists started their shopping well before November. 'Even the earliest Black Friday sales aren’t soon enough for the cities on this list,' she said. 'This year’s top 10 started making holiday purchases well before the weather changed. The yuletide spirit has been strongest in the South, as Southern cities make up more than half the list.'

"More than 350 ancient Roman statues and artifacts have been found buried in the overgrown garden of the British ambassador in Rome. The important collection had been hidden for decades in the garden which had been allowed to grow wild after years of neglect. During a painstaking three-year landscaping project to restore the garden to its former glory, gardeners were astonished to find the statues, each covered in moss, lichen and slime. Rare statues and artifacts have been found buried in the overgrown garden of the British embassy in Rome . The works include carved reliefs of wild boar, satyrs, griffons and goddesses. They were found beneath a carpet of soil and leaf litter during works to landscape the garden of Villa Wolkonsky - once the home of a Russian princess. Now, the marble statues and funerary reliefs have been cleaned and restored by experts and went on display today for the first time. They are currently on show in the villa's 10-acre garden and experts say they are important from both an artistic and an archaeological point of view. The villa itself is a palazzo and has been the residence of the British ambassador to Italy since the end of World War Two. The restoration of the garden is being led by Nina Prentice, the wife of the ambassador, Christopher Prentice. An expert has said this funerary relief showing five freed slaves and a child is 'very rare' and unusual . The works include carved reliefs of wild boar, satyrs, griffons and goddesses and were found during works to landscape the garden of Villa Wolkonsky, the British ambassador's home in Rome . 'Everything had slid into ruin and was covered in muck,' Mrs Prentice told The Telegraph. 'Every time we ventured into a different part of the garden, there would be another amazing statue. I just kept saying to myself, ""I can't believe it.""' The rediscovered artifacts include stone reliefs from ancient Roman tombs showing the faces of freed slaves, their wives and children. Other friezes feature chariot races and the ritual sacrifice of bulls. Mrs Prentice told the paper she found ancient sarcophagi used as plant pots and Roman capitols wedged underneath slabs of marble to form benches. Dr Dirk Booms, a curator from the British Museum, told the paper the funerary relief showing five freed slaves and a child is 'very rare'. He said: 'They have Greek names, suggesting they were Greek slaves who were freed by their Roman owners. The collection is an important part of the story of Rome.' The statues were found in the garden of Villa Wolkonsky (pictured) - once the home of a Russian princess . This statue, which is missing a head, is one of the 350 found in the garden of the British ambassador in Rome . The villa was originally owned by a socialite Russian princess, Zenaǐde Wolkonsky, who lived there during the 1830s. Many of the artefacts came from a nearby Roman necropolis and were used to decorate the garden while she lived there. During this time she made her home the meeting place of artists and writers and the villa was frequently visited by Karl Brullov, Alexander Ivanov and Sir Walter Scott. Nikolai Gogol wrote much of Dead Souls at the villa. It was eventually sold to the German government in 1920, becoming the German embassy and ambassador's residence. The Telegraph reports that during Nazi occupation of Rome in 1943 and 1944, the villa's underground bomb shelter was used to hold Italian civilians, some of whom were reportedly tortured by the Gestapo. After the Liberation of Rome in 1944, the Italian government took over the property, and it was placed under the Allied Control Commission. For a short time it was occupied by the Swiss legation and then the Italian Red Cross. When the British embassy at Rome's Porta Pia was blown up  in 1946, the Italian government allowed the British government to use the villa as a temporary embassy and residence. The United Kingdom then purchased the villa in 1951. When the new UK Embassy was reopened at its original location in 1971, the offices moved back to Porta Pia and the villa reverted to its role as Her Majesty's Ambassador's Residence. The unusual finds have been described by experts are 'an important part of the story of Rome'","Collection of 350 ancient Roman statues and marble friezes discovered .

"Life in rural Britain has come a long way since John Constable painted his idyllic scenes of men driving cattle, and transporting hay with wooden carts. Now, farmers have a host of technology at their fingertips - from robotic milking machines to drones - that make their farms more efficient than ever before. And while self-driving tractors might be on some farmers’ wish lists, GPS steering systems for the machines are already widely used, and were recently named the top piece of farming technology. Futuristic farmers are embracing technology such as robotic milking machines and drones to make their farms more efficient than ever before. More technology on farms could improve animal welfare, reduce reliance on chemicals and free up time, Farmers Weekly told MailOnline . Robot milking machines and smartphones . were the second most popular pieces of technology used on farms, . according to the survey run by Farmers Weekly. While farmers already use some of the technology listed, few farms can afford all the cutting-edge kit at the moment. According to the poll, the top 10 acts as a prediction of the future of farming, when more farms will one day use most of the equipment. 'Farming is becoming increasingly technical and high-tech machines allow farmers to be more accurate, decrease wastage and boost productivity and their profits margins, which are increasingly tight these days,' James Andrews of Farmers Weekly told MailOnline. GPS Steering systems make steering straight lines across fields easy, and are widely used by farmers working small and large farms, Andrews continued. This innovation got just over a third of votes. Before GPS, it was down to the driver to keep the tractor straight to avoid using too much seed, fertiliser or fuel, but today many farmers have some form of GPS steering, which means overlapping has all but disappeared. This has resulted in significant savings and improved productivity, which is why the innovation is a firm favourite with tech-savvy farmers. Elsewhere, increasing numbers of cows are milked by robot and almost one in five farmers named robotic milking machines as their favourite farm innovation. The machines allow cows to be milked whenever they like, and because the computer knows which cow is which, the teats are perfectly aligned each time, resulting in better animal welfare, while boosting farm efficiency. 'The technology gives farmers tied to their farms 24/7 more time to manage their herd. It's better for cows as they are left to their own devices and it improves the milk yield,' Andrews added. Some farmers also sung the praises of robot livestock feeders, which mean they don’t have to get up at 5am to feed livestock and ensure that their animals get a consistent ration of food. Like many other businesses, farmers rely on smartphones and they use apps to optimise their combine harvester settings, check soil depth, register livestock, and even find out which cows are in heat. GPS Steering systems make ploughing straight lines across fields (pictured) easy and are widely used by farmers working small and large farms. The innovation got just over a third of votes in the survey of farmers' favourite technology, possibly because it reduces wastage, saves time and has all but eliminated overlapping . A total of five per cent of farmers voted for cow heat detection devices, used to electronically monitor cows so they can calf at the . right time. A heat detection collar is placed on the cow within a week . of calving. The collar detects raised levels of physical activity hourly . and this data is used to boost pregnancy rates. The same amount said that they favour combine harvester yield . meters, which monitor, display and record grain yield alongside moisture . content, speed, area, work rate and harvest rate. This technology allows . farmers to map the yield across harvesting and apply the correct amount . of fertiliser. Andrews said: ‘For centuries, farmers have looked for ways to be as efficient as possible and as these results show, that trend is alive and well today, with new and even greater innovation on the horizon.’ One of those innovations is a self-driving tractor. The technology is only at prototype stage, but farmers are keen to adopt it as it could save them considerable time. One of the closest systems to commercial launch involves two tractors that are connected via satellite navigation and radio. The manned master tractor leads a second driverless tractor, which can either follow directly behind with a different implement or be offset to do the same task. A drone's-eye-view: Farmers are beginning to adopt drone technology to get a bird's eye view of their land (illustrated). They can be used to monitor livestock, spot weeds, take pictures that show how much fertilizer needs to be applied to crops and can even to scare off pigeons that eat valuable seed . While drones might already be used for military purposes, farmers are beginning to adopt the technology to get a bird’s eye view of their land. They can spot weeds, take pictures that show how much fertilizer needs to be applied and can even scare off pigeons that eat valuable seed. 'Drones are in their infancy but they're starting to take off. The technology is getting cheaper so farmers can experiment.There's definitely a buzz in the industry,' Mr Andrews said. 'At the moment, the main use is for aerial images of crops that allow farmers to get an accurate picture of their farm. You can zoom in on an individual plant.' A total of two per cent of farmers sung the praises of electronic ear tags, which are used to identify livestock using Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, while another two percent said farm management software is their favourite new technology. Increasing numbers of cows are milked by robot and almost one in five farmers named robotic milking machines (pictured) as their favourite farm innovation. They allow cows to be milked whenever they like and . because the computer knows which cow is which, the teats are perfectly aligned each time, resulting in better animal welfare, while boosting farm efficiency . The software lets farms manage their accounts, pay workers, monitor crops, make maps, record livestock and more. While few farmers currently use or can afford all this technology, Andrews said: ‘Over time technology becomes cheaper. GPS systems were unaffordable to many farmers 10 years ago but now almost all farmers can manage from form of steering system. He believes futuristic farms will boost animal welfare, reduce farmers' reliance on chemicals and  give them more time to manage their land better. 'It's not about robots taking over,' he said. The Farmers Weekly survey coincides with Open Farm Sunday, which takes place this weekend and allows members of the public to see modern farm technology in action. Annabel Shackleton, manager for Open Farm Sunday said: ‘Technology plays an essential part in the story behind our food - it helps farmers to be as efficient as possible and in the care and up keep of the countryside and the wildlife that lives there. ‘Along with displays of machinery there will be a host of other activities for the whole family to enjoy on Open Farm Sunday – to find a farm to visit near you just visit www.farmsunday.org.’ Aerial photographs taken by drones offer farmers a quick and easy way to check on the progress of crops and determine where they may need to replant or direct pesticide applications, according to one expert . For farmers, aerial photographs taken by drones offer a quick and easy way to check on the progress of crops and determine where they may need to replant or direct pesticide applications. Researchers at the University of Illinois are using drones on farms to take aerial photos of crops growing in research plots. Dennis Bowman, a crop science teacher at the university, deliberately made mistakes on one test plot by not applying enough nitrogen fertilizer and is now using drones to see if they can reveal potentially weaker crops. ‘As the crop gets up and going, we'll fly over it and see if we can detect those areas sooner than we could visually from the ground,’ he said. ‘We're also looking at doing some scans over our herbicide studies to see if the drone photography can help us identify where crops are stressed by postemergence herbicide applications.’ Mr Bowman spent two summers as a commercial crop scout and said that walking through tasseling corn in high temperatures is unpleasant. ‘The odds of actually getting to the far end of that field on foot to see what's going on are pretty slim. To get a bird's-eye view of your crop, the drones offer a handy way to do it.’ He is using two quadricopters affixed with a Go-Pro camera and a Canon Powershot SX260 camera with a lens for infrared photography to see if they can spot potential crop trouble. ‘Standard pictures and video taken with drones can tell us a lot. But what we're looking to give us even more information is multispectral cameras that can give us imagery in other wavelengths, such as near-infrared, to help us identify areas of crop stress. ‘It probably isn't going to tell us what the problem is, but it will tell us where problems are so that we can target our scouting in those specific areas and determine what might be occurring.’ Infrared images will help the researchers identify plants in the farm that appear to be absorbing or reflecting light differently - an indication that the plants are under some type of stress, such as pests, disease or nutrient deficiencies. The drones may be used to spot an invasive weed called Palmer amaranth, which is spreading across the Midwest and is becoming increasingly resistant to herbicides to the extent that it could drastically reduce farmers' yield potential in affected fields. ‘Before the soybean rows close, or if we get a different spectrum response from some of these weeds as they break through the canopy, we may see some of those weeds show up in the imagery as well to identify where there are hot spots and problems,’ Mr Bowman said.","A Farmer's Weekly survey has revealed British farmers' favourite technologies, which combine to produce a futuristic farm .

"British funding for green projects overseas is going to major economies such as India, Brazil and South Africa, a report reveals. The world’s poorest countries are being ‘left behind’ as richer nations scoop up most of the cash, according to the Overseas Development Institute. The British think tank calculated that booming economies have received the lion’s share of climate finance from Western nations – including at least £1.6billion from the UK – over the past decade. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary, insists that the UK must fund green projects abroad because the world’s poorest nations are the ones set to be hit the hardest by global warming . The money has funded wind farms, solar panels, flood defences and forestry schemes. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat Energy Secretary, insists that the UK must fund green projects abroad because the world’s poorest nations are set to be hit the hardest by global warming. However, the new analysis reveals that the ten most vulnerable nations benefited from only seven per cent of climate aid. The Overseas Development Institute released its report at the United Nations climate change summit in Peru. The money has funded wind farms, solar panels, flood defences and forestry schemes in many countries . Funding for poor countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to global warming is a key part of the negotiations, with the UN trying to raise £64billion a year from 2020 onwards. The report analysed a decade of loans and grants going into international funds set up to tackle climate change. Of the £4.8 billion that the ODI looked at, the UK was the biggest contributor, putting in £1.6billion. Half the money went to just ten countries, each of them major economies. The remaining half was divided between 125 nations. Smita Nakhooda, lead author of the report, called for money to be directed to the areas where it is most needed. ‘The lives of millions of people in poor countries affected by climate change depend on getting this right,’ she said. Conservative MP Peter Bone (pictured) called for a fundamental rethink of Britain’s green aid scheme . ‘The UK contributions to multi-lateral funds are pooled with other sources of finance and contributions from other countries, and so one cannot distinguish the UK contributions from those of others. ‘But the UK does have significant influence in decision-making over how the funds allocate their resources, alongside other countries.’ However, even one of the world’s poorest countries admitted that the UN is asking too much of western nations by insisting on huge financial contributions for green projects. Bangladesh’s environment minister Anwar Hossain Manju told reporters in Lima: ‘We are probably expecting too much from the industrialised and developed countries, because today all countries are suffering from social, political, economic problems.’ Conservative MP Peter Bone called for a fundamental rethink of Britain’s green aid programme. ‘My constituents expect overseas aid to go where it is really needed,’ he said. ‘It is completely bonkers that we are giving money to major economies to fund climate change projects.’ The UK is committed to spending £3.9billion for green projects abroad between 2011 and 2016. That sum is likely to rise in the coming years. Schemes funded with UK cash in recent years include £25million to restore forest and low-carbon agriculture in Brazil and £6million for solar panels in India – a nation prosperous enough to have its own £328million-a-year overseas aid programme. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said last night: ‘It is right we work with the international community to provide targeted support to countries where we know emissions are predicted to grow rapidly. 'This will help stop climate change and reduce its impact on the poorest and most vulnerable.’","Report reveals funding going to major economies like India and Brazil .

"One child has died and another four fell seriously ill after drinking dangerous raw milk sold in health stores as 'cosmetic milk' for bathing in. Unpasteurised cow's milk has been banned in Australia for more than 70 years but manufacturers can sell it as a cosmetic product rather than food. A three-year-old, from Mornington Peninsula - south-east of Melbourne, allegedly recently died after drinking Mountain View Organic Bath Milk, the Herald Sun reports. The product is advertised on the family-run company's website as 'amazing fresh 'raw bath milk'… dropped off to the farm store every Thursday for pick up'. Mountain View Farm owner Vicki Jones said the company always advised people not to drink the product. 'What people do with milk when they take it home, I can't tell them what to do,' she said. Scroll down for video . A three-year-old allegedly recently died after drinking Mountain View Organic Bath Milk . Ms Jones said the company labelled their milk with non-consumption warnings in accordance with health department regulations, but was happy to make any recommended changes. 'We've told them we're happy to add extra labelling and warnings to the milk,' she said. 'We're happy to comply with whatever they request.' Meanwhile, four children from Melbourne, aged one to four, have been struck down with serious illnesses such as gastroenteritis after drinking different brands of raw milk. The raw milk is often sold in fridges near to the pasteurised drinking milk and it's packaging looks similar to that of regular milk. There has been a resurgence in people wanting to drink raw milk as part of a belief that raw and unprocessed food is healthier. They claim it is more nutritious, easier to digest and contains probiotics - and that it's better for cows and farms. Dr Rosemary Lester (left) from Victoria's Department of Health has issued a health warning. The raw milk is often sold near pasteurised milk (right) Chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester says raw milk, which is marketed as bath milk, can affect the kidneys and the bloodstream and cause watery diarrhoea if consumed. 'Only a small number of these pathogens are needed to cause illness,' Dr Lester said. She said unpasteurised milk could make anyone sick but risks were greatest for young children and elderly, pregnant or otherwise unhealthy people. 'Since the 1940s, it has been compulsory to pasteurise cow's milk in Australia,' Dr Lester said. 'Milk is heated for a very short period of time, effectively destroying any disease-causing bacteria which may be present in raw milk.' Dr Lester has referred the matter to Consumer Affairs Victoria and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), saying bath milk packaging was very similar to drinking milk and they could be easily confused. Consumer Affairs Victoria director Dr Claire Noone says the watchdog will review the marketing of raw milk and work with the ACCC to establish whether there had been a breach of consumer law. 'In Victoria it is illegal to package, deliver or provide raw milk for human consumption. However, it still may be labelled and sold for cosmetic use,' she said in a statement on Thursday. An ACCC spokesperson said the commission would consider the adequacy of labelling but urged consumers to follow safety instructions on product packaging. The child's death will appear in front of the State Coroner. Dr Rosemary Lester says on the Department's website: 'The Department has been notified of a number of illnesses including three cases of Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) and two cases of cryptosporidiosis. All cases have consumed unpasteurised (raw) milk which is sold as 'bath' or 'cosmetic' milk in Victoria.' She explained: 'Cryptosporidiosis is a parasitic infection that commonly presents are gastroenteritis with watery diarrhoea. 'HUS is a rare condition which can be caused by shiga toxin and verotoxin producing E.coli that affects the kidneys and the bloodstream. Children are most susceptible to contracting HUS, which begins with abdominal pains and bloody diarrhoea which can last for about a week. 'Serious cases of HUS can lead to renal failure and death. Only small numbers of these pathogens are needed to cause illness.' Because the products are classed as cosmetic and are marked 'not for human consumption' the department has no power to recall them. Dr Lester said: 'In Australia, the sale of unpasteurised (raw) cow's milk for human consumption is illegal. In Victoria, it is also illegal to package, deliver or provide unpasteurised (raw) milk for human consumption. Unpasteurised milk is sometimes labelled and sold for cosmetic use only. 'Packaging of unpasteurised milk is often very similar to other milk products. 'Unpasteurised milk should not be consumed.'","Victoria's department of health has discovered 'several' cases of children falling ill with gastroenteritis after drinking raw milk .

"One journalist bore the full brunt of former rugby league player John Hopoate outside court on Wednesday, when he allegedly tried to trip her, before swearing at her so ferociously sheriffs were forced to intervene. At the Downing Centre in Sydney for his son Jamil's sentencing over the brutal bashing of a man in February, Hopoate senior was not pleased when he was approached outside court by reporters. As the pack followed him along Liverpool Street in the CBD, the former NRL player stuck his foot out in a what appeared to be deliberate attempt to send 2UE radio journalist Leonie Ryan flying. Scroll down for video . John Hopoate (red pants) allegedly tried to trip up journalist Leonie Ryan (in orange) outside court on Wednesday . 'It was while we were waiting outside after Jamil was sentenced,' Ms Ryan told Daily Mail Australia. 'He stomped on my foot and attempted to trip me over,' she continued. Footage from the incident shows the journalist walking alongside John asking the question: 'Do you have anything to say?' John then sticks his right leg out to the side causing Ms Ryan to stumble, almost sending her flying into the pavement. Unfortunately for Ms Ryan, the confrontation was far from over, as the man continued to antagonise her further once court was about to resume. Ms Ryan said she was trying to ask John a question before she says he tried to trip her over . Reporters went back inside to hear Jamil's bail application and just minutes later John launched a verbal attack. 'I could see him through the glass at court and he was glaring at me and mumbling,' Ms Ryan. '(Then) he stormed in and I stood up, he just kept repeating ""stop spreading lies, stop spreading lies"":' 'He kept calling me a f****** b****,' Ms Ryan continued. Former rugby league winger John Hopoate made international headlines when he was caught sticking his finger up the bottoms of three rival players while playing for the Wests Tigers in 2001. He was suspended for 12 weeks for his action and earned global infamy, in what is considered one of Australia's biggest sporting scandals. The reporter told John his behaviour outside was completely inappropriate, while he continued to abuse her. At this point the sheriffs pulled him up, said they had seen John threatening journalists outside the court and threatened to arrest him. He was at court for the sentencing of his son Jamil (left) on Wednesday . John allegedly tried to trip up other journalists on the way out of court . 'I went up to the Sherrif and I said look, we need to go back into court because Jamil is about to lodge a bail application ... what can be done,' Ms Ryan said. 'By this point I was shaking, I was really angry and intimidated'. Despite warnings from the sheriffs who notified John's lawyers, he continued to threaten Ms Ryan when she got out of the elevator upstairs outside the court room. 'He was sitting there when the elevator doors opened and sitting there just whispering you f****** b**** you f****** b****, you're a f****** b****.' Due to the confrontation, a male journalist had to relieve Ms Ryan of her court duties, over concerns for her safety. 'Jamil is up for an appeal in February and I definitely wont' be covering that,' she said.","John Hopoate was in court for his son Jamil's sentencing on Wednesday .

"Britain has 'masses of space' and the issue of immigration is 'not very important', a senior member of the independent economic watchdog has claimed. Stephen Nickell, a board member of the Office for Budget Responsibility, said just 10 per cent of the country has been 'urbanised'. And he warned the NHS would be in 'dire straits' without the influx of migrant workers to take jobs. Stephen Nickell, a member of the Office for Budget Responsibility board, told MPs that there is 'plenty of space' in Britain . Latest figures show that net migration is rising, with 260,000 more people arriving in the UK in the year to June than left. The issue is set to dominate next year's general election campaign, with all the parties promising to act on curbing benefits which can act as a 'pull factor' to attract EU nationals to Britain. But Mr Nickell told MPs that while new arrivals had held down unskilled wages 'to some extent' but the overall impact was marginal. The former economics professor at Oxford university and the London School of Economics was giving evidence to the Treasury Select Committee. Mr Nickell said: 'It's perfectly true, I think, from the evidence that the pay of unskilled workers, particularly in the service sector, has been held back to some extent - not a massive extent, but to some extent - by unskilled immigration... 'At the end of the day - let's say over the next 10 years or so - the general consensus is that for the native population, the existing population, immigration may be a little bit good, it may be a little bit bad economically. But there isn't overall that much in it.' Giving evidence to the Treasury select committee, Mr Nickell warned the NHS would be in 'dire straits' with migrant workers . But he stressed that the NHS can only survive with migrant workers. 'Obviously there are special situations like in the health service, for example - some 35 per cent of health professional are migrants. 'It's quite plain that, if they weren't there, the health service would be in absolutely dire straits.' Last month Witold Sobków, the Polish ambassador to the UK, revealed plans were being drawn up to persuade hundreds of health staff trained in Poland to return home, declaring: ‘We want them back.’ David Cameron has pledged to work with other EU countries to reduce migration across the continent, warning public services in Britain are struggling to cope with rising populations. But Mr Nickell suggested that large parts of the country are far from full, and able to cope with more new arrivals. He said the argument about immigration, 'basically boils down to people, the number of people'. 'The evidence suggests that, since more immigrants mean more housing, more roads, more airports, more incinerators, more more more of this being required. 'And since the evidence would suggest that people by and large don't like these things - especially if they are near them - I think that is the key issue about immigration that people may wish to face up to.' Mr Nickell went on: 'One argument says 'We are a small island, not much room'. 'On the other hand, of course - there is masses of room. The urbanised part of Britain occupies less than 10 per cent of the surface area. 'The urbanised part of Surrey occupies less of Surrey than golf courses. So in some senses, plenty of space. 'But as you know, explaining the situation ... there's plenty of room, these issues are really not very important, it doesn't get you very far. This is not the way people think about these things. 'People think about these things on the basis of their experience and what they read in the newspapers. 'Most of the things that people object to arise because there are just more people.' Fears over immigration have been widely credited with fuelling the recent surge in support for Ukip, which saw the party top European polls and win two Commons by-elections. Before the last election, Mr Cameron pledged to reduce net annual immigration below 100,000 by the general election, but figures released last month showed it is running at 260,000. The Prime Minister has said he will use a mooted renegotiation of Britain's EU membership terms to tackle 'pull' factors - including banning newcomers from claiming tax credits for four years.","Stephen Nickell insists the issue of immigration is 'not very important'

"Carl Singleton (left), 41, from Millom, Cumbria, has been released without charge pending an inquest into the death of student Ashley Agumbi (right), 22 . A British man accused of murdering his girlfriend has been freed after 11 days of 'hell' in a Kenyan jail. Carl Singleton, 41, from Millom, Cumbria, has been released without charge pending an inquest into the death of student Ashley Agumbi, 22. He was arrested on November 23, on suspicion of having flushed the insulin for her diabetes down the toilet. Miss Agumbi died in hospital of diabetic hypertension and respiratory failure days after making accusations against Mr Singleton. He flew out to be with her six months ago, after they met on Facebook. Mr Singleton said he'd lost two stone during his time in prison, surviving on a bowl of porridge a day. Kenya Police said he is 'free for now' after he appeared in court in front of magistrate Hannah Kaguru on Wednesday December 3. He described the ordeal in which he slept on the jail floor as 'hell'. He said: 'I was just shocked at first when I was arrested. I was in jail for 11 days that was hell, had to sleep on the floor, just one drink a day and one meal a day. Conditions were hell. 'You sleep on the floor and the jail was so dirty. No shower for 11 days or a shave.' The 6ft 6in, 20-stone former van driver said: 'I was not given much food just ugali (a dish of maize flour cooked with water to a porridge). I lost about two stone in 11 days.' He also said he was only allowed to use the phone once to call his family. He said: 'I was just upset because I lost the love of my life. But I had to stay strong for my family back home. 'We were so much in love with each other.' Harsh: Singleton said he'd lost two stone during his time in prison, surviving on a bowl of porridge a day . He said of the accusation: 'It felt bad when she was my world, my life, my everything.' He also said when he met her he 'knew it was love'. He added: 'I was so happy when I saw her at the airport. As soon as I saw her I knew she loved me. 'She was a very kind and caring young lady.'

"The ex-police officer who bungled the Madeleine McCann investigation made a fortune by spinning a web of lies about the case, a court heard today. Goncalo Amaral, 56, earned at least £344,000 from his book and TV documentary about Madeleine's disappearance, it was said. Amaral wrote 'distortions', 'fallacies', 'supposition' and 'a web of conspiracy theories' about the investigation, a libel trial in Lisbon was told. Goncalo Amaral (pictured), 56, earned at least £344,000 from his book (pictured) and TV documentary about Madeleine's disappearance, it was said . Ricardo Correia Afonso, representing Kate and Gerry McCann, told the court: 'What he published distorted the facts, and as a result the parents were judged and sentenced by public opinion. 'His book is written like a novel and that's exactly what it is. The book and the DVD were produced to convince whoever saw or read them that the parents are guilty.' Mr Correia Afonso said the ex-detective made £270,000 from sales of his book in Portugal and £18,000 from sales abroad. He earned £26,000 from the broadcasting of the documentary, watched by 2.2m viewers in April 2009, and another £28,000 from sales of a DVD. The book is still on sale in some Portuguese bookshops despite being out of print, he said. And Mr Amaral has continued to publicly repeat the central claims in the book - that Madeleine died in the family's rented holiday apartment in the Algarve in May 2007 and that her parents covered up her death. The former head of the Madeleine investigation gave an interview in June this year in which he 'had no problem stating that the parents of the child are the only guilty parties', the lawyer said. Mr Amaral even told a Portuguese newspaper a theory that Madeleine had been buried in a coffin alongside a dead women in a church in the resort of Praia da Luz, the court was told. Mr Amaral's discredited theories on Madeleine's disappearance have been widely repeated in newspapers in Portugal and around the world including Brazil and Spain, he said. The McCanns are suing Mr Amaral for £1m over his book The Truth Of The Lie and the accompanying documentary. The McCanns (pictured) are suing Mr Amaral for £1m over his book The Truth Of The Lie . Mr Amaral told a Portuguese newspaper a theory that Madeleine (pictured) had been buried in a coffin alongside a dead women in a church in the resort of Praia da Luz, the court was told . He was thrown off the investigation in 2007 after criticising British police officers involved in the search for Madeleine. In July the McCanns, both 46-year-old doctors from Rothley, Leicsestershire, told the court at the Palace of Justice in Lisbon that they had been 'devastated and crushed' by the book about their daughter, who was days short of her fourth birthday when she disappeared. But Miguel Cruz Rodrigues, for Mr Amaral, said the McCanns were suing 'to rid themselves of guilt for their negligent conduct and their conduct in relation to the investigation. He added: 'There was a lack of cooperation with the police authorities. 'That lack of cooperation led to the archiving of the investigation.' Responding to claims the book had caused the McCanns insomnia, lack of appetite and depression, he said: 'The crux of this case is these were not caused by Goncalo Amaral's book, but rather they were caused by the fact the McCanns will feel guilty all their lives for not looking after their children.' Fatima de Oliveira Esteves, representing publisher Guerra e Paz, admitted that Mr Amaral 'appeared to have invented' much of the book. But she added: 'The fact is those children were left alone and because of that fact one of them disappeared. 'Anxiety and depression were caused by the disappearance of the child, not because of the book.' And Miguel Coroadinha, representing TVI, which broadcast the documentary, said the McCanns 'want us to hear only a single version of the facts, which is their version'. He added: 'Freedom of expression and thought is one of our fundamental rights.' Judge Maria de Melo e Castro said the court will convene on January 21 to discuss which facts have been proved. She is expected to defer judgment until February.","Ex officer 'earned £344k' from book and TV show about the Madeleine case .

"Green subsidies added to families’ energy bills are to rise nearly four-fold by 2030, according to a report published today. State funding for wind and solar power and a carbon tax on coal and gas will together add £175 to the average household bill by 2030, according to the Government’s climate advisors. That is nearly four times the £45 added to bills last year, the Committee on Climate Change said. The cost of energy to business and industry is set to double in the same period, with the price of goods and services bound to increase as a result. The report is published as politicians from 196 countries meet in Peru to try to agree a treaty to curb climate change. State funding for wind and solar power and a carbon tax on coal and gas will together add £175 to the average household bill by 2030, according to the Government’s climate advisors. File picture . Energy Secretary Ed Davey, who arrived at the UN summit in Lima yesterday, is among those trying to push for every nation to adopt strict targets on carbon emissions to restrict global warming to 2C. Britain has already adopted the most stringent climate law in the world – a legal obligation to reduce greenhouse gases by 80 per cent by 2050. But Mr Davey wants other nations to follow suit, to adopt rules that will force them to reduce emissions. The impact of such policies is laid bare in the Committee on Climate Change report today. In order to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide in line with its strict targets, the British government has agreed to plough money into solar farms, wind turbines and nuclear power – with the cost added to consumer bills. The Government also has several measures in place designed to deter companies from emitting greenhouse gases, which in turn create a ‘carbon price’ that is added to the cost of power generated by gas, coal and oil. In order to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide, the British government has agreed to plough money into solar farms, wind turbines and nuclear power – with the cost added to consumer bills . The committee estimates that these measures together made up £45 of the average £1,140 dual gas and electricity bill in 2013. The green components will more than double to £100 by 2020, and soar to £175 by 2030, by which time the total average bill will be £1,305. The committee also identified £70 added to bills to support energy efficiency measures such as new boilers in low income homes and for wall and loft insulation. This element will of bills will decrease to £60 in 2020 and £40 in 2030. The committee said that funding for green power helped cut as much emissions as taking 10 million cars off the road. Most of the rises in household bills, which have increased almost £500 on average since 2004, are due to rising wholesale gas prices and investment in electricity and gas networks, it said. The cost to business will also rise, with the green element of energy bills set to double to 31 per cent for the commercial sector and 26 per cent for the industrial sector. Consumers will undoubtedly be effected by this, with the cost due to drive up the price of food, clothes and services. Most of the rises in household bills, which have increased almost £500 on average since 2004, are due to rising wholesale gas prices and investment in electricity and gas network. File picture . The report said: ‘Meeting the UK’s statutory carbon targets will add to energy bills in the future, though with potential to offset much of this through energy efficiency. ‘Electricity generation will need to shift from fossil fuels to low-carbon alternatives such as renewables and nuclear, which are currently more expensive.’ Committee chairman Lord Deben added: ‘Last year, as energy consumers we all helped hundreds of thousands of poorer people to have warmer homes and contributed to real reductions in our emissions in the fight against climate change. ‘Many people saved more than that by taking simple energy saving measures that didn't interfere with their life-style.’ Dr John Constable, director of Renewable Energy Foundation, a UK charity critical of the costs of policies to consumers said: ‘Consumers should be aware that low carbon policies do not just affect their energy bills, but also increase the cost of living as industrial and commercial consumers pass on their costs in the price of goods and services. ‘The CCC’s study shows, in the fine print, that this effect will range from £210 to £360 a year 2020, depending on the cost of fossil fuels, and between £345 and £705 a year in 2030. This is very expensive.’ The Government has repeatedly insisted that imposing green levies and taxes will save consumers money in the long-run, because energy efficiency measures will mean that total bills are cheaper than they otherwise would have been. However, ministers were forced to drastically downgrade their estimates of the potential saving last month. Previously they had estimated that the average bill would be £166 cheaper in 2020 than if no green policies had been adopted – but as the Daily Mail revealed in November, the Government’s own calculations have reduced that potential saving by 45 per cent to £92. A spokesman for the Department of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘Thanks to Government policies, bills are an estimated £90 lower this year and will be even lower by 2020. ‘Our policies are designed to keep the lights on, reduce polluting emissions, cut energy use at the lowest possible cost to gas and electricity customers.’","The cost of energy to business and industry is set to double in the same period, causing a knock-on effect to other goods and services .

"The wreck of a British bomber that sunk during a raid on the German battleship, the Tirpitz, has been found and is likely to contain the bodies of two of the missing crew. The Halifax bomber was located perfectly intact 600ft down in a Norwegian fjord 72 years after it crashed on the mission to destroy one of Hitler's most feared ships. The aircraft was struck by heavy flak and made a successful crash landing in the water inlet in northern Norway. Scroll down for video . Significant find: The Halifax bomber was located perfectly intact 600ft down in a Norwegian fjord 72 years after it crashed on the mission to destroy one of Hitler's most feared ships . The aircraft was struck by heavy flak and made a successful crash landing in the water inlet in northern Norway . There have been numerous attempts to find Halifax W7656 over the years with no joy until engineers laying a pipeline stumbled upon a mystery underwater object . Tail surfaces are fitted to Halifax  W7656 at Handley Page's plant at Cricklewood, London in March 1942 . Sergeant Alfred Columbine, who was a navigator aboard the doomed Halifax . Four of the six-man crew bailed out into a dingy but nothing was ever seen of navigator, Flight Sergeant Alfred Columbine, or wireless operator, Arthur Evans. It is believed they drowned when the bomber went down. The children of Alfred Bernard Columbine today told of their relief that the aircraft had been found but said his body should remain where it is. Sylvia Ireland was aged five when her father was killed in the raid on the Tirpitz in 1942 while her brother David was not born as the airman's widow, Elsie, was two months pregnant at the time. In 1999 the two siblings made a pilgrimage to the fjord where the Halifax crashed and laid flowers there, although they didn't know where exactly it was in the water. David Columbine, a 72-year-old retired policeman from Nottingham, said: 'I am pleased and relieved it has now been discovered. 'There is the prospect of his body being recovered and a funeral with full military honours taking place but it is a war grave and is his final resting place and maybe it should remain that way. 'In 1999 someone pinpointed roughly where the Halifax came down and our family went out there to pay our respects and lay some flowers.' Mrs Ireland, 75, said: 'When I found out the aircraft had been found I was quite upset from my mother's point of view. 'It is a wonderful thing what they have done but that is their final resting place and that is where they should remain.' Sgt Columbine was a carpenter for Boots before the war and volunteered for the RAF. He was aged 32 when he died. As he was the oldest member of the Halifax crew, his comrades nicknamed him 'Pops'. The pilot of the bomber, Fl Lt Petley, survived the war and died two years ago in Eastbourne, East Sussex. There have been numerous attempts to find Halifax W7656 over the years with no joy until engineers laying a pipeline stumbled upon a mystery underwater object. The marine technology department at a local university was tipped off about it and a team of six students visited the fjord and sent a remote control submarine down to inspect the object. Video footage beamed back to their vessel on the surface revealed the Halifax bomber that had suffered barely any visible damage over the last seven decades. Enemy target: The bomber was sunk while hunting the German battleship Tirpitz, pictured here anchored at a fjord in Norway . The Tirpitz (pictured) was attacked on numerous occasions by the Allies and was finally sunk in November 1944 . Ferocious: The German battleship Tirpitz being bombed by allied forces . Professor Martin Ludvigsen, who lead the search . Although they could not find the aircraft's serial number, given its location it is likely to be Halifax W7656. The sunken bomber will be protected as a war grave because of the likelihood of the remains of the two airman still being on board. The bomber was part of 35 Squadron and took off from RAF Kinloss on April 28, 1942, to find and sink the Tirpitz, which was the heaviest ship in the world at the time. The ship was positioned off Norway to deter an Allied invasion of the Nazi-occupied country as well as to intercept Arctic convoys. In all, 23 Halifaxes and 11 Lancasters took part in the sortie, with two being shot down by German anti-aircraft defences. It is known that W7656 has been unable to release its mines when over the target and the pilot, Flight Liuetenent Petley, came around again for a second attempt. It's port wing was hit and caught fire at 4,000ft, causing the aircraft to rapidly lose height. The pilot managed to ditch it in a fjord and three of the six crew got out and climbed into the life raft. Tail gunner Sgt Pomroy went to look for his two missing comrades but had to retreat into the dinghy as the plane quickly sank. They drifted for three hours until two Norwegian men rowed out to rescue them. They were handed over to the Germans when they came ashore and spent the rest of the war in PoW camps in Germany. Professor Martin Ludvigsen, of the marine technology department at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, said: 'It was a construction company which found the plane initially. They didn't realise it was there or what it was. Film Above Us The Waves told the story of the allied effort to sink the Tirpitz using human torpedoes and mini submarines . It took an incredible 24 operations over five years to destroy the Tirpitz. Launched in 1939, Tirpitz was a truly monumental military machine. The length of 2½ football pitches, it was crewed by 2,600 men and armed with an astonishing array of weapons including 58 anti-aircraft cannons. The hull was protected by 13in armour plating while 5in thick decks protected the engine rooms and magazines. Many believed the ship was unsinkable. For many years, it was. Churchill was obsessed with the Tirpitz, declaring: 'The whole strategy of the war turns on this ship. I regard the matter as of the highest urgency and importance.' For four years, he urged the service chiefs into finding and attacking this symbol of Nazi might. On one memorable occasion, he wrote to the First Sea Lord: 'The crippling of this ship would alter the face of the war, and the loss of 100 machines or 500 airmen would be well compensated for.' In October 1942, the Navy deployed its secret weapon, the optimistically named 'Mk1 Human Torpedo'. The plan entailed two divers riding a self-propelled torpedo before detaching the warhead, fixing it to the hull, then making their escape. Dreadful weather conspired to render the attack a failure. Mini submarines were deployed in September 1943, but despite causing some damage, Tirpitz stayed in action. In April 1944, a massive raid was mounted by the Fleet Air Arm that resulted in the ship being 'peppered with bombs' and the deaths of 122 German sailors. But still the mighty warship remained in service. In autumn 1944, Tony Iveson and his RAF colleagues from 617 Squadron (of Dambusters fame) and 9 Squadron entered the fray. Operating at the very limits of their endurance, modified Lancaster bombers were flown to a base in Russia, from where attacks could be mounted. Finally, on November 12, 1944, a force of 30 British bombers, armed with massive 12,000lb 'Tallboy' earthquake bombs, descended on Tirpitz off the coast of Tromso in Norway. The crews delivered their huge payloads with great accuracy, death and destruction raining down on the pride of the German fleet. As the smoke and steam cleared, one RAF gunner in a rear turret reported: 'Hey Skip, I think she's keeling over.' Tirpitz's war was finally at an end. Of 1,700 sailors on board, nearly 1,000 perished in the explosions and the icy waters. Countless RAF and Naval personnel had made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure its destruction. The endeavours of the human torpedoes and mini submarines were told in the 1955 film Above Us The Waves. John Nichol . A Halifax bomber - not the plane found in the fjord - is made ready by  ground crew (file picture) A reconnaissance photo shows the Tirpitz - the heaviest ship in the world at the time - at anchor . Research ship: The R/V Gunnerus was the vessel that found the bomber . 'We went to the site and used a remote controlled underwater vehicle which dived to 180 metres. It was quite exciting. We could see from the images that it was the Halifax and was in good condition. 'We realised it might be a British war grave and were very careful and respectful. There were loud cheers when we discovered the plane.' The Norwegian Aviation Museum and the British Embassy have been informed of the find. It is not clear as to what will happen next or if a search for the missing airmen will be carried out. Anders Utjaard, the director of the museum, said: 'The aircraft is still owned by the UK and is being looked after by Norway as it is in our waters. 'We have reason to believe there maybe the remains of two airmen on board and by Norwegian law nobody is allowed to touch it without proper authority. 'Any search for the airmen would require divers and it would be up to the British authorities.' A spokesman for the British Embassy in Oslo confirmed they had been made aware of the discovery and were consulting with the RAF's Air Historical Branch as to how to proceed. The Tirpitz was attacked on numerous occasions by the Allies and was finally sunk in November 1944.","Wreck of Halifax W7656 bomber found in 600ft deep waters in Norway .

"Unsuspecting drivers in Lowell, Michigan, got a holiday surprise to remember recently when a police man gave them Christmas gifts instead of traffic tickets. Officer Scot VanSolkema was tasked with being the local force’s very own Father Christmas. He pulled drivers over for minor issues - which wouldn't normally warrant police attention – including traveling five miles or less above the limit, or snow partially covering their license plate during a week of heavy snowfall. Unsuspecting drivers in Lowell, Michigan, got a holiday surprise when a police man gave them Christmas gifts instead of traffic tickets . Officer Scot VanSolkema was tasked with being the local force's very own Father Christmas for the feel good scheme . While talking to the drivers, VanSolkema quizzed them about what they want for Christmas and what their children are asking from Santa Claus. Wearing a GoPro camera and a hidden mic, Officer VanSolkema was able to radio a team of people at a local store who then rushed to get the gifts and quickly delivered them to wherever he was located. Officer VanSolkema then gave the presents - including expensive items including an Xbox and a flat-screen TV – to the disbelieving drivers most of whom were left overjoyed by the acts of generosity. After one mom receives a gift for her little boy she told the officer, ‘This just turned my bad day into a good one.’ One lucky driver got an Xbox console for his children and was delighted because he had just told the officer that he wasn't going to be able to afford it .

'This just turned my bad day into a good one,' said one happy mom when he was given the very toy that her son wanted for Christmas . The footage was filmed over November 19 and 20 and the task of getting motorists to open up about specific gifts and then get them wait around for those gifts to be delivered was a challenge, said VanSolkema. 'The next time a police officer asks you some odd question, maybe you should answer it,' he told TODAY, 'because you never know what can happen.' VanSolkema gave out about 30 gifts totaling between $7,000 and $10,000. The heart-warming idea was a collaboration between the local police, videographer Rob Bliss and the UP TV network, who funded the gifts. At a time when police nationwide have been in the news for negative reasons - especially following the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York - they hope the video will remind people about good police officers and their dedication.

"This is the heartbreaking moment young girls in Kenya are sold into arranged marriages for a dowry of livestock as part of a traditional ceremony which marks their passing into womanhood. Clad in tribal jewellery and with their hair tied up in braids, some of the women can be seen struggling as they are hauled away, traded by their fathers for 20 goats, three camels, and ten cows. Many of the girls, who are members of the Pokot tribe, are not aware they have been bargained away until their husbands come to collect them after spending a month in isolation before the ceremony takes place. Scroll down for video . Struggle: A girl from the Pokot tribe in Kenya tries to escape after being sold as a bride by her parents in return for a dowry of livestock . Tradition: The girls are isolated from the village for a month before the ritual takes place meaning many are unaware they have been sold off . Harsh: One family said they had deliberately kept the arranged marriage from their daughter for fear she would run away if she found out . Payment: The livestock are paid to the girl's family over a series of weeks, with the last being brought on the day of the ritual when the men will also collect their brides . Desperate: Life is a constant struggle for the women of the Pokot tribe as the people are also known to practice female genital mutilation . Often their parents will keep the details of the marriage hidden for fear that their daughter will run away if she finds out about the deal they have made. As part of the ritual, which lasts a day and night, the village men will also select a bull from the herd of cows which the women will punch into submission before it is executed with a spear-thrust to the heart. This particular ceremony took place in the bush around 30 miles (50km) from the town of Marigat in Baringo County which is home to around 133,000 plains Pokot. Many of the girls will be as young as 14, despite Kenyan law now forbidding childhood marriage. As with many tribal customs, however, strict adherence to tradition is considered more important than complying with the law. Fight: A girl grips on to her parents' arms before being taken away by her new husband in Kenya as part of a tribal ceremony . Ritual: The women will remain standing for more than a day and a night during the ceremony, which also involves dancing . Make way: Men arrive in the village leading the last train of cattle as they prepare to take the wives they have bargained for home with them . Young: Child marriage has been outlawed in Kenya in an attempt to crack down on tribal practices, but many will simply ignore the law . The Pokots developed their social structure and practices in order to maximise their chances of survival of each household in an often difficult and hostile environment, but they are coming to be viewed as barbaric and unacceptable in modern-day Kenya. During the ceremony the girls will sing and stay standing from the afternoon through out the night and the morning after. At the end of the ceremony, the girls and the boys of the community dance together, supervised by elders. While the images show the girls' shock and distress at what is happening to them, it is unlikely to be the first time they have suffered hardships at the hands of their parents and tribal tradition. Brutal: As part of the ceremony the village men will also select a bull from among the cattle to be slaughtered and eaten . Beaten: However before it is killed the women are required to punch it into submission as a sign of their new strength . Attack: Women of the Pokot tribe in Kenya beat a young bull as part of a ceremony that marks their passing into adulthood . Slaughter: After the women have weakened the cow by punching it, it is killed by the men using a single spear stab to the heart . Blessing: A Pokot man holds a lamb as he blesses more than a hundred girls during an initiation ceremony marking the girls' coming of age . The Pokot people are also known to practice female genital mutilation, a practice whereby parts of a woman's sexual organs are removed using scissors, a razor blade, or glass before they are sewn up and have their legs bound together until the wounds heal. The tradition is carried out at a much younger age than the forced marriages, in the belief it will help to keep the girls pure until the time comes for them to undergo the ceremony that will see them become women. However, as the ceremonies are usually carried out by unskilled quack doctors operating miles from any hospital and with no anesthetic or antibiotics, deaths are common due to blood loss or infection. Beauty: A girl has her hair braided before it is filled with beads as part of a beauty regime before she takes part in the ritual . Alone: The girls are isolated for more than a month in dark tents before they are handed over to their new husbands as they become women . Decoration: A Pokot girl has her face smeared with white paint, beads put into her hair, and braids made using a mixture of dirt and oil . On your feet: The ceremony lasts a day and night, and the women will stay standing for the whole of it before dancing with the men . Dancing: Pokot girls and boys dance together during an initiation ceremony of over a hundred girls passing over into womanhood . If the girls do not die, then the stitches can cause them terrible pain and discomfort for the rest of their lives, especially during childbirth. As with child marriage, the practice has now been outlawed in Kenya, with a maximum penalty of life in jail if a girl dies, but so far there have been no successful prosecutions. Between Kenya and Uganda there are around 700,000 native Pokot speakers, with the vast majority living in West Pokot county. Pokot society is largely divided in two between the hills Pokot, who live in rainy uplands and are mostly farmers, and the plains Pokot, who roam the dry lowlands and are mostly cattle herders.

Social: Pokot society is split into hill dwellers, who live on rainy uplands and are mostly farmers, and plains dwellers, who live in the bush . Divide: Plains dwellers, like these Pokot, are mostly cattle herders who roam the landscape looking for grazing lands for the animals .

"Australian manufacturers have been accused of creating a 'health halo' around their products to mislead consumers about the fruit and vegetable content. Researchers have found packaged foods are routinely fudging fruit and vegetable claims on labels which has prompted the call for the government to crack down on the practice by bringing the claims within the scope of the food standards code. The Cancer Council NSW and Sydney University researchers found one third of the products failed a basis nutrition test after scouring the shelves for days in the country's five largest supermarkets - Woolworths, Coles, Supa IGA, Aldi and Franklins (now IGA as well). Scroll down for video . Roll Ups (left) are only 25 per cent fruit. Twisters (right) have 99.7 per cent fruit, but both products contain none of the fibre of real fruit because they are made of  'concentrated puree' or 'concentrated juice' There is only 13% fruit juice in this product, and the second ingredient is sugar - per serve it has nearly 14 teaspoons of sugar . The poetic licence taken by manufacturers stems from there not being a required limit on fruit and vegetable claims because they refer to ingredients rather than specific nutrients. Out of about 760 labels from juices, soups and snacks that the researchers photographed by the researchers and half displayed a fruit or vegetable claim. About one-third failed a basic nutrition test based on sugar, salt and fat levels and many were found to lack the vitamins, minerals and fibre of genuine fruit and vegetables. One brand of fruit bar, Go Natural Twisters, claims to have one serve of fruit a serve, was 18 grams - short of the 30 grams defined as a dried fruit serve. Charlie's Raspberry Quencher, a fruit juice 'made with real-life raspberries', contained 13 per cent fruit juice and 14 teaspoons of sugar. Co-author Clare Hughes, of Cancer Council NSW, said food companies were cashing in on the recommendation to eat two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables. 'We don't want people to be relying on these products for their fruit and veg content,' she said. 'Nothing beats the real thing.' She urged shoppers to ignore claims and interrogate the ingredient list instead. Fruit and vegetable claims are those stating the presence of fruit or vegetables ('made with real fruit'), the fruit or vegetable content ('80 % real fruit') and/or the number of servings of fruit or vegetables they contain ('one cup contains three serves of vegetables'). 'Claims on food products can create a 'health halo', meaning that consumers perceive products carrying claims to be healthier than those that do not carry claims,' the report stated. The report says less than 50 per cent of adults consume the recommended two servings of fruit and less than 10 per cent consume the recommended five servings of vegetables each day. It also states that increasing consumption of fruit and vegetables has been a public health priority for more than 20 years in Australia. The report says these 'snacks' are lollies and have none of the fibre of real fruit, and probably not the vitamins and minerals either. They are also sticky and very high in sugar (nearly 60%) and not good for children's teeth . Cancer Council NSW has highlighted the following six products to show shoppers how they can be misled with products displaying the fruit and vegetable nutritional value. Roll Ups . These products are only 25 per cent fruit, and this is 'concentrated puree' or 'concentrated juice', meaning they have none of the fibre of real fruit, and probably not the vitamins and minerals either. They are also sticky and sugary and not good for children's teeth and do not pass nutrient profiling, meaning they are not healthy enough to make a health claim. Twisters . While Twisters contain 99.7 per cent fruit, this is 'concentrated puree' or 'concentrated juice', meaning they have none of the fibre of real fruit, and probably not the vitamins and minerals either. These products are  very high in sugar (67%) and not good for children's teeth and they do not pass nutrient profiling, meaning they are not healthy enough to make a health claim. They claim to be the equivalent of 1 serve of fruit, but a serve of dried fruit is 30g, and these are 18g/serve. Iddy Biddy Fruit Bits Assorted Flavour Fruit Snacks . These 'snacks' are lollies. They have none of the fibre of real fruit, and probably not the vitamins and minerals either. The snacks are very high in sugar (nearly 60%) and not good for children's teeth, the labelling is confusing and they do not pass nutrient profiling, meaning they are not healthy enough to make a health claim. Although this product does pass nutrient profiling, one serve of this product provides nearly half (44%) of an adult's upper limit of sodium, more than 4 teaspoons of sugar, the report states . Charlie's Old Fashioned Quencher Raspberry - claims to be made with real life raspberries . There is only 13% fruit juice in this product, and the second ingredient is sugar. Per serve it has nearly 14 teaspoons of sugar. It does not pass nutrient profiling, meaning it is not healthy enough to make a health claim. Heinz Soup for One Creamy Tomato - claims 3 vegie serves per 300g can . Although this product does pass nutrient profiling, one serve of this product provides nearly half (44%) of an adult's upper limit of sodium, more than 4 teaspoons of sugar. Campbell's Rich Tomato Condensed Soup - claims more than 6 serves of vegetables in every can . Although this product does pass nutrient profiling, one serve of this product provides 32% of an adult's upper limit of sodium, 3 teaspoons of sugar. There are 3.4 serves in a can, so it could imply that the number of serves in the can is reported when people wouldn't eat a full can. The veg (tomato) in this can is concentrated (paste) not whole veg, so will be low in fibre . Although this product does pass nutrient profiling, one serve of this product provides 32 per cent of an adult's upper limit of sodium, 3 teaspoons of sugar . Ms Hughes sees the number of nutritionally 'unhealthy' products that contain fruit and vegetable claims on their packaging as extremely concerning. 'Dietary guidelines encourage Australians to eat two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables each day, so food companies are cashing-in on this by clearly highlighting the fruit and vegetable content in their processed products,' she said. 'However, rather than helping to boost Australians' fruit and vegetable intake, fruit and vegetable claims on packaging are encouraging them to choose highly processed and often unhealthy foods as a way of meeting their fruit and vegetable requirements.' 'Despite what the labels say, we shouldn't rely on these drinks, sugary fruit snacks and salty soups to meet our daily needs.' Ms Hughes, said that as well as exploring fruit and/or vegetable content, the study also looked at the nutrient make-up of these products. 'What we found was that these products contained much less dietary fibre and much more energy, saturated fat, sugar and sodium than their fresh fruit or vegetable equivalent, making them a poor substitute for the real thing.'","Products with fruit and vegetable content not required to list amount .

"Seven decomposing sperm whale carcasses will be removed from a beach in South Australia after their repulsive smell has been discouraging tourism. It had previously been suggested by environmental experts that the whale corpses, which appeared south of the town of Ardrossan, about 150km North West of Adelaide, would be left to decompose naturally. But Yorke Pensinsula Council has now said the repulsive odour from the whales has left the council no choice but to remove the carcasses. Scroll down for video . Seven beached sperm whales washed ashore on Yorke Peninsula in South Australia this week . Andrew Cameron, CEO of the Yorke Peninsula Council, told Daily Mail Australia that two of the whales have already been disposed of. 'We buried two of the whales today. The museum is dissecting one for research, and the rest of them will likely be taken care of tomorrow.' Mr Cameron said the area where the whales appeared is a prominent site for crabbing, and strong winds were pushing the odour onto the nearby Adrossan township. 'There was a news team here today, and they were dry reaching from the smell. It's horrendous' he said. Environment Department spokeswoman Deb Kelly previously told ABC the whales might be left to decompose naturally since the beach is not a popular swimming spot. But Mr Cameron claims the odour has already been hindering tourism, with would be visitors cancelling their trips over the incident. Australian Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources Animal Welfare manager Deb Kelly standing in front of one of six sperm whales washed up dead in a rare mass stranding on the South Australia coast . Yorke Council Mayor Ray Agnew predicted it could cost up to $50,000 to remove the whales, as well as assistance from local businesses. 'We're trying to use the ingenuity of local staff seeing as we don't appear to be getting much assistance at all from the State Government who actually said they haven't got anything that can handle it,' he told ABC. Six of the  whales were found on about six kilometres south of Adrossan, while the seventh was found by a jetty. Environment Department regional co-ordinator Grant Pelton told Adelaide Now that an eighth whale was found in a deeply distressed state. 'DEWNR staff and a Department of Transport, Planning and Infrastructure Marine Safety officer located a live seven-metre sperm whale in 1.5 metres of water at Pt Vincent,' regional co-ordinator he said. Yorke Pensinsula Mayor Ray Agnew has now said the repulsive odour from the whales has left the council no choice but to remove the carcasses . 'The animal was very lethargic but after some time they managed to encourage it out into deeper water where it dived and they haven't seen it since. They will remain in the area to confirm it doesn't come into the shallows again.' Experts believe that there could be many explanations as to why the whales got into trouble. One such theory is that one of the whales was sick and went into shallow water, when it felt better it may have called for help from the rest of the pod. Another explanation may be that the pod were chasing food and got caught in the low tide. The whales were found 50m offshore at Parara Beach, about 4km south of Ardrossan . Environment Department animal welfare manager Dr Deborah Kelly was distressed to see the whales on the beach. 'This is rare,' Dr Kelly said. 'Unfortunately things like this have been happening for thousands of years.' The witness said that one of the whales was still flapping it's tail this morning at 8am, but stopped a short while later. The National Marine Mammal Laboratory say male sperm whales can grow up to 60 feet and may live to be 50-70-years-old. They say that while sperm whales typically die of natural causes, they are known to mass strand. Mr Agnew predicts it could cost up to $50,000 to remove the whales, as well as assistance from local businesses .","Seven sperm whales were washed ashore in South Australia this week .

"An Australian mother has been left struggling to make ends meet and she claims it is because her partner left her for another man, took her possessions and left her with nothing but bills. Leeann Maker says that after ten years and one child together, she is 'living in misery' after her de facto husband Dan Raja walked out on their family, allegedly for a man. Around 12 months ago, Mr Raja reportedly left began a romantic relationship with Lorenzo Kirisome, a man who refers to himself as a ‘gay man of God’, according to A Current Affair. 'This is every woman’s worst nightmare. He’s left me for a man. I gave him ten years of my life,' Ms Maker said in an interview with A Current Affair. ‘They are constantly financially crippling me. ‘I’m not sure how I keep on going, I just know I have to, so I do.’ Scroll down for video . Leeann Maker was part of a loving family, with her de facto husband Dan Raja and their young daughter (all pictured) before he allegedly left her around 12 months ago . Leeann Maker alleges her ex-partner Mr Raja (right) is now in a relationship with Lorenzo Kirisome (left) Ms Maker says she has been left with nothing but bills and her entire lifestyle has changed. Before the break-up, 'if I wanted to see my botox lady, I could just go and see her' To add to her heartbreak, she claims Mr Kirisome is now using her iPhone and driving her Mercedes after her husband took them from her during their break up. Meanwhile, she is left struggling to pay for basic necessities. '(Before the break up) if I wanted to see my botox lady, then I could just see her,' Ms Maker told A Current Affair. 'I can't take the kids to theme parks during the holidays like I used to. I can't take them out for take away.' She laments the impact it is having on her and her children's happiness. 'We used to go to a restaurant or get take away two, three nights a week every week,' she said. 'Now I can't do that.' She cannot believe the cheek of the pair, fuming because she is being sent toll fines that are in her name, but a result of Mr Kirisome's antics in her car. Ms Maker is devastated after being left by the father of her young daughter and her partner of ten years . Ms Maker accuses her ex-partner (pictured) of being obsessed with social media and taking selfies . Mr Raja and Mr Kirisome deny being in a relationship. Although Mr Kirisome is an openly gay man, they both deny that Mr Raja is involved with men . Mr Kirisome defends his behaviour by explaining that 'the vehicle is in Dan's name. It was paid for by him a couple of days ago.' Ms Maker, who was a stay-at-home mother, has suddenly found herself unable to make ends meet. She has been left without any source of income, explaining: 'I was the home-maker, the child raiser. I would do the cooking and all the errands. I was basically his personal assistant.' '(Dan) stopped paying everything, I've been left with electricity and gas bills,' Ms Maker claims. Asked if she had any inkling that her husband was interested in men, the mother admits that there were a signs in recent years that had started to concern her. 'There was a certain way he would dance, the way he would speak sometimes, the way he would hold himself,' she explained. Mr Raja and Mr Kirisome both deny allegations that they are in a romantic relationship. Ms Maker's ex-partner is also adamant that he is not involved with men. Mr Kirisome rang Mr Raja during an interview in a carpark with A Current Affair. While on loud speaker, Mr Raja insisted 'you obviously don't know the full story' Mr Kirisome denied all allegations and argued that the belongings were in Mr Raja's name, so it was his right to remove them from Ms Maker and give them to Mr Kirisome . When asked 'if Mr Raja is gay' by an A Current Affair reporter, Mr Kirisome responded explosively, using many expletives during their conversation. 'Oh yeah (Dan's) very, very happy. He's f***ing gay as can be. He's happy,' said Mr Kirisome sarcastically in response. He then became serious, clarifying, 'He's not gay at all, no he's not.' 'We have absolutely nothing to hide. We're not in a romantic relationship.' However, despite Mr Kirisome and Mr Raja's argument that the items are in Mr Raja's name, Family Law in Australia states that Mr Raja's ex-partner has legal entitlements. Mr Kirisome was angry and defensive when confronted by reporters, who asked him why he is now using Ms Maker's iPhone and driving her Mercedes . 'When you're in a relationship or in a marriage, the property is owned by each of you, irrespective of whose name it's registered in,' family lawyer Deborah Avizzio told A Current Affair. 'That’s the benefit of the family law in Australia. 'For people who don’t make a financial contribution, like a typical home maker type role, their contributions are still recognised as a home-maker or a parent.’ Ms Maker is determined to make sure that she and her family are given the money and respect she feels they deserve. 'My children and I don't deserve this.'

"Delays were continuing on the M25 this morning more than 30 hours after a fatal crash which has seen two men placed under arrest in hospital. Yesterday, thousands of drivers were trapped in eight miles of tailbacks after a man died in the 'catastrophic' four-lorry pile-up on one of the busiest stretches of the motorway. The victim, believed to have been a 39-year-old from Leicester, was found dead at the scene and three more were injured when a lorry ploughed through the central reservation in Essex. Scroll down for video . Drivers were stuck in eight miles of tailbacks, pictured yesterday, after a fatal crash on the M25 near to Waltham Abbey, on one of the busiest stretches of motorway . Today, one lane still remained closed in each direction between junctions 26 and 27 at Waltham Abbey causing delays again this morning for drivers. The Highways Agency confirmed today that both lanes were closed while emergency repair work was carried out to the central reservation, which was damaged in yesterday's smash. It has been reported that at least 40 metres of the barrier will need to be rebuilt following the crash and lane four of the carriageway in both directions may need to be closed for several days. Delays: A live traffic map showing the M25 this morning. The grey line near the top indicates lanes closures in both directions on the M25 between junctions 26 and 27 . They also added that drivers travelling in both directions could expect delays of around 10 minutes, with the slow moving traffic stretching for up to two miles. Meanwhile, Essex Police said they were still waiting to question two men who were arrested but were still being treated in hospital following the crash. The men, aged 33 and 25, have been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Crash: Police said the motorway, pictured early yesterday morning was a 'catastrophic scene of carnage' and the road was closed for 13 hours .

"Millionaire homeowners at the exclusive Sandbanks resort say rowdy stag and hen parties renting luxury mansions are making their lives a 'misery'. Angry residents launched a campaign after several multi-million pounds holiday homes in the exclusive beach-side destination in Dorset became popular as weekend 'party houses'. Some of the properties were being rented out for up to £1,000 a night - and because they are so big, groups of up to 30 partygoers were staying in them for nights out in nearby Bournemouth. Millionaire homeowners at the exclusive Sandbanks resort say rowdy stag and hen parties renting luxury mansions are making their lives a 'misery'. The property above is one of those listed for rent in the area by Deluxe Holiday Homes . A judge has upheld a noise abatement notice handed to letting agent Michele King by Poole Council following a string of complaints from residents. Pictured is one of the properties offered for rent by Deluxe Holiday Homes . Some of the properties are rented out for up to £1,000 a night. Pictured is an example of a home available for rent near the coast . Deluxe: A number of upmarket mansions, like the one above, are being listed for rent by letting companies in the area and have become popular among those looking for a luxury getaway . Residents in neighbouring properties said they were regularly having to endure noise from all-night parties while some reported having to ask revellers to remove sex dolls tied to their verandas. But that could all be set to change after a court ruling that could see landlords and letting agents fined up to £20,000 if they allow guests to run riot at their properties. In the first decision of its kind, a judge upheld a noise abatement notice handed to letting agent Michele King following a string of complaints about a property managed by her Deluxe Holiday Homes business. Mrs King appealed the notice handed to her from Poole council, arguing she could not be held responsible for the noise coming from the property as she was not the one staying there. But District Judge Stephen Nicholls dismissed the appeal, stating that Mrs King should be accountable for the disturbances. The ruling means landlords and lettings agents will now be held accountable should complaints be made about groups staying in their houses, and could be liable for fines of up to £20,000 if they flout noise abatement orders in future. Residents in neighbouring properties say they have suffered sleepless nights from homes rented out by stag and hen parties. Pictured is another of the homes offered for rent in and around Sandbanks . Residents declared the judge's decision 'a significant victory' but warned it only protects them against large groups making excessive noise . Houses in Sandbanks (pictured from above), a tiny sandy peninsula at the mouth of Poole Harbour, can sell for as much as £10million . Two football managers own property in the Sandbanks area (shown on the map) - QPR boss Harry Redknapp, who owns a harbour-front mansion, and former Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis . Residents declared the decision 'a significant victory' but warned it only protects them against large groups making excessive noise. Steve Cameron, a 55-year-old IT consultant, formed the Party House Action Group with his wife Jen after the property next door to theirs became a party house. He said: 'We have been fighting this ever since the first noise abatement order was issued on a party house three years ago. 'Living next door to one has been sheer misery for us and our neighbours. 'From spring through to autumn each year we have been unable to sleep with our windows open and we have been constantly woken up in the early hours by large groups coming back from nights out. 'While this ruling is not the complete answer it's a step in the right direction because it means letting agents and landlords who specialise in short-term rentals can now be held accountable for the behaviour of their guests. 'They face a £20,000 fine for flouting the noise abatement order so hopefully that will be enough to encourage them to take responsibility for what goes on at their properties. 'What it doesn't do is prevent these houses being rented out to huge groups of people in the first place, it only stops them from making noise deemed excessive. Michele King runs a number of luxury houses in the Sandbanks area catering for groups ranging in size from 10 to 26 people . Steve Cameron (pictured), a 55-year-old IT consultant, formed the Party House Action Group with his wife Jen after the property next door to theirs became a party house. 'It also takes a long time to go through the application process to get a noise abatement order.' Terry Stewart, president of the Branksome Park, Canford Cliffs and District Residents' Association, added: 'We are very glad of the court's ruling. 'Neighbours of the party houses have really suffered over the last three years.' Cllr Xena Dion, a spokesman for environmental health at Poole council, said: 'We are truly pleased with this decision. The council takes the issue of noise disturbance very seriously as it is extremely distressing for neighbours. 'This case has caused a huge amount of distress to local residents and officers have dedicated a significant amount of effort to resolve it. 'The court's verdict means we can now continue using this legislation to tackle any similar incidents in the future.' Mrs King runs a number of luxury houses in the Sandbanks area catering for groups ranging in size from 10 to 26 people. Sandbanks is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of its property . Located on a small peninsula stretching across the mouth of Poole Harbour in Dorset, Sandbanks is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of property. By area Sandbanks and surrounding Lilliput, Branksome Park and Canford Cliffs, nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach', boast the fourth highest land value in the world and the UK's largest concentration of expensive properties outside London. Sandbanks' popularity is attributed to its seclusion, and every home in the community is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel. Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions. The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand. In July 2009 a 1,393-square-metre (14,990 sq ft) empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for £13.5 million – the equivalent of nearly £10,000 per square metre. Earlier this year a bungalow bought for just £1,000 almost a century ago (around £40,000 in today's money) and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be worth £5million - a 500,000 percent increase in value. In April, a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye-watering £2.25million. In March, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down. Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million as Sandbanks' s reputation has continued to grow. Notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme Souness, Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie. Computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden is also said to have a home there. The five-bedroom house she was given the noise abatement notice for is advertised on her website under the heading 'live the Sandbanks dream' and says it sleeps up to 20 people over three floors. Her website also offers to organise stag and hen dos and provide naked butlers for those staying at her houses. Mrs King declined to comment after her appeal was dismissed. Houses in Sandbanks, a tiny sandy peninsula at the mouth of Poole Harbour, can sell for as much as £10million. Two football managers own property in the Sandbanks area - QPR boss Harry Redknapp, who owns a harbour-front mansion, and former Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis. Graeme Souness, the ex-Liverpool player and manager and now Sky TV pundit, has a home in nearby Branksome Park as does former Tottenham player Darren Anderton. Up until recently, cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott owned a house on Sandbanks.","Sandbanks residents launched a campaign after several homes became popular at weekends as 'party houses'

"Terrifying video footage has revealed the moment a drug dealer pulled out a gun on an undercover cop in Florida. Scott Perala, an agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, was buying two AK-47s and prescription pills from two suspects in a parking lot in Cocoa Beach when the incident unfolded. Although the confrontation, which was caught on Perala's body camera, occurred in 2010, WESH has just secured the footage. It shows Perala, who had previously carried out hundreds of successful undercover operations, climbing into the backseat of a car where suspects Jeremy Williams and Beaver Duncan are waiting. Scroll down for video . Fears: A suspect can be seen pulling a gun at an undercover agent during a routine operation in Florida. The agent had climbed into their car to buy guns and pills when the two men tried to rob him . Threats: The suspect tells the agent to give him the $2,000 he had brought to buy the guns and pills . After greeting the men, he takes a pouch of Oxycodone pills and starts to count them when he suddenly looks up to see a handgun and an AK-47 being pulled at him. 'It was three inches from my head… that barrel looked like a cannon,' Perala told WESH. He puts up his hands as he pleads with the men - while they demand him to put down the $2,000 he had brought to purchase the guns and pills. Perala jumps from the car as a shot is fired at him and, after taking cover behind an SUV, he pulls out his own weapon and fires repeatedly as they drive away. The men sped off and took shelter behind a daycare, where they were captured following another shootout with responding officers. Fighting back: The agent can be seen pulling his gun out and shooting at the suspects as they race away . Lucky escape: Scott Perala, an agent for the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Agency, who was in the video, said the terrifying experience was worth it to keep the men off the streets . Locked up: The two men in the car, Beaver Duncan, left, and Jeremy Williams are now serving life sentences . Duncan's handgun, which was loaded, was later found inside the fence of the daycare. Williams, Duncan and a third co-conspirator were charged in the case and sentenced to life in prison, KSN reported. ATF supervisor Joe Lenczyk said 10 other agents were listening and watching when the deal was taking place. He said that agents often carry out their deals in public places. 'Most bad guys aren’t going to [commit a violent act] in broad daylight in a public area,' he said. But Perala has remained positive about his near-death experience. 'It's worth it to me if they're off the street,' he said.

"Manchester City are plotting a big-money move for Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba. Work has already begun on identifying Yaya Toure's long-term successor - and France star Pogba features highly among the candidates. The former Manchester United youngster is already viewed as one of the best all-round midfielders in Europe, despite being only 21. Manchester City are plotting a big-money move for Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba . Pogba is seen as one of the hottest prospects in European football after a series of stunning displays . Pogba came through the ranks at Manchester United but ended up leaving Old Trafford two years ago . In terms of fee paid: . Sergio Aguero £38m from Atletico Madrid (2011) Robinho £32.5m from Real Madrid (2008) Eliaquim Mangala £32m from Porto (2014) Fernandinho £30m from Shakhtar Donetsk (2013) Edin Dzeko £27m from Wolfsburg (2011) Pogba signed a new long term deal to stay in Turin earlier this year. But that will not put City off should they decide he is the man they want to marshal their midfield in the long-term. Juventus will demand a high price for Pogba, at least £40million, which would see City break their transfer record should the deal go through. It is currently £38m for Sergio Aguero from Atletico Madrid in 2011. The Barclays Premier League champions are confident they are now in control of UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations, allowing them to make such a big-money swoop. Arsenal are also long-term admirers of Pogba, manager Arsene Wenger would jump at the chance to sign his compatriot. However, despite the Gunners' newly stabilised financial muscle, the numbers involved in such a deal could be beyond them.

"Nothing completes the summer like a good book. Whether you’re soaking up the sun at an exotic beach, hiking in the mountains or even taking a stroll in a park, a new report has revealed the most popular eBooks of 2014 for you to enjoy. From mystery, thriller, romance to comedy – there’s something for everyone to kick-start the New Year with these must-have eBooks. Rakuten Kobo Inc. has revealed an overview of what Australian readers buy and the books they read right to the end. Scroll down to view the top eBooks of 2014 . The must-have eBooks of 2014 have been revealed ahead of the reading season - perfect for everyone! It seems Australian readers are not falling head over heels for romance novels. By breaking down data collected from Kobo users throughout 2014, the inaugural Book Report found Australian readers are most captivated by mystery, with 63.5 percent finishing off books in this category. ‘We expected to see more people to finish a romance novel to find out the happy ending but it was interesting to see people were more interested in “who did it” mystery books,’ APAC director of content Malcolm Neil told Daily Mail Australia. The report found 56.5 percent of readers finished Sci-Fi novels while non-fiction's score was 37.8 percent. 2014's bestsellers in the Kobo bookstore for Australia - From left: Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, The Book Thief by Markus Zusak and One Cold Night by Katia Lief . Kobo president and chief content officer Michael Tamblyn said: ‘A book’s position on the bestseller list may indicate it’s bought, but that isn’t the same as it being read or finished. ‘A lot of readers have multiple novels on the go at any given time, which means they may not always read one book from start to finish before jumping into the next great story. ‘Different kinds of books also have different reading patterns. Novels are read cover-to-cover, but a work of non-fiction could be sampled for facts rather than read to completion.’ The Book Report found Australians are more captivated by mysterious reads than romance . Topping the list of books read to completion in Australia was James Patterson, while Canada and the USA saw Nora Roberts take out the title. 'The most surprising book that hit the list would be Capital in the Twenty-First Century by Thomas Piketty because you wouldn't expect people to buy a big serious book about economics - it's a really hard book to read,' Mr Neill said. The most completed books of 2014 - From left: Seven Minutes to Noon by Katia Lief, Lead: Stage Dive 3 by Kylie Scott and The Perfect Husband by Lisa Gardner . Top 10 Business Books - From left: The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, What the Most Successful People Do Before Breakfast by Laura Vanderkam and Thinking, fast and slow by Daniel Kahneman . Looking at Australia’s bestselling books of 2014, Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn topped the list, boosted by the release of the film of the same name in October. 'We got to see how much impact books have on films,’ Mr Neil told Daily Mail Australia. ‘Gone Girl sold massive amounts before the release of the film. It surprised me because it’s an old book which was released back in 2012.' Over a three-month period, 33 percent of Gone Girl's sales occurred in the week prior and week after the movie’s premiere. ‘The harrowing experience that influenced people to read the book before or after the film was good to see readers wanted to extend their experience,’ he said. From mystery, thriller, romance to comedy – there’s something for everyone to kick-start the New Year's Resolution with these must-have eReadings . Aussie favourite Markus Zusak placed second with his bestselling novel The Book Thief, but it was Veronica Roth’s futuristic Divergent series that took out three spots in the top ten. As the book market becomes ever more international, many homegrown authors have successfully climbed the charts, including  Graeme Simsion and Liane Moriarty, who all took up multiple spots in Australia’s top 100 bestsellers. Heading into 2015, more people manage to finish a book in January than in any other month of the year. New Year resolutions could be partly behind the result, which included self-improvement books and business books. EBOOK MUST HAVES – 2014’s Bestsellers in the Kobo bookstore for Australia . 1.

"The former Prime Minister claims that his ‘commitments in the Middle East and elsewhere’ mean that it will be ‘challenging’ for him to give face-to-face evidence to MPs about the letters . Tony Blair has been summoned to appear before MPs investigating ‘comfort letters’ sent to IRA fugitives assuring them they would not face prosecution. The former Prime Minister was accused of being 'extremely disrespectful' to Parliament by repeatedly ducking requests to appear in front of the Northern Ireland affairs committee. Mr Blair had claimed that his ‘commitments’ made an appearance ‘challenging’. The committee has spent more than six months attempting to question Mr Blair over the secret deals that he made with Sinn Fein. After failing to get Mr Blair's agreement, the committee has now summoned him to appear on Wednesday. In a letter to Mr Blair committee chair Laurence Robertson said: 'You have been in the UK regularly over the past few weeks, but you have not been able to find an hour or so to meet us.' North Antrim MP Ian Paisley had accused the former PM of ‘being on the run’ from giving evidence. Mr Blair made promises to more than 200 people suspected of paramilitary offences that they would not face prosecution. But in correspondence seen by The Times newspaper, the former Prime Minister claims that his ‘commitments in the Middle East and elsewhere’ mean that it will be ‘challenging’ for him to give face-to-face evidence to MPs about the letters. He also added that he had nothing ‘new’ to say. In a letter sent last month, he wrote that he had ‘nothing to say which will be new to you, the members of your committee or the people of Northern Ireland.’ The former Prime Minister also noted that he had already given evidence in private to the Hallett Review. The review was commissioned by David Cameron following the collapse of a trial involving a suspect in a bombing carried out by the IRA in Hyde Park in 1982. The assurance letters came to light during the trial of John Downey - accused of murdering four soldiers in the attack. During the case, it emerged that Mr Downey had been given a letter assuring him that he would not face prosecution. A three-month inquiry into the ‘comfort letters’, led by Lady Justice Hallett, concluded that the scheme was not unlawful. Instead, she said that there had been cases where ‘not wanted’ notices were issued to the wrong parties. The review was commissioned by David Cameron following the collapse of a trial involving a suspect in a bombing carried out by the IRA in Hyde Park in 1982. Pictured, the bodies of dead horses, covered by blankets, lay on the ground after the explosion in Hyde Park killed members of the Household Guards . Mr Blair concluded his letter by saying: ‘However, if you continue to insist on my attendance, then I will ask my office to look for a date in the new year, but I must emphasise that my commitments... will make this challenging.’ The committee has already said that they would accept video evidence from Mr Blair instead of a personal appearance. A spokeswoman for Mr Blair told The Times last night: ‘We are considering all the options proposed by the committee, given that they have refused to accept the offer of written evidence. ‘It should be noted that Mr Blair has already given evidence to the government’s inquiry led by Lady Justice Hallett and his commitment and respect for the people of Northern Ireland remains undiminished. We will respond to the committee shortly.’","Blair made promises to over 200 people suspected of paramilitary offences .

"A Polish woman has admitted she is 'positively surprised' she can obtain child benefits from Britain for her son, even though he lives in Warsaw. Evita Kossman is one of 20,000 immigrants from the EU currently claiming benefits from the UK for children who live in a different country. The mother-of-five is raking in £220 a month in welfare payments from the UK thanks to her husband, Sebastian working in a Bristol factory for a decade. Scroll down for video . £220 a month up: Evita Kossman lives in Poland where she is earning a living running a restaurant but gets benefits for her son thanks to her husband working in the UK . Separated family: Evita lives in Warsaw with her son, Mateusz, now 10, pictured sat on her lap as a toddler, while her husband works in Bristol. Their other children are all grown up . 'I was positively surprised that Great Britain supported us and helped my family well,' she told Channel 5 documentary Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole. 'No one comes from Great Britain, from the welfare system, to check on us. No one comes to check that I am here with (my son) Mateusz. They pay. I am very surprised. They are very trustful.' Evita had joined Sebastian and their other grown up children in Britain but she returned to Poland with ten-year-old Mateusz because he was struggling at school. Although he is now apart from his father - who he only gets to see a few times a year - Evita says Mateusz is now much better off. The child benefit and child tax credit they receive via Sebastian in the UK goes much further in their home country thanks to the lower cost of living. 'This is our kingdom. In Poland, food is cheaper than in England. We rent a flat for £350 a month. When we lived in Bristol, we spent £800 a month,' she said. 'They are very trustful': Evita is delighted she can still get benefits for her son even though he no longer lives in Britain . Apart: Sebastian, left, works at a factory in Bristol so only sees his son a few times a year . She added that she doesn't see anything wrong with her child being supported by British taxpayers. She said: 'In my opinion, it is absolutely normal to receive benefits from abroad, from United Kingdom. It is where my husband works and I am entitled to claim benefits because of the system.' Evita said she resents accusations - which come from her fellow Polish people - that she is lazy or a scrounger for taking hand outs from Britain. She said: 'Polish press say about thieves and scroungers. I'm sad when I read these words about me. It's not true. A lot of Polish comments are that I am lazy, I am counting on benefits only. 'This is not true. I am hard working mum. I try to be the best mum for my son. It's difficult to read stories about myself and their opinion.' Hard-working mother: Evita runs her own restaurant so she only spends the money from Britain on 'food, books, toys and entertainment' for her son . As well as looking after her son, Evita has opened her own restaurant near their one bedroom flat in Warsaw. She takes home a wage from the business so the £220 a month benefits she gets from the UK are spent solely on her son. In contrast, Polish children only get £20 a month from their government. Evita said: 'Mateusz gets only British benefits. I was surprised but this money is extra money for my son. 'Normally, my husband transfers money through Western Union which is very easy. I have money, after the transfer, from Great Britain. I spend this money on Mateusz only. I use it to buy food, books, toys, entertainment... We go to the cinema once a month.' She said she had no qualms about taking handouts from Britain to spend on her son. Lower cost of living: Evita said money goes much further in Poland so they are better off at home . Off to work: The mother says she is not lazy as she works full-time. 'I earn my own money, my business is doing well,' she said . 'I know a lot of people spend benefits on useless things, for example smokes and drinks. But look at me - I am a hard-working mum and businesswoman. I earn my own money, my business is doing well,' she said. Also in tonight's documentary, that will be shown on Channel 5 at 9pm, Romanian father-of-three, Ion, reveals how he came to the UK at the start of 2014 determined to claim thousands of pounds in British benefits. Nearly one year on, he estimates that he gets £1,200 worth of benefits a month, and he is spending all of it renovating his family home back in rural Romania. The programme takes a trip with Ion back to Romania to check the work in progress on his house. As the cost of living is cheaper there, the money goes a long way and Ion has bought a new boiler, a water pump and a new bath and toilet. Plenty of work has been completed on the structure of the building – all paid for by British benefits. Ion is able to claim the benefits because he has self-employed status as a scrap metal collector in the UK, even if he spends much of his time back home in Romania. Now Ion is signing up his one-year-old son Raoul for child benefit, which he thinks will get him another £500 each month.

"Former Communist East Germany secretly sold its citizens to western pharmaceutical companies to use as human guinea pigs in drug trials. Tens of thousands of sick people in the former German Democratic Republic were treated with medicines not approved in the West to see how effective they were. Details of the top secret project have been unearthed in the files of the Stasi secret police in Berlin. The communist regime profited with millions in hard currency. The bridge between East Germany and West Berlin pictured in the early 1960s. Recently opened files show how Stasi officials secretly sold  citizens to western pharmaceutical companies to use as human guinea pigs . But the human cost was high with dozens killed through side effects of drugs which had bypassed the normally stringent testing procedures demanded by western democracies. Even worse, some patients received placebos - pills that did nothing at all - to gauge how they responded in comparison to others who were given proper medication. The practice was exposed by journalists Stefan Hoge and Carsten Opitz and screened this week in Germany in a disturbing documentary entitled 'Test and Dead'. The Stasi files - miles and miles of yellowing paperwork which the hated secret police of East Germany failed to destroy when the country imploded in 1989 - revealed details of how it became one of the most important testing arenas for western drug companies. The conspiracy involved the state, doctors and western big pharma firms. GDR leaders were happy to implement the programme in a land which excelled only in shortages. 'There were pharmacies which could no . longer provide 20 percent of needed drugs,' said pharmaceutical . historian Christoph Friedrich from the University of Marburg. 'And that . shortage extended to hospitals.' The Stasi files have revealed details of how East Germany became one of the most important testing arenas for western drug companies (file picture) The thalidomide scandal at the beginning of the 1960's intensified the criteria for medical testing across the western world, including in West Germany. New regulatory requirements for market approval forced the manufacturer to conduct ever larger clinical trials of their drugs in large groups of patients. East Germany, for cold, hard cash, was willing to provide the guinea pigs - although they would never know that they formed part of a huge experiment. 'A secret Conference with politburo Central Committee members responsible for health care provided the stage for a momentous deal in the spring of 1983,' said historian Friedrich. 'At selected hospitals, doctors from western pharmaceutical companies were able to perform clinical tests of non-approved drugs. 'Paperwork in the Stasi files shows that western drug corporations signed contracts with a GDR foreign trade company. From 20 tests in 1983 there were 165 underway in 1988. 'The researchers could find no documentation in the Stasi files, or the records of the former East German Ministry of Health, showing that patients knew they were in fact being used as test models. The TV programme could find no-one in western big pharma companies who had any idea about the secret testing programme, said Opitz.","Tens of thousands tested with experimental drugs not approved in the West .

"When travelling in India, you should invest in a turban, available with a little haggling at any bazaar. You might expect the locals to resent your attempts to dress up as a minor character in a Sidney James or Peter Sellers film. On the contrary, they appreciate any efforts by Westerners to come to terms with their complex culture and exhaustingly hectic society. 'You look great, sir, magnificent,' said a tuk-tuk driver, stopping in heavy traffic in Jaisalmer, causing an embarrassing fanfare of car horns. 'You look like maharaja.' A landscape of colour and charm: The Jaswant Thada memorial (foreground) stands proudly in Jodhpur . Next morning, when our guide for the day turned up, he had heard there was a maharaja in town. When I was greeted by shopkeepers, shouting 'Where is your turban, sir? You must wear it,' he realised the fake maharaja was only me. Wherever you go in India, strangers engage you in conversation, usually trying to sell you clothing, food or hotel rooms, or asking 'Where you from?' Wear a turban to cut out this tiresome preliminary banter. Our guide happened to be a local disc jockey and, by the time we set off the next evening for a camel trek and camping by a fire in the sand dunes, the presence of the fake maharaja had even reached the camel drivers. Radio is a powerful medium in the desert by the Pakistan border, they told us. How to wear a turban, parts one and two: Left, a camel driver in Rajasthan; right: James as a 'maharaja' We spent two weeks driving in and around Rajasthan, starting and finishing in Delhi, staying one or two nights in each place. The province is the size of Germany, but the roads are not as good, so it's a punishing schedule, with gridlock traffic in the cities and huge potholes taking you by surprise. A driver is an essential requirement for anyone unaccustomed to Indian roads. Ours was able to negotiate heavy trucks, cyclists, unaccompanied cows, dogs, sheep and goats, and rickshaws, sometimes at speed through narrow gaps with inches to spare. A place for reflection: Udaipur rises magnificently on the shores of Lake Pichola in Rajasthan . What do you do if you find your side of the motorway is blocked by roadworks? Drive on the opposite carriageway against the oncoming traffic, then cross the central reservation when you get a chance. Others may blast their horns, but this is standard procedure. Animals and men, young and old, even sleep unmolested in the central reservations, while fathers often pile their families on the backs of their scooters, sometimes with five passengers, including small children and ladies in flowing saris, riding sidesaddle without helmets. We never saw any of them come to any harm, although there were some agonising near-misses. It is 41 years since I last visited Delhi, but since that time, everyone has acquired a car. Thank goodness for the Commonwealth Games, which caused them to invest in a Metro system. We spent two days in Delhi, visiting the Red Fort, Jama Mosque, Gandhi Smriti, Humayun's Tomb, Connaught Place and Lutyens's monumental government buildings. Then Agra, the Taj Mahal, where ladies like to sit sadly perched in Princess Diana's famous seat, and Fatehpur Sikri. Then Jaipur, Bundi and Udaipur. Jaipur is famous for its harem where the ruler's ladies can look out on the street from windows without being seen themselves, as well as a tribe of elephants taking tourists up the hill to the Amber Fort. Udaipur has a lake with a palace in the middle and another on the shore. This is popular as a wedding venue and for spectacular firework displays. All in the balance: Local women display their astonishing carrying skills in the desert outside Jaisalmer . From there, we travelled to Chhatra Sagar, a noted bird sanctuary with dam and an artificial lake. Guests stay in luxurious tents and the manager takes you on a tour of the local village, explaining the Victoria's the Prince of Jaipur in painted the colour giving it 'the City' environmentallyfriendly structure of the community, its schools, farm workers, potters and silversmiths. Life sometimes stands on its head in India. At Bikaner, we saw a temple where rats in their thousands are fed, pampered and generally worshipped. In Jodhpur, we stayed in the now famous Raas hotel, with its magnificent view of the Mehrangarh Fort perched on top of a steep cliff. By this stage, you'll need to keep a note of your forts, to avoid getting them muddled. The Raas is a quiet enclave in the centre of the city, but with a mosque at the end of the garden. The hotel thoughtfully provides earplugs to prevent guests being woken up by the call to prayer at 4am. We had dinner in another new establishment, the WelcomHotel, on the evening the Maharaja of Jodhpur was paying his first official visit. In the pink: Local men watch the world go by on a warm afternoon in the Rajasthan city of Jaisalmer . This is one of those hotels where massive, three-day Bollywood-type weddings take place - a thriving business and expensive for prosperous families. The Maharaja and Maharani were greeted by the manager and by the head chef, who happens to be His Highness's nephew. Rose petals were sprinkled at the Maharaja's feet and a four-course dinner served. Good to see that nothing has changed. No one sprinkled rose petals at my feet, however. I wasn't wearing my turban.

"This is the moment a Cleveland man was exonerated of a murder he didn't commit - 40 years after the killing took place. Kwame Ajamu was just 17 years old when he was sentenced to death in 1975 after businessman Harry Franks was beaten and shot dead outside a convenience store in his neighborhood. Then going under the name Ronnie Bridgeman, he was jailed alongside his brother Wiley Bridgeman, then aged 20, and their friend Ricky Jackson, 19. But the case against them unraveled after the prosecution's star witness, a 13-year-old, recounted his testimony last year, saying he lied after being pressured and fed evidence by detectives. Scroll down for video . Kwame Ajamu, now 57, breaks down in tears after being exonerated for a murder he didn't commit - 40 years after the killing took place . Mr Ajamu, then named Ronnie Bridgeman, was sentenced to death in 1975 along with brother Wiley and friend Ricky Jackson for the killing of Harry Franks (pictured, Judge Barker hugs Mr Ajamu after verdict) Mr Ajamu was released in 2003 on parole after having his sentence lowered to life in jail, but it was only yesterday that he was exonerated after a key witness recounted his testimony . Mr Jackson and Mr Bridgeman, now aged 59 and 60, were released from jail last month after the charges against them were dropped. Mr Jackson had served 39 years, the longest ever for a man who was subsequently exonerated. Mr Ajamu had been released on parole in 2003 after 27 years, and his exoneration yesterday brings to a close a case which the county prosecutor branded 'a terrible injustice.' In emotional scenes inside the Cleveland courtroom, Mr Ajamu broke down in tears and pumped his fists before Judge Pamela Barker stepped down from the bench to give him a hug. Comforted by his attorney Terry Gilbert, Mr Ajamu told the court that 'this room is lit with the truth.' The tragic case began in spring 1975 outside a Cut-Rate store in Fairmount. Harry Franks, a money-order collector, had just come out of the shop when he was attacked. The assailants threw acid in his face, robbed him, beat him, and then used a gun to execute him. A green car screeched up to the curb before the attackers jumped in and were driven away. Officers began their investigations and arrested several suspects, but none of them were correctly picked out during identity parades. Witness Eddie Vernon, who was aged 12 at the time of the murder of Mr Franks (pictured), told police he had seen the killings and gave the names of Mr Ajamu, Mr Bridgeman and Mr Jackson . However, last year Mr Vernon recounted his testimony, saying he had lied about being at the scene, and had been fed details and threatened by detectives while testifying . Officers then put out appeals for information and Eddie Vernon, who was aged just 12 at the time, stepped forward saying he had witnessed the crime and knew who the perpetrators were. He later told Scene magazine: 'I don't exactly know why I went up to the police at first. I think I just wanted to be helpful. 'You have to understand I was 12 years old at the time. I thought I was doing the right thing.' In fact, Vernon had not witnessed the crime, but had been heading home on a school bus in another part of the neighbourhood when he and his friends heard gunshots. They raced to the scene in time to see Mr Franks dying on the pavement, but saw nothing more than that. When the case came to court, however, Vernon was able to testify to having seen the Bridgeman brothers and Mr Jackson at the scene of the crime. He gave details of the weapon used, the method of execution and the getaway vehicle - but these had all been fed to him by detectives, along with threats to arrest his parents for perjury if he tried to back away from the story, he said later. He testified three times at the separate trials - each testimony riddled with inconsistencies that failed to stack up with the others. Wiley Bridgeman (left) and Ricky Jackson were 20 and 19 when they were jailed. They were released last month aged 60 and 59. Mr Jackson served 39 years, the longest ever for a man subsequently exonerated . The county prosecutor's office has said it will not oppose compensation claims by the men, opening up the possibility of a joint payout of $4.1million (pictured, the moment Mr Jackson was told he could walk free) After spending the majority of their adult lives in jail, brothers Kwame Ajamu and Wiley Bridgeman share a hug outside court as the charges against them are dropped . But it was enough to convince three separate juries that the men were guilty, and they were sentenced to the death penalty, which was later lowered to life in prison. It was not until April 2013, following a series of arrests for drug offences and a bout of poor health which landed him in hospital, that Mr Vernon tearfully confessed to his pastor that his evidence had been a lie. He later gave a written statement to officials from the Ohio Innocence Project who passed it to the courts, leading to the three men having their names cleared. Following the verdicts, county prosecutor Tim McGinty said his office will not oppose any claims of innocence, clearing the way for huge compensation claims by the victims. The trio could potentially claim $4.1million between them for a lifetime spent behind bars under Ohio law that allows those wrongly incarcerated to claim $40,000 for each year in jail. The prosecutor's concession seemed to astonish longtime Cleveland civil rights and defense attorney Terry Gilbert, who represented Mr Ajamu and his brother. He said: 'To recognize an injustice ... it gives me faith and hope in this criminal justice system that good things can come out of it from time to time.' Since being released in 2003, Mr Ajamu, now 57, has rebuilt his life. He is married to a woman he met in downtown Cleveland in 2003 when she couldn't find the right bus and he rode with her to her destination. They married the next year after she proposed to him. Mr Ajamu has called wife Lashawn his best friend and greatest supporter. In this photo Mr Ajamu teaches his brother how to use a smartphone. The last time the brothers were together as free men, the cordless phone had not even been invented yet . Brothers Kwame Ajamu and Wiley Bridgeman embrace after Mr Ajamu was exonerated of the murder of Harry Franks, bringing to an end a 40-year case that was described by prosecutors as 'a terrible injustice' Since being released in 2003, Mr Ajamu has rebuilt his life and is now married to Lashwan (right), who he met on the bus. He has called her his best friend and greatest supporter . He added: 'It's my hope going forward that we don't have to wait another 40 years for the next Kwame Ajamu, Wiley Bridgeman, Ricky Jackson. 'It's my hope from this day on we can stop ignoring what is obvious in the criminal justice system and move forward with peace and love.' After the hearing, Ajamu credited Kyle Swenson, a writer for Scene Magazine, who in 2011 dug into the men's stories and exposed how justice had been subverted. Ajamu said he hoped one day to meet with Eddie Vernon, who is now 52, so he can tell him he understands what happened and has no ill will toward him. Ajamu said his exoneration finally makes him feel free to go anywhere he wants, anytime he'd like. 'I can even go back to being Ronnie Bridgeman, but I'm not,' he said. 'They killed Ronnie Bridgeman. They killed his spirit. They killed everything he believed in, everything he ever wanted. 'I wanted to be something, too. I could have been a lawyer possibly. I could have been Barack Obama. Who knows?'","Kwame Ajamu was 17 when he was jailed for 1975 killing of Harry Franks .

"The victim of the acid attack at a house in Truro, Cornwall, has been named locally as married father-of-one Andreas Christopheros, 29 (pictured) A 29-year-old man is fighting for his life in hospital after having acid thrown in his face when he opened the front door to his home. The man, who has been named locally as Andreas Christopheros, suffered life-threatening facial injuries after being attacked at his home in Truro, Cornwall, by a man yesterday afternoon. His wife is also thought to have suffered burns, although she was not targeted in the 'nasty attack' and was instead injured as a result of going to the aid of her husband. It is understood the corrosive substance was thrown in the former public schoolboy's face after he opened the door at about 4pm. Devon and Cornwall Police said the victim remains in a critical condition at Royal Cornwall Hospital (Treliske) and confirmed the incident is being treated as attempted murder. Officers were called to the home of Mr Christopheros, a businessman involved in event and property management, following reports that a chemical substance, believed to be acid, had been thrown in his face. Police today said he was 'helpless' and described the attack as 'really rare'. One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said Mr Christopheros was a father of one and described the incident as 'terribly cowardly'. The neighbour: 'The first thing we saw was lots of police cars swarming round the area last night. 'Then we heard that it was Andreas, and that he had been hurt and taken to hospital. 'We didn't know much else until this morning, we are absolutely shocked that someone has attacked him with some acid. It's a terribly cowardly thing to do. 'We heard that Andreas' wife was injured in the attack too, we're not sure about their little girl. 'It must have been someone he knew, because he opened the door and let them in. 'I've only spoken to him a few times, usually about his motorbike, he does have quite a nice bike. Scroll down for video . Police are treating the incident in Carrine Road, Truro, Cornwall (pictured) as attempted murder and said the victim suffered life-threatening facial injuries. Officers are carrying out house-to-house inquiries at the scene . Mr Christopheros' property was cordoned off by police today, as investigations into the incident continued . It is believed the corrosive substance was thrown in the man's face after he opened the door to his house . Neighbours described the incident as 'terribly cowardly' while police and fire crews carried out investigations . Firefighters joined police officers in carrying out extensive enquiries at the scene of the incident today . 'I just hope he is okay, he seems like such a nice chap, he certainly doesn't deserve this. 'We'll be keeping our doors locked from now on.' Mr Christopheros, a businessman in the event and property management industries, has previously been involved in organising Newquay's Run To The Sun event - an annual custom car and dance festival - and is thought to have worked on BBC Radio One Roadshows. The privately-educated businessman, who attended King's College in Taunton, Somerset, before graduating from Plymouth University, also used to run a holiday park in Newquay. Another neighbour, who also wished to remain anonymous, described him as 'such a nice guy'. He said: 'I can't believe this has happened to Andreas. 'To me, they just seem like a regular couple in there, I can't imagine what they could have done to deserve this. 'They're both always so polite, and friendly, I've never heard a cross word come from either of them. I hope he is okay, and makes a quick recovery.' Officers were carrying out thorough checks outside the man's property, including in the front garden . Officers will remain in the area today carrying out enquiries and combing the area for any evidence . Specially-trained officers could even be seen combing a piece of land close to the man's property today . David Burchell, 83, who lives nearby, said: 'I was very surprised when I heard something like this had happened on our street. 'It's usually very quiet around here. We're still not entirely sure what happened, but as far as we are aware someone threw a chemical in someone's face, just down the road. 'Police came round to ask if we had seen anything at about 6pm last night, but they didn't tell us there had been an attack. We heard the rest on the radio this morning. 'I hope the chap involved is okay, our thoughts go out to his family.' Police are now keen to speak to the driver of a red Peugeot van seen in Carrine Road at the time of the incident. Detective Inspector Sharon Donald, who is leading the investigation, described the incident as a 'nasty attack' at a press conference this afternoon. She said: 'It is an incident that we are treating with the utmost seriousness. It’s a nasty attack on a helpless male at his home address. Police officers could be seen combing objects outside the man's property for any signs of clues or evidence . Police said the suspect was an 'unknown man' and said officers were working to trace witnesses . The 29-year-old man suffered life-threatening injuries after a corrosive substance was thrown in his face  at his home in Truro, Cornwall. He is currently in a critical condition at Royal Cornwall Hospital (Treliske) 'We are keen to speak to anyone who saw any unusual people or vehicles in the area yesterday, in particular a red van. 'If you are the driver of the red Peugeot van seen in the area, please get in touch with police so we can eliminate you from our enquiries.' Officers have been carrying out house-to-house inquiries, handing out leaflets and patrolling the area to reassure residents. Detective inspector Donald added: 'This is a really rare incident for Truro and we would like to reassure the public that this is being dealt with the utmost of seriousness to catch and convict the people or persons that have done this. 'We do not want the public to be alarmed by this isolated incident.' Anyone with information should call police on 101, quoting press log 103 of December 10.

"Hundreds of protesters caused chaos for Christmas shoppers at a London shopping centre last night with a mass demonstration over the death of American man Eric Garner, who died while being arrested in New York. Up to 600 protesters gathered in the 1,883,700 sq ft mall in Shepherd’s Bush, west London, before lying down on the floor as part of the ‘die-in’ demonstration and chanting: ‘I can’t breathe’. Police arrested 76 people at the protest, which was over the death of Mr Garner – a 43-year-old black man who choked to death in New York City in July as he was arrested for selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. Several shoppers said shops were forced to put their shutters down amid fears of damage by the protesters, while others claimed to be held outside of the mall by police who desperately tried to get the demonstration under control. Others expressed concerns about the 'intimidating' behaviour of some of the demonstrators, as well as the timing of the mass protest at the packed mall, which came just over three weeks before Christmas. Scroll down for video . Anger: Protesters held a mass 'die-in' at the Westfield shopping centre in Shepherd's Bush, London. They aimed to raise awareness of the death of Eric Garner, a black man who died as he was arrested in New York . The participants chanted: 'I can't breathe' - Eric Garner's final words - in solidarity with U.S. protesters . London protest organisers wrote on Facebook that the event was being held to denounce 'the lack of consequences for Eric Garner's murderer, as well as against the institutionalised racism of police' Met Police arrested a total of 76 people at the demonstration (not pictured), Scotland Yard confirmed . Shoppers described some of the masked protesters as 'intimidating bullies' after the protest last night . Shoppers took to Twitter to condemn the behaviour of some of the demonstrators at last night's protest . Stephanie Haigh ‏wrote on Twitter: 'I'm all for protests IF the reason is genuine but the scary masked idiots in Westfield tonight we're just intimidating bullies.' Meanwhile, shopper Tom Bassindale said: 'Pretty awful behaviour by ""protesters"" at Westfield intimidating shoppers & staff. Police calm and efficient.' Laura Kate ‏said: 'The protesters are inside Westfield now. Being neither calm nor particularly peaceful, from my observation. Blergh.' And another, who took to Twitter, under the name @afterfuse, said: 'Just found out why I couldn't get into #Westfield AND got home 35mins late because of #Ferguson protest. Morons.' Shopper Alice Rose described Westfield as 'like a war zone', while another said: 'Well I went to Westfield the wrong day to do xmas shopping.' Another shopper, called Sophie, said on Twitter: 'Wow, the shops are starting to close their shutters #Westfield #icantbreathe #london2nyc #handsupdontshoot'. The protest got underway at about 6pm  after an air horn signalled the start of the demonstration and all those involved began to lie down on the floor and start chanting: 'I can't breathe'. Many shoppers could be seen stopping to watch the protest, which filled large sections of the mall. Others were reportedly held outside the shopping centre as police contained the demonstrators. Thousands have protested in New York and elsewhere since the announcement last week that a grand jury would not indict a white police officer over Mr Garner's death. Mr Garner repeatedly gasped 'I can't breathe' in an arrest that was captured on video prior to his death. Police arrested a total of 76 in the vicinity of the Westfield mall in connection with the demonstration last night. All of those arrested were taken to various police stations across west and north London for questioning. Protesters, who police said broke away from the main group and attempted to get inside the centre, were arrested on suspicion of public order offences, with one man further arrested on suspicion of assault. Police were called to the mall to help control the protest, which ended up spilling outside of the centre . Police said a 'number of tactics - including a containment for the purpose of preventing violence and effecting arrests' were used to help control the demonstration in support of those protesting against Mr Garner's death . Police arrested 76 people. It was reported that the centre's security guards were assaulted by protesters . Officers patrolled the west London area surrounding the mall heavily last night following the mass protest . In a statement, Scotland Yard said the breakaway group assaulted security staff and caused damage to property during the demonstration. London protest organisers, London Black Revs, wrote on Facebook that the event was being held to denounce 'the lack of consequences for Eric Garner's murderer, as well as against the institutionalised racism of police in both the U.S. and the UK, and the continued murders of black people that go unpunished'. Metropolitan Police said they dealt with the protesters in London using tactics 'including a containment for the purpose of preventing violence and effecting arrests'. A statement from the Met added: '76 people were subsequently arrested on suspicion of public order offences; one man was further arrested on suspicion of assault. 'They have been taken to various London police stations for questioning.' Chief Superintendent Mark Bird, who was in charge of the policing operation, said: 'We will always work with those that wish to demonstrate lawfully - as the majority of protestors did yesterday. 'However, we will not tolerate the small minority that offer violence or commit other criminal acts, such as that witnessed outside Westfield yesterday evening.' 76 were  arrested on suspicion of public order offences; one man was further arrested on suspicion of assault . Pictures posted on Twitter appear to show hundreds of people gathering at the shopping centre and lying on one another as if dead. They shouted 'I can't breathe' - some of the last words reportedly said by Eric Garner . Police said a group of protesters broke away from a larger group and attempted to force entry to the shopping centre, assaulting security staff and causing damage to property . Pictures posted on Twitter appear to show hundreds of people gathering at the shopping centre and lying on one another as if dead. 'So much respect to the people having manicures in Westfield who stood up and joined in chanting 'I can't breathe',' one user wrote on the social media site. A spokesman for the shopping centre confirmed shops remained open throughout the demonstration. The spokesman added: 'Westfield London worked closely with the MET to manage the protest for Eric Garner which took place on Wednesday evening. 'To ensure the safety of shoppers, retailers and protesters, a designated area was provided outside Shepherd's Bush station however a group of protesters also gathered in the centre. 'The first protest passed peacefully and protesters exited the centre. 'A small group of protesters later attempted to force entry to the centre past Westfield security. Members of this group were detained by MET police officers. 'This is now a police matter. Throughout the protest the centre remained open and trading.' Police lined up outside the White City shopping mall, as the protest spilled out onto the surrounding streets . Many held placards saying 'solidarity with Ferguson' while others held signs which read 'I can't breathe' Westfield said shops at the huge mall were able to stay open and continue trading despite the mass protest . The protests come after a grand jury's decision not to indict police over the death of Eric Garner in the U.S.","Protesters chanted 'I can't breathe' at the 1,883,700 sq ft west London mall .

"Joe Hart believes Manchester City have finally come of age in Europe after their stunning 2-0 win in Rome on Wednesday night. The City goalkeeper was the star of the show as goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta gave Manuel Pellegrini's team the win they needed to take them in to the knockout stages of the Champions League. It is the second successive year Manuel Pellegrini's side have qualified for the last 16 but Hart believes they will take a lot from the manner of this season's qualification, winning their final group games against Bayern Munich and Roma to rescue a campaign that seemed doomed. Manchester City goalkeeper Joe Hart bravely punches a cross clear during his side's 2-0 win against Roma . Hart admits City needed to put in a good display after a poor start to their Champions League campaign . 'Yeah it was about time we did something like this,' said Hart, who produced string of superb saves on Wednesday night. 'We can't get away from the fact we started the campaign poorly but we have come good at the right time when we needed to and we have won the game. 'We need to build on this now. We got ourselves all the way through last time and we struggled against Barcelona so we have to look to go positive and see what we can do.' City's win in the Olympic Stadium is all the more impressive given that it was earned without four of their most important players, Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure, and Vincent Kompany, while David Silva came on in the second half. Hart added: 'Yeah we can't get away from that fact. They are four players who would get into most teams in the world. Midfielder Samir Nasri (right) gives City the lead at the Stadio Olimpico with a powerful effort from 25 yards . Nasri runs off to celebrate his stunning strike as team-mates James Milner (right) and Edin Dzeko pursue him . 'But the boys we have always shown we are a strong squad and that's how you win things and we have won things recently by doing that. We look forward to carrying on. 'I feel good at the moment, I feel like I am doing my bit for the team. 'When the team is working well, I am doing my bit and the boys are doing it at the other end. 'I thought Martin [Demichelis] and Elia [Mangala] were brilliant today as well as Zaba [Pablo Zabaleta] and Gael [Clichy].' City defender Pablo Zabaleta (right) pops up to score his side's second goal of the game against Roma . Substitute David Silva (left) joins Zabaleta as the pair celebrate in front of City's travelling supporters . City now have to wait and see if they can avoid the big Spanish teams in the draw for the last 16, having been knocked out by Barcelona last season. Hart said: 'The draw is going to take care of itself. It is what it is and we are just happy we are in it. 'We are confident we can do well against anyone but it is Leicester now in the Premier League on Saturday and we have to turn our eyes to that. That's our next big game. 'This is where we want to be. As much as an achievement it is, it is where we should be. 'I think we can't get away from the fact we were poor to start with but we have come good at the right time and the boys are playing well.'","Manchester City beat Roma 2-0 to reach to the Champions League last 16 .

"Detectives in the great Wollongong CCTV camera heist have a prime lead in the their investigation - an image of a man caught by the CCTV camera in the act of removing it from a photographic studio this week. Too busy stealing the camera to disguise his face - or to even remove the cigarette in his mouth - the man is dressed in a light-coloured cap and dark hoodie and captured with his arms stretched out to the camera he is stealing. The ultimate caught in the act photograph - which could be termed a 'shelfie' because with the camera's aid he is shelfing himself, or giving himself up - was taken by the camera inside Cole Studios  in West Wollongong, 80km south of Sydney, from where two cameras were stolen. Some mothers do 'ave 'em: CCTV thief, cigarette in mouth, captured in the act of stealing a CCTV camera by the very camera he is pulling off the wall of a photography studio in Wollongong, south of Sydney . It is being widely shared on Facebook along with witty remarks about the thief, who was also filmed wheeling up his bicycle to the camera to commit the burglary. 'Quick, going to steal a camera better slip the hoodie on so no one sees me ....stares right on into the camera for a close up shot ..... Some mothers do have them,' wrote Nicole Abrahams after officers from Wollongong Local Area Command posted the image. 'Please find him, arrest him and take away his ability to reproduce,' posted Rob Fletcher. And from . Leanne Hunter-Knight: 'But first, let me take a selfie!' The ultimate 'shelfie': Social media posters on Facebook have been quick to take the mickey out of the apparently oblivious thief who has 'shelfed' himself (dobbed himself in) with the aid of the camera he is stealing . Wollongong detectives know exactly what time the robbery took place, at 4.36am and five seconds last Sunday, recorded and time stamped on the footage. 'This video MUST be sent to some form of 'world's dumbest criminals' TV show,' wrote Dawso Dawson, whereas Warren Spriggs said 'He should have just worn a name tag. No mistaking that head', . According to Jason Cole, who owns the  photography studio where the robbery took place, the CCTV footage shows the thief may have thought he had got away scot free because CCTV footage just cuts out when he manages to disconnect the camera from the wall. Mr Cole said the cameras were worth  just $90 each, Fairfax reports. Police say the Facebook post is proving popular and anyone with information about the man's identity should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800333000. Not everyone is sure of the man's guilt. Rachel Keen Lidden posted on the Wollongong Police Facebook page,  'he may not have stolen [it]. May have just been tampering with it minutes before someone else stole it. I'm sure there is a lawyer out there somewhere who would argue that lesser charge. Not that I'm saying he is guilty of anything other than stupidity' Jenny Mitchelson wrote, 'Right, Rachel! He could been cleaning a spot or using it to see his reflection!'.","A CCTV camera has captured an image of a man stealing the camera .

"A British-born American photographer kidnapped by Al Qaeda was just seconds from being rescued by US special forces before being shot dead by his captors yesterday. US Navy SEALs, mounting a dramatic rescue bid, crept to within 100 yards of a compound in a remote mountain hideout in Yemen where the hostages were being held. The mission was ordered by Barack Obama after terrorists had on Thursday threatened to kill photographer Luke Somers, 33, within 72 hours. Scroll down for video . Best laid plans: Navy SEALs made it to within 100 yards of Mr Somers and fellow captive Pierre Korkie but they were executed by their captors before the team could reach them . Mr Somers, who spent most of his childhood in London but later became a US citizen, was killed shortly after the dawn raid began in Shabwa province, a stronghold of the terrorist network Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). South African teacher Pierre Korkie, also being held prisoner, was shot dead by the terror group alongside Somers. The Mail on Sunday understands that while British Special Forces provided key information to their US counterparts, no UK troops were directly involved in the mission. Last night Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond paid tribute to Mr Somers, saying: ‘Luke had close links with the UK and his family have spoken about Luke’s life and his work, and that is how he should be remembered. ‘My deepest condolences are with the families of both hostages at this time. We utterly condemn AQAP for the brutal murder of these two men.’ The dramatic raid was launched under cover of darkness following a desperate search for the terrorists’ hideout. Pierre Korkie, a teacher from South Africa also being held captive, was also killed in the raid . A team of up to 20 Navy SEALs then watched the Al Qaeda compound in the village of Wadi Abadan for 24 hours, fine-tuning preparations for the raid. On Friday evening, up to a further 80 Navy SEALs and Yemeni troops were flown from a US ship in the Arabian Gulf and touched down at a secret landing zone near the village. According to US and Yemeni reports, a dramatic firefight took place after a villager spotted their advance and raised the alarm just as the Navy SEALs were poised to snatch the hostages. The heavily armed Navy SEALs sprinted from house to house, surrounding the compound and shooting up to ten suspected terrorists. US commanders appealed for the terrorists to surrender, as an official explained: ‘They called on the kidnappers to give themselves up because they were surrounded on all sides. 'But the kidnappers immediately killed two hostages, which prompted the forces to open fire on the kidnappers. They tried to give first aid to the hostages but they had lost their lives.’ Navy SEALs stormed the compound, killing the guards and recovering the fatally wounded Mr Somers and Mr Korkie. They were carried to a waiting V-22 Osprey US aircraft, which had a surgical team on board. At the end of the raid, US troops on the ground requested an air strike on Wadi Aba-Dan, which according to unconfirmed reports last night caused the deaths of a number of women and children. The hostages and the US and Yemeni Special Forces were later flown back to the USS Makin Island, an amphibious assault ship positioned off Yemen’s southern coast, where Mr Somers and Mr Korkie were pronounced dead. Elite: Navy SEALs carry out training missions in preparation for real-world combat (file image) Mr Somers had moved to Yemen in 2011 to teach English but soon began photographing protests in the capital San’a and his images were published by the New York Times and BBC. He was taken hostage in 2013 and sold to AQAP by local criminals. Last night Mr Somers’s stepmother Penny Bearman, from Deal, Kent, said: ‘Luke was a talented photographer with a sensitivity for people and people’s lives.’ Mr Korkie was kidnapped in the Yemeni city of Taiz in May 2013, along with his wife Yolande. Militants released her in January and South African negotiators claimed last night Mr Korkie would have been released today were it not for the botched raid. l Lorenzo Vinciguerra, 49, a Swiss birdwatcher held hostage by militant Islamists in the Philippines for more than two years, has escaped after knifing one of his captors during fighting with government forces. He was shot and wounded during the escape but escorted to safety by the Philippine army.","Twenty Navy SEALs surrounded compound after SAS helped to locate it .

"A ground-breaking study has revealed that a shocking 664 jihadi attacks were carried out around the world in November alone, resulting in the deaths of more than 5,000 people. The deadly toll of militant-related violence was equivalent to one attack and seven deaths every hour - or three attacks on the scale of the July 21, 2005, bombings in London every day for a month. The figures revealing the extend of jihadist carnage around the world emerged as chilling images of a man being hurled off a building by Islamic State fighters on the Syria-Iraq border simply for being gay were posted online. Sickening: Images of Islamic State fanatics throwing a man off a building for being gay were released as it was revealed that that a shocking 664 jihadi attacks were carried out around the world in November alone . IS, now the most notorious Islamist terror group, has carried out beheadings, crucifixions and massacres while capturing huge swathes of Iraq and Syria as it rules its seized territory with an iron fist. It has handed out barbaric punishments for actions they see as violating their strict interpretation of Islamic law, such as adultery, stealing and blasphemy. In a statement seeking to justify the gruesome slaying of the homosexual man, somewhere on the Syria-Iraq border, it said: ‘The Islamic court in Wilayet al-Furat decided that a man who has practiced sodomy must be thrown off the highest point in the city, and then stoned to death.’ Wilayet al-Furat refers to an area where the Euphrates river flows across the frontier from Syria into Iraq. Notorious: IS, now the most notorious Islamist terror group, has carried out beheadings, crucifixions and massacres while capturing huge swathes of Iraq and Syria as it rules its seized territory with an iron fist . It is the third time in less than a month the jihadist group has hurled someone off a roof and then stoned them to death for alleged homosexuality, says the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The fresh tyranny came as the survey, the first of its kind, was conducted by the BBC World Service and the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR). It found that in a single month, 664 reported jihadist attacks were carried out in 14 countries, resulting in a staggering 5,042 deaths. The worst single day was Sunday, November 2, when 410 people were killed in 41 attacks across the world. The majority of those killed were citizens (2,080), followed closely by a large number of military personnel (1,723), as the jihadists tried to undermine and topple countries. Of the 83 politicians or officials murdered, half were in Afghanistan and Somalia. Some 935 jihadists also died – including radicalised British Muslims fighting for IS – incorporating 38 suicide bombers who were responsible for slaughtering 650 innocent people. Deadly: Boko Haram, which has been terrorising Nigeria and Cameroon – including the kidnapping of more than 250 schoolgirls (pictured) – carried out fewer attacks but these were large and deadly, killing 801 people . Sixteen jihadist groups were responsible for the bloodshed. Islamic State was the deadliest group, launching 308 attacks across Iraq and Syria which left 2,206 people dead – 44 per cent of the total fatalities. Boko Haram, which has been terrorising Nigeria and Cameroon – including the kidnapping of more than 250 schoolgirls – carried out far fewer attacks, just 30, but these were large and deadly, killing 801 people. Some 151 incidents were attributed to the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan in which 720 people died. The four countries worst affected by jihadist strikes – Iraq, Nigeria, Syria and Afghanistan – accounted for 4,031, or 80 per cent, of all deaths. Iraq bore the brunt with 1,770 people – mostly military or civilian – killed, followed by Nigeria (786), Afghanistan (782) and Syria (693). Other nations terribly blighted by jihadist terrorism included Yemen (410), Somalia (212) and Pakistan (212), where Al Qaeda offshoots operate with deadly menace. Bombing accounted for the most deaths – 1,653 people killed in 241 blasts. The deadliest single attack was the assault on the Grand Mosque at Kano, Nigeria, on November 28 in which 120 died. Human cost: The four countries worst affected by jihadist strikes – Iraq, Nigeria, Syria and Afghanistan – accounted for 4,031, or 80 per cent, of all deaths . Gun attacks claimed 1,574 lives, and 666 deaths were described as ambushes, although many of these will have involved shooting. Some 426 people were executed including 50 who were beheaded in Syria, Yemen and Libya. Peter Neumann, director of the ICSR, based at Kings College, London, said: ‘The data highlights the significant human cost of jihadism. It also makes clear that jihadists and al Qaeda are no longer one and the same. ‘Sixty per cent of jihadist deaths were caused by groups that have no formal association with al Qaeda. The overall picture is that of an increasingly ambitious, complex, sophisticated and far-reaching movement. ‘It seems obvious that the jihadist movement - which, only three years ago, everyone expected to be in a state of terminal decline - are stronger than ever, and that countering them will be a generational challenge.’ Tom Keatinge, of the Royal United Service Institute think-tank, said there was ‘only so much’ Britain and the international community, which has carried out airstrikes against IS fighters and sent troops to train local soldiers and militias, could do to stop IS. He said: ‘Ultimately, it will be the local people suffering from water shortages, food rationing, and power cuts that will need to determine to rid themselves of the yoke of IS as their relationship withers.’ Andrew Whitehead, of BBC World Service News, said: ‘Every week, every day, acts of violence by jihadist groups are making news headlines. ‘With this initiative, we are seeking to find out more about the overall impact of those groups pursuing violence in the name of jihad.’ • Full details of the data gathering methodology can be found on the BBC News website.","Study reveals seven deaths every hour are carried out by jihadis .

"When a loved one passes, most keep their memory alive with pictures and by visiting burial sites, but some take it one step further, by turning the remains  of a family member into a diamond. Swiss company Algordanza has been turning human cremation ashes into  'memorial diamonds' for a decade. The unusual keepsakes are made at a temperature between 1,600 and 2,000 degrees, and have a starting price of £2,800. Scroll down for video . Unusual keepsake: A Swiss company turns human cremation ashes into shining diamonds . After cremation, human ashes weigh around 2.5kg and carbon can be extracted from theses remains, which is then heated and turned into graphite. The graphite is then heated and subjected to intense sustained pressure, which creates the diamond. Although this practice takes place in 22 countries, including England, it is still considered a novelty in many places across the world. The company uses around 500 grams of ash to create one diamond, and the remaining ashes are returned to the family in an urn. Clean cut: The diamonds are made at a temperature between 1,600 and 2,000 degrees, starring at £2,800 . One woman, who opted for this form of memorial following the death her father, believes the diamond is an appropriate memento. The woman, who wishes to be unnamed, said: 'The decision for the diamond funeral of my father at first was not easy, but it soon became clear and in fact the only acceptable way to me. 'Death is always a surprise, even if it is known to be inevitable. 'I think that my father would have liked to be left among us as a precious memory, especially as he has returned symbolically, as small jewel.'","Swiss company offers to turn human remains into diamonds .

"A Jewish woman who escaped the gas chambers of Auschwitz is preparing to celebrate her 101st birthday . Klara Markus, 100, from Sighetu Marmaţiei, in Maramureş in northern Romania, survived three Holocaust concentration camps  before  the Second World War was over. Mrs Markus, who had been imprisoned in Dachau and Ravensbruck before being sent to Auschwitz, survived the Nazi German camp in occupied Poland because the Nazis ran out of gas. Inspiration: Holocaust survivor Klara Markus, from northern Romania, who escaped three Nazi concentration camps, is getting ready to celebrate her 101st birthday . Mrs Markus was born Klara Schongut, on New Years Eve 1913, in Carei, Satu Mare County. In August 1942, she was deported to a Jewish ghetto in Budapest, Hungary where she started work in an umbrella factory. 'My mother and older sisters were taken directly to Auschwitz. I never saw them again,' Klara Markus told a Romanian newspaper in 2010. 'When I asked about them, SS members replied shortly: ""Maybe, you should search for them in the smoke or ashes!"" and they laughed.' The mother-of-two remained in Budapest for another two years, before the Nazis ordered the remaining Jews in the city to march toward the concentration camps. Incredible: Mrs Markus was forced on a one-month march to Dachau after the Nazis emptied the Budapest ghetto, after which she  was also imprisoned in Ravensbruck before being sent to Auschwitz . After a month-long march, Mrs Markus arrived at Dachau on October 20, 1944, and one week later she was sent to the notorious women's' camp in Ravensbruck, before being transported to Auschwitz. 'I passed through all the camps on the German territory. The conditions were the same all over the places. 'I was falling asleep with tears in my eyes, missing my mother, my sisters. I got accustomed with the hunger, but not with the pain in my soul. 'Everyday we were humiliated, tortured, I was surrounded by death and lot of dirt, especially the one from our perpetrators' souls,' she said in the 2010 interview. Shortly before the evacuation and subsequent liberation of Auschwitz in January 1945, Mrs Markus, then 30 years old and weighing around 70lbs (32kg), was sent to the gas chambers. She said: 'I was chosen towards the end of the day with a large group of other women and we were made ready for the gas chamber. Mrs Markus, who returned to her home country after she escaped Auschwitz, kisses the Romanian flag . 'But when they put us inside and went to turn the gas on, they found they had run out. 'One of the guards joked that it was our lucky day because they had already killed so many they didn't have any gas left for us.' 'God was watching over me that day.' Mrs Markus says her narrow escape made her realise that she had  nothing to lose and she managed to escape Auschwitz. She returned to Romania to discover that her entire family had died during the war, and proceeded to rebuild her life which is when she met her husband, Dr Andrei Markus. In celebration of her upcoming birthday, government representative Anton Rohian turned up at her home. He said: 'I brought you a bunch of flowers, a bottle of champagne and an excellency diploma to thank you because you've returned to Maramures after all you've been through. 'It's important not to forget what happened in the past.' Kissing the Romanian flag, Mrs Markus said: 'I've had terrible experiences in my life, but this is a wonderful moment.'","Klara Markus, 100, survived three Holocaust concentration camps .

"Buried neck deep in filthy, ash covered debris, Filipino children sift through the charred debris from an enormous fire that razed a shanty town in Malabon City. With just weeks to go to Christmas, hundreds of people lost everything when their homes were destroyed by the wind whipped blaze. Many were made with light materials that were unable to stand the intense heat from the blaze. Arson investigators estimate that it caused at least £20 million worth of damage, with much of the debris washing into rivers and the sea around the slum, according to the Philippine Star newspaper. But astonishingly, fire officials told the paper that only six people were injured by the wind whipped blaze as it raced through the informal settler community which has built up in the city around 10 miles north of the country's capital, Manila. Up to the neck in filth, a young Filipino boy looks for salvageable material among the debris, following a fire that ripped through a shanty town in Malabon City . Much of the debris was washed into the sea and rivers around the settlement. Malabon city has a population of more than 350,000 and is around 10 miles north of the Philippine's capital Manila . Amazingly, only five people were injured by the fire which razed hundreds of homes. Arson investigators think it caused at least £20 million worth of damage . Wading through the rubbish on the hunt for anything salvageable, children look for metal and other valuable goods amid the wreckage. Filipino authorities think up to 1,000 people were affected by the fire . Knee deep in sludge children continue to look for valuable. The cause of the fire is unknown, but local media reported that investigators were checking claims that an illegal electrical connection may have been the cause of the fire . Examining the debris closely, a young girl hunts through the ash charred debris. The blaze came just days after parts of the Philippines were devastated by Typhoon Hagiput . The cause of the blaze is unknown investigators were checking claims that an illegal electrical connection may have been the cause of the fire, Chief Inspector Rodrigo Navalta Reyes, told the Manila Bulletin newspaper. 'A short circuit may have developed at the second floor of a home,' he said, adding that the investigation was ongoing. It is unknown how many people lived in the Shanty town, but when record were last taken in 2010, Malabon City had a population of almost 350,000. With Christmas on the horizon, the affected families have asked the government for help, the paper reported. Just weeks away from Christmas victims have asked the government, in the predominantly Catholic country, for help . Salvaging whatever they can from the fire which swept through their community. It is unknown how many people live in the shanty town . Digging deep for scraps, a young man sifts through the rubbish caused by the blaze. Emergency services in the Philippines are already stretched to breaking point by the damage from Typhoon Hagiput . It has placed added strain on the country's rescue services who were already struggling to cope with the fallout from the destruction wreaked by Typhoon Hagupit which destroyed nearly 16,500 houses and damaged more than 33,100 on the island of Samar. Rescue teams were struggling to reach upland communities on the eastern island which were thought to have been battered by gale force winds and rain from the storm, which struck almost a year after the country was devastated by Typhoon Haiyan. Hagupit has since been downgraded to a tropical storm and on Wednesday was headed for southern Vietnam.

"Deep in a forest crowded by Australian paperback trees, Aboriginal hunters Roy and Marcus Gaykamangu, a father and son team, are doing one of the most dangerous jobs in the world – they're out tracking crocodiles. It’s eerily silent, save for the screeching of tropical birds, when Marcus shouts: ‘Look, crocodiles!’ Nothing can be seen beyond mud and what little water is left in the small billabong. But they take off running past a herd of water buffalo and before you know it Roy has his shotgun pointed at the surface. Australian Aboriginal hunter Roy Gaykamangu of the Yolngu people drags a crocodile he has just shot dead out of a billabong near Yathalamarra . Roy treads carefully as the water rises to his knees, seeming for a moment to lose sight of his prey. Then in one swift action he steps back, takes aim and shatters the outback calm, and a crocodile, with a single booming shotgun blast. It’s just all part of Roy’s daily life along with the other Aboriginal Australians in the northern-most tip of the Northern Territory, Australia's rugged ‘Top End’. This Arnhem Land reserve – closer to Bali than Sydney – covers an area of around 97,000 sq km, has a population of around 16,000 people. Australia's Aborigines are the custodians of the longest unbroken cultural tradition on Earth, having migrated Down Under from Africa via Asia between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago, and connection to the land is practically written into their DNA. Roy Gaykamangu carries the crocodile he has just shot dead along the edge of a billabong . Marcus Gaykamangu lifts a baby crocodile above his head after capturing it at a billabong near Yathalamarra . Roy Gaykamangu stands with his son Marcus who carries a baby crocodile on his shoulders . Marcus Gaykamangu carries an Australian native lizard called a goanna over his shoulder that he has just killed . Hunting crocodiles is also very much part of Roy and Marcus’ DNA. This particular hunt took place on foot from Yathalamarra, located on the outskirts of the community of Ramingining in East Arnhem Land. It's a community consisting of around a dozen houses, and lead to the isolated billabong. Blazing sun and temperatures reaching 40 degrees Celsius couldn’t even deter Roy, and at his feet is the dead crocodile. Roy had pulled the beast from the water, while Marcus kept lookout. But not far from the shoreline the water starts moving. Suddenly Marcus pounces and, from just beneath the surface, he pulls another crocodile, this one a bleating baby. Australian Aboriginal hunter Roy Gaykamangu sits by a billabong and cuts up a crocodile he just shot dead . The dead crocodile is cut in half by Roy Gaykamangu to make it easier to carry . Roy’s nervous now about crossing the billabong carrying a heavy dead crocodile, but he wanders downstream and grabs a boat hidden in the bushes. Using a stick as a paddle he navigates the boat, throwing the two crocs onto the muddy shore. ‘It's easier to carry them without all that skin,’ says Roy. Any butcher would have been extremely impressed with the skill he showed at filleting this massive beast. The baby was carried out alive. Before leaving, Roy wraps the intestines in leaves, as nothing that can be eaten is wasted, and he and his sons walk the few kilometres back to the car with crocodile meat and a goanna lizard slung over their shoulders. Creeping slowly across a billabong, Roy Gaykamangu hunts a crocodile near Yathalamarra . Using a stick, Roy Gaykamangu tries to coax a crocodile out into the open so he can get a clear shot at him .","Hunters Roy and Marcus Gaykamangu are a father and son team who specialise in killing crocs .

"No Hollywood wedding would be complete without an extreme pre-nup in case of an unhappy ending. But while most pre-wedding contracts are drawn up to protect spouses in cases of wandering hands or financial misdemeanours, controlling Kanye West is said to have demanded a clause banning his wife-to-be from having any more surgery. According to reports in this week's Heat magazine the musician, whose mother died on the operating table, hit the roof when he saw messages between Kim and her surgeons discussing her next bout of body maintenance. And so the 36-yr-old demanded Kim refrain from 'lipo, botox, another nose job.' This will be a bitter pill to swallow for the 33-year-old reality star who has seemingly spent years perfecting her face. Fortunately one of the ways that Kim maintains her youthful looks doesn't have anything to do with a doctor's scalpel. Kim Kardashian's face has changed dramatically . since she first hit the headlines in 2006 (left) but now her future . husband Kanye West has banned her from anymore surgery . Since she first hit the headlines in 2006 Kim's face has changed dramatically and her rising hairline has been the source of constant speculation. While some have hinted at a full hairline lift, a painful and expensive procedure that can leave scarring, most experts agree that Kim has used laser surgery on her forehead to remove hair and give her a new hairline. Surgeon Asim Shahmalak, hair loss expert on Channel 4 medical show Embarrassing Bodies, said that Kim Kardashian has almost certainly had the 'baby hair' from the front of her hairline removed. He said this can be done temporarily by waxing or more permanently through laser removal. Dr Shahmalak, from the Crown Clinic hair transplant centre in Manchester, agreed: 'It is very likely that Kim Kardashian has had the baby hairs around hairline removed. Kim, pictured here in 2007 and 2008, has transformed her hairline over the years and experts claim that she has undergone laser hair removal . 'This can be done by waxing - a similar procedure to how women remove hair from their legs or bikini line. 'But it is more likely that Kim has opted for laser surgery, a more permanent form of removal.' Dr Shahmalak, Britain's leading hair transplant surgeon specialises in female hair treatments and is the first surgeon in the UK to perform an EYELASH transplant. He added that around 10% of women have facial hair removal - most commonly on the upper lip and chin. But hair removal around the hairline as may have happened to Kim is much rarer. He said the procedure was still fairly uncommon but publicity around celebrities was sure to increase demand because many women would have been previously unaware that there was a solution to the problem. He explained: 'This kind of procedure around the hairline is much less common. Obviously some women - particularly celebrities - are very sensitive about their appearances and may feel hair growth in this area is a little unfeminine.' The baby hair can be removed permanently in around four to six laser surgery sessions lasting around 30 minutes to an hour each time. Prices start at around £50 a session in the UK, though treatments at top clinics in Los Angeles are considerably more expensive. Dr Shahmalak said: 'It is relatively straight-forward procedure that can be done in the lunch-hour with very quick recovery time. 'Laser treatment will remove hair permanently in four to six sessions - the key is to catch the hair follicle throughout all of its growth cycles. On Monday Kim Kardashian was in New York with her sister Kendall Jenner . 'It is fairly painless, as pulses of light from the laser of a pre-determined wavelength pass down the hair follicle and kill it at the root, preventing re-growth, without any sort of damage to the rest of the body. It is a proven, extremely popular treatment, that can remove unwanted hair permanently from anywhere on the body. 'The procedure is carried out by a fully qualified esthetician. The laser works specifically to attack hair by travelling through the pigment in the hair, down to the root, where the energy is absorbed by the bulb. During this process the follicle gets killed and stops producing hair. 'Due to the way the body works and produces hair, you will typically need more than one session per course of treatments as the hair grows in cycles, so you cannot 'catch' and disable all follicle in one treatment. You will find that following each session, you will be able to go about your daily business as per usual, without any negative laser hair removal side effects. 'The discomfort during a laser hair removal treatment is minimal. Laser hair removal patients can opt to use soothing cream to minimize discomfort in the most sensitive areas. Most patients say it is far less painful than waxing.' The 'no-surgery' pre-nup clause will see Kim suffer a financial penalty of around $500,000 if the couple divorce. As well as banning Kim from having surgery musician Kanye is also insisting that the mother of his child stop her mother Kris Jenner from interfering with their private and professional lives. Kim and Kanye recently welcomed baby Nori to their family . 2006: At New York Fashion Week (left) and 2007: During an MTV appearance (right) 2010: On a trip to London (left) and 2011: During a fragrance launch (right) 2008: A new fringe at a Los Angeles premiere (left) and 2009: At a Super Bowl party in Florida (right) 2012: At a pre-GRAMMY party (left) and 2013: At the Givenchy show in Paris (right) Sustained Botox use gives the appearance of an elongated forehead . Anne-Marie Gillett, Non-Surgical Director at Transform Cosmetic Surgery* believes that Kim's love of Botox may also have had an effect on her hairline. She says: 'Looking at the images of Kim Kardashian, it appears to me that her shiny, line-free, elongated forehead is showing classic telltale signs of recent and long term Botox use. 'Kim is in danger of looking over done, with her skin beginning to look too taut and shiny. Regular use of Botox, with what appears to also be work on the eyebrows, and the tidying up of her hair, gives the appearance of a higher hairline. 'Many celebrities are keen Botox users and many also have this shiny, elongated look. A good example is Nicole Kidman. 'It’s unusual for either men or women to request to have their hairline higher, in fact, it’s quite the opposite – many people look to reduce the appearance of a large forehead or hair recession. 'Kim undoubtedly looks great and is loved by many women wanting to look good and stop the signs of ageing. A combination of Botox, dermal fillers in the cheek area, regular non-surgical treatments and fantastic contouring by her make-up artist has resulted in this smooth appearance. 'We would always recommend that less is more. Once you’ve reached the stage where you’ve achieved the appearance you want, you should leave more time between treatments, and also minimise the amount of product you are having injected. You should always seek the advice of a qualified aesthetician or doctor, so that you can achieve a natural look without looking overdone and unnatural.' *Transform is the UK's largest cosmetic surgery provider .","Kim's face has changed dramatically since she hit the headlines in 2006 .

"The curtain came down on another thrilling Champions League group stage this week. We must now wait until February before Europe’s premier competition resumes with the two-legged knockout rounds. But, for now, Sportsmail takes a look back over the group matches and assesses the winners and losers… . So who were the Invincibles? Well, only one team waltzed through the group stage victorious in all six matches, and that was holders Real Madrid. They were irresistible as they stormed through Group B with 16 goals scored and just two conceded. Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema were the stars with five goals apiece. Real Madrid went through the group stage with six wins and Cristiano Ronaldo proved their key man again . Anyone else? Just two other teams remain undefeated in this year’s competition – Chelsea and Porto, the current and former homes of Jose Mourinho. They progressed with near-identical records having won four and drawn two en route to the last 16. Lionel Messi broke a couple of records, didn’t he? Not quite yet… He did break Raul’s record of 71 Champions League goals – winning the race ahead of Ronaldo – but the Barcelona star has only drawn level with the former Real Madrid captain when it comes to goals in all European competitions. The pair have 76. Ronaldo, meanwhile, has 75, meaning he could still beat Messi to that title. Just two other teams remain undefeated in this year’s competition, including Jose Mourinho's Chelsea . Porto went unbeaten and progressed with a near-identical record to Chelsea, winning four and drawing two . So Messi must have been top scorer in the group stages? With eight goals you would think so. But Brazilian striker Luiz Adriano, of Shakhtar Donetsk, managed to smash an incredible nine goals as the Ukrainians made it through to the second phase. Adriano, though, was something of a flat-track bully – he scored five of his goals in a 7-0 win at Belarussian side BATE Borisov before adding a hat-trick in the return fixture. So Adriano was the top scorer, which team netted the most? With 17, that honour goes to Chelsea. The 6-0 home drubbing of Slovenian side Maribor helped in that respect, as did the four penalties they scored, which was more than any other team. And the tightest defence? Monaco somehow conceded just once as they topped Group C. Still, though, they did not qualify until the final game when they defeated Zenit 2-0. In fact, Group C was a bit of a turn-off. From 12 matches, just 17 goals were scored. Brazilian striker Luiz Adriano, of Shakhtar Donetsk, managed to smash an incredible nine goals . Chelsea scored the most goals during the group stage with 17, largely thanks to a 6-0 win over Maribor . Andre Schurrle of Chelsea celebrates scoring his goal with Cesar Azpilicueta on Wednesday night . Monaco somehow conceded just once as they topped Group C as goalkeeper Danijel Subasic looks dominant . And the leakiest backline? It’s no surprise to see BATE Borisov – shipping an average of four goals per game – emerge as the worst defence. In response, they scored just twice, and that double was enough to earn them a shock 2-1 win over Athletic Bilbao. Did anyone scrape through? Basle lost three matches but still managed to progress, at the expense of Liverpool. Their 1-1 draw at Anfield on Tuesday night took their points tally to a meagre seven, but that was still enough to win a place in the knockout rounds with two points to spare over the third-placed Reds. And who were the unlucky losers? Olympiacos boasted a 100 per cent record in Athens, but three defeats on the road meant their nine-point tally was not enough and they must now settle for the Europa League. Basle lost three matches but still managed to progress, at the expense of Steven Gerrard's Liverpool . Paulo Sousa (pictured, hugging Gerrard) earned a 1-1 draw at Anfield to progress to the knockout stages . The big guns are all through, how does it compare to this time last year? Zenit, Olympiacos, Milan and Galatasaray are the four teams missing who made it through to the second round 12 months ago. In their place are Shakhtar, Porto, Monaco and Juventus. Who were the stars of the group stage? It is hard to look past eight-goal Lionel Messi… again. He was outstanding for Barcelona and, in the year when Ronaldo is expected to enjoy a clean sweep of the individual honours, the Argentine served a reminder of his mesmerising ability on the biggest stage. Chelsea’s Eden Hazard has produced his best on the European stage so far this season with two goals and two assists, while Manchester United's forgotten man Nani – on loan at Sporting – also starred in the Blues' group, but his two goals and four assists could only earn them a Europa League place. Meanwhile, a pair of players to catch the eye for Porto – unbeaten to top Group H – were Algerian attacking midfielder Yacine Brahimi – who scored four and laid on two – and defensive midfielder Casemiro, the Real Madrid loanee who anchored their engine-room so impressively. It's hard to look past Lionel Messi with eight goals in the group stage for who was the main star . Chelsea’s Eden Hazard (right, with John Terry) has produced his best on the European stage so far . Manchester United forgotten man Nani, who is on loan at Sporting, also starred and looked impressive . Any young players catch the eye? Max Meyer of Schalke strengthened his reputation and it was his goal which sent the Germans into the second round. Roberto Di Matteo’s side needed victory in Maribor and the 19-year-old Germany midfielder came good half an hour from time to ensure it was they and not Sporting who progressed. Koke, the Atletico Madrid playmaker, was arguably the best young player of the group phase. He scored twice and assisted four goals to further inflate a price tag which is said to top £30million. Isco, of Real Madrid, and Lucas Moura of PSG are already players with big reputations, and they justified such hype as their respective sides enjoyed safe passage. And Mario Gotze – the man who scored the winning goal for Germany in the World Cup final – continued his fine year with three goals for Bayern Munich.

"A 2,400-year-old coffin bearing unusual and amateurish decorations, may reveal the decline of Ancient Egypt, one expert claims. It has strange features such as ‘goofy’ jars and an unusual funeral bed painted on it. The egyptologist believe the marks were made by junior artists, after the best Egyptian painters were deported when the Persians controlled the region. A historic mess? A 2,400-year-old coffin bearing unusual and amateurish decorations, may reveal the decline of Ancient Egypt, one expert claims. It has strange features such as ‘goofy’ jars and unusual funeral bed with a bird's head (pictured) painted on it among other mistakes . From 525 BC for around a century, the Persians ruled Egypt after king Cambyses marched into the Egyptian capital, Memphis, toppling the pharaoh. The occupation meant that the Persian Empire stretched from what is now Turkey to Afghanistan. The coffin could shed light on a tumultuous time in Egyptian history, in which ancient texts by Diodorus Siculus suggest the occupying Empire deported Egypt’s best craftsmen and artists to work on its own grand projects in Persia – as well as taking precious metals too. This drain of talent may explain the badly-painted coffin, according to Egyptologist Gayle Gibson, of Toronto's Royal Ontario Museum. ‘Many of the best artists in Egypt were taken by the Persians back to Persepolis and Susa as prisoners of war and war booty — you can see their work in those places,’ she told Live Science. From 525 BC for around a century, the Persians ruled Egypt after king Cambyses marched into the Egyptian capital, Memphis, defeating pharaoh Psamtik II (illustrated in this 19th century painting) The occupation of Egypt, which began in 525 BC, meant that the Persian Empire stretched from what is now Turkey to Afghanistan (pictured) Cambyses II expanded the Persian Empire by defeating the Egyptian pharaoh Psamtik II during the battle of Pelusium in 525 BC. The Egyptian army was defeated and shortly afterwards, Memphis was taken. The captive pharaoh was executed, having attempted a rebellion and Egyptian inscriptions show that Cambyses officially adopted the titles and costumes of the pharaohs. During his reign, Egyptian master craftsmen were deported so they could build elaborate palaces and other buildings in Persia. Consequently, the quality of art suffered in Egypt, as evidenced by the coffin. Cambyses went on to invade the Kingdom of Kush (which is now the Republic of Sudan) but with little success. He died in disputed circumstances, either by his own hand, an accident or even assassination. The location of his tomb is even uncertain. ‘There seems to have been a dearth of masters for some time, so that fewer and fewer artists got proper training.’ A lack of training might explain the strange features on the coffin, such as the funeral bed having the head of a human-headed bird named Ba. Ba is almost always depicted as a human-headed falcon and is often seen hovering over the deceased's mummy or freely entering and leaving a tomb, signifying an individual's soul, or spirit. She told the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities Scholars' Colloquium last month that this is the only coffin she has come across with a bed featuring Ba’s head. She also said that a winged snake wearing a crown that is associated with the goddess Hathor - of joy and motherhood - is ‘very odd,’ while four jars in the scene have a ‘goofy’ appearance. Dr Gibson explained that the artist’s lack of skill is particularly apparent when considering two creatures that look a little bit like fish, which are meant to be falcons – a symbol of the god Horus. According to inscriptions on the coffin, it belonged to a woman named Denit-ast, or Dent-ast, who radiocarbon dating suggests lived while Egypt was under Persian control. Persian king, Darius I,who was born in 550 BC, reportedly bragged that skilled Egyptian artists, carpenters and goldsmiths decorated his palace at Susa. Experts have questioned whether the coffin is real, because of its unusual markings. But radiocarbon dating has confirmed its authenticity and its material – sycamore wood – was used during this time for crafting coffins. The distinctive ‘Egyptian blue’ pigment also points to the artefact not being fake. Dr Gibson said: ‘I think there is really no doubt that this one is genuine. The coffin could shed light on a tumultuous time in Egyptian history, in which ancient texts suggest the occupying Empire deported Egypt’s best craftsmen and artists, to work on its own grand projects in Persia, instead of grand projects in the country's capital, Memphis. The head of a sphinx in Memphis is shown .","An egyptologist from Toronto's Royal Ontario Museum believes the strange coffin markings were made by junior artists shortly after 525 BC .
This is because master craftsmen were deported by the Persians who conquered Egypt, using them to build magnificent buildings at home .

"Everton have a great reputation for bringing through talented youngsters and will once again give youth a chance in Thursday night's Europa League encounter against Krasnodar. Having safely progressed to the knock-out stages as Group H winners already, Blues boss Roberto Martinez is using the clash as a chance to experiment with his squad. With talent such as boyhood Evertonians Wayne Rooney and Ross Barkley coming through the Goodison Park ranks over the last decade, Martinez is excited to show off the lastest 'diamonds' unearthed by the club.

The Spaniard hasn't been afraid to call on players from the Everton academy during his 18 months on Merseyside and the game with Krasnodar, who have already been eliminated, is the perfect opportunity to give some of the club's youngsters a taste of competitive football on the European stage. After breezing through what was a tough group on paper - Everton did the double over Bundesliga high-flyers Wolfsburg and scored three without reply against Ligue 1 side Lille - Martinez is keen to enjoy the final fixture before the competition gets serious once more.

Speaking on Wednesday, the Everton boss said of Thursday's dead-rubber match: 'I think it should be a celebration. We have one game to go, we have had an exciting time in Europe and it is ideal for us to experiment. 'We are going to have a couple of our youngsters which is really, really exciting. We want to show a few diamonds of our development system. It is a really exciting game for us.' One of the jewels in  Everton's crown is 17-year-old Ryan Ledson of whom big things are expected. The midfielder - who captained the England Under 17s to glory in the European Championships in May - made  the bench against Southampton last season and, just like with Rooney and Barkley before him, mentions of his name have been heard around Goodison Park long before his first-team debut. Tidy in possession, Ledson could be given the nod by Martinez to make his first competitive start for the club. Big things are expected of 17-year-old midfielder Ryan Ledson who may feature in Thursday's encounter . Boyhood Blues Ross Barkley and Wayne Rooney both came through the youth ranks at Everton . Kick-off: Thursday, December 11, 8.05pm . TV: ITV 4 . Whilst the Blues manager was coy about which youngsters would start he did reveal promising right back Tyias Browning and 21-year-old left back Luke Garbutt would feature. Boasting arguably the Premier League's best and most attacking full back duo in Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman the Blues have two deputies in Browning and Garbutt who are more than capable of filling in when called upon. Both have already impressed during brief cameos this term and it's fair to say both have been thrown in the deep end by Martinez who is clearly confident in their ability. Browning's two appearances this season have come at Anfield and Old Trafford while Garbutt gave a composed and assured performance in a backline which kept a clean sheet against Wolfsburg as Everton claimed a 2-0 victory in Germany last month. Relishing the chance to play under the floodlights at Goodison, both will be desperate to catch the eye and stake a further claim for more first-term action.

Martinez also revealed defender Antolin Alcaraz will play a part, as will 22-year-old forward Conor McAleny who has patiently waited for his second chance in the first-team after coming on as a substitute against Arsenal at the Emirates back in December 2011. Jonjoe Kenny, a 17-year-old defender born a short walk away from Goodison Park, and 19-year-old forward Chris Long have also been mooted for a possible cameo. It's not just the Everton youngsters who will be looking to impress during Thursday night's 'experiment'. Steven Pienaar, Christian Atsu, goalkeeper Joel Robles, Bryan Oviedo and Arouna Kone were also mentioned alongside Browning and Garbutt as the seven who would feature for the Blues against Krasnodar. Striker Kone - hoping to banish his injury hell after being sidelined with knee problems for the past 15 months - is desperate to impress the Toffees faithful after managing just five Premier League appearances without a goal to his name following his £6million move from Wigan in the summer of 2013. ‘If I did manage to score it would be fantastic,’ said the forward on Wednesday. ‘It would represent the beginning of a big comeback. I’ve got such a huge passion to get my first goal for Everton. It would be marvellous.’ Meanwhile, midfielder Gareth Barry trained on Wednesday afternoon at the club's Finch Farm training complex and could be used by Martinez as a wise head in the middle of the park who can pass on his experience and know-how as the match progresses.

(4-2-3-1): Robles; Hibbert, Alcaraz, Browning, Garbutt; Osman, Ledson; Pienaar, Barkley, Oviedo; Kone. Another name who will have certainly had an affect on Everton's younger players - both on and off the pitch - is striker Samuel Eto'o. One of the best strikers in world football during the mid-noughties, members of the Blues academy must pinch themselves every time they share a training pitch with a player they undoubtedly grew up watching and admiring. Having won the Champions League with Barcelona and Inter Milan, Eto'o still shows glimpses of his world-class ability and the former Cameroon international's winning mentality certainly boosts the Everton squad in this competition. Having a player of Samuel Eto's calibre at the club will have a hugely positive affect on the Toffees' youngsters . Eto'o celebrates winning the Champions League with Inter Milan in 2010 (left) and celebrates scoring for Barcelona against Arsenal in the 2006 final of the same competition . Everton manager Martinez will be hoping his young diamonds can sparkle on the road to Warsaw . After storming to the top of their group to secure qualification with a game to spare, the Toffees will be keen to go unbeaten and complete the round in style. With a chance to shine on the main stage, Everton's talented crop of youngsters can learn so much in a competitive game without the added pressure of needing a result. It is the perfect chance for the Toffees manager to see what his players are made of in a game they can enjoy. Martinez will be hoping Everton's mix of youth and experience can see his side sparkle on the road to Warsaw.","Everton take on Krasnodar in the Europa League on Thursday evening .

Shirtfront has been named the 2014 Word Of The Year after Tony Abbott's threat to Vladimir Putin . Australian National Dictionary Centre president Amanda Laugesen said the word was selected after it became prominent following Mr Abbott's statement – largely because there was confusion over what he meant . The comment made global headlines and was described as 'unfortunate' by the Kremlin. Australian National Dictionary Centre president Amanda Laugesen said the word was selected after it became prominent following Mr Abbott's threat – largely because there was confusion over what he actually meant. Shirt-front is mostly used in AFL to describe an aggressive front-on bump to an opponent and in rugby it refers to grabbing an opponent's jersey. But Dr Laugesen said it has a lesser-known figurative meaning - to challenge or confront a person – which dates back to the 1980s. Prime Minister Abbott made the somewhat undiplomatic threat to the Russian president over the Australian victims of MH17 ahead of the G20 summit in Brisbane . 'We don't know for sure what Abbott meant when he said it because he never really returned to it,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But he certainly could have been aware of that more figurative use.' Foreign Minister Julie Bishop reports the term has now entered the diplomatic lexicon of many countries. British Prime Minister David Cameron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi both used the word in jest when addressing federal parliament. Also on the centre's short list were man-bun (as worn by Chris Hemsworth, left), Ned Kelly beard (right) Shirt-front was triumphant over another prime ministerial catchphrase - 'Team Australia'. Also on the centre's short list were man-bun, Ned Kelly beard and coward punch. 'Man-bun and Ned Kelly beard are both associated with hipsters,' Dr Laugesen said. 'We often pick up on popular culture type words, so those are the two we saw really take off this year both in people adopting them and their use mainstream media.'","The Australian National Dictionary Centre has named 'shirtfront' as its word of the year .

"A Missouri inmate was put to death early Wednesday for fatally beating a 63-year-old woman with a hammer in 1998, the state's record 10th lethal injection of 2014 to match Texas for the most executions in the country this year. Paul Goodwin, 48, sexually assaulted Joan Crotts in St. Louis County, pushed her down a flight of stairs and beat her in the head with a hammer. Goodwin was a former neighbor who felt Crotts played a role in getting him kicked out of a boarding house. Goodwin's execution began at 1:17 a.m., more than an hour after it was scheduled, and he was pronounced dead at 1:25 a.m. Executed: Paul Goodwin, 48 (pictured left in 2001 and right this year), was put to death at 1.17 this morning . Victim: He attacked his former neighbor Joan Crotts for getting him kicked out of a boarding house . Efforts to spare Goodwin's life centered on his low IQ and claims that executing him would violate a U.S. Supreme Court ruling prohibiting the death penalty for the mentally disabled. Attorney Jennifer Herndon said Goodwin had an IQ of 73, and some tests suggested it was even lower. Goodwin's sister, Mary Mifflin, wrote in a statement that the death penalty 'is not a just punishment for his crime - an act that occurred out of passion, not premeditation, by a man with the mental capabilities of a child, not an adult.' But Goodwin's fate was sealed when Gov. Jay Nixon denied a clemency request and the U.S. Supreme Court turned down two appeals - one on the mental competency question and one concerning Missouri's use of an execution drug purchased from an unidentified compounding pharmacy. Missouri's 10th execution of 2014 matches the state's previous high of nine in 1999. Neither Missouri nor Texas has another execution scheduled this year. Texas, Missouri and Florida have combined for 28 of the 34 executions in the U.S. this year. Goodwin received special education as a child but still failed several grades, Mifflin wrote. He relied on relatives or his girlfriend to help with such tasks as buying groceries or paying bills, she said. When the girlfriend died, Goodwin wasn't mentally capable of handling the grief and turned to alcohol, which was a factor in his attack on Crotts, Mifflin wrote. Crotts' daughter, Debbie Decker, told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Goodwin deserved no mercy. 'I've been sitting back waiting for this to happen,' Decker said of the execution. 'I'm hoping all these bad memories will go away.' In the mid-1990s, Goodwin lived in a St. Louis County boarding house that was next door to Crotts' home. The two had been involved in several verbal confrontations. Goodwin was evicted in 1996 after he and friends harassed Crotts, including throwing beer cans into her yard. Court records show that Goodwin blamed Crotts for his eviction, telling her, 'I'm going to get you for this,' according to court testimony. Scene: He broke into her home in St Louis, pictured, and hid in the basement until the following morning, when he attacked her. He left a note behind reading 'You are next' - which Crotts' daughter believes was for her . Death chamber: He was the 10th person to be put to death in Missouri this year - a record for the state . On March 1, 1998, Goodwin entered Crotts home and confronted her. After a sexual assault, he pushed her down the basement stairs before striking her head several times with a hammer. Decker had discovered her mother, who was covered in blood but still alive. She had a broken hip, eight fractured ribs and massive head trauma and passed away while undergoing brain surgery that night. Police found a handwritten note that read, 'You are next' on the kitchen table. Fingerprints from the note and a Pepsi can matched Goodwin's. His hearing aid was also found inside Crotts' home. He admitted the crime after his arrest. Decker had said that she has lived in fear ever since the murder and needed to know he can no longer get her. 'I've had a fear since he's been locked up, as big as he is he could break out if he wanted to,' she said. 'There's always a way to break out of prison. I never trusted the fact that he couldn't. I need to make sure in my own mind that that man is dead.' Missouri has scheduled one execution each month since November 2013. Two were halted by court action, but 12 were carried out over the past 14 months.","Paul Goodwin, 48, sexually assaulted Joan Crotts in St. Louis County .

"Swansea have lined up a £1.75million deal to sign Exeter’s midfield starlet Matt Grimes in the January transfer window. The move will catapult the 19-year-old midfielder from his current £500 a week pay packet to earn £10,000 a week with the Premier League club - which would work out as a 1,900 per cent increase in his wages. Grimes, who has played three times for England’s Under 20 team, has also been watched by Liverpool and Sunderland. Swansea are set to sign Exeter midfielder Matt Grimes (right) for £1.75million in January . But Swans boss Garry Monk has beaten them to the punch to sign a player he believes has the passing skills to challenge for a place in his team. And he has convinced the talented youngster his career will be in safe hands at the Liberty Stadium because his own experience of playing in all four divisions means he’s not afraid to dip into the lower league’s to give talent a chance. Exeter boss Paul Tisdale agreed the fee was too big for the League Two club to turn down, but wanted to do a deal to loan his star player back for the remainder of this campaign. The 19-year-old (right) is set earn a 1,900 per cent increase in his wages at Swansea from £500 to £10,000 . But Swansea refused to agree because they want the player to go straight into their first team squad to start learning their style, and believe he could figure in the Premier League before the end of the season. Grimes, born in Exeter and a product of the League Two club’s youth system, has been earning rave reviews since breaking into Paul Tisdale’s first team at the start of last season. He won the club’s Player of the Year trophy for his performances in central midfield – although he can also operate on the left.","Matt Grimes has also been watched by Liverpool and Sunderland .

"Manchester United have suffered an incredible 48 injuries since Louis van Gaal held his first press conference at Old Trafford on July 16. Van Gaal’s squad has been seriously depleted all season and he remains without eight players following Marcos Rojo's injury in training on Saturday. The Dutchman has declined to reveal details of Rojo's latest setback. Those currently suffering at United are Chris Smalling with a groin tear, Angel di Maria with a hamstring problem, Daley Blind with knee ligament damage, as well as Tom Thorpe, Luke Shaw, Rafael and Jesse Lingard. THE LIST Scroll down to see Manchester United's unfortunate injuries this year in full . The football Gods have been conspiring against Louis van Gaal with 48 injuries inflicted on his squad so far . Angel di Maria is among those on the current crocked list at United after an injury-blighted season so far . Chris Smalling (left) goes off against Southampton with an injury, and Di Maria (right) limps off against Hull . Marcos Rojo is carried off on a stretcher after dislocating his shoulder at the Etihad against Manchester City . Former Wales assistant boss Raymond Verheijen accused his fellow Dutchman of working players too hard, insisting the 63-year-old manager risks injuries by holding 'frequent double sessions'. 'What LVG proves is that top coaches are not perfect,' Verheijen said. 'Even the world's best have deficiencies. 'LVG is tactically superior to most other coaches but planning and periodisation is not his strongest point: double sessions & muscle injuries.' Club insiders told Sportsmail in September that Van Gaal was working his players harder than ever as he was given the unenviable task of rebuilding the Old Trafford club after David Moyes' tenure. Van Gaal oversees a training session at Carrington after taking over United following David Moyes' tenure . Van Gaal's training sessions have been criticised by former Wales assistant manager Raymond Verheijen . Robin van Persie trains while fellow Dutchman Van Gaal oversees the session at Carrington in December . The injuries appear to be affecting the squad in other ways, too, as defender Jonny Evans admits. 'The way the injury situation has been you're always expecting someone to get injured,' said the 26-year-old. 'So I have to prepare myself mentally for that.' Mike Phelan, the former United assistant manager, reiterated Verheijen's comments on Tuesday, suggesting Van Gaal's fitness regime was 'too intense' and that his training methods are to blame for the growing list of casualties. ‘What’s happened is a continuation of the same players getting injured all the time, so you have to look to the reasons why,’ said Phelan, now a first-team coach at Norwich City.

They looked at it a little bit differently.’ He was reacting after Smalling limped out of last Monday's win at Southampton with a groin strain, which will force the England defender out for two weeks. Phelan, who spent 12 years working alongside Sir Alex Ferguson, feels Van Gaal's decision to bring in his own fitness specialist in Jos van Dijk and give regular coach Tony Strudwick a broader role has led to players ‘breaking down’. ‘Tony Strudwick, who was operating as head of sports science and was involved day to day with the first-team,’ continued Phelan. ‘He understood the ins and outs of how to keep players fit, how to keep them ready for competition. 'Then suddenly they moved him sideways and did something completely different. That may have had an effect. That one area has changed.' Mike Phelan, the former United assistant manager, looks over training with ex-boss Sir Alex Ferguson (right) Van Gaal held his first press conference one week after Holland were knocked out of the 2014 World Cup by Argentina. The manager landed to news that Michael Carrick was his first unlucky casualty, having suffered ankle ligament damage during training which required surgery and ruled him out until November. From that injury being revealed on July 17, it has spiralled - from Lingard's knee injury during a Barclays Premier League match to Jones' shin splints in October. Of the 48 injuries, 15 were inflicted during United training, such as Radamel Falcao's calf in October or Ashley Young's groin a month before. Of the rest, 18 were in Premier League matches and seven were while on international duty. Record-signing Di Maria, who missed United's last two matches against Stoke and Southampton, may return against Liverpool on Saturday.","Manchester United currently have eight players out through  injuries .

"Gough Whitlam once famously said of John Faulkner that he was 'the best Prime Minister Australia never had' but after 25 years serving Labor in the Upper House the senator will officially retire next month. He has also made clear his intention to never reveal, in a conversation or a book, the intimate details of his meetings with Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd during the 2010 leadership battle that ultimately crippled the Labor government. 'It's true that I joined them then and I spoke to them both individually and of course when we met together one of the things that occurred is I gave a commitment to them I would not breach the confidence of that meeting,' Senator Faulkner said. Scroll down for video . Senator John Faulkner has announced his intention to leave politics next month after 25 years in the Upper House . The Senator said his discussions with Julia Gillard and Kevin Rudd during their bitter 2010 leadership battle will remain secret . Senator Faulkner said he will remain loyal to both Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard insisting 'I gave a commitment to them I would not breach the confidence of that meeting' Former Labor PM, the late Gough Whitlam, once famously told ALP colleagues that Senator John Faulkner was 'the best Prime Minister Australia never had' 'I hope over my very long parliamentary career that I at least have the reputation of not breaching confidences and I don't intend to start now when announcing my retirement, I gave my word and intend to keep it.' With this decision goes the last minister to have served in the Hawke and Keating Labor governments. Senator Faulkner, a former Defence Minister, will bow out after Australia Day. 'I have been extremely lucky to have such a long and fulfilling career in parliament. It's over and it's time to go,' he stated. 'I owe the Labor Party everything but it's a good time for the Labor Party for a new generation to step up.' The outgoing Senator insisted he will remain an active member at branch meetings and supporting candidates in 'local, state and federal elections'. His position is expected to be filled by Jenny McAllister, who was pre-selected in July to run in his place on the NSW Labor Senate ticket for the 2016 election. Senator Faulkner vowed not to write an autobiography in his retirement as 'there are enough of those sort of books out there'. 'I remain an absolute Labor loyalist. 'I don't have any plans at the moment, I don't have any job offers, I won't be a lobbyist, I won't be a consultant, I won't be a regular media commentator.' The outgoing Senator recalled how he first began working as a fully fledged Labor official in 1980 and was first elected for New South Wales in 1989. He was a minister in three Labor governments and Senate opposition leader for eight years. Senator Faulkner vowed not to write an autobiography in his retirement as 'there are enough of those sort of books out there'. The 60-year-old started out as a teacher and party official before entering politics. His likely replacement, Ms McAllister, has been ALP national president since 2011. She has worked for infrastructure advisory firm AECOM and has previously worked as a public servant and adviser to Labor politicians. And for a politician who won respect from both sides, he remained loyal to the end insisting that he would not reveal the details of the discussions he had during the bitter leadership battles, which beset the Labor Party when it was last in government. However, Senator Faulkner said the ALP should be confident of its chances going forward. 'It has effectively rebuilt its fortune since the last election, it's working hard'. He recalled with fondness his involvement in major national issues including Mabo, Telstra's privatisation, the GST and public service reform. 'Public service may be a favourite whipping boy for some, but in my experience, the men and women of the public service, from top to bottom are committed to the public and the national interest in everything they do,' he added.","Senator John Faulkner will retire after Australia Day 2015 .

In one of the photographs he has also attached roots to back of his hand, making it look like the rose is growing through his palm. 'This determination was an important step in my life, seeing myself forced to leave many things behind to start a new life in an unknown place with new people and a completely different language,' Mr Cata told the Huffington Post. 'I felt like my feet slowly lifted off the ground, leaving their estate to begin flying.'

'A superficial pocket has been peeled away from the epidermis, soil inserted, and vegetation tucked within, transforming the human hand into a source of life for the natural growth.' Earlier this year, Mr Cata used his body as a canvas for his project Overexposed Emotions, which saw him stitching portraits of his family, friends and girlfriend into the palms of his hands.

"Even the powers of a pet psychic and the whiff of rotisserie chicken haven't been enough to lure back an elusive Golden Retriever who went missing in Vermont five months ago. Three-year-old Murphy bolted after being spooked by a car accident on June 29 and his owner, 24-year-old Kirstin Campbell of Morrisville, has been desperately trying to find him ever since. At one point she enlisted a Massachusetts-based medium who claims to be able to communicate with animals. Missing: This 2013 photo provided by Kirstin Campbell, of Morrisville, Vermont, shows her three-year-old golden retriever Murphy, who bolted from her vehicle after she crashed into a tree on June 29 in Stowe . The psychic told her by phone that Murphy was on a parallel path to a road where he'd reportedly been spotted and that she was seeing his name. A tipster then reported seeing Murphy at Murray Hill Farm in Waterbury Center, Campbell said. However, the dog was not located. Neighbors are now going door-to-door with posters, looking for tracks and setting out toys, food and traps in a bid to find Murphy. He's been spotted numerous times, in backyards and on trail cameras in Waterbury Center, about 8 miles from where the crash happened. Out there somewhere: Murphy's  been spotted numerous times, in backyards and on trail cameras in Waterbury Center, about 8 miles from where the crash happened . Gone in a flash: But any time someone gets close, the cagey canine darts off . But any time someone gets close, the cagey canine darts off. 'I definitely think he's still in the fight-or-flight mode because he seems to run from everybody,' Campbell said. She had Murphy with her when her vehicle went off the road and hit a tree in Stowe. She let the dog out after the crash and he ran away, traumatized. He was seen around the resort town in the summer but ended up venturing south to Waterbury Center, apparently along the one main road between the towns. The search has gotten the attention of local media and members of a popular online community forum where Campbell's grandfather Ed Hamel, 63, has posted weekly since Murphy disappeared. Community effort: After Murphy was spotted in August, one woman drove about 30 miles from Burlington every night to keep a look out for him in Waterbury Center . 'We did the old, you know, put the clothing out, put the towels out, food out, treats out, walk around and walk around, leave our scent everywhere and that didn't do any good,' said Hamel, who describes Murphy as 'the best dog in the world.' After Murphy was spotted in August, one woman drove about 30 miles from Burlington every night to keep a look out for him in Waterbury Center. And town resident Lisa Lovelette has helped check the traps for Hamel, knowing he couldn't make the long drive from his home twice a day. 'I just thought about how I would feel if it were my dog and I lived 30 miles away,' she said. 'So I've just been doing what I can to kind of help him out.' At the end of October and in mid-November, Murphy was spotted on two trail cameras in Waterbury Center, giving Campbell hope that he's still out there and they're on the right track. Now one homeowner nearby has been setting out food to lure Murphy back for regular feedings until he can be caught - before winter really sets in. But Hamel and Campbell urged people not to chase the skittish pooch, just to report where they see him. 'I miss him like crazy,' she said.","The  dog bolted after being spooked by a car accident on June 29 .

"Ruben Loftus-Cheek says making his senior Chelsea debut has given him a thirst for more first-team playing time. The 18-year-old midfielder, who has been with the Blues since the age of eight, made his first appearance in Wednesday night's Champions League Group G defeat of Sporting Lisbon. Manager Jose Mourinho insisted prior to the 3-1 win that Loftus-Cheek's inclusion would be a day for the whole Chelsea academy to celebrate, showing there is a path to the first team despite no one making a lasting impression since John Terry. Ruben Loftus-Cheek has revealed his joy at making Chelsea debut on Wednesday against Sporting Lisbon . Loftus-Cheek, who came on for the final seven minutes, told Chelsea TV: 'I wanted it to last longer. It was a bit weird when I came on, a bit surreal, it took a while to sink in. 'Just to come on is all I can ask for. To play at a full Stamford Bridge is amazing. When you come on and you start playing it all just goes away, you're just focused. 'After that I just want to keep working harder - to get more opportunities like that would be wicked.' Goalkeeper Petr Cech started against Sporting and also wants further opportunities. The 32-year-old has been displaced after 10 years as first choice by Thibaut Courtois and has been linked with a move away from Chelsea, with numerous clubs reported to be interested, including Arsenal. Loftus-Cheek (left) came on as a late substitute in Chelsea's 3-1 Champions League win at Stamford Bridge . 'It's up to everyone to keep working and to show to the manager when you get a game that you can play any game,' Cech said on chelseafc.com. 'For everybody it's important to have this opportunity to play and to be in 'game shape' because the season is very long. 'You need everybody in the squad to be available and in the best condition possible to hope that you can win anything.' The match saw Chelsea bounce back from a first loss in 24 matches this season at Newcastle last Saturday with a victory ahead of this weekend's Premier League encounter with Hull. 'It's always important to win especially when you lose a game in the league,' Cech added. 'We wanted to have a good performance and win the game and you could see that from the start.' Petr Cech (centre) was happy with the Blues' performance after Saturday's Premier League loss at Newcastle . Chelsea, semi-finalists last season, must wait until Monday to discover their last 16 opponents, with Juventus, Basle, Bayer Leverkusen, Paris St Germain or Shakhtar Donetsk all possible opponents in February. 'Last season we were unlucky in the semi-finals and this season we would like to carry on the good work,' Cech said. 'We go game by game now. Obviously we have the quality and we know we can beat anybody. Let's see where it takes us.'","Chelsea beat Sporting Lisbon 3-1 in the Champions League on Wednesday .

"A nine-year-old girl has been left traumatised after her classmates ripped up Christmas cards she gave to them because they didn't come with candy canes. Annie Winter, from Coomera on the Gold Coast, bought cards for her daughter Lori to give out to children at school but couldn't find mini candy canes at the shop. Ms Winter said the Year 3 student has been left extremely upset after the cards were thrown out right in front of her. 'She said ""Mum some of the people today just threw them out"", they ripped them up in front of her,' she told Daily Mail Australia. Annie Winter (left) is devastated for her daughter Lori (right) who was treated so cruelly by her classmates when she gave them Christmas cards - but did not include candy canes in the envelope . 'It's just so rude, she's a fairly private person anyway and it's like a slap in the face. 'She's doesn't like showing her feelings so outright, that's why when she came home and told me about it she said ""Mum I'm not doing that again"", she doesn't want to put herself out there.' Ms Winter said she didn't think the children did it to intentionally bully her daughter. 'I think it's more to do with the expectation kids seem to have these days, they've kind of got this attitude of what to get out of things rather than what they can give,' she said. 'You can't say that for all kids but I just question whether or not it's a sign of the times or is the way we're parenting? Ms Winter said she didn't think the children did it to intentionally bully her daughter, but instead thought they lacked manners and expected too much . 'Are we not showing kids to be grateful?' Ms Winter said she is treating the whole ordeal as a learning experience for Lori and her younger daughter Holly, seven. 'My biggest thing, I want them to be kind and I want them to be responsible for their actions,' she said. 'I want them to have the old fashion manners and respect and I think it starts in the home.' Since Ms Winter posted about her daughter on a community Facebook page the family has been inundated with messages of support and people wanting to send Christmas cards to Lori. 'It just brought me to tears, I've gone through and read all of the messages to my daughters,' she said. 'I think that's really encouraged Lori, I want to show her this is what people are really like.'","Annie Winter bought cards for her daughter Lori to give out to friends .

"Dozens of dementia patients were moved out of a nursing home in their pyjamas after regulators branded it ‘dangerous’ and shut it down at short notice. In chaotic scenes, pensioners were carried out in the freezing night to waiting ambulances after they were deemed ‘at significant risk of harm’. Patients and their families were given just a few hours’ notice before police and paramedics arrived to move the patients out of Merok Park Care Home. Residents at Merok Park Nursing Home in Banstead, Surrey, have been forced to find new accommodation  after inspectors warned they were 'at significant risk of harm'. Pictured: A resident is removed from the home . It was reported that staff at the care home were working up to 60 hours per week and that they had not been given relevant training. A recent care quality inspection found that residents were being washed in cold water . The Care Quality Commission ordered its immediate closure after finding elderly patients in filthy conditions and forced to wash in cold water by untrained staff. Inspectors also described an ‘overpowering’ smell of urine at the care home in Banstead, Surrey – which charges up to £500 a week. Shocked families were told about the emergency move on Tuesday morning and some arrived at the home with bin liners to pack up their loved ones’ belongings. As darkness fell, there was chaos as pensioners were carried from their beds in nightclothes to be transported to other homes. Some were left shivering by the front door in wheelchairs with blankets around their necks as they waited, while one confused woman – who did not appear to have any relatives – was left all day in the corner of the lounge. Families also complained they were left without information on when transport would arrive. The closure comes despite the home being given a clean bill of health in January by the watchdog – and despite numerous complaints from relatives going back years. Leslie Shields, 53, whose father was among those moved out, said: ‘The home was a pigsty. My father’s health has really gone downhill there. I think they’ve been cutting corners when it comes to staff. ‘I’ve complained to the council on numerous occasions about the concerns I had, but they just seemed to file the documents away and do nothing. ‘But the worst was moving all those elderly people out on one of the coldest, windiest nights of the year. It was awful for them.’ Another relative, who asked not to be named, said: ‘The thing that makes me angry is that the home passed its CQC inspection in January. The care hasn’t got worse since then – it’s always been that bad. How can they have passed it 11 months ago and now be shutting it down?’ The CQC said it carried out a 'comprehensive inspection' of the home on November 28 and December 1 and, after the visit, it was decided that the care facility had to close immediately. Patients were moved immediately . A woman (not pictured) whose father was at the home said her relative had been found soiled several times . There were other questions last night over why elderly people were ever placed in the care home by Surrey County Council, which was damned by a coroner this year over the death of a dementia patient. Gloria Foster, 81, died when she was left without food and medication for nine days after the care agency which visited her daily was shut down by immigration officers. The CQC said it had taken ‘urgent’ action to remove registration from Merok Park after a range of safety concerns. Inspectors found its 29 residents were not being helped to eat and some were confined to the top floors because of a broken lift. Some staff had neither passed police checks nor received ‘relevant training’ and worked up to 60 hours a week. The residents have now been re-housed by the local authority in different care homes. Adrian Hughes, chief inspector of adult social care in the south for the Care Quality Commission (CQC), confirmed the health and social care services regulator had taken action because of the 'significant risk of harm' to residents. He said: 'We have taken urgent action to remove CQC registration from Merok Park Nursing Home in Banstead, Surrey, because of concerns that the people living there are at significant risk of harm. 'CQC does not take enforcement action lightly given the obvious impact on people who live in nursing and residential care homes, but in this case we – and other agencies locally – felt that the home was unsafe. Residents of the family-run Merok Park (pictured) were told they would need to find new accommodation because the home was 'no longer safe'. Inspectors found the home was 'dirty' and strongly 'smelt of urine' Surrey Police confirmed uniformed officers assisted with the closure of the home and removing residents . 'We made the providers aware of our concerns some time ago, but action has not been taken to maintain the safety and welfare of people.' Mr Hughes confirmed that the CQC carried out a 'comprehensive inspection' of the home on November 28 and December 1, after receiving concerns about the level of care provided. He said: 'We identified a number of serious issues with the care provided at Merok Park. 'We saw that people living in the home were not being appropriately supported by staff, and witnessed some incidents of poor manual handling. 'People were being washed in cold water, there was a high risk of people developing pressure sores due to inappropriate beds. 'People were not supported to eat, and the home was dirty. The smell of urine in the home on the first day of the inspection was overpowering. 'Some staff working in the home had not had criminal records checks, and staff were working up to 60 hours a week. 'There has been neglect': Leslie Shields . A furious son has described how he complained ‘hundreds’ of times about the state of Merok Park and its treatment of his father. Leslie Shields, 53, said he and relatives repeatedly confronted the home and Surrey County Council officials about the standard of care. His father – also called Leslie, 78 – entered the home six years ago with dementia after suffering several falls and some memory loss. But over the years the family began to worry about conditions at the Surrey centre. Mr Shields described it as a ‘hovel’ and complained of a bad smell throughout, saying there were so few staff that it was difficult to arrange health appointments. He claimed his father was left to soil himself and had blisters and sores all over his legs caused by ‘poor hygiene’. The family said they were ignored by the council after repeated complaints – and despite filling out formal questionnaires and filing letters to an NHS commissioning body. ‘We’ve been telling social services for years... and ramped up our efforts in the last two years,’ he said. ‘Each time, nothing was done. We feel there has been neglect at the home.’ 'There were not enough staff on duty, and relevant training had not been provided. 'A broken lift had left some people unable to get downstairs in the home for several weeks.' Mr Hughes said the decision to move the residents from the home was made in their best interests. He said: 'Taking any decision which causes people to leave their homes is always difficult at any time of year – but it is our view, shared by other agencies, that it was no longer safe for people to remain in Merok Park. 'The level of concerns we had here were rare, and robust action was needed. 'The local authority and the CCG are in the process of moving people to other services, and we are continuing to monitor the situation.' Merok Park is run by Mauritian businessman Soondressen Cooppen, 51, and his wife Maleenee, who also run the Faygate House care home in Sutton. That was criticised earlier this year by the CQC for failing to store the residents’ records properly. The couple, who own a £1.3million home in nearby Cheam, were unavailable to comment yesterday. Merok Park passed an inspection in January even though there were ‘concerns’ during a visit in September last year. That inspection found that residents were ‘generally satisfied’ but a report said the home had ‘not always taken steps to provide care in a home that was adequately maintained in all areas’. Surrey Police confirmed officers assisted with the closure of the home. A spokesman said: 'Uniformed officers assisted with the closure of a care home in Banstead following a request by the Care Quality Commission. 'The closure, which involved several partner agencies, took place on Tuesday.' MailOnline has contacted Mr and Mrs Cooppen for comment.","Care Quality inspection found that residents at Merok Park Nursing Home were being washed in cold water and an 'overpowering' smell of urine .

"Dozens more former Scouts have come forward to claim they were victims of child abuse after the movement issued an apology and admitted paying out £500,000 in compensation. Yesterday, the Scout Association said it was 'deeply sorry' after an investigation claimed it was facing more than 50 legal cases over historic sex abuse. Today, solicitor David McClenaghan said 30 people called his firm overnight after seeing a BBC report about two historic cases. The Scout Association has apologised to people who were abused during their time in the organisation, saying it was 'deeply sorry for anybody hurt by the actions of abusers' Mr McClenaghan, of Bolt Burdon Kemp which has already represented around 30 alleged victims in recent years, told BBC Radio 4's Today: 'Since the report on the abuse in the Scout Association went out yesterday, I have been contacted overnight by an additional 30 people. 'I think what that demonstrates is that the figures that have come out really are the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number of people who have suffered abuse.' He said the apology had been issued 'under intense pressure from the media'. 'It's convenient that that has been issued now and it serves their self-interest rather than being a genuine apology to the individual people,' he said. The Scout Association denies claims, reported by the BBC, that 56 people have instructed solicitors to sue the association over historical abuse since October 2012. The Scouts put the number of people who have launched civil actions since that time at 36 - more than double the number during the first century of the movement's history. A Scout spokesman admitted that the organisation has tried to deal with paedophiles without telling police. The Association said: 'We apologise to all those who have been abused during their time in scouting. The safety and support of young people in scouting is our number one priority. 'Any abuse of young people is abhorrent and we are deeply sorry for anybody hurt by the actions of abusers. We strive to ensure these abuses do not take place.' A spokesman added that the association had been wrong not to report past allegations to police. 'Those were inappropriate and unacceptable responses to that situation. These were extremely rare incidences and this should not have happened. We deeply regret this failure,' the spokesman said. The BBC said that 56 people have instructed lawyers to sue over Scout-related abuse committed in past decades since the scale of allegations against Savile became known in 2012. Earlier this year paedophile Scout leader Martyn Tucker was jailed for 12 years after admitting 26 sex offences against boys in the 1960s and 1970s . And it said £897,000 in damages has already been paid by the movement and by individual Scout leaders. Last night the association said the numbers of abuse claims had been exaggerated and that it had paid less than £500,000 in compensation. The BBC said one victim had been paid £45,000 in 2011. He said he had been abused by a Scout leader in the early 1980s at weekly meetings and during a camp. He said: 'I was sickened and disgusted by it. I wanted it to stop but I couldn't make it stop. 'I had no one I could speak to and I didn't know what to say. 'Perhaps he was clever in choosing people who he knew wouldn't be in a position to talk about it.' The scoutmaster was investigated by the police but committed suicide before the trial began, the report revealed. The victim later asked the association to pay for therapy to help his recovery: 'I was looking for them to help,' he said. 'It was a time of crisis in my own life and I was looking for someone to be there to help address the issues I was experiencing.' The association advised approaching the NHS but he decided to pursue a compensation claim to fund therapy privately, the BBC said. One of the legal firms handling claims against the Scout Association is North London-based Bolt Burdon Kemp. Lawyer David McClenaghan said that his firm had handled 33 claims, of which a number are still outstanding. Of these, 24 have been made since the Savile abuse charges became widely known in the autumn of 2012. 'These come from people who suffered in the 60s, 70s and 80s,' he said. 'It still takes great courage for people to come forward. 'The hope is that these claims will encourage the Scout Association to put better safeguards in place to make sure this does not happen again.' The association told the BBC that safety for young people was its 'number one priority'. It said that in common with other organisations it had 'experienced an increase in reported historic cases since 2012.' The organisation denied claims that 56 people have instructed solicitors to sue the association over historical abuse since October 2012 . However, it said it had paid, together with its insurers, only £496,500 in damages to claimants in recent times. The association also said it has received only 36 abuse claims since October 2012. Before that, there had been only 12 sex abuse claims in over a century since the movement's foundation in 1907, it said. A Scout Association spokesman added that the organisation was confident that mistakes of the past would not be repeated. 'Where there is any evidence of wrongdoing, this information is automatically passed on to the police,' he said. 'This is in line with a clear written code of conduct that we have had in place for the last 20 years, which requires all adults in the Movement to report suspected cases of abuse to the appropriate authorities.' Earlier this year paedophile Scout leader Martyn Tucker was jailed for 12 years after admitting 26 sex offences against boys in the 1960s and 1970s. A court heard how the Scout movement knew about allegations against him, but never told the police. Tucker, now 68, abused scouts while he was assistant leader of a troop in Whitchurch, Shropshire.","Scouts Association says it is 'deeply sorry' to those who have been hurt .

"A propaganda film commissioned by Thailand's military regime was supposed to promote the '12 core values' all Thai youths must learn. But there was one scene the junta has had trouble explaining: a grinning schoolboy painting an image of Adolf Hitler while his smiling classmate applauds. The video, screened before films in major cinemas since Saturday, has been met with ridicule on social media and condemned by the Israeli Embassy in Bangkok. Scroll down for video . 'Misunderstanding': The scene from a Thai propaganda film showing a young schoolboy proudly painting a picture of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler while his classmate applauds his efforts enthusiastically . National myth: The video is supposed to promote '12 core values' to be imbued in all Thai youth . A senior official in the prime minister's office, Panadda Diskul, said it was a 'misunderstanding', adding that the Nazi imagery in the cartoon scene would soon be replaced. The 11-minute film tells the story of two schoolboys who learn to accept winning and losing is part of life. Mr Panadda claimed the boy shown merrily painting an image of Hitler saluting beside a swastika was trying to compare his mother to a dictator, in essence a rebellious jest. In the video, however, there is no such explanation. The scene is part of a sequence without dialogue that depicts an otherwise normal day at school - the boys catching butterflies at a playground, doing experiments in a chemistry class and exercising on a karate mat. It lasts just a few seconds and runs with a cheery tune playing in the background. 'The film is good, but it has caused a slight misunderstanding in our society,' Mr Panadda said. 'We won't stop the project, but we will replace that problematic picture with another, more proper one.' The director of the film, Kulp Kaljaruek, told AFP he did not mean to cause offence but instead was trying to illustrate the child's moral progress. 'It's symbolic. The child is going in the wrong direction. But I didn't mean it (to show Hitler) in a bad way,' said Mr Kulp, whose father is head of Kantana Group, one of Thailand's largest film studios. 'You know Hitler had quite strong power in the past. But not in a good way. So it's like he (the boy) is learning from that until he becomes a good person at the end,' he said. Mr Kulp confirmed the junta had approved the film but said 'nobody asked' about the contentious scene featuring the painting. Coup leader-cum-Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, left, introduced the 12 values as part of a campaign to return 'happiness' to the people. Right, a coloured-up photo of Hitler, whose image is popular in Thailand . Israel's ambassador to Thailand, Simon Roded, said he was 'deeply saddened to see this trivialisation and misuse of Nazi symbols in an official Thai movie'. 'I was surprised that throughout the screening process this movie must have gone through to be approved for public broadcast, none of the smart, well educated people checking it had identified it as being problematic and offensive,' he said. 'If we learn anything from this incident it is that Holocaust education, especially its global messages of tolerance, should be introduced into the Thai curriculum.' Images of Hitler, swastikas and other Nazi regalia are fairly commonplace in Thailand - adorning T-shirts and memorabilia - a phenomenon blamed on a lack of historical understanding rather than political leanings. The study of history in the Thai school system revolves primarily around the history of Thailand and its long line of kings. World history is glossed over, with little or no mention of the Holocaust. Last year, Thailand's Chulalongkorn University apologised for displaying a billboard showing Hitler with Superman and other superheroes. Officials said it was painted by students who did not realise Hitler's image would offend anyone. A Thai Catholic school was also left red-faced in 2011 after students dressed up in Nazi uniform for a sports day parade. Bizarre: A student poses in front of a congratulatory superhero-themed banner that included Adolf Hitler at the Chulalongkorn University in Thailand . After overthrowing the nation's democratically elected government on May 22, coup leader-cum-Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha introduced the 12 values as part of a junta campaign to return 'happiness' to the people. The values reflect traditional concepts in Thai culture the military felt needed reinforcing, ranging from upholding the monarchy to respecting parents and understanding 'true democratic ideals'. Some student groups have hit back, calling the values, which highlight obedience towards the royalist establishment, a form of brainwashing .","The film has been screened in cinemas across Thailand since Saturday .

A brave four-year-old Brown bear climbed almost to the top of a huge tree in Norway just so she could doze . Wood you believe it? The bear cleverly distributed her weight by placing two paws on one thin branch underneath her and grabbed another in front of her .

She relaxed for hours up the tree to take in the beautiful views in Fla, Norway. Jorgen Tharaldsen, a 41-year-old game designer from Oslo, Norway, was lucky enough to see the bear sitting at the top of the tree. He said: 'When I first saw her, I could hardly believe the small branches could cover that much weight. 'It looks like it's barely enough! But the bear was smart about it, ensuring she distributed weight across the thin branches. It was wonderful to see. 'As an avid photographer - I never leave the house without my camera - it's a rare gift to experience such a moment. 'This was a day where everything simply aligned in a perfect way. 'The emotion of the bear, the unlikely location, the afternoon nordic light, the weather, the depth of the image with the valley kilometres behind the bear, and the autumn colours of nature were all perfect. Content: The bear relaxed for hours at the top of the tree, taking in the view and snoozing . Out of harm's way: Mr Tharaldsen, who photographed the bear, thinks the fact that a large male bear prowling the forest floor may have been an added incentive for her to climb the tree . Upping the ante: The bear was perched on a branch 50 feet up . 'At the same time the trees looked so fragile, and they were, so it seemed like an impossible feat of bear bravery. 'I was getting a sense of melancholy from her, sitting in that tall thin tree as the colours of autumn were all around her. But not being entirely free. 'She was sitting there for hours on end. I never saw her go up, or down, just shifting the position around as she enjoyed the beautiful autumn day. 'Brown bears are expert climbers. They climb from a very young age, just for fun and to play, but also to gather food or to get a good lookout of the forest environment. 'This one was there for the view, and to get away from the rest of the family in the park. 'There was also a massive male brown bear on the ground, perhaps twice her size, and I reckon it was easier to simply hang out up there. Expert climbers: Bears learn to clamber around trees from an early age . 'Fla in Norway is a little community around two hours drive outside Oslo. 'They also have a bear park and carnivore research center where you get to see the bears in their natural environment. 'I was there to photograph animals, and had been in the Hallingdal valley for three days to capture nordic animals. 'While we still have wild bears in Norway, they are extremely rare in the populated central parts of the country. 'I knew this to be a place where I could get close to bears, while knowing they are in a park environment where they are respected, thrive and are studied.

"England’s limited-overs future was looking a little brighter yesterday after Joe Root’s third one-day century of the year and another sprightly innings from James Taylor inspired them to a five-wicket win over Sri Lanka. A target of 240 turned out to be not so much the small mountain some had feared as a pleasant stroll in the Pallekele hills. Tantalisingly, England now trail 3-2 with two games to play. Just as important, the manner in which Root and Taylor — both nimble, inventive and busy — put on 104 in 21 overs for the third wicket lent weight to England’s repeated insistence that they really are capable of playing a modern brand of one-day cricket. England's Joe Root bats during his country's fifth one-day international against Sri Lanka . Root made a century as England kept their hopes of a series win alive with victory in Pallekele . Root, who eventually finished on 104 not out, celebrates reaching his century at the Pallekele Stadium . Root made an unbeaten 104 from 117 balls and Taylor 68 — four days after his morale-boosting 90 in Colombo — as England turned in their most complete 50-over performance since brushing aside the Sri Lankans in Manchester in May. The result glossed over another patchy innings from Alastair Cook, who made 20 in 30 balls, but he could at least spend most of the post-match press conference answering questions about his two young team-mates rather than his own form. ‘Rooty played a knock of equal class to Sangakkara’s 91,’ said the England captain. ‘James has taken his chance and played so well on two difficult wickets. I was a little concerned about the pitch this morning, but it didn’t make a difference.’ Strictly speaking, of course, it wasn’t a one-day international at all, spread, as it was, across Wednesday and Thursday by the weather. But that merely emphasised England’s superiority here: mean with the ball on day one, when Chris Woakes claimed six wickets, and clinical with the bat on day two. Play resumed with the Sri Lankans hoping to strangle England with their phalanx of spinners. And it seemed to be working. In the second over Moeen Ali charged at Sachithra Senanayake and was bowled for four. And it was 35 for two when Cook was trapped in front by Senanayake. Recording his latest failure — and that’s 57 international innings now without a century — has assumed the air of a bloodsport. England have already declared him their World Cup captain of course, but pot-shots will continue to be taken until Cook successfully returns fire. England hero Root leaves the field after helping England to their second win of the seven-game series . Sri Lanka's Sachithra Senanayake dives but fails to try stop Ravi Bopara's low shot . Thisara Perera (left) celebrates with team-mate Kumar Sangakkara after taking the wicket of James Taylor . I keep getting 20s and 30s,’ he said. ‘That’s more frustrating to me than it is to anyone else.’ Conditions here bear little resemblance to what is expected at the World Cup but Taylor’s innings oozed the deftness and adroit game-management that will do well on any surface. He scarpered the singles, swept with intent, and deposited Tillekeratne Dilshan’s off-spin over cow corner for six. But, as at Colombo, a pair of sweat-soaked gloves appeared to bring about Taylor’s demise: an attempted pull off Thisara Perera provided a simple catch for Ajantha Mendis at long leg. But Root was determined to see the job through. He and Ravi Bopara added an untroubled 86 and, though Bopara was caught with 15 needed, Root was soon celebrating his hundred with a crowd-silencing slog-sweep for six. Eoin Morgan threw his wicket away attempting the winning hit, but if England can repeat this result here tomorrow, their reward will be an unexpected series decider in Colombo on Tuesday. ‘This was a really important win for us,’ said Cook. ‘Colombo hasn’t been kind to us so far, but we’ve won away from there. It would be great to get there at 3-3 and have a series final.’ That is not a sentence many were expecting Cook to be able to utter when this tour started.

"A terrorism expert believes Australia should engage with returning jihadists, instead of locking them up and punishing them.

But Mr Killelea says using returned fighters could benefit Australia to discourage other would-be jihadists to join conflicts in Syria and Iraq, like the 90 odd Australians who have already done so. In other countries similar theories are being put to the test. In the UK, former extremist members have established support and outreach programs to steer people away from extremism, while in Norway foreign fighters are not charged on their return. Community leader Jamal Rifi told The Age, he was shocked punishment was being used on returned fighters. But Attorney General George Brandis believes that the more than 20 jihadists that have returned to Australia pose a threat to the country and community, with police powers boosted to arrest them on return . Australia is ranked 95 out of 162 of countries most prone to terrorism but it was the sixth biggest supplier of western fighters in Syria . 'The failure of us as a community and society to use their experience is like someone putting a straight jacket on what we can do for these young people,' he said. Ahmet Keskin, executive director of the Affinity Intercultural Foundation, agrees and believes prevention is key, saying that returned fighters best understand the psychology behind Islamic State, who are recruiting vulnerable young people to fight. According to the Global Terrorism Index, the number of terrorist attacks around the world has increased dramatically, with over 80 per cent of all terrorism occurring in only five countries. Australia is ranked 95 out of 162 of countries most prone to terrorism but it was the sixth biggest supplier of western fighters in Syria.","A terrorism expert believes Australia should not lock up and punish returning jihadists .

"A poignant image has emerged from protests over a deadly police shooting in Phoenix, as police Tuesday released the name of the officer who shot and killed an unarmed drug suspect. The 9-year-old daughter of Rumain Brisbon, Aiyana Rains, was among those attending a demonstration Monday in downtown Phoenix as protesters pushed for greater transparency in the investigation. The Arizona Republic reports a police officer in riot gear shook the girl's hand and said 'I'm sorry.' The newspaper also captured an image of the encounter. Encounter: A police officer in riot gear was snapped meeting Aiyana Rains, daughter of Rumain Brisbon, and reportedly told her 'I'm sorry' at the Monday protest . Shooting: Police have said  Rumain Brisbon was unarmed when he was shot by a white officer investigating a tip that Brisbon was doing a drug deal inside an SUV in the parking lot of his apartment complex . When asked about the gesture, the attorney for Brisbon's family, Marci Kratter, said it was 'nice, but it does not bring back her father.' She says, 'It doesn't change things.' Police were investigating complaints of drug dealing in a Phoenix neighborhood when officer Mark Rine shot Brisbon. The officer mistook a pill bottle in the suspect's pocket for a gun as the two scuffled. The move to name Rine came Tuesday just hours before activists and Brisbon's family members planned a protest. Rine, a seven-year veteran of the department, has been reassigned to nonenforcement duty pending the outcome of an internal investigation, police said. 'It has been seven days since the incident and we didn't want to hold off on releasing the name any longer,' Phoenix Police Department spokesman Sgt. Trent Crump told Reuters on Tuesday. 'He's now had time to mitigate any threats he might receive.' Prosecutors will determine whether the 30-year-old officer will face criminal charges in the December 2 shooting. Incident: Brisbon failed to obey the officer's commands and ran to an apartment where a struggle turned deadly, police said, noting that the officer mistook a pill bottle that Brisbon had been clutching in his pocket for the butt of a gun . Police: Officer Mark Rine, seen right next to Phoenix Police Chief Daniel Garcia, has been reassigned to nonenforcement duty pending the outcome of an internal investigation . Police Chief Daniel Garcia told AZCentral.com 'The conclusion I came to is, it's time now. It's time to release the name. One of the things that I've tried to do from the onset of this incident was to be transparent. We're not Ferguson.' 'We're a city who has many communication avenues available to our community,' he also told the news outlet. 'We take pride in the fact that we have a relationship with all segments to our community, and I thought it was important for us to be as transparent as possible from the very onset.' Police have said 34-year-old Brisbon, who was black, was unarmed when he was shot by a white officer investigating a tip that Brisbon was doing a drug deal inside an SUV in the parking lot of his apartment complex. Brisbon failed to obey the officer's commands and ran to an apartment where a struggle turned deadly, police said, noting that the officer mistook a pill bottle that Brisbon had been clutching in his pocket for the butt of a gun. 'Unfortunately because this individual is a police officer and is engaged in the line of work that he is, he and his family are now going to be put under undue stress and concern for their safety,' Phoenix Law Enforcement Association President Joe Clure told ABC15. An autopsy has determined that Brisbon died from gunshot wounds to his torso. The Rev. Jarrett Maupin, a civil rights advocate, said he and friends and family members of Brisbon were planning to rally and march in downtown Phoenix unless police released the name of the officer involved. A call to Maupin on Tuesday from The Associated Press wasn't immediately returned. Daughter: Aiyana Rains is seen crying Monday night during the protest .

"Jamil Hopoate's brother Will said jail would crush their mother's heart. His manager said prison would finish his promising rugby league career. Now the 20-year-old has been sentenced to a minimum one year behind bars for a drunken, brutal and unprovoked attack on a man outside a Sydney pub. The second-eldest son of former NRL bad boy John Hopoate hugged and kissed his father in court after learning of his punishment for the late-night assault on two men this year. An emotional John Hopoate left court briefly, jostling with journalists and cameraman outside, as his son prepared to make an urgent bail application, pending an appeal. Scroll down for video . NRL player Jamil Hopoate (pictured left), charged over a bar assault, arrived with his father former NRL player John Hopoate (pictured right) at Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney on Wednesday before he was sentenced to a minimum of one year behind bars . But Magistrate Jane Mottley refused his bid, saying he posed an unacceptable risk of failing to appear if released. 'The offence before the court is a serious matter. It's of a violent nature,' she said. Hopoate pleaded guilty to two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company following the attack on Alexander Christie and 'good Samaritan' Timothy Blackett outside a Manly hotel in February. Hopoate started an argument outside the Ivanhoe Hotel with a security guard after he was ejected from the premises. His co-offenders John and Luke Akauola arrived and set upon the unsuspecting Mr Christie, punching and kicking him. Jamil Hopoate (pictured both left and right) arrived at court before he was given a jail sentence from the judge for a 'drunken' 'brutal' and 'unprovoked' assault on two men at a Sydney pub in February . Jamil is the son of NRL bad boy John Hopoate (pictured in his playing days) Mr Blackett tried to intervene but was 'cast aside like a toy' so the brutal assault could continue. Then, as Mr Christie tried to rouse himself from the ground, a 'grossly intoxicated' Hopoate ran over and made a kick towards him before Luke Akauola delivered the blow that rendered their victim unconscious, Ms Mottley said. 'To say the community as a whole is deeply concerned about this type of gratuitous violence is an understatement,' she said. Hopoate was sentenced to a maximum of 18 months for the attack on Mr Christie and a two-year good behaviour bond over the assault on Mr Blackett. It comes after rugby league manager Tyrone Smith said the NRL would 'tear up' Hopoate's new contract if he received a custodial sentence. The second-eldest son of former NRL bad boy John Hopoate (pictured right), Jamil (pictured left) hugged and kissed his father in court after learning of his punishment . 'It will finish him,' Mr Smith told court this month. 'I think with his talents, his footy is what's helping him move forward. Other than that, there's not much more.' Hopoate's older brother and NRL star Will told the court a jail term would 'shatter' his family. 'It'll crush his heart,' he said, 'I think it will crush mum to pieces.' Manly said the club and the NRL's integrity unit were reviewing the matter. Hopoate was stood down by his club Manly after the incident, but he was allowed to return in June to play in the National Youth Competition and NSW Cup. Despite missing half the season, he won the club's under-20s player award and earned a first-grade contract for 2015. The Akauolas will be sentenced next year.","Jamil Hopoate sentenced to a minimum of one year behind bars for late night assault in February .

"It sounds like science fiction, but building a giant ball around the sun to harness its power could be closer than you think - we just have to blow up the planet Mercury. An emerging technology expert has claimed that we can start building a Dyson sphere (a sort of spherical solar panel) that would give us more energy than we will ever need within a matter of decades. George Dvorsky said that by ‘taking apart’ the whole of Mercury, asteroids and even other planets like Venus we can gather enough material to complete the huge project. Mercury, as captured by the Messenger spacecraft: Mining the planet could offer humanity raw materials for the next stage in its evolution . But rather than a solid shell it would be a ‘large number of independent constructs orbiting in a dense formation around the sun’ Earth's horizon and the International Space Station's solar array panels: A Dyson sphere would use the same principle but on a much grander scale . Dvorsky, chair of the US based Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, wrote about his bold, blue skies plan on the organisation’s website. He believes the project can be started in 25 to 50 years and the first phase could be completed within a few decades. But rather than a solid shell it would be a ‘large number of independent constructs orbiting in a dense formation around the sun’, which could be built in stages. These would form a ‘receiving surface’ around the sun which could absorb the energy from the sun to power the next phase of the project, rather than relying on fuel brought from Earth. It all sounds well and good but even Dvorsky admits there are a number of hurdles - not least the fact that no astronaut has ever been to Mercury. Another major issue would be construction.Dvorsky cites a plan by Oxford University physicist Stuart Armstrong which breaks it down into five ‘ten year surges’, starting with the assembling of the first array.But he adds: ‘We’re going to have to mine materials from Mercury. Actually, we’ll likely have to take the whole planet apart. ‘The Dyson sphere will require a horrendous amount of material - so much so, in fact, that, should we want to completely envelope the sun, we are going to have to disassemble not just Mercury, but Venus, some of the outer planets, and any nearby asteroids as well’. The concept of a Dyson sphere, also known as a Dyson shell, was dreamed up by astronomer Freeman Dyson in 1959. But until now it has been the stuff of science fiction and appeared in books like Hex by writer Allen Steele where it was a gift from an alien race. Dvorsky writes: ‘A Dyson sphere would provide us with more energy than we would ever know what to do with while dramatically increasing our living space. ‘Given that our resources here on Earth are starting to dwindle, and combined with the problem of increasing demand for more energy and living space, this would seem to a good long-term plan for our species.’ In his plan however he does not explain how the energy from the Sun could be brought back 93 million miles to Earth. Dvorsky adds: ‘It seems clear that the idea of constructing a Dyson sphere should no longer be relegated to science fiction or our dreams of the deep future. ‘Like other speculative projects, like the space elevator or terraforming Mars, we should seriously consider putting this alongside our other near-term plans for space exploration and work.’","Scientists aim to begin project within 25 years .

"When Brendon Martin's wife turned her life around after suffering depression for seven years, he decided to start his own campaign to help those who also suffer from mental health illness. The Gold Coast resident and gym owner has been taking part in '52 events in 52 weeks' this year to raise awareness on depression, anxiety, suicide, as well as funds for beyondblue. The 38-year-old has been tackling endurance events across Australia, including a 12-hour dusk to dawn mountain-bike ride in Tamworth NSW and a 12 kilometre foot-race in Adelaide's Caudo Vineyards with more than 40 obstacles. It comes after his wife, Jamie was diagnosed with postnatal depression after the birth of their third child. But after taking up exercising, she won the battle and 'returned back to her former self.' The Gold Coast man started his own campaign '52 Events in 52 Weeks' in a bid to raise awareness and funds . 'The exercise got her off the medication and it brought her back to normal,' Martin told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was a really difficult few years and she tried everything to alleviate but I'm so glad that by reaching out for support, she was able to begin a long journey of recovery and take back control of her life. 'For this reason, I felt compelled to do something physical to support beyondblue and promote keeping active and staying healthy.' The father of three has raised more than $11,000 for beyondblue during his challenge, called '52 for Blue', and is hoping to reach $52,000 by the end of year, which will be his 52nd and final round. 'It's been challenging trying to coordinate everything such as our businesses and not missing out on too much of the kids' activities but the most challenging part was the 50 kilometre stand-up paddle board.' 'I'm hoping to carry the event on again next year and inspire everyone to get together and help them achieve that goal.' Brendon Martin's inspiration comes when his wife, Jamie (left) turned her life around after suffering depression . The Gold Coast family - Clockwise: Brendan Martin, Harrison, 9, wife Jamie, Georgia, 12, and Olivia, 14 . The father of three has raised more than $11,000 and is hoping to reach $52,000 by the end of year . The 38-year-old organised events across Australia in a bid to help those who suffer from mental health illness . Martin's remaining five events will include a 50KM Ultramarathon from Kurrawa to Duranbah near the Gold Coast on Sunday December 14. 'I've been very humbled by the support I've received from my community and have often been lucky enough to have family members and friends join me for events,' Martin said. 'I am proud to be supporting beyondblue and look forward to pushing myself during the last few weeks of the challenge.' Martin added: 'My advice to anyone who has experienced the impact of depression that it has on the person, family and friends - All you can do is really support them. 'Don't ever think it's you. It's not about you and it's not about them - it's a condition and hopefully they can recover from it. 'Seek as much professional advice as possible and try and find out what they've got an interest in. Jamie was lucky to find her area in health and exercise but everyone is different.' The Gold Coast resident has been taking part in '52 events in 52 weeks' this year to raise awareness . Martin has been taking part in a gruelling physical endurance challenge each week throughout 2014 . Martin said he feels strongly about the cause as he knows how heartbreaking it is to watch someone close struggle with depression or anxiety . CEO Georgie Harman said beyondblue is grateful to Martin for taking on a massive challenge to support its work. 'For most of us, completing one endurance event in a year, such as a marathon, would be a major accomplishment. To do one every week for a year is nothing short of remarkable,' she said. 'At least one in seven women will experience postnatal depression, and anxiety conditions are thought to be at least as common as depression during this time. 'By speaking openly about anxiety and depression, particularly postnatal depression and how it affects families, Brendon has been helping to break down the stigma surrounding these conditions, which stops many people from taking action when they are struggling. 'We wish Brendon the very best for the remaining weeks of 52 for Blue and hope he achieves his goal and takes a well-earned rest.'

"Introducing himself as the 'big elf,' President Barack Obama on Wednesday exclaimed 'Ho, Ho, Ho' and made merry as he delivered a pair of giant red sacks filled with toys and other gifts to the Marine Corps' annual Toys for Tots campaign. First lady Michelle Obama has been the traditional bearer of the gifts, which have been donated annually by White House staffers. But this time she decided to bring a pair of extra hands to the Washington military base, Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, where the unwrapped toys are collected. They brought about 1,000 items. 'That's a pretty serious ho, ho, ho,' Mrs. Obama said of her husband's greeting to the crowd in the taped encounter, a video of which appeared online. 'We're going to break you in slowly, okay?' she also said to the president at the event. Scroll down for video . Here he is!

She also said 'One of the challenges is making sure that we have enough toys for the older kids. It's always fun to buy the Barbie dolls and the coloring books, but we have to remember that there are teenagers out there too that need those gifts. 'And we try to make it a point to make sure that we're buying cool clothes for kids and electronic products and educational materials for teenagers as well.' 'I'm the big elf, I'm like Will Ferrell,' Obama said as he introduced himself. He thanked the Marine Corps for starting the annual toy drive in the 1940s. Since then, the Toys for Tots campaign has distributed more than 469 million toys to more than 216 million less fortunate children, Obama said. 'That's a lot of dollhouses, that's a lot of Ninja Turtles,' he said. Before the Obamas got to work sorting the toys into boxes according to age and whether a particular item was for a boy or a girl, Mrs. Obama joked that the president might have a hard time sorting the gifts, saying he doesn't do much shopping. 'I don't know how good he'll be with sorting, because he doesn't usually deal in shopping in any kind of way,' she said. She continued 'But we'll watch him closely to see if he can figure out which ones are girls' zero-to-two or unisex. It gets really complicated, so watch him, because he could really make your work harder.' Obama said he was 'positive' that the 'Call of Duty' video game was perfect for girls, zero to two.

"Asda, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Marks & Spencer wines have been given the stamp of approval by more than 300 wine experts. In fact tipples from four supermarket tipples were considered the best to pair with Christmas meals this festive season.

Chocolate dessert is best matched with Tesco Finest* 10 YO Tawny Port, wine experts who judge for the International Wine and Spirit Competition (IWSC) revealed. But if it's roast goose you're having then a Cono Sur 20 Barrels Pinot Noir 2012 suits. And salmon goes particularly well with a Xanadu Next of Kin Chardonnay 201, . The experts also shared top recommendations for everyday food and wine pairings, . Fish and chips should be partnered with Champagne, a full-bodied red goes with sausage and mash, and a slug of aged Riesling will soften a spicy Indian. But a full English breakfast is still best served with a cup of tea. Other suggestions include pairing a crisp Pinot Grigio with Chinese and serving pepperoni pizza with a glass of warm Chianti. The experts also suggested similar wine and grape varieties to help consumers discover new tipples instead of sticking to their old favourites. Sauvignon Blanc drinkers should try Pouilly Fumé while Zinfandel fans should replace it with a Primitivo.

"Having played for Barcelona for over 16 years and represented Spain 133 times, Xavi has had the pleasure of lacing up his boots alongside many of the world's finest. The 34-year-old veteran has also faced the best of British talent in the Champions League, helping the Catalan giants win the famous trophy on three occasions over the last decade. Luis Enrique's side are safely through to the knockout stages this season and, ahead of Monday's draw for the last 16, the midfield pass-master has picked his all-time UK XI to have played in Europe's elite club competition. Barcelona midfielder Xavi, pictured in action against Espanyol, has picked his British Champions League XI . Xavi (second from left), pictured at the Stadio Olimpico in 2009, has won the Champions League three times . Former Spain international Xavi holds the Champions League trophy prior to the 2011 Super Cup against Porto . Goalkeeper: Fraser Forster . Defenders: Rio Ferdinand, Sol Campbell, John Terry . Midfielders: Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, Paul Gascoigne . Forwards: Theo Walcott, Wayne Rooney . Speaking to ShortList magazine, Xavi chose a 3-5-2 formation in order to accommodate five of the greatest midfielders to have been born in the British Isles. The Spaniard began by picking his goalkeeper, surprisingly opting for Southampton No 1 Fraser Forster. The England man, who joined Saints from Celtic last summer, put in some inspired displays against Barca during his time in Glasgow - after one match the Catalan press dubbed him the 'Yellow Wall' - all of which stuck in the memory of Xavi. 'Barcelona have met Celtic four times in recent seasons, and every time Forster put in an incredible performance,' he said. 'In the games we've played, he's made some of the best saves I have ever seen.' Lining up in the veteran's defensive three are former England trio Rio Ferdinand, Sol Campbell and John Terry. All three have faced Xavi and Barcelona in the Champions League, with Ferdinand part of Manchester United's back-four in final defeats by the La Liga side in 2009 and 2011. Chelsea skipper Terry enjoyed both success and failure against Lionel Messi and Co and Campbell scoring in Arsenal's 2-1 loss to Frank Rijkaard's men in 2006.

Rio Ferdinand helped Manchester United win the Champions League final against Chelsea in 2008 . It's no surprise to see ex-United star Paul Scholes included in midfield, with Xavi having spoken of his admiration for the ginger-haired maestro on plenty of occasions. 'Technically the best English player since Matt Le Tissier, who I grew up watching,' said Xavi. 'Just unbelievably gifted. Every time I played against him or watched him on TV he made everything look so easy. I've never seen anyone make playing that well look so effortless.' Former Rangers and Lazio playmaker Paul Gascoigne, ex-Chelsea stalwart Frank Lampard and Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs also make the cut in midfield, although Xavi reserved special praise for Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard. He said: 'John Barnes was one of the first midfield players I remember watching and appreciating his technical skill. Gerrard is just as good and, like Frank [Lampard], he has every attribute you need to be a Barcelona player.'

Arsenal favourite Theo Walcott, although used more as a wide player, was picked after helping the Gunners fight back for a 2-2 draw against Barca at the Emirates in 2010. And Xavi opted for United striker Wayne Rooney to partner him, insisting that the 29-year-old would easily fit into Barcelona's tiki-taka style. 'Wayne was very complimentary about the way Barcelona play,' he said. 'He would have fitted into our style of play no problem, but Manchester United would never have wanted to let one of the best players in the world leave. He's still the player who makes things happen for them.' A young Theo Walcott celebrates scoring in a 2-2 draw against Barcelona at the Emirates in March 2010 .

"Tens of thousands of bright children are going backwards at secondary school, a damning Ofsted report said yesterday. High-achievers too often find themselves repeating topics they have already studied and enduring noisy lessons that are disrupted by increasingly poor behaviour. In a ‘state of the nation’ report, Ofsted warned that almost two-thirds of high-fliers at age 11 – about 57,000 pupils – fail to convert their early promise into A and A* grades at GCSE. Schools watchdog Ofsted warned teachers face an impossible job in some schools when they are faced with a 'hubbub of interference' from pupils gossiping, shouting out and using mobiles phones during lessons . It said many comprehensives lacked a ‘scholarship’ culture. School inspections in the last academic year uncovered specific weaknesses in the teaching of the most able pupils in about a third of secondaries, with many not being given work that stretched them. ‘Inspectors found that teachers’ expectations of the most able were too low,’ said Ofsted. ‘There is a worrying lack of scholarship permeating the culture of too many schools.’ Publishing the report, Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, warned that the education outlook was ‘less promising’ than a year ago. ‘The nation should be worried about a growing divide between primary and secondary schools,’ he said. England is facing a teacher shortage, the Ofsted chief inspector has warned, with the weakest schools most likely to miss out as top candidates are 'cherry-picked' by the best. In a speech introducing his third annual report, Sir Michael Wilshaw suggested that not enough new teachers are joining the profession and the good entrants are often not going where they are most needed. Teacher recruitment is a pressing issue with thousands more teachers needed over the next decade to educate the almost one million more children due to be attending the nation's schools in this period, he said. Sir Michael warned that the education system is in danger of becoming 'polarised' as the strongest new teachers go to the most successful schools. The number of entrants into teacher training has dropped by 17 per cent in the last four years, with large shortfalls in key subjects such as maths and physics. There are 8,000 fewer trainees in secondary schools since 2009/2010, figures show. ‘In too many cases, pupils are leaving their primary schools with good literacy and numeracy skills, confident and eager to learn. But the culture they encounter at too many secondary schools often demotivates and discourages them.’ Sir Michael noted that weak leadership was fuelling the problem, with about a quarter of secondary headteachers rated as below par. The report said more than 400,000 pupils are being taught in schools with discipline problems following a decline in behaviour standards. Inspectors found a ‘hubbub of interference’ in too many classrooms where pupils gossiped or used phones. Standards of behaviour were found to be poor in 28 per cent of secondary schools in 2013/14 – up from 21 per cent the year before. Sir Michael went on to rail against parents who fail to support heads as they strive to instil discipline among pupils. ‘Heads who are battling an anti-learning culture and taking a stand against those who are too ready to defend the indefensible deserve support not opprobrium,’ he said. He warned that the performance of white working class pupils was ‘particularly troubling’. These pupils were being failed by the system as well as poor parenting, he said. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said she ‘shared Ofsted’s ambition’ but added: ‘We should not lose sight of the incredible improvements seen under this government.’ Ofsted's chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw warned half a million children are being taught at secondary schools suffering from poor behaviour .","Ofsted warns 500,000 children in secondary schools with poor behaviour .

"Head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, will warn too many state secondaries still struggle to provide educational ‘basics’ The number of children being taught in failing secondary schools has risen to 170,000 – despite a drive to boost standards, the head of Ofsted will reveal today. Some 147 schools are now in special measures, a rise of 62 per cent, while those given top ratings remains the same. Sir Michael Wilshaw will cite the data as evidence that standards have stagnated – and progress could even go into reverse. Despite giving heads more freedom to run their own affairs, he will warn that too many state secondaries still struggle to provide educational 'basics' – with 'indifferent' teaching and poor discipline. Launching his annual report, Sir Michael will reveal how the number of pupils being taught in schools rated 'inadequate' by Ofsted has risen by 70,000 in two years to 170,000. At the same time, the proportion of schools given Ofsted's top ratings – good and outstanding – remains unchanged on last year at about 70 per cent. While primary schools are continuing to 'forge ahead', improvements at secondary level have 'plateaued', he will say. In too many cases, secondaries are allowing bad behaviour to go unchallenged and are led by 'weak' head teachers and governors who lack oversight of standards. Sir Michael – the chief inspector of schools – will add that many secondaries 'lack meaningful support' despite the Government's academies programme which has seen hundreds of schools govern themselves or hand over management to sponsors. In a speech to launch his third annual report, he will call for an end to 'sterile' debates about how schooling should be structured. 'Where schools are failing, it is not because they are local authority schools or academies, or because they are part of a multi-academy trust or because they stand alone,' he will tell an audience. 'They are failing because they haven't got the essentials right: governance and oversight is weak, leadership is poor, misbehaviour goes unchallenged and teaching is indifferent. Launching his annual report, Sir Michael will reveal how the number of pupils being taught in schools rated 'inadequate' by Ofsted has risen by 70,000 in two years to 170,000 . 'If our education system is to continue to progress we need to concentrate on the basics of why schools and colleges fail and why they succeed.' He will also call for stronger monitoring of struggling schools which had become 'isolated' and lacked support from local authorities or sponsors. 'These schools are deprived of effective support when times are bad,' he will say. 'They are left unchallenged when they flirt with complacency. In many cases they are totally insulated from effective governance. They are bereft of good leadership and teaching practice. They remain apart from schools that could partner them.' In contrast, Sir Michael will highlight the performance of schools rated 'outstanding' which he says are doing a 'superb job' and creating a 'strong learning ethos'. And he will argue that primaries have continued to improve, largely because heads and governors are 'getting the basics right' – such as the effective teaching of the 'phonics' reading method. Alongside a national report, Sir Michael will also publish eight regional reports. It will show that in 13 local authority areas, fewer than half of secondary schools are rated good or outstanding by Ofsted.","Head of Ofsted will say the data proves school standards have stagnated .

"A man who took to stealing packages from a woman's doorstop in Washington DC this week got more than he bargained for - a box filled with dog feces. Andrea Hutzler, 33, said she has lost more than $800 in stolen goods over the past two months, including Christmas presents, clothes and even aluminium poles she had ordered for a building project. Hutzler and her boyfriend have filed police reports and installed a camera outside their home, but all these measures did nothing to stop thieves from lifting parcels from their doorstep. Scroll down for videos . Revenge's best served smelly: This suspected package thief in Washington DC had no idea he was walking into a stinky trap when he approached a house hoping to steal a package containing something valuable . Pungent plot: What the man did not know is the homeowners, who had lost several parcels to sticky-fingered crooks over the past three months, filled this cardboard box with dog feces to teach him a lesson . Candid camera: To make matters worse for the unwitting perpetrator, the residents trained a surveillance camera on the front door to catch him in the act and get a good look at his face . For Hutzler the last straw was seeing a stranger approach her house at around 3pm last Friday and get away with yet another delivery. ‘I worked hard, saved my money, bought something and then it was just gone,’ the frustrated woman told ABC7. So with less than two weeks to go before Christmas, Miss Hutzler has decided to teach the sticky-fingered Grinch who has been swiping her purchases what it means to be on her naughty list. With some help from her two dogs, Miss Hutzler has come up the perfect, pungent revenge plot, filling a cardboard box with the pooches' excrement, reported MyFox Philly. On Monday, the crafty homeowner trained a video camera on her front door and set up the trap. Before long, a man in a hooded sweatshirt and a beanie hat was caught on camera walking up the stairs, scooping up the special gift and fleeing. The recording showing the heartless thief getting his comeuppance was posted on YouTube Monday and has since spread online. Partners in crime: Andrea Hutzler, 33, devised the revenge plot with the help of her two dogs, one of them pictured on the right . Unforgettable lesson: Hutlzer, pictured here with her four-legged accomplice, hopes she won't be seeing the thief anytime soon . Hutzler said that before recruiting her two dogs as her accomplices in her vendetta, she had planned to place a note inside the box stating: 'Surprise! Please stop stealing my crap.' Hutzler has filed a police report and hopes detectives will be able to identify and collar the crook with the help of the surveillance video. For now, she hopes that her stunt has sent the thief a clear message to stay away from her stuff. ‘I think he would be gone for good because he'll never know what I’ll be putting in a box,’ she said with a smile.","Andrea Hutzler, 33, of Washington DC, said she has lost more than $800 in stolen goods over the past two months, including Christmas presents .

"Yusupha Bojang , deputy head of the Gambian Diplomatic Mission, has been jailed for six years for being the ringleader in running a tax-free tobacconist by abusing his diplomatic privileges . A gang of Gambian diplomats who turned their London embassy into a tax-free tobacconist and avoided paying almost £5million in tax have been jailed for a total of 33 years. Yusupha Bojang, 54, the deputy head of the Gambian Diplomatic Mission in Kensington in London, and his colleagues ordered 29 tonnes of rolling tobacco over three years - amounting to more than half a million pouches. At one point their racket became so large that people were queuing outside the embassy to buy the tobacco. Bojang and six other members of staff  'systematically abused' diplomatic tax exemptions and were caught after the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was alerted to the system being misused. They decided the vast amounts could not possibly be for personal use and launched a criminal investigation which led the Gambian government to waive the diplomatic immunity of the seven. A judge branded the tobacco racket a 'substantial fraud' and said the diplomats had made 'every citizen in this country' losers by committing the deception so they could make large profits. The gang denied conspiracy to cheat the public revenue but were found guilty after a trial at Southwark Crown Court lasting more than a month. The court previously heard that the 50g pouches were imported at tax-free rates which were only permissible for goods for personal use or that of the Gambian High Commission. But the diplomats did not smoke and sold the tobacco from the Mission, a £6million redbrick town house in west London, while failing to pay £4.8m in VAT and excise duty. As it became more successful the tobacco racket became even bigger. Later it became so 'bold' long queues of customers were seen queuing outside the embassy to buy the tobacco. During the trial it emerged that demand became so high that members of the gang were ordering tobacco worth more than their annual salary, and so much of it that firm which supplied them couldn't keep up with demand. Bojang, who was a senior staff member and considered a 'father figure', was the ringleader, but all the diplomats profited from the scam. He was jailed for seven years. First secretary Gaston Sambou, 48 and finance attache Ebrima John, 38, were jailed for six years. Welfare officer Georgina Gomez, 29, who sobbed throughout the hearing, was sentenced to five years. First secretary Gaston Sambou (left) was part of the group which abused their diplomatic privileges to buy and sell dozens of tonnes of rolling tobacco which was found in crates (right) and seized by police . All four diplomats had earlier been found guilty of conspiracy to cheat the revenue. They all had diplomatic privileges, but these were waived by the Government of Gambia, and they now face deportation after their spells in prison. Fellow workers Veerahia Ramarajaha, 54, Audrey Leeward, 49, and Hasaintu Noah, 60, were also convicted of aiding the tax fraud and jailed, but none had diplomatic privileges. The racket became so successful queues were seen for the tobacco outside the Diplomatic Mission (left with Gambian flag) which is in one of London's most expensive streets in Kensington, in south west London . Judge Michael Gledhill QC said the four diplomats 'breached the trust' of the British and Gambian people. He said: 'In any view this was a substantial fraud on the public purse and the losers are every citizen of this country. 'Each of you say you were trying simply to help you fellow Gambians. In my judgement that is not just nonsense, it is a downright lie. 'Each of you made a substantial profit - this was your business. Dozens of boxes of tobacco were found in the Gambian Embassy which at times resembled a 'warehouse' 'As you felt increasingly confident the orders placed by you in your own names and others connected to the Mission increased dramatically.' Judge Gledhill said they ordered so much tobacco in such an obvious way that the only conclusion was that they believed they would never be caught. 'The quantities of tobacco ordered meant that at times the Mission must have looked like a wholesale warehouse, added the judge. The tobacco racket became so successful and in such demand that suppliers could not keep up with orders . The Government of Gambia waived the diplomatic privileges of the four so they could be investigated and scores of crates of tobacco, which had been ordered using tax exemption privileges, were found . 'There is no doubt in my mind that this was a dishonest business operated on an increasingly large scale.' He said the four diplomats had committed 'significant breaches of trust' given to them by the British and Gambian governments. 'First, you have breached the trust of the President and people of Gambia,' added Judge Gledhill. 'You were each sent to London to represent your country and you were certainly expected, as diplomats, to maintain the highest possible standards of integrity and honesty. Diplomatic immunity has existed for more than 50 years and is agreed on by almost every country in the world, even those with frosty international relations such as North Korea. It was signed into law under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to ensure diplomats can represent their nation without being harassed by their hosts. This is particularly essential in countries which criminalise behaviour which would be perfectly acceptable at home, and those which prosecute people for political reasons. But there have been abuses of the system - including the fact that diplomats do not have to pay parking fines. More than £60million of London's congestion charge fines have been avoided by embassies, Foreign Secretary William Hague revealed last year, including £7million by U.S. diplomats alone. It is extremely rare for immunity to be waived, and it can only happen with the agreement of the diplomat's home country. Some nations refuse on principle, while most reserve the measure only for serious crimes. In 2002 Colombia waived diplomatic immunity on a London-based official who was accused of killing a mugger. He was later found not guilty of manslaughter and murder. 'Second, the UK was entitled to expect that you would respect and comply with the laws of this country. You have breached that trust as well.' Fellow embassy workers Veerahia Ramarajaha, 54, Audrey Leeward, 49, and Hasaintu Noah, 60, were convicted of the same offence as the four diplomats. Ramarajaha was also convicted of dealing, harbouring, concealing or carrying dutiable goods. They were all jailed for three years each. The court heard the convictions are a 'tremendous fall from grace' for the diplomats. Bojang's family is in thousands of pounds of debt and face eviction, while his wife works on the checkout at Tesco, the court was told. Defence lawyers said the diplomats face severe 'consequences' if they were deported back to Gambia after their prison sentences. Dean Armstrong, representing Bojang, said: 'There is a likelihood that an ability to return to Gambia will be fraught with very serious consequences. 'There is at least a regime which gives tough penalties to those who transgress.' Eighth defendant Ida Jeng Njie, who worked in the same building for the Gambian Tourist Authority, was found not guilty of conspiracy to cheat the revenue. The Diplomatic Mission is now officially known as the Gambian Embassy after the West African nation left the Commonwealth last year. Mo Dampha, Solictor Advocate at IBB Solicitors, represented the four diplomats. Following the sentencing he said: 'My clients have accepted what they see as a harsh sentence for the crime that was committed under UK laws. 'However this case raises important wider international law issues, specifically in relation to diplomatic immunity and when it can and can’t be waived.'","Four Gambian diplomats jailed for selling tax-free tobacco from embassy .

"Samir Nasir was just 21 when he announced himself to his new Arsenal team-mates by taking Thierry Henry's usual seat on the France team coach and refusing to budge when the club's greatest-ever player told him to at Euro 2008. When it comes to rubbing up people the wrong way, Nasri is world-class. But when he performs like he has done in City's last three games, it is a price managers consider worth paying. Nasri, now 27, would say he's maturing. With high-profile fall-outs in the past with Sir Alex Ferguson, Didier Deschamps, Arsenal fans and French media, you'd hope so. Samir Nasri scored a stunning opener for Manchester City in their Champions League win against Roma . Nasri (passing to Karim Benzema) refused to get out of Thierry Henry's (right) seat on the France team bus . Nasri (next to Henry and Franck Ribery) has a confrontational style which won't change . Manuel Pellegrini's less confrontational style appears to suit Nasri just fine though. As City have been forced to cope without their fab four Vincent Kompany, Yaya Toure, David Silva, Sergio Aguero, Nasri is one of those who has thrived on the extra responsibility and a major reason the club have qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League and on Chelsea's shoulder at the top of the Premier League. After a poor start to the season, Nasri stepped up a gear in the 4-1 win at Sunderland, playing a central No 10 role with such creativity, Silva wasn't missed. He followed up with a man-of-the-match performance at the weekend when City beat Everton 1-0 and saved his best until Wednesday night when his wonder-strike opened the scoring in a 2-0 win in Roma which confirmed City's place among Europe's top 16 clubs. Nasri compared the goal, his first of the season. in importance with his Capital One Cup final winner against Sunderland last season. If City go on to achieve anything in Europe, it will be far more significant than that having looked down-and-out in the group stages after taking only two points from their opening four matches. 'It was a great strike, I should try it more,' smiled the Frenchman. 'In the past few weeks we have been back to our best and shown we are team. When Yaya, Kompany and Aguero are not there, I don't think any other team could do it. We have shown the world we are a big team.' 'It is always the way with City, we like to do it the hard way.' The outspoken Nasri and girlfriend Anara Atanes (pictured at a City charity event) both polarise opinion . Nasri (pictured on Wednesday) has started to consistently perform for the Premier League champions . Doing it the hard way has always been Nasri's personal experience, too. Born and raised in the tough southern French city of Marseille, he says and does what he thinks. Henry found that out when Nasri joined Arsenal. So did Arsene Wenger when Nasri decided to leave the club, so did Ferguson who was convinced Nasri would sign for Manchester United until they were gazumped by City. A return of 23 goals in 144 games for City is not a high enough return for someone of the Frenchman's talent. The Frenchman's slipped ball through to Sergio Aguero at Sunderland showed his immense vision on the ball . Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini's cool attitude has helped Nasri rediscover his form . But the way he has stepped in for Silva has been stunning, to the extent that Pellegrini can't leave him out now. His slide-rule pass for Aguero's second goal against Sunderland underlined his vision. His performance as a second striker behind Aguero against Everton showed his versatility. And his goal in Rome proves he can hit a ball when he wants to. His rising shot from an angle couldn't have been better placed as it crashed in via the inside of the post. You'll never be able to take the controversy away from Nasri, whether it's swearing at the French media in a mixed zone at Euro 2012 or telling Arsenal fans they are 'stupid' to boo him because players don't feel the same loyalty to clubs as supporters. Only this week, Nasri – who signed a five-year contract in the summer – warned he wouldn't stick around at City if the club didn't see him as an important part of their plans. Given his recent form, there's not much chance of that.","Samir Nasri scored in Manchester City's win against Roma on Wednesday .

"Christmas came early for a four-year-old boy obsessed by trucks, when UPS decided to reunite him with his favorite driver and give him a truck of his own. Carson Kight of Colorado Springs, Colorado, would always look forward to seeing his local UPS delivery man, Ernest Lagasca, who would make deliveries in his neighborhood. 'When I first started off he wouldn’t even come out of the house, he would just look at the truck from inside the window… he loved trucks in general, but for some reason the UPS truck really captivated him. He’s just intrigued by it,’ said Lagasca, who Carson calls Mr Ernie.

Carson then made deliveries to his neighbors' homes in his brand new battery-powered truck with the help of a home-made map. The truck should go some way to making up for the fact that Lagasca was transferred to a different route and therefore no longer sees Carson as often. Speaking to local TV station KRDO, Lagasca said: ‘He used to brighten my day. And it was right in the middle of my day where I kind of needed a little bit of a pick-up.’ For Lagasca though, who has worked at UPS for over 25 years, the new route helps as it involves more driving and less heavy-lifting. The two were reunited when UPS arranged for Carson to come to the depot and meet the whole fleet of drivers, who had heard all about the boy from Lagasca. ‘It's every dad's dream to see your son be part of a team, and not just in football, but in life,’ Carson’s father Jim Kight told KRDO. ‘For every one of them, they're making 10,000 Christmases happen or holidays happen for us,’ said Kight.

"Inside Edition host Deborah Norville says she will be 'stunned and outraged' if New York State authorities do not prosecute the doctors whose actions led to the death of her close friend Joan Rivers. Deborah, 56, spoke out as Joan's daughter Melissa prepares to sue the clinic where the comic suffered a heart attack that led to her death following a routine endoscopy - and the doctors who treated her. In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Deborah said: 'There are two legal issues, there is Melissa’s civil suit, but I will be stunned and outraged if the State of New York does not instigate criminal proceedings against some of the medical professionals involved. You cannot tell me what has been reported on is not criminal behavior. It shouldn't have happened.' Scroll down for video . Close: Joan Rivers and Deborah Norville. The Inside Edition host says: 'Joan just made people better' Memories: Joan Rivers, Deborah Norville and her husband Karl Wellner (bottom right) enjoyed a hot air balloon ride in France - and crash landed, prompting Joan to state: 'Oh my God - I think I lost the baby!' Joan Rivers' will was filed in Manhattan court on Tuesday, and reveals she left her fortune behind to her family, friends and several charities. Pictured above in October 2009 . This Christmas, Joan will be firmly on Deborah's mind. 'We have an annual Christmas dinner at a famous restaurant in New York and this year we're having a big debate, do we leave one empty seat?', she muses, before firmly deciding: 'I think we do.' Joan died aged 81 on September 4 after slipping into a coma while undergoing routine throat surgery at Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic on Manhattan's Upper East Side. A state report says the clinic and Joan's doctors, believed to be her personal physician, Dr Gwen Korovin, and gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, who served as the clinic's medical director,  failed to identify her deteriorating vital signs during the routine procedure. Dr Korovin was allegedly allowed to operate when she did not have the authority to practice at the clinic, while one of the doctors took a photo of Joan while she was under anesthesia on the operating table, it was reported. But Deborah chooses to dwell on the positive, including the outpouring of love for Joan following her death - and the massive crowd that flocked to her funeral at Temple Emanu-El in New York City on September 7. The TV host - who next year will celebrate her 20th anniversary on Inside Edition - gave a bawdy eulogy at Joan's funeral that included tales of how the comedy legend once scattered the ashes of a good friend at Buckingham Palace - and then proceeded to crow about it to Prince Charles. Catching herself as she refers to Joan in the present tense ('I still do that', she says), Deborah adds: 'I don't think Joan would have allowed herself to imagine that she was held in such high and wide regard, she knew that people loved her and she loved her fans, but I think she would have been blown away with all the outpouring. 'I remember when we left the synagogue, it was a beautiful sunny day and the Emerald Society police band were marching up and down 5th Avenue and from the police barricade to the wall people were jammed in. 'I thought 'Oh My God, Joan would love this'.' Reminiscing about the funeral service, Deborah said: 'I think the rabbi has probably converted to something else by now! 'It started with the gay men's chorus, then Cindy Adams saying the F Word, then Howard Stern saying Joan had a dry vagina, I was worried about my eulogy, but I leaned over and said to my husband 'we're good to go'. 'There was an Irish Catholic band playing, it was totally Joan, totally Joan.' Joan nicknamed Deborah and her husband Karl Wellner 'Ken and Barbie'. 'I never signed my name Deborah, always 'Barbie', Deborah says: 'Joan just made people better, when you were around her you upped your game. 'What a great legacy to leave and what an inspiration for the rest of us. How much better would the world be if each of us lived in a way we hoped would make the people around us better, that's unique.' And despite the ups and downs that Joan faced during her lifetime, including the death of her beloved husband Edgar Rosenberg and losing her late night Fox show, Deborah said: 'Joan was amazingly resilient. Talk about taking the long view...whatever the story was today, whatever the situation was, however big the poop pile was, she knew if you took the long view, whatever mountains or molehills stood in your way, you'd be ok. 'Kathy Griffin and I had that exact conversation after the funeral. Joan gave excellent advice because she had lived it all. There was nothing she hadn't experienced in the entertainment business. 'She'd had every creepy boss in the world, she had people turn on her, friends turn out not to be friends. She also told me 'at any given time I have 10 balls in the air, if half hit the ground I still have a 50 per cent chance of something happening'. Now what's wrong with that advice!' Agony aunt: Deborah Norville says: 'Joan gave excellent advice - there was nothing she hadn't experienced in the entertainment business' Beloved: Joan Rivers with daughter Melissa and her grandson Cooper on Celebrity Wife Swap in May 2013 . In her will, filed in New York this week, Joan left her only child, daughter Melissa, in charge of her estimated $150 million fortune held in a trust, with provisions made for charities close to her heart. The will also briefly mentions a potential malpractice lawsuit against Yorkville Endoscopy Clinic. Asked about Melissa,  Deborah said: ‘Melissa is hanging in there, she’s a young woman, she’s got a career and thankfully she and Joan together had created some really tremendous brands, the red carpet show and Fashion Police. I know she’s out there pitching other programs.. ‘She’s a smart woman and she had the best teacher on planet earth, she’ll be fine. You never fill that hole, but she has the satisfaction of knowing her mother saw her turn out well. ‘And the other thing is that she had 40 plus years of guidance and wisdom and memories and laughs and nobody can take that away from her. But she has been robbed of another 20 years - I always thought Joan would make it till 100!' Tribute: Melissa Rivers spoke publicly for the first time since her mother's death in September at the Hollywood Reporter's Women in Entertainment Breakfast on Wednesday in Los Angeles. She said: 'If my mother were here this morning she would not only be grateful and proud but she would be beyond herself' Proud: Melissa Rivers and Sarah Silverman on Wednesday.

"NBA star Amar'e Stoudemire has revealed he's been taking red wine baths over the past six months to help rejuvenate his body. The 31-year-old, who has had long-standing problems with his knees during his career, believes the remedy has helped him recover much better after games and revitalised him. It certainly seems to have done the trick, with Stoudemire playing in three pre-season games for the New York Knicks in just four nights in the past week. Amar'e Stoudemire takes a selfie of himself taking a red wine bath to help with his knee rehabilitation . Stoudemire looks to dribble around Greg Stiemsma during the New York Knicks game against Toronto Raptors . - A beauty therapy process where the residue of wine is soaked into the skin. - Grape seeds, stems and skins contain high quantities of powerful antioxidants, minerals, pectic, sugars, tannins and vitamins, all of which are fundamental to the skin's well being. - The combination of these elements serve to fortify the skin by reducing inflammation and slowing the skin’s ageing process. - The pulp in the wine in particular has excellent exfoliating qualities and helps reduce the problems associated with ageing. When speaking to reporters after a training session on Thursday he said on the treatment: 'The red wine bath is very important to me because it allows me to create more circulation in my red blood cells. 'Plus, it's very hot, so it's like a hot tub. But it's also the red wine ... it just kind of soothes the body. 'Also, you have the ancient tub, so you have like a salt tub and a hot tub, cold plunge and a pool - and you just kind of mix it all up.' Stoudemire, entering his 13th season of his NBA career, revealed that after his last outing his body and surgically repaired knees felt great on his day off. He added: 'After doing that recovery day, my legs felt rejuvenated. I felt great, so I'm going to continue to do that for sure.' Stoudemire is currently in the final year of his contract at the Knicks but has no immediate plans to retire just yet.","Amar'e Stoudemire has just played three pre-season games in four nights .

"Graham Richardson has been a last-minute no-show on his Sky News program ‘Richo’, despite promising to use his show to respond to claims that he is ‘a person on interest’ in an Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) investigation. Throughout the day, the controversial political lobbyist and former Labor politician had been sending tweets to promote his appearance on the program. Just two hours before the program’s scheduled start time he sent a message, declaring that he would give his ‘response to Fairfax’s report linking (him) to ICAC). Yet at 8pm, his program Richo began with Peter Van Onselen at the helm, stepping into the hosting role without explanation. 'It looks like I'll be doing the rest of the show,' said Onselen, who had just finished hosting the lead-in program, 'PVO News Hour'. Five days ago, Fairfax media published a report accusing Richardson of being ‘embroiled in a potentially explosive investigation’ by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. Graham Richardson has been a last-minute no-show on his Sky News program ‘Richo’, despite promising to use his show to respond to claims that he is ‘a person on interest’ in an Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) investigation . Just two hours before the program began, Graham Richardson had promised that he would respond to allegations that he is being investigated by ICAC . It’s alleged that Richardson was a lobbyist in a questionable property deal, after the anti-corruption body were made aware of a string of emails, sent between 2004 and 2010, reportedly exposed by the NSW ALP. The contents of the emails or specific details of the alleged investigation are yet to be revealed. 'Graham was taken ill. These things happened. He didn't come into the studio,' said a Sky News spokesperson. His no-show comes three months after the Australian political personality made a sudden exit while hosting the live broadcast of his Sky News show. When the Richo  program returned from an ad break, the 64-year-old, who is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment, had been replaced by Sky News host Vanessa Grimm. The host explained Richardson was not feeling well and a spokesperson for the network confirmed to Daily Mail Australia his sudden disappearance was due to illness. 'As most people are aware Richo is undergoing treatment. This evening during the show he had a turn. He is okay and will be back next week,' the statement said. The former Labor powerbroker has suffered from chondrosarcoma - a condition that sees the victim plagued with cancerous cysts -  for more than 15 years, and began a new experimental form of chemotherapy earlier this year. The 64-year-old is currently undergoing experimental chemotherapy treatment for a rare condition called chondrosarcoma, which sees his pelvic region plagued with cancerous cysts . 'These things won’t kill me but the condition is rare so it’s time to look at new treatment,' he told the Daily Telegraph in February. 'The drugs are experimental. I’ll be the 13th person in the country to have tried them.' The former New South Wales senator said he wasn't concerned about the treatment interfering with his job hosting the Sky program. 'I may not look the best, but I should still be able to do my shows.' Richardson has had several operations on the cysts, which are located in his pelvic region. A spokesperson for Sky News said Richardson has taken 'a turn' during the program but 'he is okay'","Graham Richardson was a last minute no-show for his hosting role on Richo .

"A police officer throttled his girlfriend and kicked her in the stomach after flying into a drunken rage because he left £30 in a cashpoint, a court heard. James Vosper, 41, who serves with Gloucestershire Constabulary, allegedly started drinking heavily after realising his mistake and texted partner Melissa Mustoe that 'everything has gone to rat s***'. He continued drinking for nearly two hours until mother-of-two Miss Mustoe arrived home and they rowed about how much he had consumed - before Vosper launched himself at her, it was claimed. HQ: James Vosper, 41, who serves with Gloucestershire Constabulary (pictured) allegedly started drinking heavily after realising his mistake and texted partner Melissa Mustoe that 'everything has gone to rat s***' He grabbed Miss Mustoe around the throat and forced her onto the sofa, then she frantically dialled 999 and he kicked her in the stomach as she was on the phone to his colleagues, the court was told. Miss Mustoe allegedly managed to escape his clutches and lock him out of the house in Abbeymead, Gloucestershire, and remained on the phone for 40 minutes until police arrived and arrested him. Ian Jackson, prosecuting, told Bristol Magistrates' Court: ‘He wrapped around her neck and pinned her to the sofa with one hand. She was unable to breathe. ‘Having released her he then kicked her in the stomach while she was on the phone to police.’ He added: ‘During the course of the 999 call you can hear part of the alleged assault actually taking place - you can hear her reaction. ‘Very shortly in, about four or five minutes you hear her exclaim she has just been kicked in the stomach by Mr Vosper.’ He said when police arrived at the house they noted a number of marks on Miss Mustoe’s neck and face. Vosper denies assault by beating at the couple's home on December 11 last year. He told police: ‘I came home, she went mad, I just wanted to go to bed, she gave me a slap.’  Vosper claims she attacked him and he was only acting in self-defence. But Miss Mustoe said her partner was in a bad mood because of the cashpoint incident and after returning home she expressed concerns about how much he had drunk. Trial: Bristol Magistrates' Court was told Miss Mustoe dialled 999 and Vosper kicked her in the stomach . Mr Jackson said: ‘She also indicates she had reason to believe he was not in the best of moods. ‘He had sent her a text earlier in the day because he had been out shopping buying three bottles of wine and some desserts for his daughters, and he had asked for cashback from the self-service till. ‘He had wandered away before collecting the cash and when he went back to get it, it had gone - someone had taken it. The text seems quite angry - he says “everything has gone to rat s***”. He seems to be quite angry about it.’ 'He wrapped around her neck and pinned her to the sofa with one hand. She was unable to breathe. Having released her he then kicked her in the stomach while she was on the phone to police' Ian Jackson, prosecuting . He added that in the text at 6.45pm he said: ‘Well I'm well f*** off, everything has gone to rat s***. That's £30, I don't believe it, I'm close to f****** losing it.’ Miss Mustoe replied and told Vosper not to worry about the money but when she returned home around 8.30pm a fight allegedly broke out. She rang emergency services at 11.15pm claiming to have been assaulted by her partner and asking for protection. During the call Vosper could be heard repeatedly demanding entry to the house and she told the operator she had locked him out because she 'needed to be safe'. The court heard that Vosper was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following an incident at work where he was given six months off to recover. He admitted to investigating officers he had begun to drink heavily through that period but strongly denied having an alcohol problem. The trial continues.

"A coroner has resigned after being barred from crime scenes and touching dead bodies because he stuck his fingers into the head wound of a shooting victim, authorities revealed. Coroner Terry Jarnigan, of Cocke County, Tennessee, was barred by a judge on Monday from disturbing or touching dead bodies, touching evidence or attending crime scenes. Jarnigan reportedly went Newport Medical Center on November 2 to determine whether a 39-year-old victim, who was found with a gunshot wound to the head, committed suicide or was a homicide. The corner stuck two fingers into a bullet exit wound on the victim's head and on realizing he had brain matter on his fingers, put it back into the wound and made a remark 'Oh, brains', according to a police affidavit. Coroner Terry Jarnigan reportedly went Newport Medical Center (pictured) on November 2 to assist in a death investigation and contaminate a victim's gunshot wound by sticking his fingers in it . A detective, Paula Wilson, was at the hospital to take forensic photos for the investigation, according to the affidavit seen by 10 News. Wilson said that Jarnigan was 'twisting his finger around' in the head wound. Investigators typically try not to contaminate bodies because it can damage potential evidence. Deputy DA General Brownlow Marsh alleged on November 19 that Jarnigan had contaminated evidence at other crime scenes after showing up uninvited. Jarnigan resigned on Tuesday, effective immediately. In 1977, Jarnigan, then known as Terry Lackey, was convicted of felonies including 'willful injury by explosives' and arson and detonation of explosives with intent to harm a person. He had his citizenship rights restored in 2002 after a court decided that he had 'the character of a person of honesty, integrity, respectability and veracity'. Don and Annette Heitman (pictured with their son Alex) have called for the investigation into his death to be reopened after the coroner who oversaw the scene resigned for mishandling of bodies and investigations . On Wednesday, a family whose son's death investigation was overseen by Coroner Jarnigan have called for Cocke County authorities to reopen the investigation into his death. Alex Heitman, 29, was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head in July 2011 in a remote part of Cocke County, 70 miles from his home in Knoxville. Mr Heitman, a business supervisor at Oak Ridge Schools, had moved to Tennessee in 2008 with his new wife Kristie. She was eight months' pregnant at the time of his death. His parents, Don and Annette Heitman, from Wisconsin, remain unconvinced of the official verdict of suicide. They have repeatedly asked that Alex's death be re-examined by authorities who have offered the family little cooperation. The Heitmans recently hired retired Assistant U.S. Attorney Hugh B. Ward Jr to represent them and obtained the assistance of Oak Ridge City Councilwoman Trina Baughn, to act as their Tennessee proxy. Ms Baughn told MailOnline in a statement on Thursday that according to 911 audio files and logs, Jarnigan supervised the scene of Alex Heitman's death for five hours. However, there exists no evidence that even a basic investigation took place. No fingerprints, ballistics, coroner’s report, police report or credible crime scene photos were ever discovered to have been taken. People who lived near the scene found evidence that had been left behind the following day, Ms Baughn said. According the Heitman family, this included portions of Alex’s brain matter and a shotgun shell casing. Ms Baughn said on Thursday: 'My heart aches for this family and I am willing to do whatever I can to help them find the answers they seek.' In a statement this week, the Heitmans said: 'We have exhausted tremendous time and financial resources over the last 3½ years with little cooperation from local authorities. 'It is our hope that with Mr. Ward’s help and that of Oak Ridge City Councilwoman Trina Baughn as our Tennessee resident proxy, we will finally obtain the answers we need to find closure and move on from the devastating loss of our beloved son.'","Coroner Terry Jarnigan, of Cocke County, Tennessee, was barred on Monday from touching dead bodies or attending crime scenes .

"The Harvard Business School instructor who blasted a Boston-area Chinese restaurant for overcharging him by $4 on a takeout order has apologized. Associate professor Benjamin Edelman complained to the owners the of Sichuan Garden in Brookline after he was charged $1 more on each of the four items he ordered for takeout recently. Ran Duan, the son of the restaurant's owner, acknowledged the prices listed on its website were out of date and promised to update them soon. Angry emailer: Ben Edelman, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard, has unleashed a string of angry and threatening emails to Sichuan Garden, claiming they overcharged him $4 and it was illegal . But Edelman demanded a $12 refund, citing state law. He also contacted local officials to demand the restaurant compensate all other customers who might have been affected. On Tuesday, Edelman posted a message on his personal website admitting that his lengthy emails with Duan were 'out of line' and that he has reached out to the restaurant to apologize. 'Having reflected on my interaction with Ran, including what I said and how I said it, it’s clear that I was very much out of line,' wrote Edelman on his website. 'I aspire to act with great respect and humility in dealing with others, no matter what the situation. Clearly I failed to do so. I am sorry, and I intend to do better in the future.' EdeIman said he had also reached out to the owner to apologize to him personally as well. Duan said he has been overwhelmed by the support he has received from people as far afield as Australia offering donations and support with his website and legal advice. Apologetic: Ran Duan, the son of the restaurant's owners who manages The Baldwin Bar, located inside the Woburn location of Sichuan Garden, responded to Edelman in a courteous way . 'I just want to make clear that we are not a business in financial distress. We have been blessed with the support of our amazing community and hospitality family that has understood the value of a hard working family. Your support and kind words are more then enough,' he wrote. Duan said he had also increased an increase in business as a result of the publicity that the story had generated and that he had received 'overwhelming' support from Harvard graduates and the student body. 'I believe that one man’s actions should not be the burden of another. I just want to apologize to Harvard for all the negative association they have been linked with this ordeal. I also believe that something good can come out of all this situation,' he wrote. Duan manages The Baldwin Bar, located inside the Woburn location of Sichuan Garden, a Chinese restaurant founded by his parents and appeared in a recent issue of GQ hailed as 'America's Most Imaginative Bartender'. The incident began on Friday when Edelman ordered $53.53 worth of takeout from the restaurant and was shocked when the bill was $4 more than he had added up using the online menu. He emailed the restaurant, who admitted that their website was 'out of date' and that the prices of each dish had gone up about $1, causing the Harvard Business School professor to send a barrage of threatening emails that were made public by Boston.com. Scene: Edelman had ordered takeout from the Sichuan Garden in Brookline (pictured) 'Under Massachusetts law it turns out to be a serious violation to advertise one price and charge a different price,' Edelman wrote. 'I urge you to cease this practice immediately. 'In the interim, I suggest that Sichuan Garden refund me three times the amount of the overcharge. 'The tripling reflects the approach provided under the Massachusetts consumer protection statute, MGL 93a, wherein consumers broadly receive triple damages for certain intentional violations. 'Please refund the $12 to my credit card. Or you could mail a check for $12 to my home.' Edelman recieved an apologetic reply about an hour later from Duan. 'We are a mom and pop restaurant and we pride ourselves on hard work and authentic Sichuan cuisine,' Duan wrote. 'I will honor the website price and honor you the $3.00.' However this only seemed to infuriate Edelman further. Not happy: After initally going to great lengths to get the restaurant to credit him $12 over the so-called mishap, Edelman has now apologized profusely for his bullying behavior . 'It strikes me that merely providing a refund to a single customer would be an extremely light sanction for the violation that has occurred,' Edelman wrote back. 'To wit, your restaurant overcharged all customers who viewed the website and placed a telephone order – the standard and typical way to order takeout. 'You did so knowingly, knowing that your website was out of date. 'You don't seem to recognize that this is a legal matter and calls for a more thoughtful and far-reaching resolution. 'Nor do you recognize the principle, well established in applicable laws, that when a business intentionally overcharges a customer, the business should suffer a penalty larger than the amount of the overcharge.' Duan responded with an obvious question: 'You seem like a smart man. But is this really worth your time?' Again, Edelman came back firing. 'You're right that I have better things to do,' Edelman's replied. Popular: Duan was featured in GQ magazine last month and hailed as 'America's most imaginative bartender' 'If you had responded appropriately to my initial message – providing the refund I requested with a genuine and forthright apology – that could have been the end of it. 'The more you try to claim your restaurant was not at fault, the more determined I am to seek a greater sanction against you.' Edelman 'passed the matter on to the authorities' in Brookline. Duan wrote back: 'Once again thank you for bringing it to my attention, I will wait for proper authorities to direct me on how to resolve this situation. 'Once they direct me on how to resolve this situation with you, we will be able to honor the price that they advise me on. 'I will make a note that you seek out 50 percent off your total meal bill. 'I have no issues with honoring 50 percent off your total bill if the authorities see fit. 'I hope you understand I want to go through the proper channels so we can resolve this properly. 'I will keep you updated as soon as they contact me.' According to Boston.com, besides Harvard, Edelman also operates a consulting practice that works at 'preventing and detecting online fraud (especially advertising fraud)'. His clients include Microsoft, the NFL, the New York Times, and Universal Music. Edelman sent a statement to Business Insider saying he believes how he handled the situation with Sichuan Garden was helping other people as well. 'We all rely on trust in our daily lives, that when sales tax is added, it actually applies and equals the specified amount; that the meter in a taxi shows the correct amount provided by law and correctly measures the actual distance; that when you order takeout, the price you see online matches the amount you pay in the restaurant,' he told the website. 'We all take most of this for granted.'","Ben Edelman, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard, posted his apology on his website on Wednesday .

"Internal affairs investigators from the New York Police Department have questioned officer Daniel Pantaleo for two hours in the chokehold death of Eric Garner. Pantaleo was cleared last week of criminal charges after a Staten Island, New York, grand jury declined to indict him. But now the NYPD is beginning its own investigation over whether Pantaleo broke departmental rules when he arrested Garner on July 17 for illegally selling cigarettes on the street, according to DNA Info. Scroll down for video . Daniel Pantaleo was questioned for two hours by the NYPD's internal affair bureau on Monday about the death of Eric Garner . Dying: Eric Garner lost consciousness after he was put into an alleged chokehold by Pantaleo in July. He later died at a hospital . In amateur video taken of the arrest, Pantaleo appeared to put Garner in a chokehold before forcing him to the ground holding him down while he was being cuffed. Garner, a father of six, passed after exclaiming 'I can't breathe!' He then died after being taken to the hospital. His last words became a rallying cry for thousands of protesters who took to the streets in New York and other cities after Pantaleo was not indicted. Chokeholds are banned by the NYPD, though Pantaleo denies using one on Garner - despite video evidence that has been widely interpreted otherwise. The medical examiner found that Garner, who was 6-foot-3 and 350lbs, died of a Heart attack resulting from compression of neck and of chest and 'prone positioning during physical restraint by police' resulted in his death. However, his asthma, obesity and other health problems were also blamed for his death. Garner, who was 6-foot-3 and 350lbs, died from neck and chest compression and being forced to lay on the ground during his arrest, a medical examiner found. His health problems contributed to his death . Investigators with the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau questioned Pantaleo for two hours on Monday, according to DNA Info. 'He pretty much told the same story he did to the grand jury, his actions, his thoughts, during the Garner encounter,' a police source told the news site. The 29-year-old cop has been pulled off the streets and stripped of his badge and gun pending the outcome of the investigation. He still works at the NYPD on desk duty. The investigation will likely take weeks, or even months, to conclude.","The NYPD Internal Affair Bureau has began its own investigation into whether Daniel Pantaleo broke department protocol .
