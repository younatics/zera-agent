"Washington (CNN) -- The FBI says it has launched an investigation into the discovery of sewing needles in four turkey sandwiches on separate Delta Air Lines flights from Amsterdam to the United States. The objects were discovered in food on planes as they were en route Sunday from Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands to Minneapolis, Seattle and two flights to Atlanta, according to Delta spokeswoman Kristin Baur. Two of the needles were found by passengers, she said, at which point Delta told all 18 flights from Amsterdam to stop serving the sandwiches. Unsavory truths about airplane food . Two more needles were discovered, including one found by a federal air marshal. One passenger on the plane going to Minneapolis was injured by the needle but declined medical treatment upon landing, according to Baur. Federal agents have begun a criminal investigation, said Special Agent Stephen Emmett, an FBI spokesman in Atlanta. Gate Gourmet, which provided prepared sandwiches to Delta, said the sandwiches originated at the firm's facility in Amsterdam. The company has been in business since 1992. ""This is a terribly upsetting situation,"" said Gate Gourmet spokeswoman Christina Ulosevich. ""First and foremost is the safety of the traveling public. There's nothing more important to us at all than the safety of the passengers and crews."" Delta is now serving sealed prepackaged food on these flights instead of the sandwiches, and no other needles have been found, Baur said. Airline drops salads from flights in food scare . The Transportation Security Administration says it notified all U.S. airlines with flights from Schiphol to the United States of the findings. ""TSA continues to closely monitor the review of the incidents as well as the security protocols being conducted by the air carrier and the airport authority,"" spokesman David Castelveter said. ""Delta requires all its in-flight caterers to adhere to strict criteria in order to offer our customers the very best onboard meals,"" Baur told CNN in a statement. ""The safety and security of our passengers and crew is Delta's number one priority."" Delta says it has been in contact with the FBI, authorities in the Netherlands and Gate Gourmet and is fully cooperating with them in this investigation. Why air travel snacks matter . Asked whether Gate Gourmet had taken any job action against any employee, Ulosevich said, ""We don't have any comment. It's part of an active investigation."" ""We are absolutely cooperating fully with federal and local authorities who are involved, and concurrent with that, we'll be conducting our own full-scale investigation."" Ulosevich said the company provides food to other airlines, ""but we have received no other reports"" of tampered products from other customers.

"(CNN) -- The man who allegedly lit an explosive on board a U.S.-bound international flight deserves none of the constitutional protections afforded American citizens, a former top Bush administration official said Monday. Tom Ridge, who served as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security from 2003 to 2005, made the comments on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""I take a look at this individual who has been charged criminally, does that mean he gets his Miranda warnings? The only information we get is if he volunteers it?"" Ridge said. ""He's not a citizen of this country. He's a terrorist, and I don't think he deserves the full range of protections of our criminal justice system embodied in the Constitution of the United States."" Ridge also said he was ""not surprised"" about reports that two former detainees in the detention center at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, had joined up with the group that claimed responsibility for Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab's failed terrorist attack. ""It's a symptom of a larger challenge that this country has, and that's how do you adjudicate these individuals that we pick up from these places and make a determination if they should be incarcerated for a long time, if not permanently,"" he said. Muhamad Attik al-Harbi, also known as Muhamad al-Awfi, and Said Ali Shari were released to Saudi Arabia in 2007 by the Bush administration. The two went through a ""rehabilitation"" program in Saudi Arabia but returned to the militants. U.S. officials, however, cautioned that the two could not be connected with Friday's attack. Ridge told King that the country is ""clearly ... safer, but it's equally clear, given the several incidents that have occurred in the last couple of months in this country, that we still have very serious gaps in information-sharing."" ""What are we going to do to make sure more information, particularly with that kind of information that sends warning signals out, gets to the people that can act on it?"" he said. ""Whether you're in the battlefield in Iraq or Afghanistan or a screener at the airport, you need actionable information. I'm not sure all this information was in the hands of TSA at the time."" Ridge also questioned why the State Department did not revoke AbdulMutallab's visa upon learning that his father had reported his son might have terrorist connections. ""Why the State Department didn't revoke his visa immediately is beyond belief, in my judgment,"" he said. ""But at the heart of this, it's a clash of cultures and institutional challenge. [The Department of Homeland Security] can only act on information it has, and they didn't have all the information at its disposal."" The former secretary was less critical of current Secretary Janet Napolitano than many other Republicans for comments she made praising the way some protocols had worked. ""I don't think any right-thinking person actually believed that Secretary Napolitano thought the system worked,"" he said. ""Obviously, it was flawed. I think what she was referring to was that after the incident occurred, there are certain procedures and protocols to put in place. That worked smoothly.""","Tom Ridge, secretary of homeland security 2003-05, appears on ""Larry King Live""

"Slovyansk, Ukraine (CNN) -- CNN's Nick Paton Walsh and his team traveled to Slovyansk, in the north of the Donetsk region, on April 26. He has filed daily reports from the area as the crisis in eastern Ukraine unfolds. This is their journey throughout the week. On Saturday, April 26, the team went to the funeral of Alexander Lubenets, a young man who was killed at a separatist checkpoint at Kombikormovyi on the outskirts of Slovyansk. There was grief and anger at the central government in Kiev, which people say has turned against them. April 27 . The team attended a bizarre news conference given -- under duress -- by captured military observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the self-appointed mayor of Slovyansk, Vyacheslav Ponomarev. The military observers would end up being held for more than a week, before they were freed with the intervention of an envoy of Vladimir Putin. April 28 . The team traveled south of Slovyansk to the town of Kostyantinivka after reports that separatists had launched their latest move there. By now, the takeover of key buildings by pro-Russian militia has developed a familiar, smooth routine. Locals now come out to have their photos taken with the gunmen. April 29 . The team followed up the story of Alexander Lubenets, talking to his father, a former Soviet soldier, in the nearby village of Khrestysche. ""We are all fighting for our land,"" the father said. On the other side of this conflict, there are gruesome deaths, too. Three bodies found dumped in a river -- all three, investigators say, bear torture marks from knives. April 30 . The team talked to the men controlling the checkpoint at Kombikormovyi, where Lubenets was killed. Early that morning, the men had seen Ukrainian armor roll toward them again, only to pull back. At another checkpoint not far away, the team saw heavier armed new arrivals for the first time. Their equipment was closer to what they had seen the previous month in Crimea. At this stage, more than a week after Kiev had promised a stepped-up campaign against the separatists, the team has seen little evidence of it. May 1 . The separatists now running Slovyansk seem to have firmed up plans to hold a referendum, which could pave the way for the eastern regions to break away from Ukraine. Inside the local Communist Party offices, under the gaze of Comrade Lenin, a local party official said she is preparing voter lists ahead of the poll. The team also returned to the checkpoint at Kombikormovyi, where they found that the militia is pulling back in anticipation of another Ukrainian advance. May 2 . Ukrainian troops made their first serious move to reassert control over Slovyansk. Paton Walsh reported from the outlying village of Andreevka, where Ukrainian APCs found their way blocked by angry locals waving flags of the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic. The team also saw discarded shoulder-held missile launchers, of the type suspected of bringing down two Ukrainian helicopters earlier in the day. May 3 . The team reported from Kramatorsk, to the south of Slovyansk. Early morning reports suggest that the Ukrainians have moved in. Announcements coming from Kiev claimed that a number of key locations have been regained from separatists. Though it is clear that Ukrainian forces have passed through the town, the team found no evidence of a sustained presence there. They did, however, hear rare voices of disdain for the actions of the pro-Russian forces.",CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reports on the unfolding crisis in Ukraine .
"(CNN) -- The U.S. State Department has broadened its travel warning for Mexico, advising citizens to avoid certain areas and steer clear of driving at night. The new alert, issued late last week, urges Americans to defer nonessential travel in regions where drug-related violence has surged, including the border state of Tamaulipas and the central state of Michoacan. It also warns against nonessential travel in parts of eight other states, significantly expanding the scope of an alert issued in September. ""There's pretty much no state that hasn't been touched by this. ... We've seen some major, high-value cartel targets that have been taken down by the Mexican government, but that doesn't appear to have quelled a lot of the violence,"" said Fred Burton, vice president of the Stratfor global intelligence agency. ""We see no short-term end in sight."" The State Department notes that millions of U.S. citizens safely visit Mexico every year. But it also says Mexico's ongoing violence and security concerns pose ""serious risks"" for U.S. citizens, and urges travelers to take precautions. ""To reduce risk, you are strongly urged to travel only during daylight hours throughout Mexico, to avoid isolated roads and to use toll roads whenever possible,"" the advisory says. Americans with connections to Mexico had mixed reactions to the latest assessment of travel south of the border. Friday's warning was ""a major red flag"" and ""quite a bit more expansive"" than past alerts, said Kathleen Fairfax, vice president for global education at Arizona State University. ""We don't have armored cars like the government does,"" said Fairfax, who noted that school officials will meet this week to discuss how the new guidelines might affect study-abroad trips. But reports of violence can be overblown, the leader of an expatriate group in Mexico said, describing his trip last month to a butterfly sanctuary in Michoacan, a stronghold of Mexico's La Familia cartel. ""I felt totally safe there. We had no problem at all. You have to be mindful of what's going on, but there aren't people attacking anybody, especially expats,"" Howard Feldstein said. The 69-year-old retired small-business owner from Denver, Colorado, heads the Lake Chapala Society, an expatriate community center in the Mexican state of Jalisco with more than 3,000 members. The country remains a ""great place to retire,"" he said, despite security concerns. ""Life goes on. The people that live here do not live in fear of moving around freely. We're just, perhaps, more cautious,"" he said. Mexico's government has not issued an official response to the latest U.S. alert. Tourism officials have repeatedly stressed that violence occurs mostly in areas along the border that are far from Mexico's popular landmarks and beaches. ""We should not take the issue out of context,"" Rodolfo Lopez Negrete, chief operating officer of the Mexico Tourism Board, said in a recent interview. ""The distances are very, very great. You wouldn't stop going to New York because of a problem in Dallas."" But Burton, of Stratfor, said the latest U.S. State Department alert shows ""the unpredictability of where this violence could happen next."" ""The fear is that as you are traveling the highways inside Mexico, that you could be victimized in some sort of roving roadblock,"" he said. Blocking major thoroughfares to prevent police and military reinforcements from arriving has become an increasingly common tactic employed by drug gangs across Mexico. The State Department advisory warns of carjacking and highway robberies and notes, ""Violence along Mexican roads and highways is a particular concern in the northern border region."" Drug cartel members blocked roads with hijacked vehicles in the border states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas over two days in March. During clashes with federal police in December, suspected members of La Familia set trucks and buses ablaze on highways in Michoacan. Mexican government figures indicate more than 34,600 people have been killed in drug-related violence in Mexico since President Felipe Calderon announced a crackdown on cartels in December 2006. The number of U.S. citizens killed in Mexico increased from 35 in 2007 to 111 in 2010, the State Department said. More than a third of the 2010 reported slayings of U.S. citizens occurred in the border cities of Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana, according to the State Department. ""There is no evidence that U.S. tourists have been targeted by criminal elements due to their citizenship. Nonetheless, while in Mexico you should be aware of your surroundings at all times and exercise particular caution in unfamiliar areas,"" the alert says. Friday's warning also specifies dangers and advises against nonessential travel in parts of the states of Durango, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Jalisco, San Luis Potosi, Sinaloa, Sonora and Zacatecas. Travelers should exercise caution visiting parts of Baja California, Guerrero, Nayarit and Nuevo Leon, the advisory says. CNN's Rafael Romo contributed to this report.","The alert singles out some Mexican states and warns U.S. citizens to drive during daylight .

"(CNN) -- Having lived and breathed Plastiki for the last two and a half years, I finally stepped aboard her for the final leg to Australia. My first day was thankfully uneventful; some steering, a game of Bananagrams, plenty of dozing and just a little hide and seek with some nausea. But at sea it is the night that ushers in the sublime; a sky ablaze with burning bright stars, twenty or more tumbling gracefully into oblivion. A small slither of a smiley moon, barely concealing the bright promise that lies beneath. A huge billowing turret of a cloud, host to a lightning show so brilliant that it casts momentary shadows across deck. What is ridiculous is that any of this ever happened at all. This boat; conceived, designed and built out of plastic bottles, which has sailed over 4000 miles to be here today beneath this unbelievable sky. ""It's a boat, made from plastic bottles,"" David de Rothschild said to me in December 2007. ""We've got this amazing sustainability architect, Michael Pawlyn, on board. He's done some dope drawings and we're interviewing for a naval engineer. The plan is to sail through this thing called the Great Eastern Garbage patch, doing science along the way and inspiring people to look at Waste as a Resource. We'll build it in San Fran, set sail in December (2008) and arrive into Sydney March 09."" I'm paraphrasing massively, but you get the gist. ""Cool,"" was what I remember thinking. I was working for a firm building emergency bridges in Africa and was ready for something different. This seemed different and I was in. The early days of the project revolved around meetings, phone calls and a staggering inbox of emails. We were rich in big ideas and exceptional consultants but poor in concrete ideas and real boating knowledge. The brief was very strict and has always remained so; the bottles must be the primary element of the boat ideally performing both structure and flotation. We were to use no glues, minimal fixings, minimal new components or materials. In addition it was to sustainably support a crew of six using innovative ""off grid"" life support systems. It was a hugely creative period with amazing sausage-type bottle structures and invertebrate raft ideas all on the table. The wackier most bottle-centric minimal structure designs were favored. We had a major coup early on which was the ""gassing"" of the bottles. Of great concern was stabilizing the bottles into mini structures themselves. The obvious solution seemed to be pressurizing them, but how? We variously talked about fitting bicycle valves to the caps and pumping them up, building a hyperbaric chamber to fill the bottles under pressure and finally liquid nitrogen. Knowing very little about liquid nitrogen I set off happily to BOC Gases intent on gettin' me some. The guy looked at me like I was crazy, which was something I was to get used to over the next few years. ""Er, I don't think so,"" he said. Not such a good idea. ""Dry ice on the other hand,"" he said grinning sheepishly, ""would be an excellent alternative."" And before I knew it he was shoveling crystalline, smoky powder into an Evian bottle. ""Watch this,"" he said, screwing on the cap and ejecting it into the empty parking lot. It was a Saturday morning deep in the bowels of Covent Garden Market in London, but the bang when the bottle spectacularly exploded I thought was sure to bring SWAT troops parachuting down on us. Not wishing to stick around to find out I bought all the dry ice he had and made my exit. I could hear a faint call after me: ""Make sure you keep a window open in the car..."" ""Kaboom,"" I thought as I careered out of there, windows down in the freezing February air. I was in search of somewhere quiet and secluded to do some experimenting of my own. So despite this early success with the bottles we were still a very ""un-boaty"" collection of boat designers. We were in for a rude awakening.... Andy Dovell, of Dovell Naval Architects based in Sydney came highly recommended and joined us in London in early March 2008. He came complete with a first draft design -- of a boat. ""It's a bit boat-like,"" we conferred out of earshot. ""Too much structure,"" was another comment. ""But a good starting point nevertheless,"" someone else chimed in. What Andy knew and we didn't was that boats typically look like boats and require structure. So began the taming of the shrew.","Plastiki expedition co-ordinator Matthew Grey recalls early days of the project .

"(CNN) -- Students ducked under desks and ran for cover during a shooting at a community college in Texas on Tuesday that left three people wounded. ""I just started hearing people shouting and yelling and running,"" said Amanda Vasquez, a freshman who was in English class when the shooting erupted at the North Harris campus of Lone Star College in Houston. ""I immediately tried to get under the desk, tried to hide ... ""I called my mom as soon as I could just because you never know. I didn't know if this was going to be the last time I was going to be able to speak with her. So I just wanted to make sure she knew that I loved her,"" Vasquez told CNN's AC360Â°. Officials from the Harris County Sheriff's Office are still in the initial stages of their investigation, but here is what they have said so far: . The early-afternoon shooting apparently stemmed from an argument between two men. At least one of the men was armed and at least one had a student ID. Both were wounded by gunfire and treated at a hospital, where they were detained. ""We haven't determined their exact involvement,"" said Capt. Ken Melancon. Late Tuesday night, authorities said 22-year-old Carlton Berry was a shooter. Berry, who remained hospitalized, has been charged with aggravated assault. A maintenance worker also was shot. He was struck in the leg and was in stable condition, said Richard Carpenter, chancellor of the Lone Star College System. The shooting took place outside, between the academic building and the library, he said. A possible fourth victim, a woman with a student ID who was either at or near the shooting, was treated at a hospital for medical problems. According to a federal law enforcement official who received reports from the scene, the fourth person suffered a heart attack. Lone Star College student Brittany Mobley told CNN affiliate KHOU that she saw the shooting. ""I saw two dudes basically get into an altercation and ... the dude that shot, he basically got angry and, you know, started shooting the other guy,"" she said. ""A lot of people heard a lot of shots."" The Lone Star College System is the largest institution of higher education in the Houston area, and the fastest-growing community college system in Texas, according to its website. There were more than 10,000 students on the campus at the time of the shooting, said Jed Young, a school spokesman. The campus was evacuated and closed for the remainder of Tuesday. The campus will reopen Wednesday. Police and emergency responders swarmed an entrance to the campus, aerial video from KPRC showed. Medical personnel were seen treating at least two people and moving them to ambulances. One person appeared to be handcuffed to a stretcher. Students jogged from some buildings, with their hands up in the air, presumably in response to police instruction. ""I heard no less than five shots, and I just ran,"" one student told CNN affiliate KTRK. ""My heart was pounding. I was praying I wouldn't hear anymore shots. I was with a bunch of other people running and someone yelled out, 'don't push!' People were crying, I had tears in my eyes."" Another witness told KTRK he saw blood on the ground and someone shot in the leg. ""Beside him, there was one guy in handcuffs,"" he said. ""I just heard somebody screaming, and then after that, I heard the shots,"" another student told KPRC. The Houston shooting comes roughly a month after the deadly shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school that ended with 26 people -- including 20 children ages 6 and 7 -- dead. ""We know that there is significant national dialogue regarding the frequency, unfortunately, of shootings like this on public school and college campuses,"" said Carpenter. ""Though we never expected to be a central part of this discussion, we hope that things can be learned from it."" Are you there? Share your story .

"BEIJING, China (CNN) -- China's long simmering battle against corruption has come to a boil, this time in Chongqing, the largest megalopolis in the world. A massive crackdown has implicated millionaires, gangsters, and even police officers. Known as ""dahei"" (combat triads), the campaign has put the spotlight on organized crime and how it has infested local bureaucracy and businesses through bribery, extortion, blackmail and violence. A group of defendants face sentencing this week in Chongqing on charges linked to organized crime. Criminal trials are under way following months of police investigation. Details of murky cases are trickling out. Among those on the dock is Xie Caiping, a portly woman believed be the ""mama san"" of one of Chongqing's notorious triads. Xie is accused of operating gambling dens, drug trafficking, giving and collecting bribes and terrorizing people, including policemen who had tried to investigate her illicit activities. More trials are expected as the city fights at least 14 mafia-style gangs. Given China's opaque political world, it is notable that the ongoing trial is extensively covered by the Chinese media. For years after the Cultural Revolution, Chongqing languished as a decrepit mountain-city in Sichuan province, better known for its spicy food and poor farmers carrying goods on bamboo poles. It became the world's largest city in 1997 when the central government, by administrative edict, incorporated a huge area adjacent to the city into what is now the Chongqing municipality. China's goal was to build up Chongqing into a modern mega-city that will later serve as the new economic engine in central China. Over the years, thanks of the influx of corporate investments and central government funding in infrastructure projects, the city of 31 million has become a center of an economic boom. But the economic boom has also led to the resurgence of local gangs engaged in human and drug trafficking, illegal gambling, prostitution, extortion and protection rackets. Gangsters were blamed for heinous crimes of murder and kidnapping. Local officials were accused of ""economic crimes""-- bribery, profiteering and malversation involving public funds and property. Such abuses have prompted popular anger and social unrest. Communist Party officials are under pressure to clean up or perish. ""The life or death of the party depends on whether or not we have a strong will to punish and prevent corruption,"" Chinese President Hu Jintao told a meeting of the party elite last September. Party leaders pledged to attack the ""acute problems"" of corruption, the gap between the rich and the poor, and the lack of democracy within the party's own ranks. At the meeting, they outlined an anti-corruption directive that would compel officials and their families to disclose their property holdings and investments. ""The new transparency rules are meant to curb abuse of power,"" says University of Alberta professor Wenran Jiang. ""It's also aimed at appeasing public discontent over corruption."" In Chongqing, police operations started in June, leading to the arrest of over 4,800 suspected gangsters and the confiscation of 1,700 illegal firearms. Investigations led to many city officials, including police officers. They include Wen Qiang, Xie Caiping's brother-in-law, who is now accused of colluding with gangsters. Highly regarded as an ace investigator, Wen was the deputy police commissioner and head of the city's justice bureau. Last August, he was stripped of his posts, detained and charged of accepting over 100 million yuan in bribes in exchange for giving gangs a ""protective umbrella"". Local media reports say Chongqing residents celebrated Wen's arrest by setting off firecrackers. The ""dahei"" campaign is led by Bo Xilai. 60, the city's party chief who also sits on China's ruling politburo. Son of a revolutionary veteran, Bo had served as Dalian city mayor, Liaoning provincial governor and China's minister of commerce. An outsider in Chongqing, Bo has had to bring in his trusted protégé, Wang Lijun, to replace Wen Qiang as chief of police and clean up the city. Wang made his name as a tough, upright police commissioner in Liaoning province, Bo's former turf. In response, the gangs have reportedly put a 12 million yuan bounty on Wang's head. ""It not us who took the initiative to fight the underworld,"" Bo Xilai told the Chongqing media. ""It's the underworld who has compelled us to do so. The public has been gathering at the gate of our government building, holding blood-stained pictures, deeply distressed. The underworld has killed innocent people with machetes, like butchers killing pigs -- too horrible to see."" Bo said the campaign is aimed at restoring economic order and winning people's trust. Bo's get-tough stance has earned him praises, especially among the Netizens. ""Chongqing's experience should be popularized nationwide,"" wrote a Netizen from the eastern province of Zhejiang. ""Bo should be China's leader in the new era,"" wrote another. Some political observers think success in Chongqing could catapult him as a ""dark horse"" in the next round of political transition, when the next generation of leaders take over in 2012. ""Whatever his motives, the impact is not local but national,"" says Wenran Jiang. ""Clearly, there is public support for such bold actions."" Jiang, who was Bo's college classmate at Peking University in the late 1970s, remembers Bo as ""a smart student of Chinese and world history who always want to do the right thing."" It remains unclear if the current house-cleaning in Chongqing will spread nationwide. Cynics doubt if the Communist Party leaders have the stomach to genuinely root out the evil of corruption wherever investigations find them. ""These crackdowns are like swatting flies while ignoring tigers,"" shrugs a white-collar worker in Beijing. Some see progress. ""At least they realize that the problem is very acute,"" says a government functionary [who asked to remain anonymous]. ""We cannot speak of a harmonious society unless the people are treated equally before the law.""","Anti-corruption drive in Chongqing implicates millionaires, gangsters, police .

"(CNN) -- Ferrari chairman Luca Di Montezemolo has speculated that his famous marque could withdraw from Formula One and compete in other categories of motorsport. Di Montezemolo is unhappy with technological changes in F1 which have shifted the emphasis away from traditional car and engine research and design to areas such as aerodynamics. ""If Formula 1 is not any more an extreme technology competition, where the technology can be transferred to the road car, maybe we can see Formula 1 without Ferrari,"" he told CNN in a wide-ranging interview. ""Even if F1 without Ferrari anymore is not F1. In this case -- in a theoretical case -- we will do something else,"" added Di Montezemolo. ""But we will never see Ferrari without competition and sporting challenges."" The 65-year-old Di Montezemolo also warned earlier this year in an interview with CNN that costs were an issue, ""we are spending to much,"" he said. He has not placed a time frame on any potential pull out, ""it will depend on the rules"" but is dismayed about rumors of electric cars being introduced into F1 because of environmental concerns. ""This is a joke because this is not Formula One,"" he said. Di Montezemolo has been at the helm of Ferrari since 1991, presiding over their most successful period both in terms of racing, but also commercially, with the company reporting strong profits even in the economic downturn. But with his business acumen, he has mixed feelings about proposals to float F1 on Asian stock markets. ""It means stability, it means mainly transparency in business, so I think this could be a good idea,"" he said. ""On the other hand, the importance of the teams is crucial because at the end of the day, we are the actors, we are the players, and without the players you don't have the game."" Ferrari go into the 13th round of the championship on their home track at Monza with Fernando Alonso leading the title race by 24 points, despite being caught up in the first corner carnage at Spa last Sunday. But his number two Felipe Massa has struggled to make an impression and his future at Ferrari is in some doubt. Di Montezemolo could give no guarantees about the team's driver line-up for next season. ""He (Massa) has to get good results, but Felipe has been and still is an important driver for Ferrari. ""We will see, but I think we have to look to the future and we need two very competitive drivers,"" he added.","Ferrari chief Luca Di Montezemolo unhappy with recent F1 developments .

"Lyons, Colorado (CNN) -- More people were told to evacuate their homes in northeastern Colorado on Tuesday as residents of the flood-stricken towns north of Denver returned to battered neighborhoods, with some of them finding no house to call home. The small town of Crook, about 150 miles northeast of Denver, ordered residents on the north side of town to clear out as water in a canal rose to ""historic"" levels, the Logan County Emergency Management Office reported. Residents on the south side of town had already been ordered out of their homes as firefighters monitored the rising South Platte River, the agency said. Runoff from last week's floods along the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains is now rushing down the South Platte, which runs from south of Denver into Nebraska. The National Weather Service warned counties in Nebraska would start to see the river overflow its banks by Wednesday. State emergency management officials later Tuesday revised the statewide death toll from eight to six. ""The two missing and presumed dead individuals from Larimer County are now listed under missing numbers to more accurately reflect their status,"" officials said. Rescuers were still plucking hundreds of stranded residents from homes cut off by last week's flooding on Tuesday. Authorities in Boulder County airlifted 215 people to safer ground on Monday, while Larimer County saw 420 people evacuated, according to officials there. However, about 600 people are stranded in isolated areas of Larimer County, and rescue crews continued working to evacuate as many as possible Tuesday, authorities said. The week's weather outlook looked favorable for crews, and forecasts called for only slight chances of afternoon storm mid-week, officials said. ""At this point the mission is getting folks down off the mountain, getting them down safely,"" said Nick Christensen, executive officer of the Larimer County Sheriff's Office. The air efforts may be the largest such evacuation in the country since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the National Guard said. ""I expected to see a lot more frustration with folks,"" Larimer County Sheriff Justin Smith told reporters. ""They have been up there since Wednesday or Thursday without an ability to come down, many of them without water and very limited on food overall."" But most were ""in good spirits,"" Smith said. ""It was just amazing. It spoke to the spirit of folks that live here."" Authorities continued checking on residences Tuesday for any occupants, Smith said. ""We have significant air resources up,"" he added. The numbers of people unaccounted for during the height of the bad weather dropped again Tuesday, with Boulder County reducing its count to 183 and Larimer County dropping its figure to 197. Most of the people on the unaccounted list are likely alive and well but have failed to check in with authorities to let them know. For many of those who've returned home, however, the scenes are heartbreaking. In the town of Lyons, about 15 miles north of Boulder, flood waters pushed entire houses around like furniture. ""Today is our first day up here since we've been evacuated,"" Kelly Hunt told CNN. ""And I feel like it's worse than I thought it would be. We lost absolutely everything we own."" When the thick mud and water moved through the town Thursday, they lifted her house and moved it several feet. Throughout Lyons, the streets are dotted with snapped power poles. Rescue workers and the National Guard members outnumber residents, who were forced to evacuate. The two branches of the St. Vrain Creek bisect this town, and nearly swallowed it whole. Abe Vasquez tried to step through the living room of his 78-year-old mother's home. His feet slowly sank in the two feet of raw sewage that had pooled there. ""Here's what's left,"" Vasquez said. ""That's her walker. That's the other one."" Stories of grief, generosity and gratitude . It took 79 years to build the place, Vasquez said. It took 24 hours for it all to disappear. ""It's gone,"" he said. ""It's hard."" In nearby Longmont, Jeff Larsen considered himself a little more fortunate. His home is damaged. But at least it's still standing. ""It's ruined,"" Larsen, who returned to Longmont for the first time since Thursday, told CNN affiliate KUSA. ""Our basement is gone. It stinks so bad in there, you can barely stand it."" When the waters rushed in, his wife, Nina, watched as their SUV was whooshed away. ""We watched it float down the road,"" she said. Nearly 18,000 homes around the state have been damaged. ""I think there is still going to be a lot of shock and disbelief,"" said Matthew Applebaum, the mayor of Boulder. ""The amount of destruction, the damage to people's houses, the damage to neighborhoods, the damage to roads, the damage to our much beloved open space -- it's pretty significant and, as I said, it's extraordinarily widespread."" How to help . Like many, Casey Korbely wants to return home. But pictures from his neighborhood in Boulder County show cars buried in mud, and a huge hole that was once a road. ""The cops and firefighters said it would probably take two to three weeks before they can build a bridge and we can get our vehicles out. "" But Korbely is determined to get back -- by hiking. An uphill climb ... fueled by a Colorado spirit that doesn't give up. In Boulder, the Schuler family surveyed the incredible damage to their home, inundated by water and mud. They live in the flood plain, but have insurance. ""It totally took all the furniture and moved it from one room to the other, so it was whipping through the house,"" Kim Schuler told CNN as he showed the damage. The resident said friends have helped them clean up the muck and prepare for the next step. ""It does give you a perspective on humanity,"" Schuler said. ""There's a lot of nice people that you don't know that don't ask for anything of thanks. They just came in, they helped and they left."" More than 6,400 Colorado residents in the disaster have applied for aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and more than $430,000 has been approved in individual assistance such as temporary housing and home repairs, FEMA said Tuesday.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Soccer star Lionel Messi and his father testified in a Barcelona court Friday in a preliminary hearing over allegations they defrauded Spanish tax authorities of more than $5 million. Prosecutors filed charges last June. Messi has denied any wrongdoing, and last August he and his father paid $6.75 million in back taxes plus interest. But a prosecution spokesman told CNN by phone that they still had to appear in court because they are potentially liable, if the matter goes to trial and they are convicted, to pay a fine of $10 million to $32 million and could be sentenced to up to four years in jail. The complaint centers on alleged tax fraud during 2007, 2008 and 2009. Prosecutors contend Messi and his father, aiming to lower their Spanish tax bill, sought to manage the player's lucrative income from image rights through shell companies set up overseas. Messi, 26, has a yearly salary from his club, FC Barcelona, of just over $20 million plus around $21 million in endorsements from sponsors including Adidas and PepsiCo. ""We have always fulfilled all our tax obligations, following the advice of our tax consultants, who will take care of clarifying this situation,"" Messi posted on his Facebook page last June. His father, Jorge Horacio Messi, was first to arrive on Friday at a court in Gava, a Barcelona suburb chosen because the soccer star's home is within its jurisdiction. Messi, a four-time world player of the year, arrived later and video images of the scene showed a crowd gathered to cheer on, and seek autographs from, the star who's helped FC Barcelona stay atop the Spanish league standings this season. The closed-door hearings were held before an investigating magistrate and included prosecutors, the Messis and their lawyers, and a lawyer for Spain's tax authority, said the prosecution spokesman. Messi testified for about 30 minutes and his father, for about an hour, earlier and separately, said Gemma Linan, a reporter for CNN affiliate 8tv, who was outside the courthouse. After the hearings, the lawyer for the Messis, Cristobal Martell, spoke briefly to reporters, promising total transparency and a willingness to collaborate and make sure taxes are paid, and adding that there had been no intent to defraud. ""We were told to do only one thing: to collaborate with the administration to clear up the facts showing the economic data,"" Martell said, according to a translation by Reuters. ""The order we were given by the Messi family was to show transparency, clarity and collaboration. We proceeded as we did today with the only goal of showing transparency, and we have proven little aim for fraud and a clear will to regulate the situation with the State Agency for Tax Administration, in order to avoid any big fight with the state regarding the fiscal ruling."" The prosecution spokesman, who by custom is not identified, said that last Wednesday, just two days before the hearing, Martell tried to reach an out-of-court settlement with prosecutors for the Messis. Prosecutors proposed that both Messi and his father would plead guilty to tax evasion in the hearing, and would likely be fined about $10 million and receive a one-year sentence, which would not require time in prison because they have no prior convictions, the spokesman said. But Martell said the Messis were opposed. He proposed that only the father would make such a plea, in exchange for prosecutors and the court relieving Leo Messi of any responsibility. Prosecutors would not accept that based on Spanish law, the spokesman said. Inside the court, Messi's father testified that he was in charge of the finances, and any blame would be his, and Lionel Messi was not involved, according to a prosecutor who talked to an ad hoc pool of Spanish journalists, Linan said. Messi, who arrived at Barcelona as a 13-year-old in 2000, has won six Spanish Primera Liga titles and three Champions League crowns and scored an unparalleled 86 goals for the club and his national team, Argentina, in 2012. FC Barcelona has refused comment on the case.","Soccer star Lionel Messi and his father are accused of tax fraud .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- The body of a Hungarian daredevil ""wingsuit flier"" has been found a day after he plunged into a remote valley in northwestern China during a practice flight ahead of the World Championships. Rescuers discovered Victor Kovats with a smashed skull at the foot of a 100-meter (328-foot) cliff in Tianmen Mountain National Forest Park in Zhangjiajie on Wednesday, according to China's state-run Xinhua news agency. An investigation is now underway, though rescuers believe Kovats crashed into the cliff when his parachute failed to deploy. Wingsuit flying is an extremely hazardous sport where participants glide through the air wearing a specially constructed suit with fabric under the arms and legs to slow the rate of descent. Much like skydiving, the flight ends with the deployment of a parachute. ""We are deeply saddened by Victor Kovats's passing and our thoughts and prayers go out to his parents and friends during these difficult times,"" read a statement on the website of the Red Bull World Wingsuit League (WWL), which organizes the competition. ""He will be always be remembered for his deep passion for life and his spirit of adventure, and he will always be sadly missed in the wingsuit community."" Skydiver found dead after jump in Tennessee . Difficult terrain . Kovats jumped at 2:51 p.m. local time, according to Xinhua. Witnesses then lost sight of Kovats after his parachute appeared to fail. Three other fliers successfully completed trial jumps at the time. Nearly 200 firefighters and policemen were involved in the search operation, which was hampered by difficult terrain, according to Xinhua. Kovats, a three-time Hungarian national champion, had completed 700 jumps. He was also an experienced skydiver and base jumper. The organizers have not yet said if the event -- in its second year and scheduled to begin on October 11 -- will go ahead. The inaugural World Wingsuit Championships were held at Tianmen Mountain's 700-meter (2,300-foot) cliffs last year with 15 fliers from nine countries. Kovats is the latest in a line of wingsuit fatalities. In August, a British stuntman, who parachuted in dressed as James Bond during the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony, died after hitting a cliff while jumping in a wingsuit from a helicopter in Switzerland. Mark Sutton, 42, and another man jumped from a height of about 3,300 meters (10,826 feet) in the Grandes-Otannes area in the Alps, near the border with France, a police statement said.

"(CNN) -- As a social network and identity platform, Google+ has had a lukewarm reception. But the service has had a pair of breakout features: Hangouts and photos. Google announced updates to both tools on Tuesday in a San Francisco art gallery decorated in photos taken by Google+ users. The company has spent the past two years forcefully pushing Google+ into every nook and cranny of Google products. It says there are now 540 million active Google+ users across Google, meaning they use some Google+-ified Google product in some way or another. The number of people actually opening up Google+ and checking out its stream of posts is lower, at 300 million visitors a month. For comparison, Facebook has just more than 1 billion monthly active users. The problem with pictures . One number that does pop out is the amount of photos people are sharing to the service. Google says 1.5 billion photographs are uploaded every week. (Facebook says it has about 2.4 billion a week, or 350 million a day.) Digital photography and mobile devices with decent cameras have created a monster. People have thousands of photos, hours of videos, and not enough time to cut through the noise, edit and share images. ""Photography today is too hard,"" said Google senior vice president of engineering Vic Gundotra at the press conference. ""People have beautiful treasures that have become stranded in these devices."" Google has been focusing on making tools that automate as much of the process as possible. Hobbyists and professional photographers might enjoy carefully editing images, but average people just want to share their best vacation or family photos and move on. When you upload photos to Facebook or Instagram, the images are compressed. For the people who use social media as a kind of backup, this can be a disadvantage down the line when they want a higher-resolution version of their image. Google+ is automatically uploading images at their full resolution, and soon the feature will come to iOS. Auto highlights, which was first was announced at the Google i/o developers conference, digs through all your images and picks out the best shots, eliminating duplicates, looking for sharpness and good exposures, and finding people it knows are important to you. The search feature has added thousands of new automatic tags like waterfall, sunset and beach, as well as less obvious categories like ""hedgehog"" and ""manicure."" That means you can search for pics of your daughter Sally in front a waterfall wearing sunglasses (and possibly holding a hedgehog) and get the exact images that fit that description. There are also improved editing features, like auto-enhance, which can be toggled to high or low. If you agree with Google's taste in photos and editing tweaks, it can save you hours of work. Videos are even more labor-intensive than photos. The humbly named ""Auto Awesome Movie,"" takes over in much the same way Apple's iMovie automatically creates trailers. It can stabilize videos, sync the action with music tracks, add filters and edit clips together with minimal input from the user. ""This is not some little local client editing system,"" said Gundotra. ""This is the power of Google -- of machine learning applied to photos and videos."" Hangouts are for texting and GIFs . Hangouts is Google's communication tool that dabbles in chatting, video conferencing and live broadcasting. Hangouts on Air is popular for politicians and celebrities who want to broadcast a live chat. President Barack Obama has done Q&As using the tool in the past. Google added features to schedule and promote Hangouts On Air before they happen, more control for producers screening questions and moderating viewers, and auto-enhance features to improve video quality. Video calls are now higher quality and can go fullscreen. If you'd like to make your call look more like an Instagram stream, you can add filters or auto-enhance. FInally, to fully cover all the communication options in chats, Google is adding SMS support so people can send text messages directly from the Hangouts app. Most important, Hangouts now support our most advanced method of communication, the animated GIF. (It already allowed the second-most advanced method, the emoji.)","Google+ is improving its photo editing features to cut down on time needed to share .

"(EW.com) -- Seth Rogen was recently quoted in an Entertainment Weekly magazine article as saying that there have been only one and a half good movies ever made about frat life: ""Animal House"" and the first half of ""Old School."" I'd throw 1984's ""Revenge of the Nerds"" into the mix, but I get his point. Too few comedies have been able to capture the gonzo, bacchanalian spirit of the Greek system with some degree of wit. Well, now you can add Rogen's raucously inspired ""Neighbors"" to the honor roll. It's a frat-house flick with more on its mind than beer, bongs, and beer bongs. It's also a razor-sharp commentary on desperately trying to remain carefree after the burdens of adulthood have taken over. Critical Mass: Is 'Neighbors' the season's best comedy? Directed by ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall's"" Nicholas Stoller, ""Neighbors"" stars Rogen and Rose Byrne as Mac and Kelly Radner, a 30-something couple with a newborn daughter, a sensible station wagon, and a crushing mortgage on a house littered with breast pumps and baby monitors. What they don't have is any of the spontaneity of their 20s. Exhibit A: As the film opens, Rogen and Byrne are getting hot and heavy in the bedroom, only to realize that their baby is watching Daddy tell Mommy he's about to take her to ''Bonertown.'' Plans to go out clubbing with their less exhausted single friends go just about as well. Then one morning, moving trucks show up next door and unload a sea of whooping, Solo-cup-clutching frat boys. Led by the chiseled, vacant alpha dog Teddy (Zac Efron) and his Abercrombie wingman Pete (Dave Franco), the guys of Delta Psi Beta proceed to turn Mac and Kelly's quiet, tree-lined slice of suburban heaven into a hedonistic hell. At first, Mac and Kelly see their new neighbors as an opportunity to prove that they're more than just the sum of their Pack 'n Plays, that they're still down to party and reclaim their laid-back youth. The couple obliviously try to cozy up with Teddy and Pete, but every time they hope to show how cool they are, it becomes more and more clear that they're just the annoying old buzzkills next door. And when the raging gets a bit too epic and the meatheads refuse to keep it down, it's war. The two sides launch into a hilarious volley of tit-for-tat pranks that gradually escalates into a gross-out gag Armageddon with obscene topiaries and gargantuan dildos as the weapons of battle. James Franco may play Tommy Wiseau in film based on 'The Disaster Artist' One of the best surprises in Andrew Jay Cohen and Brendan O'Brien's script is its refusal to succumb to lazy sitcom stereotypes, which would set Rogen up as the oafish Kevin James man-child and Byrne as the nag. Instead, Kelly is as foul-mouthed, shallow, and irresponsible as her husband. Speaking in her native Aussie twang, Byrne shows that she's a deadpan comic ace. And thanks to her chemistry with Rogen, ""Neighbors"" proves that just because you grow up doesn't mean you have to be a grown-up. You can still be wild and crazy even as you're yelling at the kids next door to get the hell off your lawn. Grade: B+ . See the original story at EW.com.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Caroline Kennedy, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, visited Nagasaki on Tuesday, one of two Japanese cities on which the United States dropped atomic bombs during the final days of World War II. Kennedy, who took up the position of ambassador last month, toured the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum and talked with survivors of the nuclear blast that devastated much of the city on August 9, 1945. In comments at the museum, she referenced her late father, former President John F. Kennedy. ""President Kennedy was very proud that he was able to start the process of nuclear disarmament, and all of our family shares the commitment,"" she said. ""And President Obama also has been working very hard on this issue."" Caroline Kennedy laid a wreath at the Nagasaki Peace Park for the victims of the bombing, which is estimated to have killed as many as 80,000 people. She then participated in a tree-planting ceremony to mark the friendship between the United States and Japan. The bombing of Nagasaki took place three days after the United States had dropped an atomic bomb on the city of Hiroshima. That nuclear attack, which is estimated to have killed as many as 140,000 people, was the first use of an atomic bomb in warfare.

"(CNN) -- The Bowe Bergdahl story may be coming to the big screen. Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal are developing a feature film based on the story of Bergdahl, the U.S. Army sergeant who recently returned to the United States after five years in captivity in Afghanistan. If the film makes it to the screen, it will be familiar territory for Bigelow and Boal, whose movies ""The Hurt Locker"" and ""Zero Dark Thirty"" looked at U.S. involvement in the Mideast and South Asia through the lenses of a bomb-disposal expert and a CIA agent, respectively. Tony Angellotti, Boal's press rep, confirmed that the writer's production company, Page 1, will work on this movie. ""The Hurt Locker"" (2009) won six Oscars, including best picture, best original screenplay for Boal and best director for Bigelow. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" (2012), about the search for Osama bin Laden, was nominated for five Oscars and won one, but not for either Boal or Bigelow. A film on Bergdahl will likely prove controversial. The soldier went missing in June 2009 in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. He was released on May 31 in exchange for five Taliban figures held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official briefed on the report. The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official has told CNN.

""The Hurt Locker's"" bomb disposal expert, played by Jeremy Renner, sees horrific events in Iraq but finds he needs the adrenaline rush of his military work to function. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" included a controversial waterboarding scene, which led to a debate over the film's position on torture.

"(CNN) -- It is a rare, strange day when Senate Republicans vote to block billions in tax cuts. But that's what happened Thursday when they chose to freeze a massive tax credit package in order to protest how Democrats are running the chamber. By a vote of 53-40, the EXPIRE Act, which would extend $85 billion in tax credits, failed to get the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster. Only one Republican, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, voted with Democrats to advance the measure. The rest of the GOP votes were ""no,"" as Republicans vented anger that Democrats have refused to allow votes on their amendments to this and most other bills in the past year. ""This is bigger than any one bill,"" Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor. ""What (Democrats are) doing is muzzling the people of this country, a gag order on the people we were sent here to represent."" ""It's time to act as the U.S. Senate should act and allow (both sides) the opportunity to express their view,"" echoed Sen. Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah. The pushback comes as the Senate struggles to find a way to operate. Traditional processes and procedures for working through sharp divides have broken down in the past year. Democrats, frustrated with Republicans for blocking presidential nominees, changed a significant piece of the filibuster rule. Triggering the so-called ""nuclear option,"" Majority Leader Harry Reid and Democrats made it easier to get around GOP objections. That raised hostility behind the scenes to a new level. At the same time, Republicans are also furious that Democrats will not let bills have a so-called ""open"" process, where senators can propose amendments and get a vote on their idea. That is far from unique to Reid or this Senate. Republicans have used the same tactic to choose friendly amendments when they were in the majority. But after months of tension and in a bitter midterm election year where they want to rail against Democrats, Republicans decided that Thursday was the day to take a stand on the process issues in the Senate. Reid fired back, insisting that Republicans are the ones causing obstruction in the Senate and are doing so for political reasons. ""It should not be lost that Republican senators are continuing their agenda by just saying no,"" the Nevada senator said after the vote. ""I wonder who called them today to kill this bill? No matter the excuse, Republicans continue to wage war against common sense."" Reid also made sure to point out that, with Thursday's vote, Republicans were blocking their own cause. ""That's what just happened, Republicans just voted against tax cuts,"" Reid said. What happens next? The bill to extend the tax cuts is frozen temporarily but not dead. Reid suggested that both sides should take the weekend to think about their next moves.","Republicans were protesting how Democrats run the Senate .

"(CNN) -- What if you saw your city as a giant obstacle course? Buildings were there to be leaped from, railings hurdled over, rooftops rolled across. Suddenly the morning commute isn't so boring when you're scaling concrete walls Spider-Man-style, or balancing along ledges with the stealth of Catwoman. There are countless ways to move through our urban spaces -- so why do we often plod along with the crowd? A growing community sees things differently. This is parkour, a daring discipline where people bound around concrete jungles in the most efficient way possible -- if that means leaping from building to building high above the gridlock below, then so be it. They rely only on their bodies, using the city's surfaces to powerfully propel themselves forward, reading the landscape with an almost animal instinct. t . School of hard knocks . Can anyone become a parkour pro? I'm about to find out -- starting from the inside. In a converted shipment yard in east London, ripped young men spring across concrete blocks with the ease of panthers. They are training in the UK's first purpose-built parkour center -- a sign not just of how popular this once-underground activity has become, but how organized. A vast warehouse has been decked-out to resemble the urban landscape, filled with a haphazard assortment of steel railings, brick walls, and giant trucks tires. A gentle electronic soundtrack plays in the background. Why practice parkour inside, when there's a whole world to explore outside these four walls? ""We wanted somewhere you could train without worrying about residents complaining or being kicked off by the police -- and fair enough, if you are jumping on somebody's walls, they might not like it,"" explained 27-year-old James Adams, who four years ago quit his job as a high court civil servant to teach parkour full-time. ""We don't expect people to stop training outside, and we wouldn't want them to. But especially for those starting out, this place can be really useful -- it's a community of people to learn from."" An ideal introduction for those like myself, whose sporting prowess is limited to running after the bus or squeezing myself onto a train at rush hour. There are no soft furnishing in this cavernous concrete building, and before I attempt my first challenge -- leaping over a waist-high steel railing -- I'm giving a word of warning. ""This isn't a gymnastics center,"" says Adams. ""You can't fall on your head here and be fine."" Urban acrobats . Twenty minutes later I find myself hanging upside down from a four-meter-high concrete wall, gripping on for dear life. ""It really pushes you mentally to face fear and overcome it,"" says Adams, who first took up parkour because he was ""bored out of his brain at the gym."" ""Once you start training, your vision expands. It frees you in a huge way. You see a railing on your way to the train station and think 'I'm not going to go three feet out of my way. I can go over that."" Even in my panicked state gently rolling backwards down a wall, blood rushing to my head and the center swimming before my eyes, a strange thought looms before me. 'This is so much cooler than the gym.' Lights, camera, action . Since it emerged in France in the 1980s, parkour has been as hard to pin down as the people who practice it, used as everything from a way to keep fit, to security training, and even film stunts. In the opening scenes of James Bond film ""Casino Royale,"" Daniel Craig leaps, rolls, and hurdles after a bad guy through a bustling construction site -- culminating in a spectacular dive between two cranes. This is no ordinary villain, but Sebastian Foucan, one of the founders of parkour, and the pair perform moves so death-defying, you might think they were the work of special effects alone. ""It's almost expected now that when a superhero is traveling across the city, they'll be able to do parkour, because it looks cooler for them to run down the street and vault over a bin, than to just run in a straight line,"" says Adams. ""People do a class and assume the first thing I'm going to ask them to do is a triple backflip -- it couldn't be further from the truth. Most of the training we do is low and safe."" Power and beauty . The academy now hopes to train uniformed forces. As Adams says, a police officer who can chase someone over a wall, is going to be much more valuable than one who struggles to keep up. Despite his bulky physique, there is an elegance to the way Adams lightly leaps over wooden barriers, and it's easy to see why parkour is also increasingly being used on stage -- the group is currently working on a performance of ""Alice in Wonderland"". One thing's for certain, parkour will make that journey down the rabbit hole a lot more interesting.

"(CNN) -- Nearly 800 dogs were rescued by a Chinese animal protection group last Saturday night in the city of Zigong, in southwest Sichuan province. The Qiming Center, an animal-rights protection group in Sichuan, pulled off the rescue. Last Friday night, a volunteer tipped off the group that hundreds of caged dogs were being loaded onto trucks in Zigong and headed to various restaurants in Southern Guangxi province. The group dispatched a team of five to block the dog-trader while they posted microblogs online calling for help from animal-loving citizens. After a standoff and negotiation, the group agreed to pay the dog trader 83,000 yuan ($13,000) to secure the caged dogs' freedom, said Qiming president Qiao Wei. ""It's a compromise we took in an effort to let the dogs free—they are visibly suffering for being packed in small cages with very limited space. We spent hours negotiating with the trader,"" Qiao told CNN in a phone interview. ""Finally with the help of local government he was willing to hand over the dogs in exchange for 83,000 yuan—60,000 for personal compensation, another 20,000 for cages that we lack."" Qiming volunteers are now helping settle down the dogs, according to state-run media. Dog meat has long been a popular dish in certain regions of China. But over time this cultural and culinary tradition is getting more and more unpopular, as international and Chinese animal protection organizations increase pressure against the dog meat trade. China's attitudes on pets, palates change . Most dogs rescued Saturday were severely dehydrated. Rescuers photographed and registered the dogs before tending to their health. ""It's a costly work but workers at the center are trying their best to take care of the dogs. Since their arrival, only one dog has died due to respiration system failure,"" Qiao told CNN . Ms Teng, a Qiming Center employee, said four full-time staff have been working round the clock. On the center's official blog, the group frequently updates the dogs' latest conditions and solicits donations or voluntary assistance from animal lovers. ""Some dogs were stolen, and now their owners come to us to take back their pets. Many would leave with a certain amount of money as appreciation for our work,"" Teng told CNN. ""Once we've finished the health check up procedures, we'll start helping the dogs find new homes."" Teng says through the rescue she and her fellow volunteers hope to send the general public one message: ""No trading, no killing."" Meanwhile, dog trading remains rife in certain regions in China due to lack of a national law on animal welfare and protection. ""A major part of our work is proposing drafts of laws and regulations under which the government can effectively punish this kind of behavior,"" Qiao added. ""Now we can only tackle the traders one at a time, and can hardly tell whether they'll go back to the business again."" In April 520 dogs were saved from dinner table by Chinese animal-rights activists who stopped a truck carrying them in cages on a highway near Beijing. A 15-hour standoff between volunteers and the trader caused a temporary shut-down of nearby exits, until an agreement was reached. The truck driver let the dogs free for 115,000 yuan. The incident stirred online discussions about how far activists should go in protecting animal rights—a concept still under debate in China.","Nearly 800 dogs were rescued by a Chinese animal protection group .

"(CNN) -- The answer to the question will now never be known -- for many football fans had been wondering how Borussia Dortmund's Mario Gotze would fare when taking on future employers Bayern Munich in Saturday's Champions League final at Wembley. After both German teams booked their place in the final, supporters, journalists and former players had asked how the 20-year-old would handle a situation whereby he had the chance to shatter Bayern's Champions League dream but such thoughts now lie idle. Last month, it was announced the midfielder was joining Dortmund's biggest Bundesliga rivals after the recently-crowned German champions activated his release clause with a bid of $47 million. The move was criticized by many Dortmund fans, disappointed that a player who had been developed by the club's academy since the age of 8 was being lost so readily and by the timing of the news. The announcement came on the eve of the opening leg of Dortmund's Champions League semifinal with Real Madrid, which the 2012 Bundesliga champions ultimately won 4-3 on aggregate to reach their first final in 16 years. Gotze was highly influential in the first leg but tore his hamstring 14 minutes into Dortmund's 2-0 defeat in the return fixture at the Bernabeu on April 30 -- a game that has proved to be his last for the club. ""It was my big aim to play in the final and I have been working hard to reach that in the last few weeks,"" Dortmund's website quoted the German international as saying on Wednesday. ""I am incredibly sorry that I can't help the team in this really important game. I have full confidence in the team and will of course be going to London to support the boys from the sidelines."" The attacking midfielder had maintained hopes of playing in London until Tuesday, when he managed an hour of training in his first full session since April until an adverse reaction curtailed his dream -- and so perhaps his chances of repairing his damaged relationship with some fans. For while the absence of Dortmund's main playmaker represents a major tactical blow for coach Jurgen Klopp, it has been welcomed by a section of the club's supporters. The intensity of feeling following the April announcement found some fans burning a replica of his Dortmund jersey in online videos and others labeling him 'Judas' among other protests. When hosting Bayern in a league match on May 4 that ended 1-1, Dortmund fans unveiled a massive banner reading 'The quest for cash reveals how much heart you really have, get lost Goetze'. ""What you find on the internet is that some Dortmund fans are not that disappointed that Gotze cannot play,"" said Peter Penders, a sports journalist with German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine. ""A lot of them never wanted to see him in a Dortmund jersey again as they no longer saw him as the club's player after he signed for Bayern."" ""He had grown up at Borussia Dortmund and was seen as a player wholly created by Borussia Dortmund, which is why they were so disappointed."" When the transfer was announced, the charismatic Klopp revealed that Gotze's departure had hinged on the fact that former Barcelona Pep Guardiola, who will take charge of Bayern after this season, had identified him as a key player. ""The reason Gotze is leaving? He is the favorite transfer of Guardiola,"" Klopp told reporters. ""So if it's anyone's fault, it's mine. I cannot make myself 15 centimeters smaller and learn Spanish. Gotze wants to work with this extraordinary coach that is Guardiola."" Despite the apathy of some supporters, Dortmund - who finished runner-up to Bayern in this season's German championship -- will miss the creativity of a player with 12 league goals and 13 assists in both the Bundesliga and Champions League this season. ""Gotze's absence is a major problem in attack because they have to change some other things,"" added Penders. ""Perhaps Marco Reus will take his position behind striker Robert Lewandowski, with Kevin Grosskreutz filling Reus' usual position on the wing."" Dortmund are also waiting on the fitness of defender Mats Hummels, who is receiving intense treatment on the ankle he damaged in Saturday's surprise home defeat by Hoffenheim. Meanwhile, one of the players Gotze will link up with next season says Bayern must atone for final defeats to Inter Milan in 2010 and to Chelsea in their own stadium last year. ""We have to win for the fans, the club and the whole team,"" said Franck Ribery, who joined the Bavarian club six years ago. ""This is our third time, we have more experience, know what it means to play in a final, so it's nothing new for us, everyone knows what they have to do and how we have to play against Dortmund. ""The defeat to Inter was hard, but the loss to Chelsea really hurt, it was a huge shock for everyone,"" added the French winger.","Dortmund's Gotze ruled out of Saturday's Champions League final against Bayern Munich .

"Majuro, Marshall Islands (CNN) -- How long did Jose Salvador Alvarenga, the man who washed up on the shores of a group of Pacific islands last week, spend adrift at sea? He says it was around 13 months. Local fishermen in the area of Mexico from which he set off say he may have been gone for a month longer than that, which more or less matches a document from a local civil protection agency that reports he disappeared in November 2012. But some people have suggested he looks too healthy for somebody who'd been through such an ordeal. Officials in the Marshall Islands -- where the bearded, shaggy haired Alvarenga turned up last Thursday in a heavily damaged boat -- say they've abandoned efforts to pin down the length of time he spent lost in the ocean. ""We gave up on trying to find out the truth of how long he drifted,"" said Anjanette Kattil. ""Time will confirm his story. What we've been concentrating on is his medical condition to see if he's OK and his repatriation."" Health improving . Alvarenga's story has raised questions about how he managed to survive on a small boat for so long. ""He looks way better than I would have expected for someone who has drifted for as long as he says he has,"" Kattil said Wednesday. ""But there is no question he has drifted for quite some time and he has washed up on our shores."" Alvarenga has said he lived off fish and turtles he had caught and relied on rainwater, and sometimes his own urine, to try to stay hydrated. Doctors in the Marshall Islands have told government officials that the castaway's immune system is very weak and that his symptoms are consistent with someone who has signs of severe dehydration and a diet of only meat. But his condition is improving and he was released from the hospital Tuesday. One of his first acts was to get a haircut and a shave, ditching his tangled locks and bushy beard. ""For days he's been asking for a haircut,"" Kattil said. He requested a cut like the one worn by the men on Ebon, the atoll where he was found, she said. A fishing trip gone awry . Alvarenga, who says he is 37, has been identified by Mexico as a Salvadoran citizen who was living in the Mexican city of Tonala. Authorities say they plan to repatriate him to El Salvador -- where his parents say they haven't seen him for years -- once his health is recovered and his documentation is sorted out. Since El Salvador doesn't have diplomatic ties with the Marshall Islands, Mexican officials are coordinating the arrangements. Alvarenga says he set off from the port of Paredon Viejo, near Tonala in Mexico's Chiapas state, in December 2012. Local fishermen in the area told El Universal newspaper that they remember Alvarenga setting off earlier, in November that year. He says he and another man intended to spend a day trying to catch sharks, but they were blown off course by northerly winds and then caught in a storm, eventually losing use of their engines. According to Kattil, Alvarenga said that four weeks into their drift, he lost his companion because he refused to eat raw birds. There are no details yet on what Alvarenga did with the man's body. Bellarmino Rodriguez Beyz, owner of Alvarenga's boat in Mexico, identified Alvarenga's companion as 23-year-old Ezequiel CÃ³rdova. Alvarenga has said that his faith in God kept him going through the ordeal, but that he also contemplated suicide when he ran low on food and water. Across an ocean . If Alvarenga's story proves true, the trip across the Pacific would have taken him across roughly 6,600 miles (10,800 kilometers) of open ocean before ending in the Marshall Islands, about halfway between Hawaii and Australia, in the northern Pacific. Such an amazing journey isn't unheard of in the small Pacific nation, as three Mexican fishermen made a similar drift voyage in 2006 that lasted nine months. Those men lived off fish they caught and rainwater, and they read the Bible for comfort. Conditions in the Pacific make the timeline of Alvarenga's journey plausible, according to Judson Jones, a producer for CNN Weather. Jones said that given the average currents between Mexico and the Marshall Islands, it would have taken less than a year to travel from the origin to the end in the strongest average currents. If the trip did indeed take 13-1/2 months, it means his boat would have averaged about 18.6 miles (30 kilometers) a day. But Jones said a meandering journey in and out of the currents was most likely. Journalists Suzanne Chutaro reported from Majuro, Marshall Islands, and CNN's Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Mariano Castillo and Nick Parker contributed to this report.","NEW: There are conflicting reports as to when the castaway and his companion disappeared .

"(CNN) -- On Monday, the Supreme Court is hearing a challenge to a 2008 law that dramatically expanded the government's authority to wiretap Americans' phone calls and e-mails. At stake are not only the privacy protections guaranteed by the Constitution, but the ability of the courts to enforce them. The law in question -- called the FISA Amendments Act -- endorsed and expanded the warrantless surveillance program that President George W. Bush authorized shortly after 9/11. It gives the National Security Agency a virtual blank check to intercept Americans' international phone calls and e-mails, to store them indefinitely in huge databases, and to share them with other agencies with few restrictions. Surveillance under the law must target foreigners abroad, but the law permits the government to sweep up Americans' communications in the process. Indeed, administration officials who advocated for the law made clear that their principal interest was in collecting Americans' international communications. Most troublingly, the FISA Amendments Act allows the government to wiretap Americans' international communications in a dragnet fashion -- potentially sweeping up thousands or millions of Americans' communications at a time -- without any suspicion of wrongdoing and without even identifying the targets of its surveillance to any court. In the Clapper v. Amnesty case, the Supreme Court will, for the first time, hear a case concerning FISA -- the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act -- which was enacted more than 30 years ago, after the Senate's Church Committee exposed the rampant surveillance abuses of the preceding decades. And it will be the first time since 1972 that the court has considered any case concerning ""intelligence surveillance"" -- surveillance conducted not for law enforcement, but for investigating threats to national security. The question before the justices is in one sense a narrow one: Can the law be challenged? The plaintiffs include an array of attorneys, human rights, labor, legal and media organizations whose work requires them to engage in sensitive and sometimes privileged phone and e-mail communications with people abroad. In the past, we have argued that the plaintiffs have the right to challenge the law because it puts their communications at risk of surveillance, and because that risk is substantial enough to have compelled them to take costly and burdensome measures to protect their confidential communications. For example, some of the plaintiffs have had to travel overseas to gather information in person that -- if not for this law -- they would have been able to gather by phone or e-mail. An appeals court agreed with us last year, but the government argues that the plaintiffs may not sue because they cannot prove that their communications have actually been intercepted under the law or will be intercepted under it in the future. Of course, the government refuses to disclose whether it has -- or will in the future -- wiretap the plaintiffs' phone calls or e-mails. The flaw in the government's logic should be obvious: If only those who can prove they were wiretapped can sue, and if the government categorically refuses to reveal whom it has wiretapped, then no one will ever be able to challenge the law. The real issue here is whether this unprecedented and invasive surveillance law will be subject to meaningful judicial review at all, ever. If the plaintiffs cannot challenge the law, then the only judicial scrutiny the law is likely to receive will come from the FISA Court, which meets in secret, generally allows only the government to appear before it, rarely issues public decisions, and doesn't have the authority to consider several key constitutional problems with the law. The government's argument is really about the role of the judiciary in patrolling the boundaries between the lawful measures that the executive should take in the defense of national security, and the unconstitutional and effectively unbridled discretion the government now has to acquire Americans' international communications. Whatever one's views of the legality of the FISA Amendments Act, the government's efforts to shield the law from any meaningful judicial review should be profoundly disturbing to all Americans. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jameel Jaffer and Alexander Abdo.","Jameel Jaffer, Alexander Abdo: FISA Amendments Act violates Americans' privacy .

"Andar, Afghanistan (CNN) -- ""An apple,"" English teacher Asadullah writes and reads out on the board. A simple word, perhaps, but here speaking and teaching English is something of a novelty and for the U.S. military and Afghan government a success -- albeit small. It would not have been possible four months ago when soldiers from the 101st Airborne arrived in Andar district in Afghanistan's Ghazni province -- the first American presence in the area in two years. ""The school was empty, it was essentially a ghost town,"" Captain Justin Quisenberry recalled. ""We found a passerby and asked, 'where are all the students, the teachers?' He said it had been closed for a couple of years, the Taliban threatened us. It's just not a safe place to have classes."" An indication of just how powerful the Taliban has been in this area is the turnout for the country's September elections. Just three people out of the district's 110,000 residents voted. Classes only just resumed here. The school is in the town of Miri. Although it may not look like an oasis, it is -- of sorts. The local market is thriving. Cell phones and bright clothes imported from Pakistan are among the items on sale, creating an explosion of color against the dull brown of the mud walls. The school is the only one around for miles under government control; the other 25 remain in the grip of the Taliban. ""The Taliban doesn't like that this school is open,"" headmaster Abdullah Hakmal told us. ""It's because they don't have power here."" He explained the Taliban wants to dictate the curriculum, focusing more on religion rather than other studies. The students, who range from 11-years-old to 25, used to have to walk for kilometers to get any sort of education at all from a Taliban-controlled school. ""Yes"" the class says in unison when we ask if they are happy. As 15-year-old Nuradin puts it, ""It's great to have a school that is a safe and close walk."" ""The one school we just recently opened up in Miri, it's in the oil spot or security bubble that we've been able to establish in the last four months,"" U.S. Battalion commander David Fivecoat said. ""We will gradually expand that here over the coming months and begin to take back some of the schools from the ones that are under Taliban control and begin to re-exert government influence here in Andar."" But Taliban influence is not just confined to the educational system; they have also set up a shadow government. ""What we've seen here, we've seen tax collection system where the Taliban has been able to levy taxes on farmers and the wheat harvest came in. We've also been able to see a small judicial system where they have been able to adjudicate disputes,"" Fivecoat added. ""As we've discovered this and gained some insight into it, it also gives us the ability to target the judges and the tax collectors for the Taliban to remove that infrastructure and make it harder for them to come back if and when they try to come back from Pakistan."" Historically the Taliban leadership and many fighters flee to their safe havens in neighboring Pakistan for the winter, re-emerging for what is known as the ""spring offensive."" ""This winter in December and January insurgent activity has definitely decreased,"" explained Fivecoat. ""We've seen fewer engagements between my soldiers and the enemy, we've seen less IED's and really less violence. But in the last week we did hear some reports that some of the Taliban leaders are being ordered back here to fight in Andar due to some of the successes that we've had. And we're ready for that if and when they come back."" It's been a tough fight just to get this far. Since arriving in Andar, Fivecoat has had around 50 soldiers wounded in battle and one killed. Outside of the ""oil spot"" or ""security bubble"" that the U.S. has managed to establish in Miri itself, fear of the Taliban prevails. On patrol through a small village that sits along one of the major routes in the district, 33-year-old Afghan Army Lieutenant Matiullah asks local men where the Taliban are hiding. Their responses are a variation of ""We don't know"", ""They are not here,"" or ""No, no Taliban."" The search through the village is intended to catch the Taliban off guard. ""A lot of times insurgents will stage their attacks out of villages such as this, hide IED making materials here and generally stage and plan in the mosques around here before they move out on the roads to instigate their attacks on coalition forces and afghan military and police,"" U.S. Army Lieutenant Chip Evans explained. The men crouch through the doorways of the rooms in the mud compounds but find nothing. Meanwhile, Matiullah gathers the elders by the mosque, where his address is as much a plea for help as it is a lecture. ""We are coming here to help, you need to help us to bring security,"" he says, adding, ""The Taliban comes here to take your money, we are coming to help."" He accuses them of helping the Taliban, otherwise he says troops would not be getting ambushed or blown up in the area. The men sit expressionless, refusing to answer any of Matiullah's accusations. ""These people do anger me a bit,"" Matiullah said. ""But I can't really blame them, none of them have weapons and they are too scared of the Taliban.""","U.S. 101st Airborne arrived in Andar district in Afghanistan's Ghazni province 4 months ago .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- New Zealand sport has been rocked by allegations that three former national cricketers are under investigation for alleged match-fixing, according to reports. The International Cricket Council (ICC), the game's governing body, said in a statement that a small number of former New Zealand representatives were under investigation by the anti-corruption unit for alleged involvement in ""fixing activity in historic cricket matches."" It did not identify those under investigation, but after New Zealand media named those alleged to be implicated, two of the players made statements regarding the investigation. Former test batsman Lou Vincent confirmed he was involved, but said the ongoing investigation made him unable to comment further. ""I wish to let everyone know that I am cooperating with an ongoing ICC anti-corruption investigation that has been made public today,"" said Vincent, who played his last game for New Zealand in 2007. ""This investigation is bound by a number of rules and regulations that mean I am unable to make any further public comment. I will personally talk to the public when I am able to."" Former all-rounder Chris Cairns, also named in media reports as one of the players involved, told reporters he was unaware of any investigation and had not been contacted by authorities in relation to the matter. Cairns, who played his last game for New Zealand in 2006, had been acting as a television commentator for New Zealand's test match against the West Indies in Dunedin, but left the coverage amid the controversy. Another former player claimed in media reports to be the third individual involved made no public comment. New Zealand Cricket chief executive David White told reporters the organization had been aware of this investigation for a number of months and was ""shocked and surprised by the allegations."" ""We support the ICC's investigation as corruption has no place in our sport. No current New Zealand players are being investigated. No games played in New Zealand are being investigated. Lastly, no matches under New Zealand Cricket's jurisdiction are being investigated."" New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told reporters it would be ""very, very serious'' if the allegations were proven. ""New Zealand is a country that sees itself as a very above board, honest place both to do business and to play sport, so it would be deeply concerning if this was factually correct."" The country regularly ranks as one of the world's least corrupt, recently topping Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index alongside Denmark. Cairns has previously challenged match-fixing allegations in the courts, and won. Last year, he sued Indian cricket official and businessman Lalit Modi in a British Court, after Modi had tweeted allegations of match-fixing relating to Cairns' stint with the Chandigarh Lions in the short-lived Indian Cricket League. Cairns captained the side in 2007 and 2008, playing alongside Vincent in 2008. Modi, who ran the rival Indian Premier League competition, lost his appeal against the court's decision in October 2012, with damages increased to Â£90,000 ($147,459). International cricket has been plagued by the specter of match-fixing in recent years. Players from countries including Pakistan, India, the West Indies and South Africa -- including the late former captain Hansie Cronje -- have been issued punishments ranging up to life bans for under-performance, bribe-taking or passing information to bookmakers. In August, seven were charged in Bangladesh with match-fixing; former national captain Mohammad Ashraful had previously confessed to fixing matches. And in October, six international umpires were stood down following an India TV expose which alleged officials were willing to fix matches at the recent T20 World Cup in exchange for payment.","International Cricket Council says it is investigating former New Zealand players .

"(CNN) -- The most important question facing Washington today is: How do we move America forward? This question guides everything we do at Americans for Prosperity. From health care to taxes to environmental issues, we fight for policies that would give every American the best shot at a better life. But politicians in Washington don't want to answer this question. Even if they tried, they wouldn't know where to start. They're too busy attacking anyone with whom they disagree. Exhibit A: Writing on these pages several days ago, Brad Woodhouse from American Bridge 21st Century declared that we want to ""buy elections"" and pursue a ""self-serving"" agenda. Exhibit B: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid regularly takes to the Senate floor to denounce groups like Americans for Prosperity as ""un-American."" Moreover, everything we say, according to Reid, is ""untrue."" Dozens of Senate and House candidates have since parroted Reid's baseless assertions in stump speeches, campaign e-mails, and more. This is nothing more than the politics of personal destruction. Yet personal attacks are all they have in their playbook. Washington's record from the past few years doesn't stand up to scrutiny -- and they know it. They can't show how they've helped the people they claim to represent. Millions of Americans have been harmed by their bankrupt policies and broken promises. Look no further than Obamacare for proof. It has been nothing but a burden on hard-working American families. The country deserves to hear their stories. For months, we've worked with middle-class families in states like Arkansas, North Carolina, Michigan, Louisiana, and elsewhere. Obamacare canceled their plans and forced them to buy health insurance that they didn't want and couldn't afford. Between 6 and 9 million families experienced similar problems firsthand. Millions more found out that their new plans don't include their doctors or cost far more than expected. Everywhere we look, people are paying more but getting less. Their response? Call these people liars. It's a similar story with Washington's current energy policies. These, too, attack middle-class Americans. Take the example of the EPA regulations unveiled on June 2. It doesn't take an economist to see that these rules will increase electricity costs on families and businesses and kill jobs. Even The New York Times admits that ""jobs will indeed be lost"" and ""costs imposed"" by the new rules. These costs will disproportionately harm the middle class and the poor, who pay a greater percentage of their income on electricity and everyday goods. As for the effect on the climate? The EPA's own data shows that the new rules will only prevent 0.018 degrees Celsius of warming between now and 2100. Ask the Americans who lose their jobs whether this nearly nonexistent change is worth it. The list goes on. Washington's solution to every problem is to create a bureaucracy and lavish it with billions in taxpayer dollars. In return we get the Department of Veterans Affairs, the IRS, and bureaucracies that can barely function or actively harm Americans. Meanwhile, Washington's demands for higher taxes will stifle small business growth and job creation even though the economy is stalled and labor force participation is hovering near record lows. Ditto for the years of trillion dollar deficits and the $17.5 trillion dollar debt, which has nearly doubled since President Obama took office. Such unchecked, out-of-control spending -- which many in Washington only want to expand -- will harm our economy and American families for generations for to come. This is Washington's record. Such big government policies hobble the economy and harm the middle class, who invariably have to pick up the tab. But rather than help people, Washington's defenders attack us for pointing this out. We're fighting to create a better future -- but Washington is too busy holding America back.

"(CNN) -- Yet again, politics and race got mixed up together today, and this time with an added bonus -- adoption. In a segment on her MSNBC show, host Melissa Harris-Perry highlighted Mitt Romney's family photo, in which the former GOP presidential candidate held his newly adopted African-American grandson on his knee. She encouraged her panel to ""caption that"" picture. What followed was unfortunate, thoughtless commentary from the panel. (One of the panelists, Dean Obeidallah, appears on CNN shows and writes op-eds for CNN.com.) The exchange was a cold reminder of us of just how easy it is to flippantly do harm, and also of the dearth of understanding and sensitivity surrounding race and adoption . I am a transracial adoptee and advocate for children and families, so the complexities of race and adoption resonate on a personal level. I see myself in that Romney family photo. I was adopted from foster care when I was about 8 months old. My white parents recall that during the adoption process, there was little conversation about race or what it meant to have a baby of another race enter the family. The ""non-identifying"" adoption records I received as an adult articulated the agency's noncommittal stance on my race and noted that there was a birthmark present that ""could indicate"" I was of mixed race. With the reality that race was not something that was going to be discussed, how could anyone expect me or my family to know how to deal with issues of race and adoption? There was little to no education, so we were left to our own devices. When people did and said insensitive and cruel things, my sturdy New England parents simply loved me and cared for me the very best they could. According to a 2007 National Survey of Adoptive Parents, about 40% of adoptions in America are transracial (most are international adoptions) and that number is growing. Most transracial adoptions are with white adoptive parents. While there is a strong sense of community support surrounding many intercountry adoptions -- such as from South Korea and China -- black and white adoptions tends to be more polarizing. Thankfully, more resources are available today than during my 1971 adoption. Families can proactively seek out books, online help and support groups to be more in tune with the needs of their adopted children. But they have to be self-starters because transracial adoption is poorly studied and not tracked appropriately. What's lacking are longitudinal studies that focus on the transracial adoption experience. Without these, it's difficult to create and target additional programs and support systems, indeed to even make the case that they are needed. While to many, research that would yield such information would be useful and important, it seems to fall low on the funding priority list. Because of this, available data is old, limited and often inconsistent. This might also have something to do with issues of class, race and history that for many attend the idea of white parents adopting black and brown babies. Today there is no set national standard for training pre-adoptive parents that want to adopt a child of another race. Some agencies make it their mission to do as much as they can to prepare families, while others simply do not include differences in race and what that means to a family as part of their training. Against this backdrop, the misbegotten MSNBC jokes hurt. They don't help. They are another reminder that adoptive families need to be always at the ready to support their children on matters of race and adoption. White parents will never fully understand what it means to be black or brown, but they can and should do their best to support their children. And they should have help: Even the best adoptions managed by well-trained practitioners should offer robust post-adoption services and education that includes the language and tools to help adopted children as they grow and develop. When someone says or does something careless, the people that should know how to comfort the adopted person should not be at a loss. I remember in my white neighborhood that people during the summer would ask me if I was a ""fresh air"" child. While I did not understand it, I got the distinct impression that I did not belong where I was for some strange reason. And kids in my school would throw out barbs such as ""at least I know who my real parents are."" So often, the thoughtlessness and carelessness of others results in deep pain for adoptees, who are already faced with navigating a life-ong search for identity that begins with losing their original family. I can't help but feel for innocent little Kieran Romney as he is singled out at the very beginning of his adoption journey. When transracial adoption is mocked, it only works to undermine the foundation adoptees and adoptive families are trying to build. One hopes Kieran's parents received guidance before adopting him on the challenges they could face. Insensitivity, ignorance and intolerance will fuel negative comments. The answer is to better to prepare and educate adoptive parents, practitioners, educators and the media to the sensitivities of adoption and race. Transracially adoption children should be protected and empowered, not singled out and mocked. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of April Dinwoodie.","April Dinwoodie: MSNBC panel's flip jokes about Mitt Romney's grandchild were thoughtless .

"(CNN) -- Wouldn't moving objects with your mind be fun? But the implications go deeper: For the millions of Americans who live with paralysis, mentally controlling artificial limbs and mobility devices would be a big step forward toward more independent living. Melody Moore Jackson, director of the BrainLab at the Georgia Institute of Technology, is trying to make that happen. Jackson started this lab in 1998 to look at methods of brain control that didn't involve surgery. At that time, she estimates, there were about five labs working on the same topic of brain-computer interfaces. Now there are about 300. The BrainLab was one of the first to demonstrate that a person can control a robotic arm and a wheelchair with brain signals, Jackson said. ""We can literally influence the wiring of the brain, rewiring the brain, so to speak, to allow them to make new neural connections, and hopefully to restore movement to a paralyzed arm,"" Jackson said. About 6 million Americans live with paralysis, according to the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation. A smaller subset in need of such technologies consists of patients with locked-in syndrome, a rare neurological disorder. These patients feel, think, and understand language, but cannot move or speak -- they are ""prisoners in their own bodies,"" Jackson explained. A famous example is Jean-Dominique Bauby, who became locked-in after a stroke, and wrote the memoir ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" by blinking to indicate individual letters. Jackson wants to open up possibilities for people with locked-in syndrome to communicate and move. There has been a lot of activity in brain-computer interfaces to help such people. Another pioneering research group in this area is the laboratory of Miguel Nicolelis at Duke University Center for Neuroengineering. Nicolelis and colleagues have shown that a rhesus monkey in North Carolina could, using only its brain, control the walking patterns of a robot in Japan. In 2011, they got a monkey to move a virtual arm and feel sensations from it. This team is leading the Walk Again Project, an international consortium of research centers dedicated to creating brain-computer interfaces to restore movement. One technique that Jackson and colleagues use to harness brain signals is called functional near-infrared spectroscopy. This involves shining a light into the brain to discern how much activity is there, and examining the corresponding oxygen level. Light at a specific wavelength is beamed into the brain, and the oxygen present will absorb some of that light. This allows scientists to pick up on small differences in the blood's oxygenation. For example, scientists can place a sensor over the Brocca's area, a part of the brain essential for language. This area is activated when you talk to yourself inside your head or count silently, which is called subvocal speech. Scientists can use the oxygen levels associated with this to create a system of allowing a person to say ""yes"" and ""no"" just by thinking; ""no"" corresponds to no subvocal speech or nonsense syllables. The original hardware for a device that utilizes this technique was developed by Hitachi, and it allows a person with locked-in syndrome to say ""yes"" or ""no,"" Jackson said. But Jackson wanted to make something more interesting to learn. Her group created a hot-air balloon video game, where the balloon reflects the blood oxygenation level. Multiple locked-in syndrome patients can compete with each other in this game. ""It's not necessarily just for fun,"" Jackson said. ""We can actually say, 'Well, they got 70% of the obstacles correct, they were able to jump over the mountains or get through the wind.' And so it also allows us to collect data."" In the stroke rehabilitation arena, Jackson's group hopes to restore movement in people who have paralysis or partial paralysis in a limb. Researchers are looking at a rehabilitation robot called an exoskeleton, a device that a person sits in to be able to move limbs that they wouldn't otherwise. The robot can detect the brain signal corresponding to a person thinking about moving an arm, and then move the arm. ""What we're trying to do is make new neural connections from the brain to the arm,"" Jackson said. The lab has also developed a wheelchair that a person can drive by using brain signals, rather than moving a joystick or pressing buttons. Such brain-computer interfaces require that the user wear an EEG cap to measure brain signals, but setting one up is very complicated. Jackson hopes to make it accessible for anyone to use in their own home. ""You can imagine how much faster the therapy would go if you were doing it all the time,"" she said.","Melody Moore Jackson is the director of Georgia Tech's BrainLab .

"Watch the full interview with Ratan Tata on ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" at 1 p.m. ET Sunday on CNN. The Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai, India, temporarily increased security after being warned of a possible terrorist attack, the chairman of the company that owns the hotel said Saturday. Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata, whose company owns the Taj hotel, discusses this week's attacks in Mumbai. But Tata Group Chairman Ratan Tata said those measures, which were eased shortly before this week's terror attacks, could not have prevented gunmen from entering the hotel. ""If I look at what we had ... it could not have stopped what took place,"" Tata said in an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria that will air Sunday. ""It's ironic that we did have such a warning, and we did have some measures,"" Tata said, without elaborating on the warning or when security measures were enacted. ""People couldn't park their cars in the portico, where you had to go through a metal detector."" However, Tata said the attackers did not enter through the entrance that has a metal detector. Instead, they came in a back entrance, he said.  Watch Tata discuss need for better preparedness » . ""They knew what they were doing, and they did not go through the front. All of our arrangements are in the front,"" he said. ""They planned everything,"" he said of the attackers. ""I believe the first thing they did, they shot a sniffer dog and his handler. They went through the kitchen."" The 105-year-old hotel was one of nine sites attacked by gunmen in a 60-hour wave of terror that killed at least 183 people and injured hundreds more before it ended in a standoff at the hotel Saturday morning.  Learn more about the historic hotel's past and future » . Authorities carried out a room-by-room sweep in the 565-room Victorian building late Saturday to make sure that all guests had been evacuated and no gunmen remained inside. A. Vaidyanathan, an economist who was a guest in the Taj when the attacks occurred, told The Hindu newspaper on Friday that he had noticed tight security at the hotel when he stayed there last month. ""First, when you enter the open parking, where the cars are parked, you had a very heavy metal frame; your baggage was searched,"" he said. ""At the entrance of the foyer, there was another metal detector, and you were personally searched and so on."" However, for this latest trip, he said, he could walk right into the hotel without encountering the same measures. Bullet holes and scars of grenade blasts marred the restaurant walls in the Taj Mahal hotel, Tata said.  See images from the battlegrounds » . Tata said the attacks revealed deficiencies in law enforcement, especially in the areas of crisis response and management. ""We were getting the cooperation that they could give us, but the infrastructure was woefully poor,"" he said, . As an example, Tata said it took three hours for firefighters to get water to the Taj after a blaze broke out in the oldest part of the building. ""We had people who died being shot through bulletproof vests,"" he added. Tata said that not even the army or commandoes who ultimately took over the offensive were prepared for the level of organization and execution that the attackers seemed to have put into their plan. ""They seemed to know [the hotel] in the night or in the daytime,"" he said of the attackers. ""They seemed to have planned their moves quite well, and there seem to have been a lot of pre-planning."" Tata said the attacks underscored the need for law enforcement to develop infrastructure for crisis management, even if it meant seeking outside expertise for training, equipment and strategic operations. ""We've been very complacent, because we've really not had this kind of terrorism inflicted upon us,"" he said. ""We should not stand on ceremony to hold back. We should go to the best place possible to get expertise."" Tata was hopeful that the attacks would unite Indians behind a common goal of preventing a similar tragedy. ""Rather than have us succumb to this kind of terror, what it has done is given us a resolve that nobody can do this to us,"" he said. ""We're indignant, but we're not scared. If there's a view that this has pulled us down, I think it will unite the country that much more."" Tata said he derived those sentiments from members of his staff, who have pledged to stand behind him and restore the Taj to its former grandeur. ""The general manager lost his whole family in one of the fires in the building,"" Tata said. ""I went up to him today and I told him how sorry I was, and he said, 'Sir, we are going to beat this. We are going to build this Taj back into what it was. We're standing with you. We will not let this event take us down.'"" Tata added, ""And that is the feeling that they have, and I have a feeling that that's pretty much echoed throughout the country.""","Taj had heightened security in response to warning, Tata group chairman says .

"(CNN) -- The beautiful game's ugly underside was exposed on Monday as one of Europe's senior crime fighters revealed hundreds of games are under investigation in what he described as ""a sad day for European football."" Recent match-fixing scandals have centered on South Korea and South Africa, but Europol believes the highest levels of the game are now no longer safe with alleged corruption in two Champions League matches discovered, including one played in England, with 680 games in all being probed across the globe. ""This is the work of a suspected organized crime syndicate based in Asia and operated with criminal networks around Europe,"" Rob Wainwright, director of European law enforcement agency Europol, told reporters, following its 18-month probe. ""It is clear to us this is the biggest-ever investigation into suspected match-fixing in Europe. It has yielded major results which we think have uncovered a big problem for the integrity of football in Europe. We have uncovered an extensive criminal network."" A total of 380 games in Europe -- including World Cup and European Championship qualifiers -- have been deemed suspicious, with 425 match and club officials and criminals involved from 15 different countries. The Champions League match in England, which took place in the ""last three or four years"", is now subject to ""ongoing judicial proceedings."" It is estimated that €16 million ($21.7m) had been bet on matches by criminals, yielding an €8 million ($10.8m) profit, with the highest single bribe of €140,000 paid in Austria. Wainwright will be writing to UEFA president Michel Platini to inform him of Europol's findings. ""I'm a committed football fan,"" added Europol's director of European law enforcement agency. ""I'm encouraged by the serious way many football administrators are taking it and by the results of this investigation."" A further 300 matches outside of Europe, including in South America and Africa, are also under suspicion. Most of the international level football matches involved were with national teams in Africa, Asia, Central and South America -- including two World Cup qualifiers in Africa and one in South America. ""CAF does not intend to take any action until receipt of the full disclosed information to be made available to us,"" said the Confederation of African Football (CAF) in a statement. ""Second, CAF will take action if the fixed matches fall within our jurisdiction at the continental level, and national when required."" Last month FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke branded match-fixing a ""disease"" in an interview with CNN just weeks after lifetime bans were handed to 41 South Korean players found guilty of prearranging matches. The president of the South African Football Association was suspended in December ahead of an investigation into match-fixing in the country prior to it hosting the 2010 World Cup. Chris Eaton is a former head of security at football's global governing body FIFA who now works for Qatar-based sports security consultancy ICSS. He warned the threat facing soccer is greater than ever and that governments must do more to combat it. ""Sport is now under unprecedented attack from criminals and opportunists who conspire to manipulate the results of competitions around the world,"" Eaton said in a statement. ""What is apparent is that there is a clear absence of effective and collective government control on international gambling that deters match-fixers and organized criminals. ""It is this absence of governmental supervision at a global level where the real fight against match fixing and the manipulation of sport outcomes must now be fought.""

"(CNN) -- Horace Silver, the innovative and prolific jazz pianist best known for such pieces as ""Song for My Father"" and ""The Preacher,"" has died. He was 85. Silver died Wednesday in New Rochelle, New York, according to a statement from his longtime label, Blue Note Records. ""A pioneer of hard bop and original founder of The Jazz Messengers, Horace tempered bebop with elements of gospel, blues and R&B to create a soulful modern jazz concept that came to identify the 'Blue Note Sound,' "" said the legendary jazz label. The pianist was known for his light touch and ability to combine a variety of styles in his nimble playing. Though known for ""hard bop"" -- an offshoot of bebop -- he seldom let boundaries contain his playing. ""His funky, unique and infectious piano-playing style set a standard for many pianists to follow, further cementing his well-deserved legacy,"" the Recording Academy said in a statement. Mainstream audiences might be most familiar with Silver's ""Song for My Father,"" a mid-'60s composition that starts with a keyboard phrase later borrowed by Steely Dan for ""Rikki Don't Lose That Number."" But unlike the brooding ""Rikki,"" which came out a decade later, Silver's composition is upbeat and joyful, with sprightly horns and rhythms evoking the island birthplace of Silver's father, the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde. Silver dedicated the piece to his dad and put him on the cover of the ""Song for My Father"" LP (1965). Silver was born in 1928 in Norwalk, Connecticut. He got his big break when the popular saxophonist Stan Getz heard him one night and asked him to join him in New York. ""I had maybe $700 in the bank and I had spent all that money on doctor bills,"" he said in an interview with the magazine All About Jazz. ""But the good Lord was looking after me and Stan Getz came through Hartford and heard me and my trio and hired us. That was a blessing."" He formed the Jazz Messengers with drummer Art Blakey in 1953, then left to form his own group two years later.

"(CNN) -- The voices in the video tell the story. ""Something crazy is going on outside,"" a woman shouts. ""I'm scared."" Moments later, the same voice yells that a tree has fallen and another says, ""It's on that guy's camper."" Overturned campers, downed trees . The footage posted on the website of CNN affiliate WAVY came from the Cherrystone Family Camping Resort on the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, where a tornado on Thursday toppled campers and sent trees crashing onto vehicles. State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said a New Jersey couple died when a tree fell on their tent and 36 people were hospitalized -- including the couple's 13-year-old son. He was in critical condition. She identified the fatalities as Lord Balatbat and Lolabeth Ortega, both 38, of Jersey City. According to Geller, more than 1,300 people were staying at the campground and police have accounted for all of them, plus 40 Cherrystone staff members. Photos from the scene in Northampton County showed overturned campers, with a downed tree crushing one vehicle. The area was under a tornado warning, and Danielle Rivera -- who shot the video footage -- told WAVY of giant hail and crushing winds that tore off the awning of her family's camper. ""I was terrified"" ""I was terrified,"" the 17-year-old Rivera said. ""I was so scared."" She and her mother decided to stay in the camper until the hail and wind relented enough for them to make a dash to their car. ""I thought a tree was going to fall on us,"" she said. Survivors were bused to a local high school set up as a temporary shelter, and workers made sure the devastated campground was safe before allowing anyone to return, Geller said. The injured were taken to four different medical centers, with most going to Riverside Shore Memorial Hospital, she said. Tornado warning . According to the National Weather Service, a cluster of ""supercells"" ahead of a cold front formed a storm over Chesapeake Bay just after 8 a.m. ET. The storm intensified as it moved on ashore about 30 minutes later. The area was under a tornado warning issued at 8:20 a.m., and Geller said the weather service confirmed that an EF-1 tornado hit the campground. An EF-1 tornado has wind speeds of 73-112 mph. Cherrystone opened in 1964 occupies 300 acres with 725 sites including cabins, cottages, and deluxe campers, its website says. Geller told reporters that the tornado appeared to come off the water and hit the campground. It also knocked over a tractor-trailer on a nearby road, injuring the driver, she said. All the other damage and injuries occurred at the campground, Geller said, adding that most of those sent to hospitals had been treated and released. Rivera told WAVYthat she and her family had been going there for 10 years, but ""never have I ever witnessed anything this bad.""","NEW: The National Weather Service confirms an F1 tornado in Virginia .

"(CNN) -- You may have just unwrapped your new iPad 2, but rumors are already swirling about the iPad 3. The always-fertile field of Apple rumors is once again blossoming furiously, as tech observers pore over the most minute tidbits of information to speculate on the future of the market-leading Apple tablet. While much of the chatter is just that, there are a few details to be gleaned in all the usual fervor that precedes an Apple ""iLaunch."" It was January 2010 when Apple unveiled the ""magical"" iPad, introducing much of the general public to the concept of a tablet computer for the first time. With the massive Consumer Electronics Show set for January 10-13 and MacWorld/iWorld -- billed as ""the world's ultimate fan event"" for Apple lovers -- scheduled for January 26-28, observers are wondering whether Apple could soon roll out the third generation of the device. On Thursday morning, the conventional wisdom in the blogosphere seemed virtually sure that Apple would do so. But by Friday, many tech pundits were saying there's no way it will happen. Tomorrow? Who knows? ""We've entered a post-iPhone news cycle, when iPad rumors are surfacing with full force,"" wrote Leslie Horn for PC Magazine. ""Of course the launch date has been discussed quite a bit, as it goes with any anticipated Apple device. ... But the reality with an Apple gadget is that we'll have to wait and see."" Other tidbits making the rounds? That a new model will be rolled out February 24, which would have been Steve Jobs' birthday, or in March, the same month the iPad 2 was introduced. Richard Shim, an analyst at research firm DisplaySearch, told CNET that a January release date might be wishful thinking. January is ""a little suspect,"" Shim told the blog. ""When they make them available they want to have as many as possible. And my sense is that they will wait rather than make them immediately available."" But from folks who monitor the supply chain of Apple components in Asia and other analysts, a few plausible details have emerged: . Faster processor. Several reports have suggested that the new iPads will have a new, faster processor that will offer quicker browsing, gaming and other activity. Apple recently started using a plant in Austin, Texas, to manufacture computer chips, according to a Reuters report and other sources. Analysts have speculated that facility, owned by Samsung, could be the source of the new processors. Sharper screen. It's also a relatively safe bet to expect a higher-resolution screen, an upgrade that's been a staple in most new permutations of Apple's mobile products. Reports of a much stronger battery have also surfaced in multiple places and seem to have some merit. Voice control. One can't help wonder whether Apple will add Siri, the iPhone 4S's voice-control ""virtual assistant,"" to the new iPad as well. A cheaper iPad. Also possible is that Apple will attempt to address, in some way, the recent success of the smaller, simpler Kindle Fire tablet from Amazon, which costs $300 less than the entry-level iPad 2. No single tablet computer from Apple's competitors had gained much traction until Amazon rolled out the Fire this holiday season. The company says it sold more than 4 million Kindles in December, and most of those are believed to be Kindle Fires. How Apple may address that competition has prognosticators split. Taiwan-based DigiTimes, which sparked much of Thursday's speculation with a report that the new iPad will be unveiled in January, also reported that the company will roll out two new tablets and that the iPad 2 would get a price cut to let it compete more directly with the Fire. (It should be noted that DigiTimes has a somewhat spotty track record, doing pretty well with reports out of its native Taiwan but missing the mark more often on other news). The same site quoted unnamed sources just two weeks ago saying that Apple would be unveiling a 7-inch tablet to match the Fire, a departure that would seem unlikely unless it was in the works well before Amazon's new gadget was announced. Shim attempted to throw cold water on the concept that Apple will take a step back in features to try to snuff Amazon. ""They don't want to create any hint of a second-class product,"" he told CNET. ""They have no reason. They're selling as many as they can make. And this next-generation device is going to reinforce that supply-demand dynamic.""","Rumors about the iPad 3 are heating up as 2012 dawns .

"(CNN) -- After a string of real celebrity deaths last week, the Internet and online social networks killed a few more stars. Pop star Britney Spears was among those falsely claimed to be dead recently. Despite what you may have read, Jeff Goldblum, Natalie Portman, George Clooney, Britney Spears, Harrison Ford and Rick Astley are alive. Fake news of their deaths flew across the Internet -- particularly on online social networks like Twitter and Facebook -- after Michael Jackson, Farrah Fawcett and Ed McMahon were reported dead. The situation is calling attention to the changing state of the news media: As information online moves faster and comes from more sources, it's more difficult to verify what's true and what may be shockingly false. Some have downplayed the situation, saying the rumors are not harmful. Others find the situation offensive in light of the actual deaths last week. Internet-savvy readers can tell the difference between fake news and real information that has been verified by a trusted blogger or mainstream news reporter, said Gabriel Snyder, managing editor at Gawker, a celebrity news and gossip blog not associated with the rumors. ""It's easier than ever to publish stuff, and the human condition is a complicated thing. Some people just like to be responsible for starting something,"" he said, noting that the trend is not especially new. Others say the fake deaths, or ""death pranks,"" show an inherent problem with the decentralization of news on the Internet. The man who claims indirect responsibility for several of the recent fake celebrity deaths is Rich Hoover, whose site, fakeawish.com, allows users to input celebrity names into five false news templates with outlandish stories about their deaths. Hoover said the site's fans used its story-generation power to start rumors that Goldblum, Ford, Portman and Clooney had died. Traffic on his site jumped from a few thousand users per day to about 500,000 in the two days after Michael Jackson's death, he said. A fake story that appears to have been generated by the site claimed that Portman had died after falling off a cliff in New Zealand. But while a small disclaimer tells readers the story is false, Hoover said many Twitter and Facebook users re-post links after reading only a story headline. ""I'm absolutely flabbergasted by the success of this and the impact these social networks have on communication -- and the communication of misinformation,"" he said. About 85 percent of the recent traffic on Hoover's site came from Facebook and Twitter, he said, adding that the traffic does help him make money. CNN could not independently verify that the celebrity rumors started from Hoover's site. CNN's user-generated news community, iReport.com, was criticized for spreading celebrity death rumors following Michael Jackson's death. One of the site's users sent in a post saying Astley had died. That false news about the singer of ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" was not aired on CNN or CNN.com, both of which vet iReports for accuracy before using them in reporting. For pop star Spears, the recent false news came across Twitter, a micro-blogging site where users post 140-character messages. After a post said Spears had died, a correction was posted to her Twitter feed on Sunday, saying ""Britney's Twitter was just hacked. The last message is obviously not true. She is fine and dandy spending a quiet day at home relaxing."" News surrounding deaths is very sensitive and must be correct, said Elaine Haney, president of tributes.com, an obituary site that verifies deaths, often through funeral homes, before posting. ""You never want to kill somebody by accident,"" she said. She added, ""I don't think there's much good to say about somebody who would joke about something serious like that. It's unfortunate."" The fake news may not be all bad for celebrities. Goldblum, for example, went on Comedy Central's ""The Colbert Report"" to dispel rumors that he had died. In the episode, host Stephen Colbert jokes that he thinks Goldblum is dead even as the actor appears on stage beside him. Goldblum then posts to Twitter to try to prove that he is still living. ""Oh my God! Ladies and gentlemen, I have huge news,"" Colbert says, upon reading Goldblum's tweet on his phone. ""The dead can Twitter."" Goldblum then reads his own false obituary into the camera.","Online news stories falsely claimed some celebrities had died .

"(CNN) -- You may be relieved or even ecstatic about the end of a symbol of terror, or maybe it seems like the pain is just beginning all over again. Both of these reactions to the death of Osama bin Laden, who was killed by U.S. troops in Pakistan, are natural, experts say. From the celebrations in Washington and New York, it looks like lots of people are happy. Chants of ""USA! USA!"" reverberated outside the White House and at New York's ground zero as crowds celebrated the death of the terrorist leader,  President Obama announced Sunday. As far as the collective American psyche goes, it makes sense that this is a moment of celebration, says Columbia University psychiatrist Dr. Jeffery Lieberman. The country has been experiencing emotional malaise, with a slow-moving economy, a sense of America losing its No. 1 status in the world, and a decade of pent-up anguish about the threat of terrorism. Much like the World War II years, these have been uncertain times. Then, rumors of bin Laden's death, confirmed by an announcement from the president, lifted that burden of pain and helplessness. ""In the blink of an eye, the gloom and doom and pessimism has dissipated,"" Lieberman said. After bin Laden: What does it mean to you? But wait a minute: Should we rejoice in the death of another human being? But although bin Laden claimed responsibility for the destruction of the World Trade Center and the deaths of thousands of Americans, the outpouring of celebration doesn't feel right for everyone. David Sirota, a newspaper columnist and a contributor to Salon felt uncomfortable with the jubilation because he said there is a ""difference between relief and euphoria."" ""A euphoric response instead of somber relief suggests that we are celebrating revenge. We are not celebrating an end to the war,"" he said, comparing it to the public's euphoria when World War II ended. ""What's a little scary about this: We were once a country that saw violence as regrettable, but sometimes necessary act. But we're not celebrating end of violence, but the exercise of it."" Josh Pesavento, 22, a journalism student in New York who photographed the cheering crowds in Times Square on Monday morning, also felt conflicted about the celebrations he witnessed. ""I don't believe that any person has the right to kill anyone, and I don't think that we should be cheering for yet more loss of life. However, I tell myself that in this situation, these people may be cheering for the end of an icon who led to the death of far, far too many,"" Pesavento said. For some, bin Laden represents an idea more than a person who lived and died. More than the death of a human being, this ends the life of a powerful symbol of terrorism and destruction, said Nadine Kaslow, psychologist at Emory University. Bin Laden's death hits closer to home in the U.S. than the capture and execution of Saddam Hussein, for example, because the Iraqi dictator did not directly attack American soil, she said. The celebratory mood reflects a sense that fairness and justice had been restored and that a terrorist got his comeuppance, said Kaslow. ""I think people feel like this guy got what he deserved. It was a sense that it was 'our family' that was killed,"" she said. But there are likely others who aren't chanting on the streets for whom the death of bin Laden brings back painful memories of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, she said. People who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001, may have symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, and the killing of bin Laden may open old wounds, Lieberman said. ""It doesn't bring their loved ones back. It doesn't ease their pain. There was so much more to this than catching bin Laden. At best, they would be bittersweet: It feels good to have the relief of this guy being gone, but the pain of their loss is very strong and very real to them,"" said Dr. Susan Nolen-Hoeksema, a Yale University psychologist. Is it morally right to celebrate bin Laden's death? Diana Massaroli, who lost her husband, Michael Massaroli, in the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, said the news of bin Laden's death made her feel an ""overall calm that I haven't felt in 10 years."" ""I feel better ... like I can start a new chapter in my life."" Sirota and Kaslow likened bin Laden's death to the execution of a convicted murderer of someone's family, which may bring a sense of closure for some. In the case of bin Laden, though, there is fear of retaliation from terrorist groups. ""Relief also comes with a kind of sadness that the victims can never be brought back and sadness at the world that creates such a perpetrator,"" Sirota said. Even people who didn't feel the direct impact of the attacks on September 11, 2001, will feel relief, Kaslow said. After all, everyone gets reminded of the global insecurity that resulted whenever they go to the airport. The terrorist leader's living situation also doesn't bring about any sympathy -- he wasn't starving and struggling in a cave, but rather lived in a mansion, which adds to his perceived arrogance, Kaslow said. The news of bin Laden's death ""allows us to put some sort of order"" to the horror of 9-11 because otherwise, ""it's upsetting, disconcerting when we're reminded how unpredictable life, death and the world around us could be,"" said Sam Sommer, associate professor of psychology at Tufts University. People's reactions are likely tied to how emotionally and personally they felt to the events 10 years ago, Sommer said. ""It seems to me that the emotional reaction had a lot to do with the differences in how people view this -- whether it's the right triumphing over evil -- a lot of young people are viewing this in that way,"" Nolen-Hoeksema said. She noted that her teenage son and his friends were enthusiastically tweeting about the news in a tone that ""this is a bad guy, the good guys got him finally -- that's all they are seeing."" After, all Jack Bauer of ""24"" was trending on Twitter. But the one common factor was that everyone felt a need to share the news and their observations -- whether it was rallying in front of the White House, or tweeting or updating their Facebook page. ""These emotionally charged events send us back to our social roots and make us need to affiliate with other people,"" Sommer said. CNN's Nicole Saidi contributed to this report.","Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. troops in Pakistan, President Obama announced Sunday .

"(CNN) -- A bungled break-in, Deep Throat, a defiant President Richard Nixon declaring, ""I am not a crook."" These are what often come to mind when people hear the word Watergate. But another legacy of the infamous scandal has re-emerged in this year's presidential race. Many Americans may not remember, but public outrage over Watergate led to the enactment of a series of campaign finance reforms designed to restore the country's faith in government. While the nation marks the 40th anniversary of the Watergate break-in later this year, some observers say our political leaders have already forgotten a key lesson of Watergate: that anonymous money corrupts political campaigns. Opinion: It took a scandal to get real campaign finance reform . ""Watergate was basically a campaign finance scandal,"" says Chris Dolan, a political science professor at Lebanon Valley College in Pennsylvania. Dolan and others say this historical amnesia can be seen in the U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which allows corporations and unions to give unlimited campaign donations to so-called super PACs as long as those political action committees are not coordinated with a candidate's campaign. Super PACs can quickly pull in huge amounts of money. They have the option of disclosing their donors and donations either semiannually or quarterly in a nonelection year, and quarterly or monthly in an election year. Critics say super PACs are dangerous because they can delay disclosing details of donations until after elections take place, and they can easily work around restrictions against coordinating with a candidate's campaign. ""Citizens United will lead to a future that will make Watergate look tame,"" Dolan says. ""There will be more elections with fewer controls, more spending and great secrecy. The post-Watergate regulations are, in effect, dead."" Others say the Watergate reforms actually hurt the election process and that the damage can be seen in this year's presidential race. The post-Watergate restrictions on campaign fundraising inspired savvy political operators to devise more backdoor ways than ever to steer big money to candidates, says political scientist David Schaefer. Campaign operators usually stay ahead of campaign reformers, says Schaefer, a professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts. He points to the 2002 McCain-Feingold law as an example. The law set strict limits on contributions to candidates and parties. The result: the rise of ""independent"" PACs that can receive up to $5,000 from an individual or a national party committee in a calendar year. PACs often make it easier for a candidate's supporters to attack their opponents, Schaefer says. ""The candidates cannot be held accountable or responsible for anything PACs say on their behalf, even if there are scurrilous charges that amount to pure mudslinging,"" he says. A slush fund . From the very beginning of Watergate, campaign contributions were intertwined with the scandal. It began on June 17, 1972, when a security guard called Washington police after discovering white masking tape plastered over a door in a sprawling apartment and office complex known as the Watergate. Five men in business suits were arrested for breaking into the offices of the Democratic National Committee. Investigators later discovered that one of the burglars had a $25,000 check from President Nixon's Committee for the Re-election of the President (known as CRP, or CREEP) deposited in his bank account. Nixon aides had dispatched the burglars to the Democratic headquarters to gather intelligence on his political opponents. To cover up the break-in, the president would take the nation on a two-year series of events that came to be known as Watergate. Before resigning in disgrace in 1974, Nixon would order wiretaps for reporters, misuse the Internal Revenue Service, FBI and CIA for political purposes, and prompt a showdown with the Supreme Court. At the end, 30 government officials were convicted, and a disgusted nation began to lose faith in government. Keeping illegal donations hidden was a prime concern of the Nixon White House after the arrests, says Barry Sussman, a former Washington Post editor who helped lead coverage into the scandal. Nixon didn't just cover up a burglary. His re-election campaign chiefs had asked for and received millions in illegal, secret contributions from major American companies. ""They went around with a very heavy hand, telling corporations that we're going to win and you better get on board. You don't want to be against us,"" says Sussman, author of ""The Great Coverup: Nixon and the Scandal of Watergate. ""That's called extortion."" So much secret money was pouring into the Nixon White House that there were reports of bags of money being delivered to Nixon's re-election campaign, says Gerry Keim, chairman of the management department at Arizona State University's business school. ""There was a slush fund,"" Keim says. ""They were extorting money from corporate interests with the threat of using the IRS to audit them if they didn't comply."" Corporations expected something in return, and Nixon delivered. His administration intervened in an antitrust action against one corporation that had given it money and relaxed regulations for a milk company that had done the same. Congressional investigators who discovered Nixon's shakedown of corporations decided that the campaign finance system needed to be reformed, says Cornell law professor Robert Hockett. ""There was a widespread public perception that the political process had been thoroughly corrupted,"" Hockett says. ""Public policy seemed to be up for sale to the highest bidder."" Why reforms faltered . Congress attempted to change that perception by passing laws that created a system of public financing for political campaigns. Disclosure laws were enacted to root out secret donors. Limits were placed on campaign donations and private expenditures. (A candidate, for example, can't use campaign money for noncampaign spending.) A bipartisan Federal Election Commission would monitor compliance with the reforms. Yet those reforms were challenged almost as soon as they were enacted. In 1976, a divided Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo stuck down campaign expenditure limits, equating money with free speech. Two decades before the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the judiciary was already gutting Watergate's electoral reforms, Hockett says. ""Thanks to Buckley and its progeny, including Citizens United, the post-Watergate electoral reforms have been all but eviscerated,"" Hockett says. ""We basically have little if anything left in the way of meaningful, democracy-protecting campaign finance regulations."" Maybe that's just as well, some political scientists say -- that the post-Watergate campaign finance reforms, and others like it, were never destined to last because the flow of money in politics can never be stopped. Big money and secrecy corrupts? The best solution for fighting the potentially corrupting influence of big money in politics, they say, is sunlight. ""The real remedy is publicity,"" says Schaefer, the Holy Cross professor. ""It should be illegal to donate to any political candidate beyond a certain figure -- let's say $1,000 -- or even a political action committee without immediately disclosing it on the Internet."" Transparency, though, isn't enough when big-money donors are treated like ordinary voters, says former editor Sussman. ""That's not 'one man, one vote,' "" he says. ""Corporations can give all they want. Some speech is overwhelming other forms of speech. That's not democracy."" Sussman says many people have forgotten one of the most important lessons of Watergate: that big money and secrecy corrupts. The amount of secret money in this year's presidential race will dwarf the amount Nixon extorted, he says. ""Nobody would have predicted that these enormous outlays of secret money would now become legal,"" he says. But political scientist Peter Hanson says money is such a dominant force in politics that trying to prevent big-money interests from getting involved is like trying to fight nature. Attempted reforms of the campaign finance system date further back than Watergate to the Progressive-era reforms of the early 20th century, says Hanson, an assistant professor at the University of Denver. Demanding transparency in campaign donations may be the most realistic reform possible because it gives voters the information needed to hold candidates accountable, he says. ""Money in politics is like the Mississippi River flowing into the ocean,"" Hanson says. ""You're not going to stop the river. You have to direct it in the ways that will best protect public integrity.""","Americans may have forgotten a key legacy of Watergate, professors say .

"(CNN) -- Violent incidents early Friday, including the shooting death of a college police officer, kept Bostonians on edge just days after the bombing of the iconic Boston Marathon. Howling sirens pierced the night quiet, and flashing lights lit up the darkness, as dozens of officers from state and city police responded to the deadly shooting on the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Hardly an hour later, they were chasing suspects in a hijacked vehicle just less than five miles away. There were reports that explosives may have been involved before police cornered the vehicle. ""Police were in a standoff with the vehicle just down the hill,"" said CNN photographer Gabe Ramirez saw the chase end in Watertown. They ordered the suspect out of vehicle and commanded he strip down naked before putting him in a patrol car and transporting him away from the scene, Ramirez said. Police ran down the streets of Watertown, according to CNN affiliate WCVB, which broadcast images from the pursuit. One man could be seen lying face down on the street in a surrender pose with his hands outstretched in front of him and his legs crossed. Dozens of police from various units arrived in Watertown, some in SWAT uniforms, others wearing helmets. Large crowds gathered around a trove of emergency vehicles that had congregated in the neighborhood, WCVB reported. But even with all this activity it was unclear if the arrest in Watertown was related to the shooting on the MIT campus or any other incident in the Boston area. How it began . The nightly mayhem began, after a university police officer died in a shooting on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus in Cambridge late Thursday, state police spokesman Lt. Mark Riley said. The MIT officer was responding to a disturbance when he was fired upon, according to the state district attorney's office. He sustained ""multiple gunshot wounds."" State police and the FBI were called in after the shooting and found the campus policeman near Building 32 on MIT's campus. He was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, the district attorney's office said. Dozens of officers surrounded and cordoned off the building, known as the Stata Center, which houses computer science laboratories as well as the department of linguistics and philosophy, according to MIT's website. The university, which lies adjacent to the city of Boston, requested people stay away from the building as police considered the situation potentially dangerous. Students and faculty received e-mails to alert them to the event, CNN affiliate WCVB reported. Residents in the area have been on edge after two bombs ripped through the crowd near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring about 180 others. Police are seeking two suspects in the attack, and they are still at large. Many news media outlets are in the area covering the investigation into Monday's bombings and arrived at MIT to cover the shooting, WCVB reported. The Stata Center also contains a food court, WCVB said. It serves as a gathering area for students.","NEW: A chaotic scene occurs in Watertown .

"(CNN) -- It was late, the football game was over, and I was ready for bed. The problem was, I couldn't find the remote control. It wasn't right next to me on the couch in my hotel room and I was too lazy -- or drunk -- to dig between the cushions to look for it. So after a couple of glances, I decided to just turn the TV off manually and worry about finding the remote in the morning. I slid my hand down the sides, ran my fingers across the top, bent down and looked along the bottom and even tried tapping the screen, as if it were a 48"" iPad. Nothing. Now, again -- I had been drinking. But I don't think Jack and Cokes were the reasons why I had no idea how to turn the TV off. As I was fumbling around looking for something that looked like a power button, it dawned on me: I hadn't manually turned off a television in years. Eventually I grew tired of looking and decided to just unplug the damn thing and take my drunken self to bed. And this is what technology has turned me and I suspect many Americans into: Automated idiot savants. Tell me, how many people with smartphones actually know their boyfriend's or girlfriend's telephone number and can dial it from memory? I've been with my partner for three years and after the area code, I couldn't tell you a single digit that's in his number. We met one night, exchanged numbers and I haven't dialed it since. Special series: Our mobile society . Funny -- I used to joke that if I ever lost all of the contacts backed up on my computer, I wouldn't be able to call my own mama. Now I realize that I really wasn't joking. I don't know my mama's number. Not only that, I don't know her address either. I know where she lives, but if I was suddenly cut off from all technology, I would have to get in my car and drive three hours just to say ""hi."" All of which brings me to this: For all of the wonderful conveniences technology has brought into our lives, there is something to be said about all of the little things that have been lost because of these advancements as well. Like knowing by heart the telephone numbers of the people we care about. Stopping in a gas station and asking another human being for directions. Going to a record store. I can remember spending hours with my high school friends roaming the Harmony House record store in downtown Detroit. The first 45 I ever bought was Bon Jovi's ""Wanted Dead or Alive,"" and I can remember my black friends teasing me for liking ""white people's music."" Now, I am sure on some level I am simply romanticizing life before Steve Jobs. I am not against the technological progress we've made -- I'm just trying to put it into context. Technology can deliver a song faster to us, but there are some things in life that can't be rushed. To this day, I still think ""Wanted Dead or Alive"" is one of the greatest songs of all time. But more importantly, the interaction that came from purchasing that song as well as other conversations that occurred in that store over the years helped shape me into the person I am today. You know, my son hates it when I tell him to grab a dictionary whenever he asks me how to spell a word he can't figure out with spellcheck. ""Dad, just tell me,"" he would say. And I would say, ""No, otherwise you won't learn."" Don't get me wrong, spell-check's a great tool, and I use it. But it pays to know the long way in case you can't take the shortcut. I have seen my penmanship become increasingly illegible over the past 20 years because despite being a writer, I don't really write. I type. And so over time, using a keyboard exclusively has led to a degree of atrophy in my writing hand. Now I can barely get through handwriting a personal note in a greeting card before noticing a little pain or soreness. Some people may wonder what all the fuss is about. It's no big deal that I don't know by heart my loved ones' phone numbers, as long as I have them programmed in my phone. Right? It's easy and convenient and efficient. I guess I'm wondering if technology has gone from assisting us in our lives to taking over our lives. In a recent Vodaphone survey, 54% of the responders said it was OK to pick up the phone while out to dinner and 57% said they'd pick it up while going to the bathroom. But the thing that really got me is that 33% thinks it's OK to pick up their cell phone during sex. SEX!!??!! That's when I think this whole technology take over goes from being funny to a bit sad. (Unless they're taking pictures ... in which case I say, carry on.) The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of LZ Granderson.","LZ Granderson: I hadn't manually turned off TV in years .

"(CNN) -- Before dying, 2-year-old Riley Ann Sawyers was beaten with belts, picked up by her hair, thrown across the room and held under water, according to an affidavit from the Galveston County Sheriff's Office. Police believe 2-year-old Riley Ann Sawyers is ""Baby Grace."" The affidavit says the girl's mother, Kimberly Dawn Trenor, described to police how her daughter died and was put in a plastic storage box that Trenor and her husband, Royce Zeigler, later dumped into a Galveston waterway. Trenor told police Zeigler tried to commit suicide the weekend before Thanksgiving, and wrote a note that said, ""My wife is innocent of the sins that I committed."" The body of the then-unidentified toddler was found on October 29. A fisherman found Riley's body stuffed inside a blue storage container that washed up on an uninhabited island in Galveston's West Bay. A medical examiner said the child's skull was fractured, and a forensic dentist estimated her age at 2 to 3 years. Police dubbed the child ""Baby Grace.""  A police artist's sketch of her was widely circulated in the news media and prompted a call to Galveston police from Riley's grandmother in Ohio, who had not seen the girl in months. On Saturday, police arrested Trenor and Zeigler on charges of injuring a child and tampering with physical evidence, the sheriff's department said. Their bonds were set at $350,000 each. The affidavit, obtained by CNN, says when police interviewed Trenor on November 23, she ""gave a voluntary statement on video with her attorney present in which she describes her involvement, with Royce Zeigler, in the physical abuse, death and disposal of the remains of her daughter, Riley Ann Sawyers."" Trenor's statement said on July 24, she and Zeigler both beat the child with leather belts and held her head under water in the bathtub. She said Zeigler picked the girl up by her hair and also threw her across the room, slamming her head into the tile floor. After her daughter died, Trenor's statement said, she and Zeigler went to a Wal-Mart that night and bought the Sterilite container, a shovel, concrete mix, and other supplies. The statement said the box containing the child's body was hidden in a storage shed for ""one to two months.""  Then, Trenor said, she and Zeigler carried it to the Galveston Causeway and tossed it in, and she saw it drifting away. Riley Ann's father, Robert Sawyers, on Monday tearfully remembered her as a ""fun-loving girl ... with a big imagination.""  Watch Riley Ann's father describe the little girl » . Riley was ""very active, very hyper, but also very well-behaved,"" Sawyers told reporters in Mentor, Ohio. She would play ""with a water hose ... spraying the whole patio soaking wet until she was done with it,"" he said, as he sat behind two photographs of his daughter, a toddler with wispy blond curls. Robert Sawyers' mother, Sheryl Sawyers, said the family was ""devastated"" to learn that police believe Riley is dead. ""It's hard to think that I'll never see her again,"" she said, clutching a red Elmo doll she had planned to give Riley for Christmas. Maj. Ray Tuttoilmondo of the Galveston County Sheriff's Department said Monday that authorities are ""fairly confident"" that the toddler whose body was found on October 29 is Riley Ann Sawyers. DNA analysis is still in progress to confirm the identification. The results will be available in two to three weeks, Tuttoilmondo said. Tuttoilmondo said Riley is originally from Mentor, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb, and that ""she and her mother came down to Texas earlier this year."" The toddler was last seen in Texas ""three or four months ago,"" Tuttoilmondo said, although he did not know by whom. Tuttoilmondo said police did investigate whether Child Protective Services had taken Riley away, something the mother had reportedly alleged. Of that report, Tuttoilmondo said, ""What we believe is that is not what happened."" The affidavit said Trenor admitted that after the body was found, Zeigler had her type up a fake letter from the Ohio Department of Children's Services saying that Riley was to be taken away. Trenor left Ohio in late May, after filing an allegation of domestic violence against Robert Sawyers and reaching a joint voluntary agreement that gave her custody of Riley and gave Robert Sawyers visitation rights, the Sawyers' family lawyer said Monday. ""She disappeared,"" Laura DePledge said Monday at the Ohio news conference with the Sawyers. Sheryl Sawyers said Monday that she saw widely distributed police sketches of ""Baby Grace"" and contacted Galveston police in November. The girl in the police sketches strongly resembles photos of Riley. ""No, I never did think it would end up like this,"" Sheryl Sawyers said Monday, eyes welling. ""I guess knowing is better than not knowing."" The girl's family in Ohio has been ""very helpful"" in this case, Tuttoilmondo said, adding that the FBI and a Galveston County police officer visited the family in Ohio on Sunday. DePledge said Riley was the product of a ""teenage pregnancy."" Trenor and Robert Sawyers were together for two years as a result of the pregnancy, DePledge said, during which time they lived with Sheryl Sawyers. DePledge said Monday that the family, whose grief she described as ""simply overwhelming,"" wants Riley's body returned to Ohio for a memorial service. ""What Riley needs is to be brought home,"" she said. ""I think this family needs some closure."" Tuttoilmondo asked anyone who knew the child or her family to help detectives reconstruct the events of Riley's short life. The toddler's case has touched even hardened police officers, he said. ""Any way you look at it, we carry a piece of her with us, and we'll always carry a little piece of her with us,"" he said Monday. He held up a small, pink-and-white shoe identical to those the child was wearing when she was found.  ""That says it all. A little-bitty shoe."" E-mail to a friend .

"Islamabad (CNN) -- The second-largest party in Pakistan's ruling coalition quit the government Sunday over fuel price increases and other complaints, leaving the country with a minority government. Sunday's announcement by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement that its 25 members would join the opposition comes after several previous threats to quit the government. But Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said the ruling Pakistan People's Party would be able to function without a majority in the National Assembly, which chooses the prime minister. ""Just because one party pulls out does not mean that the government will fall or come apart,"" Gilani told reporters. The MQM is one of the largest and most liberal parties in Pakistan, with its stronghold in the southern city of Karachi. Its exit follows December's withdrawal of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal ur Rehman, a leading religious party. Muhammad Anwar, a senior coordinator for the MQM, told CNN that the last straw for the party were the fuel price increases that took effect Saturday. Pakistan's government raised gasoline prices by 9.2% and increased kerosene by nearly 6%, blaming higher crude oil costs for the move. Anwar also said the government had failed to crack down on ""rampant"" corruption and maintain law and order -- particularly in Karachi and the surrounding southern province of Sindh. Businessmen in Karachi ""are virtually hostage"" to extortion and kidnapping rings, he said. And MQM leader Faisal Sabzwari said Sunday that the PPP-led government also has imposed unfair taxes on the poor and allowed an energy crisis to fester. The party pulled its two cabinet ministers in the federal government last week, a move MQM leaders said was a warning to the government. The decision leaves the PPP-led government that came to power in 2008 with 147 seats in the 342-seat National Assembly, where members serve up to five-year terms. Anwar said the MQM doesn't want the government to fail, but ""The government is failing itself by its own deeds.""

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- A former kingpin for a Colombian drug cartel pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court to charges of drug trafficking, obstruction of justice by murder and racketeering, federal officials said. Authorities say Montoya, known as ""Don Diego,"" was the head of the Norte del Valle drug cartel. Diego Leon Montoya Sanchez had faced 15 criminal charges, said Montoya's Miami attorney, Bill Clay. ""As is often the case in plea agreements, there are concessions and benefits a defendant gets,"" Clay told CNN. ""There are benefits that are very valuable to Montoya. Twelve counts will be dismissed at the time of sentencing."" Montoya's plea covered two federal cases. In one, prosecuted by the U.S. attorney's office in Miami, Montoya admitted to one count of conspiracy to import more than 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of cocaine into the United States and one count of obstruction of justice by murder, federal officials said. In the second case, prosecuted in the District of Columbia, Montoya pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage racketeering. That case was transferred to Miami for the plea. Sentencing is set for October 21, Clay said. By statute, Montoya could be sentenced to life in prison, but he will not, the attorney said. He said he believes prosecutors will ask for a 45-year sentence. Federal officials lauded the plea agreement Tuesday. ""This notorious leader of the extremely violent Norte Valle Cartel is where he belongs: behind bars for murder, drug trafficking and racketeering,"" acting Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Michele M. Leonhart said in a news release. Montoya, 48, had a $5 million reward on his head before his capture in Colombia in September 2007 and extradition to the United States 15 months later. He had been on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list since 2004. Authorities say Montoya, known as ""Don Diego,"" was the head of the Norte Valle drug cartel. The FBI called the cartel ""the most powerful and violent drug trafficking organization in Colombia."" The Justice Department said Tuesday that, ""based upon FBI estimates, at its peak the Norte Valle Cartel was responsible for 60 percent of the cocaine exported from Colombia to the United States. ... (B)etween 1990 and 2004, the Norte Valle Cartel exported more than 1.2 million pounds, or 500 metric tons, of cocaine worth more than $10 billion from Colombia to the United States."" Even though he did not have to, Montoya chose to make a statement to Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga, the Colombian's attorney said. ""He said to the judge he wanted to express remorse to his family and to the families of the victims of his criminal conduct,"" Clay said. Montoya is the fourth member of his family to be convicted as part of the Florida case, officials said Tuesday. A brother pleaded guilty in January to one count of conspiracy to import more than 5 kilograms of cocaine into the United States and one count of obstruction of justice by murder. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison. In November 2005, officials said, another brother and a cousin each pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than 5 kilograms of cocaine into the United States. Each received a sentence of more than 20 years.","Former kingpin for Colombian drug cartel pleads guilty in U.S. District Court .

"(CNN) -- Tayna Fogle sat just behind Sen. Rand Paul, nodding her head and listening as he pressed the case with Kentucky state senators to restore felon voting rights. ""Kids do make mistakes. White kids make mistakes. Black kids make mistakes. Brown kids make mistakes,"" Paul told the Kentucky state Senate committee considering a constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of some felons on Wednesday. ""But when you look at the prison population, three out of the four people in prison are black or brown."" Fogle whispered: ""Good for you. I'm glad someone is speaking up."" She felt as if he was narrating her life. In 1991, the former University of Kentucky basketball team captain received a 10-year sentence for crack cocaine possession. Since her release, she has been unable to vote. ""I remember when my mom showed me how to vote for the very first time. I remember watching the movies of my ancestors getting mauled by dogs and water hoses,"" Fogle said, her voice cracking a bit. ""It changed my life completely. I was an embarrassment to my family. My community."" ""I'm not making any excuses for my behavior. Should I have gotten a 10-year sentence? Yes, I should have. Have I served my time? Yes, I have."" Holder calls for restoring ex-cons' voting rights . The issue of restoring felon voting rights has made for some unusual alliances as former felons, like Fogle, see in lawmakers like Paul, a tea party-backed Republican, a champion. Nationally, about 5.8 million people are prohibited from voting because of current or previous felony convictions, according to Attorney Gen. Eric Holder. In the swing states of Florida and Virginia, one in five black adults is unable to vote because of these laws, according to Holder. In Paul's home state of Kentucky, it's also one in five. ""Somewhere along the line he gained a lot of knowledge,"" Fogle said of Paul's push to restore voting rights to nonviolent felons. ""He has seen the disenfranchisement,"" said Fogle, a community organizer with Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, a nonprofit grassroots organization that has pushed to restore the voting rights of felons. One place where he notices that is west Louisville's predominantly African-American neighborhoods, a community where Paul sticks out at the grassroots gatherings he's attended. The potential 2016 presidential candidate has spent quite a bit of time over the past year in that area and at the Plymouth Community Renewal Center listening to black men vent frustration over not being able to vote after completing their prison terms for nonviolent crimes. Paul said he started thinking that this is exactly the type of issue that could help build a bridge between the Republican Party and African-American voters. ""It's an important issue. When you look at who is being deprived of voting they are disproportionately people of color,"" Paul told the state Senate panel. It is a lesson he says was brought home for him in real terms while hanging out in west Louisville. ""In the last six months or so, I've been over to the Plymouth Community Center in the west side of Louisville and I met a lot of people there who are very smart, very bright, very articulate who told me they can't vote because (because they are felons),"" Paul said in a phone interview before the hearing. ""I've become aware of the problem ... not just in regard to voting but also in terms of getting work."" Paul's push to change laws he says disenfranchise black menâ€”a longtime crusade of many civil rights organizations and minority lawmakersâ€”echoes the slow evolution of the Republican Party following huge losses among African-American voters during the 2012 presidential election. Tough racial issues face GOP in minority outreach . An internal autopsy of sorts conducted last year by the Republican National Committee revealed a wide gap between the party and African American voters. The GOP moved to try and fix the rift by beefing up outreach. ""We've been improving our messaging because we need to,"" said Orlando Watson, the RNC communications director for black media and a former Paul staffer. ""But we need to speak to how our messaging (improves the lives) of all Americans."" As the RNC was working on its messaging problem, potential presidential contenders such as Paul also began tentatively reaching out to minority voters. Paul's speeches at historically black colleges Howard University in Washington and Simmons College in Louisville, among others have been met with mixed reviews. He was roiled for what some saw as a condescending tone in his questioning whether Howard students knew that the NAACP founders were Republican. But he also received kudos for just showing up. Last year, he was the first major Republican to speak at Howard since Colin Powell in 1994. Efforts like Paul's illustrate the delicate dance the GOP must undertake if it is to appeal to minority voters in a way that is sincere, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. ""If the policies are wrong and aren't framed in a way that is appealing to minorities they are going to be a hard sell to minorities,"" she said. Paul may have just struck the right chord. During his lunch last week with Holder, Paul said he talked about their shared concerns about laws that disenfranchise black men, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent crimes. Paul's also crafting a federal measure that would restore voting rights for felons who committed nonviolent crimes. ""We have to convince people we do care,"" Paul said during a phone interview of the GOP's outreach to minorities. ""We do care about what is going on in areas of long-term poverty and long-term crime."" Currently, 11 states restrict or completely deny voting rights to prisoners even after they've completed sentences, probation and parole. In Florida, for example, roughly 10% of the population is banned from voting as a result of these laws. ""There's a racial outcome in who's incarcerated in our country,"" Paul told the state senators. ""Not only is the incarceration unfair but they get out and their voting rights are impaired."" As for Fogle, who got a chance to meet Paul and take a picture with him, she points out that her son registered as a Republican by accident when he voted for the first time. She's encouraged him to keep the party affiliation. ""I told him it didn't matter,"" she said. ""As long as he voted."" A more diverse slate of Republican presidential possibles .

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- Last weekend, another large piece of ""space junk"" tumbled to Earth, perhaps in Southeast Asia. Many people -- if they noted the event at all -- probably worried about being hit on the head, even though the odds are overwhelmingly against such a catastrophe (trillions to one). But for thousands of astrophysicists around the world, the German Roentgen satellite (""ROSAT"") was no mere rubbish; it was an old and important friend. Launched in 1990, a few months after the better known Hubble Space Telescope, ROSAT provided images of the sky in X-rays (very short wavelength light), as opposed to the red-green-blue light visible with Hubble, meaning it could see the most energetic phenomena in the Universe. Plus ROSAT had better image quality than any X-ray satellite had before, an improvement comparable to the superiority of Hubble imaging compared to ground-based telescopes. A few thousand astronomers worldwide used ROSAT to study the universe, discovering where black holes are growing, when massive clusters of galaxies formed, and how neutron stars and black holes in our Milky Way Galaxy behave. I used ROSAT to study the wildly varying emission from ""jets"" of energetic particles emanating from the central black holes in distant galaxies. These particles are far more energetic than those produced in man-made terrestrial accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider. Others made exquisite images of the remnants of stellar explosions (""supernova remnants"" like IC443) or mapped the hot gases held by gravity in the space between dense clusters of galaxies or indeed to image the entire sky. One totally unexpected discovery was that comets -- cold balls of ice heated by the Sun as they whiz past -- are strong X-ray emitters, thanks to the interaction of energetic particles from the Sun with the gaseous material around the comet. The same physics explains X-ray light seen from the dark side of the moon, which otherwise shadows the bright all sky X-ray glow from growing black holes. Dr. Guenther Hasinger, the recently appointed Director of the Institute for Astronomy in Hawaii, began his career working on the ROSAT project. His planning kept the satellite working long after two gyros failed early in the mission, and he developed as a scientist using ROSAT to make very deep pictures of the X-ray sky, so he found the satellite's demise an especially poignant moment. ""We recently moved to Hawaii from Germany,"" he said, ""and while unpacking the family's shipping container"" he found his miniature ROSAT model. It now sits on his desk at the Institute, next to a piece of the spare detector housing. ""I definitely felt an emotional attachment to this project,"" he admitted. Astrophysicists in the U.S. and beyond made excellent use of ROSAT's capabilities, finding some 110,000 new X-ray sources (galaxies, stars, comets, etc.) and making X-ray observations an integral part of every astronomer's toolkit. The project had spinoff value as well: techniques used to manufacture ROSAT's mirror surfaces were later applied to making ordinary optical lenses. Your bifocals might have been made using ROSAT technology. It may be ""space junk"" to some, but its benefits are riding on a lot of noses. Twenty years ago, experts in Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom collaborated to build and launch the ROSAT satellite. These days, international collaboration in X-ray astronomy has become the norm, with the Japanese and European space agencies as major partners with NASA. Transcending political boundaries, decisions about what a satellite observes are based on scientific merit, not national origin. NASA scientist Dr. Rob Petre (no relation to the Dick van Dyke character) helped decide the annual program of ROSAT observations. Each year, scientists would submit hundreds of proposals outlining their plans for the telescope, which were then ranked competitively. Only a small fraction were approved. For every scientist granted precious ROSAT observing time, the re-entry last weekend had to sting. Dr. Petre was definitely chagrined to hear ROSAT referred to as ""space junk"" in news stories. ""That was really depressing,"" he said, ""when it was such a huge scientific success."" But he wasn't worried about falling debris landing on inhabited places, even though, like the UARS satellite a few weeks earlier, big pieces of ROSAT (the glass mirrors) were expected to hit the ground before burning up completely. Most of the Earth's surface is covered by oceans and most of Earth's land masses are unoccupied, so the odds of falling space debris causing damage are miniscule -- which is why space agencies do not go to the expense of planning controlled re-entries. Dr. Hasinger estimates that space debris as large as ROSAT falls to Earth every few weeks, almost all of it unreported and unnoticed. Last weekend, somewhere on Earth, the ROSAT re-entry must have made beautiful ""shooting stars"" streaking across the sky. But the fact that there are no eyewitness reports underscores the fact that most of the planet -- especially our oceans -- is uninhabited. So the ROSAT fall from the heavens may not have been witnessed, but the satellite certainly is remembered. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Meg Urry.","Last weekend a large piece of ""space junk"" tumbled to earth .

"(CNN) -- If you thought the Supreme Court's ruling two years ago remaking the individual mandate into a tax was the end of the legal threat to the Affordable Care Act, think again. Set aside Hobby Lobby and similar lawsuits; those are important for religious liberty but don't threaten Obamacare's existence. Instead, as we saw Tuesday, courts are again considering serious challenges that strike at the core of how Obamacare operates. First, in Halbig v. Burwell, the D.C. Circuit -- the federal appellate court that oversees executive agencies -- held that the IRS broke the law in issuing tax credits for people to buy policies from federal insurance exchanges. A couple of hours later, however, in King v. Burwell, the Richmond-based 4th Circuit ruled in favor of the government's authority to provide these credits. FAQ: What the Obamacare court decisions mean for you . What's going on here and what's the big deal about some obscure tax regulations? As it turns out, these tax credits, better known as subsidies, make Obamacare tick, even more than the individual mandate. Without them, consumers face the full cost of health care, which is a sticker shock that would further turn the public against the law and finally force the administration to reopen it. It's also these subsidies that trigger taxes on employers and individuals who don't buy the requisite level of care. So what the two courts are debating is whether President Obama illegally spent billions of taxpayer dollars and subjected millions of people to illegal taxes. Watchdog: Fake applicants got Obamacare subsidies . The problem lies buried deep in the text of the Affordable Care Act, which provides federal subsidies only to taxpayers who enroll in exchanges ""established by the state."" As Judge Thomas Griffith, a moderate George W. Bush appointee who was supported by then-Sen. Barack Obama, wrote for the D.C. Circuit, ""the federal government is not a 'state,'"" and therefore ""a federal exchange is not an 'exchange established by the state.'"" That should be the end of the discussion, and it would be in any sane world. But the government and its defenders argue, apparently channeling Humpty Dumpty's mantra that a word means just what he chooses it to mean, that ""established by a state"" is synonymous with ""established by the federal government."" Thus, in the King ruling, Judge Roger Gregory, whom Bush appointed in a good-faith gesture after his nomination expired under Bill Clinton, somehow found the language to be ""ambiguous"" and deferred to the agency's reading. After all, why wouldn't Congress make subsidies available to all? Such questions of legislative history are irrelevant when the text is clear, but there's actually a simple answer: the Affordable Care Act's drafters wanted to give states an incentive to set up exchanges. That's not uncommon; for example, only residents of cooperating states get Medicaid assistance. Unfortunately for Obamacare's proponents, however, only 14 states and the District of Columbia chose to establish their own exchanges. If the D.C. Appeals Court ruling is correct, that means millions of people in 36 states are receiving subsidies for which they aren't eligible. Study: Obamacare gave 10 million Americans health insurance . After-the-fact rationalizations notwithstanding, the concession that Obamacare's designers didn't anticipate so many state vetoes doesn't retroactively rewrite the plain language of the law. The fault lies squarely with those drafters, not the lawyers who point out the IRS abuse or the judges who strike it down. The government will see rehearing by the entire D.C. Circuit; having stacked the court after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid eliminated filibusters of judicial nominations, President Obama figures he has a good chance to reverse Halbig. At the same time, Mike Carvin, the lawyer for the plaintiffs in both cases, will bypass the similarly unfriendly 4th Circuit and ask the Supreme Court to hear King. The high court could decide not to act until the D.C. Circuit rules, presumably eliminating the circuit split and thus the necessity of taking up the issue. But two more cases are coming behind these, one brought by Oklahoma's attorney general and the other by the state of Indiana. Waiting another year or two would only increase the economic damage of the IRS' shell game. The sooner the administration is forced to fix Obamacare, the better for the country and its battered rule of law.","Ilya Shapiro: Court challenges are striking at the core of how Obamacare operates .
Shapiro: Who is eligible for subsidies? Without them, consumers face full, high costs .

"(CNN) -- Ratko Mladic, who is on trial on charges he masterminded an army campaign to cleanse Bosnia of Croats and Muslims, was taken to the hospital Thursday as a precautionary measure, a court spokeswoman said. ""Proceedings were adjourned because he wasn't feeling well,"" said Nerma Jelacic, a spokeswoman for International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. She did not release any details about his condition. Mladic, whose trial began at the Hague in May, is accused of orchestrating a campaign of ethnic cleansing during the bloody civil war that ripped apart Yugoslavia. He has been indicted on 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the 1992-95 war. Ratko Mladic: Brutal villain to many, hero to others . His trial is taking place in The Hague at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, a court established to try those responsible for atrocities during the war. In May, prosecutor Dermot Groome laid out details of the case against Mladic, saying that ethnic cleansing was not a byproduct of the war, but a specific aim of the Bosnian Serb leadership. He said he would show that Mladic was directly responsible for atrocities carried out by his forces, which were fighting for control of land in ethnically mixed Bosnia. Mladic eluded authorities for nearly 16 years until his capture in May 2011, when police burst into the garden of a small house in northern Serbia. Analysis: In this battle with Mladic, women of Srebrencia hold the edge . Though he was carrying two handguns, he surrendered without a fight and was extradited to the Netherlands. In the three decades leading up to the violent splintering of Yugoslavia, Mladic rose rapidly through the ranks of the Yugoslav army. In 1991, he served as a front-line commander spearheading Serb forces in a yearlong war with Croatia. By the time he took to Bosnia's battlefields, he had become a hero to many Serbs, seen as a defender of their dwindling fortunes. In May 1992, Bosnia's Serbian political leaders picked him to lead the assault on their Muslim enemies who clamored for independence. Mladic wasted no time galvanizing his heavily armed forces in a siege of Sarajevo, cutting the city off from the outside world. Serb forces pounded the city every day from higher ground positions, trapping Sarajevo's ill-prepared residents in the valley below. As the war ended in the fall of 1995, Mladic went on the run. Shortly after Mladic was sent to The Hague last year, authorities nabbed former Croatian Serb rebel leader Goran Hadzic. He was the last Yugoslav war crimes suspect at large.

"Washington (CNN) -- House Republicans unveiled a $1.5 billion border funding package Wednesday to address the situation on the southern border, almost $1 billion dollars smaller than the version introduced by Senate Democrats on Tuesday, and less than half of what President Barack Obama requested. But strong opposition from congressional Democrats to policy changes House and Senate GOP members want to attach to a bill combined with conservative pushback from those Republicans who don't want to give Obama any more money means getting anything through Congress is an uphill battle. House Speaker John Boehner criticized the Obama administration for sending what he believes were mixed signals about its position on altering a 2008 immigration law that allows children from Central America to remain in the United States until they have a hearing. Immigration fast facts . ""The administration ought to get their act together,"" Boehner told reporters after the closed- door meeting with House Republicans. ""You know they made indications that they were for changes to the 2008 law that helped bring this problem on, and yet now they're opposed to it. Without trying to fix the problem, I don't know how we actually are in a position to give the President any more money."" Opinion: GOP, show you care about kids at the border . Boehner sent Obama a letter on Wednesday pointing to recent public comments by the President and other administration officials in support of getting additional legal authority, but said that now congressional Democrats have ""backpedaled and voiced unswerving opposition to any changes at all."" ""Frankly, it is difficult to see how we can make progress on this issue without strong, public support from the White House for much-needed reforms, including changes to the 2008 law,"" Boehner wrote. Prospects for border legislation in doubt . Changing 2008 law at center of plan . A House Border Working Group set up by Boehner released a series of policy recommendations it believes are needed to stem the influx of illegal crossings. The centerpiece of their plan was reversing the 2008 law to make it easier to deport unaccompanied children fleeing countries like Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Instead of children being allowed to remain in the United States until they receive a hearing -- something that can take months or more than a year -- most children will be returned home quickly. Those who maintain that they face threats of sexual abuse or violence will stay in U.S. custody and get a hearing within seven days. Immigration crisis a political conundrum . That plan mirrors a bipartisan bill introduced last week by Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar and GOP Sen. John Cornyn, both of Texas. The working group also wants to deploy the National Guard to the border to assist border patrol agents dealing with humanitarian needs, establish a set of metrics to measure how well federal agencies are securing the border, and expand the number of judges who can more quickly determine whether claims of persecution from those coming into the U.S. from Central America are legitimate. Many of the recommendations from the group are expected to be added to the funding proposal outlined by House Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers. The House plan uses left over funds from various federal programs to cover the price tag. Senate Democrats argue the emergency spending bill doesn't need to be offset. Rogers insisted the change to the 2008 law is a critical component of Congress' response, saying, ""If we don't change the '08 law, the costs of dealing with the problem go up at least $1.3 billion that HHS [Department of Health and Human Services] would need to continue to house the people that continue to flood across."" The witches' brew: Desperation, hope and children on the border . Not much support from Democrats . Senate Democrats released their border funding proposal on Tuesday -- a $2.7 billion package that does not include any policy changes. But it's unclear that proposal can pass. House GOP leaders planned to huddle after meeting with their rank and file members to discuss what details they would put in a final legislative package. They recognize that their pared-down package won't get many Democratic votes. Besides Cuellar, only one House Democrat has signed onto the bill to change the 2008 law. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has said she opposes it and argued any significant changes to immigration laws need to be handled separately. The No. 2 House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, told reporters that GOP leaders shouldn't expect much support for their plan. Hoyer said Cecilia Munoz, a top White House aide on domestic policy, told him the White House is pushing for a border bill without any policy provisions attached, but the administration is open to discussing changes to the 2008 law on a separate track. For Boehner getting the 218 votes needed to pass a border bill mostly with House Republican votes is proving to be a big lift. Republican Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama told reporters he opposed giving more than $1 billion to the administration and instead suggested spending $20-30 million to pay for one-way plane tickets to send all of the children crossing the border back to their home countries. Playing the blame game . Blasting Obama's handling of the crisis, an exasperated Brooks said the administration is giving families coming from Central America ""free goodies, free food, free clothing, free health care, free transportation, free entertainment."" He added, ""Right now the president of the United States is the world's sugar daddy and that has to stop."" But North Carolina GOP Rep. Richard Hudson told reporters the growing problem means Congress should act, and he hoped something would pass before the recess. Referring to the short amount of time left before Congress leaves for its August break, Hudson said, ""I think we need to deal with this issue, we can't let it linger another five weeks."" Both parties acknowledge some federal agencies housing and providing medical care for the tens of thousands of children coming across the border are scheduled to run out of money next month. Since Congress controls the purse strings, House Republicans realize that if they don't pass a bill they'll get blamed for the situation getting worse. ""I think if you don't do something the administration and the Democrats in the Senate are going to say -- well they're going to try to offload this problem onto Republicans and say it's due to our failure to act,"" Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole said Wednesday. Boehner declined to commit to holding a House vote on a GOP bill before the end of the month, but said ""I'd like to act, we've got a humanitarian crisis on the border that has to be dealt with."" Texas GOP Rep. John Carter, a member of the border working group, warned that if the House and Senate failed to reach a deal on a border bill, ""another 50,000 unaccompanied minors will come across our border.""","House Republicans offer plan far less costly than Democrats, Obama .
Some in GOP caucus balk at spending any money except to send children home .
Number two Democrat in House tells Republicans not to expect much support from them .

"(CNN) -- Nearly six months after it went missing off Venezuela's coast, authorities have located the small plane that was carrying Italian fashion boss Vittorio Missoni and five others, the country's Interior Ministry announced Thursday. The aircraft disappeared on January 4 as it left Los Roques, an archipelago and resort, for the international airport outside Caracas, about 90 miles away. Vittorio Missoni, his wife, and four others -- including a pilot and copilot -- were all on board. All are presumed dead. Missoni, 58, ran the famed Missoni fashion house with his siblings, Luca and Angela. Neither sibling was on the plane. With the help of an American ship with special oceanographic technology, the plane was located off the coast of Key Carenero, within the Los Roques archipelago, according to a family statement published by Italy's ANSA news agency. ""At this time, efforts are underway to recover the wreckage,"" the families of those aboard the plane said in the statement. ""The families would like to thank the Venezuelan and Italian governments for its commitments in finding the wreckage and the family is confident that the investigation into the cause of the incident."" Family: 'We will not give up' Venezuelan authorities had launched intensive search efforts with boats, helicopters and divers scouring the area for any sign of the missing plane. A bag from the plane washed up on the island of Curacao some 124 miles away from where the aircraft disappeared three weeks after the aircraft went missing. The fashion house, which boasts such celebrity clients as Katie Holmes, Cameron Diaz and Nicole Richie, is a high-end fashion label known for its patterned knitwear and signature zigzag stripe. The private company, based in Milan, Italy, has estimated annual sales of between $75 million and $100 million. The brand, first created in 1953 as a knitwear workshop in Gallarte, Italy, has expanded from apparel to housewares, a fragrance line and a chain of hotels. Stefano Tonchi, editor-in-chief of W magazine, called the Missonis ""one of the most important Italian fashion families,"" crediting their move to Milan in the late 1960s with helping make the northern Italian city the fashion hub it is today. Vittorio Missoni and his siblings took over the brand in 1996 with an eye toward marketing to a younger consumer. The fashion house partnered with Target in 2011 to produce a more budget-friendly collection for the discount retailer, which caused Target's website to crash due to the high demand. CNN's Jessica King and Alexander Hunter contributed to this report.","The plane went missing in January .

"MINNEAPOLIS, Minnesota (CNN) -- Investigators trying to figure out what caused Wednesday's massive bridge collapse are focusing on the southern end of the span, which ""behaved differently"" as it fell, the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday. The NTSB says one part of the bridge shifted 50 feet as it fell, while other sections collapsed in place. The NTSB, which is investigating the disaster that killed at least five people and injured dozens, is also hoping another video provided by the Army Corps of Engineers will provide new images of the collapse. What's getting investigators' attention is the way the southern part of the bridge fell in a video they've already examined -- recorded by a security camera near the bridge's north end -- and the way the section settled after the collapse. ""It appears that it has shifted approximately 50 feet to the east and when we compare that to what we've seen in the rest of the bridge -- the rest of the bridge appears to have collapsed in place, "" said NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker, who is leading a 19-member team charged with determining the cause of the accident. ""We're going to take a look at any unique design factors that could have created that shift...for whatever reason."" It's not the answer to the mystery of why the bridge fell, but a step forward, Rosenker said. The NTSB will also examine three more videos provided by the Army Corps of Engineers, one of which may show another view of the bridge falling, Rosenker said. Investigators aren't optimistic the other two will show anything because they weren't pointed at the bridge. On Thursday, U.S. Transportation Secretary Mary Peters notified state transportation departments to immediately inspect all bridges of the same design as the one that collapsed Wednesday on Interstate 35W into the Mississippi River in Minneapolis. Brian Turmail, spokesman for the Transportation Department, said there are about 750 bridges across the country that have similar steel deck truss designs. Turmail said the measure is being taken ""out of extreme caution."" Two reports published since 2001 have pointed to structural problems with the Interstate 35W bridge, but both reports determined the bridge was safe despite deficiencies.  See which states have most troubled bridges » . ""The bridge's deck truss system has not experienced fatigue cracking, but it has many poor fatigue details on the main truss and the floor truss system,"" said a report conducted for the Minnesota Department of Transportation in 2001. The 40-year-old bridge is of a type known as deck steel truss. It has three parts: a deck, superstructure and substructure. The deck is made of concrete and rebar, the superstructure is made of steel and the substructure is made of steel and concrete footing, according to Rosenker. The executive summary of the 2001 Minnesota Department of Transportation report -- undertaken by the University of Minnesota's Department of Civil Engineering -- points to fatigue problems with the bridge's approach span, the segments that connect the main span of the bridge to land. However, the report said, ""Fatigue cracking is not expected during the remaining useful life of the bridge.""  Watch the bridge collapse » . In 2005, the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Bridge Inventory database concluded the bridge was ""structurally deficient."" Minnesota Department of Transportation bridge engineer Dan Dorgan said the term ""structurally deficient"" is a Federal Highway Administration rating. Inspectors rate sections of the bridge on a 1 to 9 scale, with 9 being in excellent condition, he said. ""A structurally deficient condition is a bridge that would have a rating of 4 either in the deck, the superstructure or the substructure,"" he said. ""Any one of those in condition 4 or less is considered structurally deficient."" But, he noted, out of 13,000 state and local bridges in Minnesota that are 20 feet and more in span, 1,160 of them -- 8 percent of the state's bridges -- are considered structurally deficient. Tom Everett of the Federal Highway Administration's National Bridge Inspection Program said the structurally deficient rating was a ""programatic classification rather than an indication of safety."" ""It does not indicate a bridge is dangerous or that that bridge must be replaced,"" he said. The Minnesota bridge was deemed structurally deficient in 1990, Dorgan said, ""due to corrosion of the bearings, so they were not able to move as freely as designed."" Later, inspectors found corrosion of steel around joints in the bridge and fatigue cracks in the approach spans. Those problems were repaired in the 1990s. ""Recent inspections in 2005 and 2006 found no evidence of cracking or growth in the existing cracks in the tab well that have been there since the day the bridge was built,"" he said. Dorgan also cited an in-depth study of the bridge's fatigue potential conducted from 2004 to 2007 that recommended two alternatives for the bridge's future -- to add steel plates to reinforce critical parts of the bridge or to conduct thorough inspections of the wells inside the box to determine whether there were cracks. ""We chose the inspection route, and began in May,"" he said, adding that officials intended to replace the bridge about 2020. ""We had the bridge partially inspected and were going to complete that this fall after construction was done."" During a Wednesday news conference, Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty described the bridge deficiencies as ""minor"" and said the state was told that the bridge's deck might need to be rehabilitated or replaced in 2020 or later.  View photos from the disaster » . ""It was last inspected both in 2005 and 2006. There were no structural deficiencies identified according to [the Minnesota Department of Transportation],"" Pawlenty said. Most bridges are inspected every two years and receive ratings based on the conditions of various components, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In addition to ""structurally deficient,"" another bridge classification is ""functionally obsolete,"" according to the Federal Highway Administration. A bridge is tagged structurally deficient when significant bridge elements have deteriorated and the bridge's load-carrying capacity is reduced, according to the highway administration. A bridge is dubbed functionally obsolete when the bridge does not meet current design standards. Neither label indicates a bridge is unsafe for travel, the highway administration said. As of 2003, there were about 160,570 bridges deemed structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. The number represented 27.1 percent of the nation's bridges. The American Society of Civil Engineers also reported that the number of bridge deficiencies had steadily declined from 34.6 percent in 1992 to 27.1 percent in 2003.

"(CNN) -- A former high school teacher in Freeland, Michigan, has been arraigned in two counties on 29 counts of sexual misconduct with an underage student, a Midland County prosecutor said Wednesday. Marcie Rousseau, a 33-year-old married mother of two, is accused of having sex with a then-16-year-old student from May 2009 to February, according to prosecutor Angelina Scarpelli. There could be two other alleged victims dating back to 2002, Scarpelli told HLN's ""Prime News."" Rousseau was placed on administrative leave February 16 while police investigated the allegations. She officially resigned from her teaching job at Freeland High School on June 16, Scarpelli said.

"(Kaiser Health News) -- On Tuesday, two U.S. appeals courts issued conflicting rulings on a subject that's important to millions of people: the availability of subsidies to help purchase coverage under the health-care law. Q: What did the courts decide? A:  In a blow to the health law, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that the health law's subsidies are available only to individuals in the 14 states and the District of Columbia now operating their own health insurance exchanges. The federal government now runs the exchanges in 36 states. Judge Thomas Griffith, writing the majority opinion in the 2-1 decision, said they concluded ""that the ACA unambiguously restricts"" the subsidies to ""exchanges 'established by the state.' "" In a separate ruling, a three-judge panel for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., ruled unanimously for the Obama administration, allowing subsidies to be available to residents in all states. Judge Roger Gregory, writing the opinion, said while the health law is ""ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations,"" the court decided to uphold the IRS's interpretation of the law that residents of states using the federal exchange are entitled to subsidies. White House revises contraception opt out . Q: What was the issue the courts decided on? A: The case centers on a brief description in the health law that says subsidies will be available ""through an exchange established by the state."" In implementing the law, the Internal Revenue Service interpreted the law to allow eligible consumers to receive subsidies to help purchase coverage, regardless of whether they are in an exchange run by their state or by the federal government. Opponents of the law questioned that interpretation, saying that the law as written clearly directs subsidies to state-based exchanges only. But proponents-- including several lawmakers who helped write it -- said lawmakers fully intended that subsidies be offered on all exchanges no matter if they were administered by the feds or state officials. Q I don't know if my state runs its own exchange. Which states do? A: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia all run their own exchanges. Idaho and New Mexico intend to set up their own marketplace for the next enrollment period, which begins in November, but used Healthcare.gov this year. CNN Poll: Is Obamacare working? Q: I live in a state with a federally run exchange, and I get a subsidy to help me buy coverage. Am I going to lose it? A: Nothing is happening immediately. Justice Department officials said Tuesday they plan to seek an en banc review from the D.C. Appeals Court, meaning that the panel's full contingent of 11 judges would hear the case. Six of the court's judges would have to agree for the full panel to review the case. The full panel is dominated by judges appointed by Democrats, 7-4. Eventually the case could be considered by the Supreme Court, but the current subsidies would likely remain in place until there is a final legal decision on the matter. ""In the meantime, to be clear, people getting premium tax credits should know that nothing has changed; tax credits remain available,"" said Emily Pierce, deputy director of the Justice Department's office of public affairs. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the administration was confident it would prevail. ""You don't need a fancy legal degree to understand that Congress intended for every eligible American to have access to tax credits that would lower their health care costs, regardless of whether it was state officials or federal officials who were running the marketplace."" Supporters of the court challenge to the IRS interpretation on subsidies also maintain their case is strong. ""The executive branch does not get to rewrite statutes just because it thinks those statutes would work better a certain way,"" said Michael Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute who championed the subsidy appeals. ""If people lose those subsidies it is because the courts have ruled that those subsidies are and always have been unlawful -- that the administration had no authority to administer those in the first place."" Q: Are these the only two court cases? A: No. There are two other similar cases pending in courts in Oklahoma and Indiana. Q: If there are legal disputes ongoing about who qualifies to receive a subsidy, do I still have to buy health insurance? A: Yes. The law's ""individual mandate,"" which requires most people to purchase health insurance or pay a fine, is still in place. Q. What if I get my insurance through work? A: This decision applies only to policies sold on the online marketplaces. It does not affect work-based insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, regardless of where you live.

"London (CNN) -- Queen Elizabeth's jubilee tour strikes an historic note today, when the British monarch visits Northern Ireland on a trip it is hoped will mark a symbolic end to the decades-long conflict there. She's been to the province almost every year over the last decade. But this visit is especially significant as it follows her tour of the Republic of Ireland last year. It was the first visit by a British head of state since Ireland's independence, and at the time, British Prime Minister David Cameron described it as a game-changer. As head of state of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the queen has a purely symbolic role. But her influence - after six decades on the throne - is palpable. And her ability to mark an historic turning point unquestioned. Despite the passing of 15 years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, resentment among Ireland's Catholics - both North and South - has lingered over the wrongs committed during British rule. Queen arrives in Northern Ireland . But the queen's visit last year helped to heal some of those wounds. In Dublin she visited Croke Park, where British forces killed Irish civilians at a Gaelic football match in 1920, on what became known as Bloody Sunday. At a state dinner the same day, there were gasps as she spoke in Gaelic. The Irish president was seen mouthing the word 'wow' and commentators declared the speech historic. The queen managed subtly to set the tone of a visiting head of state as opposed to a ruling one. The image was powerful and cathartic for those still bitter towards Britain. ""It is a sad and regrettable reality that through history our islands have experienced more than their fair share of heartache, turbulence and loss,"" she said. In Northern Ireland, the queen has the chance to make history again -- but this time it is personal. The queen's cousin, Louis Mountbatten, was assassinated by the Provisional IRA (Irish Republican Army) in 1979, using a bomb planted in his fishing boat. Three others died in the same explosion. The queen was devastated: Mountbatten had introduced her to his nephew, Prince Philip, during her teens; the pair went on to marry and have four children. After decades of struggle, key Republicans in Northern Ireland are ready to have their symbolic moment of peace with the ""Queen of England,"" as they call her. Sinn Fein has decided that Republican icon and Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, should shake hands with the queen in front of the cameras. McGuinness is a former IRA commander. What makes this simple handshake even more poignant is that the queen is not just representing the UK, she's also representing the victims of the sectarian conflict. As someone who lost a loved one in an IRA attack, she is one herself. With a simple gesture, a victim and a former man of violence will put their personal feelings aside in the name of duty, and in the name of peace.","Britain's Queen Elizabeth visiting Northern Ireland on jubilee tour .

"(CNN) -- The spectacle of Russia swallowing pieces of a neighboring country while claiming to defend its people would make George Orwell grimace with recognition. This weekend's charade, a ""referendum"" in which we're told more than 96% voted to join Russia, fits perfectly with the Orwellian narrative. In this twilight zone of make-believe, Russian troops invade after removing the insignias from their uniforms and Putin explains, ""You can go to a store and buy a uniform,"" claiming they are local ""self-defense forces."" Maybe Crimean shops also sell machine guns and armored personnel carriers. In this world of double-speak and misinformation, Moscow is manipulating the message, intimidating, twisting facts and lying -- the more absurd the propaganda the better. My personal favorite is the branding of Crimea's independence push as the ""Russian Spring."" The most famous independence ""spring"" was the 1968 ""Prague Spring,"" a push to expand freedoms in Czechoslovakia that was crushed by Soviet tanks. On second thought, maybe Ukrainians should embrace irony and call this charade a Russian Spring. Do not believe those who say the result is fair or an accurate reflection of the popular will. Sure, the Russian speakers in Crimea are intoxicated with Russian nationalism right now. So are millions in the motherland, who have heard the persistent false claims about grave threats, even warning of genocide against Russia's ""brothers"" in Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine. The more you hear about threats to ethnic Russians, the closer Putin is getting to launching an expanded invasion. Look for claims of ""requests for protection"" from Moscow. After all, how can Moscow not help. And ignore the Russian agents sowing unrest. The unrest is the required pretext. Russia will come and ""pacify."" This tactic was not invented by Putin; it left a fetid track in the history of European empire-building, ethnic cleansing and warfare. Before the propaganda campaign, a poll reported in The Washington Post found a majority of Crimeans were not exactly yearning to join Russia. More than half said their homeland was Crimea, and 35% said Ukraine. About 12 % of Crimeans are Muslim Tatars who despise Russia. About one-quarter are ethnic Ukrainians. You can bet they feel absolutely no affection for Russia today. The referendum process was a travesty. Thousands of invading soldiers, no campaigning to hear differing views, no choice on the ballot for the status quo, intimidation of opponents, and a lightning-fast schedule after the local government is overthrown under the watch of armed men in unmarked camouflage fatigues. Democracy? You tell me. The referendum was not just a violation of democratic norms and Ukrainian law, it was a clear violation of international law. A Kremlin statement said Putin told U.S. President Barack Obama that Crimean independence echoes the ""Kosovo experience."" He may come to regret bringing up the former Yugoslavia, which unraveled in an orgy of ethnic and nationalism-driven bloodshed in the 1990s. No country annexed Kosovo, and that experience has little in common with Crimea. No one has accused the new Ukrainian government of persecuting Crimea's Russians the way Serbian forces ever did. The new Ukrainian government does contain an element of extreme right-wingers, who should be isolated and removed. The large mainstream of Ukraine's government, including its prime minister, is moderate, liberal, democratic and peaceful. Moscow's false narrative that fascists control Kiev is a ploy, a pretext. Already Putin has reserved the right to ""defend"" Russians in other parts of Ukraine. So-called self-defense forces captured a gas terminal close to Crimea, just inside Ukraine. What comes next -- and what should the West do? There are clear signs that Putin has designs on eastern Ukraine. He may not have decided yet. And what if he orders an invasion there? What if he goes for the rest of Ukraine? After all, Russia has close ties to Crimea, but it also has strong emotional ties to Kiev. And then? Many neighboring republics are getting nervous. Their history books are replete with stories of conquest. Would Moscow dare? We just don't know. NATO will not go to war against Russia over Ukraine. Putin knows that. The West should set up a dual track response. First, help the new Ukraine succeed. Ukrainian prosperity, democracy, anti-corruption reform, everything the Ukrainians say they want. Many in Russia want it too. At the same time, impose sanctions and set up trip wires -- escalating sanctions that will go into effect if Russia makes more military moves. If Moscow makes a move to seize more of Ukraine, tell the Republic of Georgia, which yearns to join NATO and already lost territory to a similar Russian move, that its request will go on an approval track. The U.S. and Europe need to work together and speak with one voice. Obama is traveling to Europe in the next few days. Meetings with NATO allies should produce more than statements. They should produce more than threats. Real sanctions will make Putin rethink his next move, especially if they affect his oligarch friends, who enjoy homes in London and ski trips in the Alps. Sanctions require full European participation. Much has been made of Europe's need for Russian natural gas. But gas sales are a double-edged sword. Russia needs its European customers. America's newfound gas riches could help Europe gain independence from Moscow. The long-term goal is to convince Russia that the use of force is counterproductive, that the costs outweigh the benefits. Ukraine will always be Russia's neighbor. One country's prosperity will benefit the other. For now, however, Putin views Ukraine's dash for an independent, pro-Western future as a challenge to his worldview; to his goal of a Eurasian future dominated by Moscow. He has shown he is prepared to use force. He has also shown that he wants a veneer of legitimacy for his actions. That's why he is taking the trouble of placing Orwellian labels and going through faux-democratic moves. If Putin believes each region should have the right to choose in what country it belongs, he has just smashed a hornet's nest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: Putin's talk of ""democracy"" is double-speak and unfounded lies .

"(CNN) -- Serbian tennis player Viktor Troicki has told CNN in an exclusive interview that he has been ""treated like a criminal"" following the year-long ban he received after missing a drugs test in April. The 27-year-old was speaking less than 24 hours after compatriot and world No. 2 Novak Djokovic branded anti-doping procedures in tennis as ""ridiculous"" following the treatment of his close friend. ""I have been treated like a criminal"" Troicki said on Wednesday, explaining how he was barred from attending Serbia's Davis Cup clash against Canada two months ago because of his troubles. ""I wasn't even allowed in the arena. They said it was not possible for me to attend -- even to be a spectator who bought a ticket and attended the match. ""A lot of the players have been behind me, and gave me their support, so that means a lot to me in the toughest time of my career."" Troicki, a former top-20 player, was initially handed an 18-month ban for missing a drugs test at the Monte Carlo Masters, which was reduced to 12 months on Tuesday after an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The Serb maintains he was given permission to miss the test due to illness and the fact he has a phobia of needles. ""It's very bad news that we got for him, and for me, for all of us who are close to him,"" said Djokovic, who arrived at the press conference with written notes on the subject. ""But I think it's just not bad news for him, it proves again that this system does not work."" Djokovic used his post-match press conference following a three-set victory over Roger Federer at the ATP World Tour Finals to launch an attack on the sport's various governing bodies as he vigorously defended Troicki. The six-time grand slam champion went on to claim that the consequences of not completing the test were not made plain to Troicki at the time. ""First of all, he's not positive on any banned substance,"" continued Djokovic. ""I'm not saying that it's completely not his fault. ""She (the Doping Control Officer) did not clearly present him with all the severe consequences that he will have if he avoids that. She told him that he needs to write a report and that he will be just fine. ""And because of her negligence and because of her unprofessionalism, he is now off the tour for one year. And now it makes me nervous as a player to do any kind of test."" Blog: Nine reasons to watch the ATP World Tour Finals . In his interview with CNN World Sport, Troicki confessed to being both surprised and moved by Djokovic's comments. ""I didn't actually know he was going to say that - and the way he said it really meant the world to me,"" he said from Belgrade. ""To have the support of a good friend of mine was just amazing at this moment, and I thank him so much. He's really my true friend and I saw that in this moment. ""Not only him but other players too -- (Jelena) Jankovic, (Janko) Tipsarevic and Rafa (Nadal) have also said nice things."" Loss of Trust . As a result of Troicki's ban, which is a double blow because he will have to compete in lesser tournaments upon his return given his loss of ranking points, Djokovic said he has lost all faith in the ability of anti-doping authorities to conduct accurate and reliable tests. ""I don't have trust in them anymore,"" said the 26-year-old. ""I don't have trust in what's going on. ""I don't know if tomorrow the (anti-doping) representative, because of the unprofessionalism, because of their negligence, because of their inability to explain the rules in a proper way, I don't know if they're going to misplace the test that I have or anything worse than that. ""For me, the whole procedure of the court case is totally against the player and player's rights. ""Now in Viktor's case, he's going to be sanctioned until July next year, and this lady, the DCO, she's going to come back tomorrow for the job. Nobody is going to answer for that. Only him. Why? ""For me, this is total injustice. It's just incredible."" He went on to criticize the ATP, the body which governs the elite men's tour, for not offering greater support to Troicki or Marin Cilic, who this year served a four-month ban -- reduced from nine months on appeal to CAS -- after testing positive for a banned substance which he claims to have taken unknowingly. ""After this kind of announcement and after this particular situation, the only one who is suffering here is the player,"" continued Djokovic. ""The ATP, which is supposed to be an association of players of tennis professionals, which is supposed to be the governing body, the association that stands behind the players, is not going to answer on this announcement, is not going to do anything for Viktor. ""So Viktor is there by himself. Tomorrow it can be anybody else. Cilic was there in this situation. ""I'm emotionally connected to Viktor but, looking at the whole scenario, it doesn't give me any trust in that, in them, in the whole procedure, in the whole rules, in anything. ""That's it. That's my statement. Sorry, but that's what I had to do. Not just because of him, but because of the sake of the players and because of the sake of the sport. It's just ridiculous."" Troicki's manager Corrado Tschabuschnig was grateful that the CAS had reduced his client's ban, but he was ""very disappointed"" that the sanction was still 12 months. ""It's another big setback, we were all expecting six months, but we will try to be as positive as we can,"" Tschabuschnig told CNN. ""We all believed that Viktor was going to get back into the top 20 in the world and his coach Jack Reader was doing a great job. Now we have to rethink everything."" On the support Troicki has received from Djokovic, Tschabuschnig added: ""Novak trusts Viktor."" Policing tennis . The International Tennis Federation (ITF) accepted CAS' decision to reduce Troicki's ban, but reacted strongly to criticism of anti-doping officials. ""The ITF, as the administrator of the Tennis Anti-Doping Program on behalf of the Grand Slam tournaments, ATP and WTA, is committed with our partners to protect the integrity of the game of tennis,"" read an ITF statement issued prior to Djokovic's outburst. ""We respect the ruling of the CAS ... what is harder to accept is criticism of doping control officers who perform a difficult role. ""Finally, separate from this decision, we should all remember that exactly one year ago anti-doping programs around the world were under scrutiny. ""This reinforced the need to be vigilant and apply the rules strictly, something that we and our partners in the tennis anti-doping program strive to do to keep our sport clean.""","Novak Djokovic criticizes anti-doping procedures in tennis .

"(CNN) -- Mexico City sees its share of protests, but this one was unusual. One woman wept. Other protesters shouted at the tops of their lungs, demanding answers. Still others showed pictures of their relatives to puzzled passersby. The protesters who gathered Thursday are relatives of 11 partygoers who went missing more than a week ago from a bar in a posh Mexico City neighborhood known as ""Zona Rosa,"" or Pink Zone. The area has a vibrant night scene with bars, nightclubs and upscale restaurants on every street. The protesters say their relatives were kidnapped on May 26 as they were partying at Heaven, an after-hours bar in the neighborhood. All 11 disappeared between 10 a.m. and noon, they say. The bar is only steps away from Paseo de la Reforma, an iconic avenue in central Mexico City. The emblematic Angel of Independence monument is nearby, as are the U.S. Embassy and the financial district. Guadalupe Dominguez, a relative of one of the missing, said a witness told her the 11 people were kidnapped by armed men who showed up in SUVs, but authorities say there's no evidence of such an incident. ""A young fellow who managed to escape was the one who told us about it, but we don't really know anything else,"" Dominguez said. Mexico reports more than 26,000 missing . Most of those hanging out at the after-hours bar were in their 20s, except for Yersi Ortiz, who is 16. Maria Teresa Ramos, Ortiz's grandmother, said relatives are mystified and want answers. ""This supposedly happened on Sunday in broad daylight. This couldn't have happened during the day and only a few steps from Reforma Avenue without anybody noticing. There should be surveillance cameras that can show us exactly what happened,"" Ramos said. Maria del Carmen Zamudio, another relative at the protest, said the witness told them the young people were all suddenly told to leave. ""The (bar) owner apparently told them that there was going to be a police operation and turned the lights off. He told them to get out, and armed men in black SUVs were already waiting for them outside,"" Zamudio said. Police say there was no such operation. Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said authorities are treating the incident as a missing-person case because so far, there's no evidence the young people were kidnapped. ""For now, we haven't been able to confirm how this happened or the specific location where (these young people) were kidnapped. What we have is a missing persons report and the knowledge that they're missing. We have to do something to find them,"" Mancera said. Inside San Pedro Sula, the 'murder capital' of the world . Mexico City District Attorney Rodolfo Rios Garza said security cameras at the bar were not working, but authorities are relying on city cameras in the neighborhood. So far, he said, an analysis of video from the cameras does not show any violence in or around the bar where the kidnapping supposedly took place. Authorities searched the bar and found illegal drugs but no signs of forced entry or anything that would indicate the young people had been kidnapped, Rios Garza said. More than 26,000 people have gone missing in Mexico over the past six years as violence surged and the country's government cracked down on drug cartels, according to Mexico's Interior Ministry. Authorities don't have data about how many of the disappearances are connected with organized crime. The 26,121 disappearances occurred during former President Felipe Calderon's six-year administration, which ended on December 1 when Enrique Pena Nieto assumed the presidency. The bar has been shut down while the investigation into the disappearances continues. The Mexican attorney general's office has also joined the investigation. Last month, Malcolm Shabazz, the grandson of civil rights activist Malcolm X, was beaten to death at another Mexico City establishment. Shabazz, 28, was found just outside the bar by police at 3:30 a.m. one block south of Plaza Garibaldi. Two bartenders were arrested in connection with Shabazz's killing, the attorney general's office said. Rios Garza said the men work at the bar, The Palace Club, where Shabazz and three people had drinks. An argument ensued when the staff said the bill was $1,200. Shabazz was beaten while another man was threatened and stripped of his belongings, Rios said. Marine reservist kidnapped in Mexico, FBI seeks public's help . CNN's Steve Almasy and Catherine E.

"(CNN) -- Women have finally arrived. From Washington to Wall Street to Twitter, writers, academics, and business leaders are pointing to the empowerment of women as key to many of the world's greatest challenges. They're publicizing the research and amplifying hard facts, like the fact that when women have equal access to agricultural resources, 100 million to 150 million fewer people will go hungry. Or that when women participate equally in the workforce, the GDP in the U.S. the eurozone, and Japan will experience a double-digit spike. And while there's no perfect metric for the popular perception of ""girl power,"" a 2010 Pew study found widespread public support for women's equality in virtually every nation. The excitement over women's potential and progress is warranted. But there's still a large and disappointing disconnect between research and reality. Girls and women do indeed perform 66% of the work and produce 50% of the world's food. But they earn only 10% of the world's income and own a dismal 1% of its property. And women everywhere experience less access to credit, training, technology, markets, role models, and protection under the law. Girls and women may keep the world running, but someone else is still running the show. So if women have indeed ""arrived,"" despite key indicators showing continued widespread inequality, where exactly have they landed? All signs point to girls and women at a tipping point. With leaders finally paying attention to their issues, women are miles ahead of where they once were. But they are also far from where they need to be. And women won't get past the tipping point and onto a level economic playing field until we all ensure that their economic empowerment is a sustainable path forward rather than a fad or figment of the global imagination. Leaders across various sectors must approach girls and women as actors who drive solutions, not just as beneficiaries who receive their results. We need a shift in strategy and investment to help women around the world to mobilize themselves and their communities. The moment is ripe for action. Mid-September is the geopolitical busy season, and leaders from around the globe have descended on Manhattan for the U.N. General Assembly, the Clinton Global Initiative, and other global meetings, where girls and women will undoubtedly be a hot topic. For the first time, this game of empowerment has all the cards stacked on the right side: The relevant players, from corporations to governments and nongovernmental organizations, are beginning to recognize that it's time to ""invest in women."" Some already are. Members of the Clinton Global Initiative are promoting innovative solutions. Through its Personal Achievement and Career Enhancement program, retailer Gap Inc. helps female garment workers build both life and technical skills, offering managerial and financial literacy training so that they can advance in the workplace. And that will help them make progress in their careers and lives. Through P.A.C.E.'s partnership with the Washington-based research institute the International Center for Research on Women and local NGOs, 7,600 women have completed the P.A.C.E. program in seven countries. Unilever is putting women in the driver's seat as well, boldly pledging to make more than half of its senior management team female by 2015. With women controlling nearly $12 trillion of the overall $18.4 trillion in global consumer spending, it's just good business sense for a global consumer goods company to guarantee itself a leadership that reflects its consumers. Leaders can also look to the approach taken by the Secretary's Office of Global Women's Issues in the U.S. State Department, which is integrating initiatives for women's advancement into the United States' foreign policy and the duties of every U.S. diplomat abroad. And it has built partnerships with the private sector to mentor and train thousands of women who own small and medium-sized businesses in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere around the world, to combat gender-based violence, and to provide prenatal education to mothers in developing countries. If the world is truly to mine the untapped potential of women, and bring greater social and economic progress to our societies, then all sectors of society -- government, business, civil -- must work together. Not just because women will reap the benefits, but because everyone stands to benefit. None of us will truly arrive until girls and women leap over the tipping point, too.

"(CNN) -- At the NATO summit in Chicago, President Obama and leaders of America's NATO allies agreed on an ""irreversible"" plan to withdraw from Afghanistan. But challenges remain. Despite the deliberately unambiguous word choice used to describe the withdrawal, uncertainty about how the West will confront the obstacles ahead remains. Issues specifically related to Afghanistan are yet to be resolved, and plenty of others are tied to the volatile politics of the area. The Afghan National Army is already taking the lead in regions with roughly 75% of the population, with U.S. and other NATO troops acting as support. However, this does not include the most contested areas in the south and east, where Afghan forces are slated to assume responsibility by next summer. Serious doubts persist about their readiness to do so. Despite significant training efforts, the army's level of competence remains in question. It lacks many of the support functions needed for war fighting. The army will remain dependent on international forces for these capabilities and on the international community for financial assistance, expected to cost at least $4 billion a year. The strategic partnership agreement signed by the United States and Afghanistan in early May addressed both issues. Washington pledged a residual force of U.S. troops that will stay in Afghanistan and promised financial assistance. Still unclear, however, is how many soldiers will make up the residual force, how long they will stay, what their main objectives will be and where they will be based. Complicating matters even more, the Afghan army is overwhelmingly non-Pashtun, which makes operating in the overwhelmingly Pashtun south and east, where the Taliban-led insurgency is strongest, all the more challenging. The army's ethnic composition and that of the Karzai government are also among Pakistan's chief concerns. Which brings us to the wider regional concerns. During the 1990s, Pakistan's rival India supported the non-Pashtun Northern Alliance against the Pakistan-sponsored Taliban. Today, Pakistan views the non-Pashtun army in Afghanistan as essentially the Northern Alliance on steroids: a 300,000-plus force equipped by the United States and, like the government in Kabul, partial to India. If the Afghan army holds together, then Pakistan faces an unfriendly army loyal to an unfriendly government on its western border. If the army splinters as a result of its unbalanced ethnic composition -- Pashtuns represent the majority of the population but a small minority in the army -- this probably would result in inter- and intra-ethnic violence that could rend the nation. A civil war in Afghanistan would have disastrous consequences for the region, particularly neighboring Pakistan. Yet Pakistan's fears have led it to pursue a myopic policy that could contribute to this very outcome. It supports the Taliban, the Haqqani network and other assorted proxies in Afghanistan both as a hedging strategy and with the aim of positioning itself as the ultimate arbiter of any resolution. This has encouraged hedging among other regional actors and led to Pakistan's isolation. Though the Pakistani security establishment supports an Afghan-led reconciliation with the Taliban, it seeks significant control over that process. This is unacceptable to Kabul, Washington and, ironically, the Taliban. They all want to minimize Pakistan's role. These thorny issues have been extant for quite some time, but no clear path to resolving them has been proposed, and it doesn't appear any significant progress was made in Chicago. The main focus on Pakistan during the NATO summit concerned its willingness to reopen NATO supply lines into Afghanistan that have been closed since November after a U.S. air raid accidentally killed 24 Pakistani soldiers. Since then, supplies have been shipped via the longer and more expensive Northern Distribution Network running through Russia and Central Asia. Although reopening Pakistani supply lines is not essential for maintaining NATO forces on the ground, they constitute an important logistical link for any large-scale withdrawal. When Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari received a last-minute invite to Chicago, it was well understood that this was intended to ease Pakistan's resistance to reopening these supply lines. But they remain closed, subject to a disagreement over the transit fee Pakistan will receive for each truck and Washington's unwillingness to issue a formal apology for the air raid. Most experts anticipate that the issue will be resolved sooner rather than later. More troubling, Pakistan's presence in Chicago was tied mainly to its control of supply lines, not to the vital role it could play in tipping the balance in Afghanistan toward either a political resolution or a possible civil war. Meanwhile, the Pakistan military appears to be increasing support for its own proxies in anticipation of the NATO drawdown, heightening the possibility of civil war in Afghanistan. That other regional powers, chiefly India and Iran, are readying their own proxies for this eventuality only risks making it more likely. Questions remain about whether any residual American force will be sufficient to provide enough support to the Afghan army to avoid such an outcome. It's also unknown whether this objective will take priority over strategically defeating al Qaeda or at least denying it the ability to reclaim its safe haven in Afghanistan. The summit in Chicago was an important turning point. U.S. forces cannot remain in Afghanistan at present levels indefinitely, not least because there is no purely military solution to these problems. But it's clear that a timeline for the transition to a new role for the U.S. and NATO allies in Afghanistan does not mean the war is over.

"(EW.com ) -- Fox has canceled three freshman comedies, including the most critically bashed sitcom of the season. The network confirms that Seth MacFarlane's ""Dads"" is dead. This is actually a bit surprising. The industry tom-toms began to drum in recent weeks that the series starring Giovanni Ribisi and Seth Green was, against the odds, looking very likely for a renewal. Recently, however, the caustic comedy's fortune suddenly reversed. The axing is a win for the critics â€” ""Dads"" averaged a score of only 15 of 100 on Metacritic. In addition, ""Surviving Jack"" is canceled too â€” that's definitely not a surprise. The single-camera sitcom based on best-selling author Justin Halpern's autobiographical book, ""I Suck at Girls,"" is a coming-of-age story set in the 1990s that featured Christopher Meloni as a dad trying to raise his teenage kids. The show struggled in the ratings on Thursday nights. Lastly, cult-fav comedy ""Enlisted"" is dead. The Friday night freshman military comedy starring Geoff Stults and Chris Lowell was always a long shot for a renewal, but the feel-good series had plenty of fans and defenders who hoped it would get a second chance. In the ratings, ""Dads"" averaged 4.2 million viewers and a 1.8 rating including DVR playback; ""Surviving Jack"" had 5 million and a 1.4 rating; and ""Enlisted"" had 2.7 million and a 1.0 rating. Fox is not commenting on whether the Greg Kinnear legal drama series ""Rake"" is canceled, but nobody seems to expect the show to return for a second season either. Earlier this year, Fox announced renewals for Tuesday comedies ""New Girl,"" ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" and ""The Mindy Project."" Also, for those tracking this stuff, Fox has passed on comedy pilots ""No Place Like Home,"" ""Fatrick"" and ""Dead Boss."" This is the first of what's sure to be many cancellations over the next several days as broadcasters prepare for their upfront presentation to advertisers.

"Belfast, Northern Ireland (CNN) -- For Martin McGuinness, shaking Queen Elizabeth II's hand is the biggest single step yet on his road from feared paramilitary commander to politician. It's a transformation that has taken place over decades: From the shaggy-haired, scrawny commander of Irish Republican Army (IRA) gunmen in the early 1970s, to the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, where he represents Sinn Fein, the province's most popular, mainly Roman Catholic, Republican party opposed to British rule. In his home city of Londonderry I saw that fear firsthand while shooting a documentary about him a little over a decade ago. McGuinness had long been rumored to have had a direct hand in the killing of an IRA man turned informer. I visited the man's mother, who lived just a few streets away from McGuinness's modest terraced house in the city's notorious Bay Side neighborhood. The killing had allegedly taken place decades earlier but the man's mother was still too afraid to talk. Queen arrives in Northern Ireland on jubilee visit . Derry, as he would call his city, or Londonderry, as the province's mainly Protestant, pro-British Loyalists refer to it, was where McGuinness first tried his hand at politics. While shooting the documentary I met with one of his former political colleagues who also was a secret agent for the British government. He had been pulled out and relocated to mainland Britain when his cover was blown a long time ago, but he told me he warned his British government handlers that McGuinness's early ballot box victories were a fraud: Countless ballots cast in clear infringement of the law. Royal boost for peace process . He says his handlers turned a blind eye, and he concluded even at that early stage, 10 years after violence broke out, that British government officials had calculated McGuinness was someone they wanted in a suit and tie at the table talking to them, and not on the streets waging war. As I concluded that documentary, I struggled to balance all I had seen with the question, is this transition reversible? Is McGuinness committed to peace? Back then, the IRA had still not decommissioned its weapons, and the door seemed open to a return to violence. Later McGuinness's Sinn Fein colleagues told me I'd set him up for assassination as a leader who'd used back channels to secretly negotiate peace with the British government. I was told ""we expected something more like Nelson Mandela,"" but that was a leap of faith I didn't have the evidence to take. Dislike for McGuinness is not limited to those on the opposite side of the sectarian divide. His readiness to make peace with the British -- never mind shake the queen's hand -- has made him some powerful enemies in his own mainly Catholic community. When McGuinness and the IRA gave up their guns, even more extreme republicans picked up where they left off. The Real IRA has continued, its hard core of supporters making bombs and killing policemen. In the Derry streets where McGuinness still lives, violent vigilante gangs mete out their own informal justice on the community, shooting drug pushers. They boast more arms than the IRA ever had, and have filled the void left as McGuinness and the social order the IRA enforced fade into the past. Meeting the queen means McGuinness loses the legitimacy of hardcore Republicans -- he can no longer sway them as he once did. So while he'll still call for the British government to investigate its own actions of brutality, collusion with Protestant paramilitaries and the alleged shoot-to-kill policy of IRA volunteers, his calls will ring hollow for some. But all along, McGuinness's every move, from IRA commander, to deputy first minister, seems to have been an ever-more calculated step. The vast majority of nationalists -- and everyone else in Northern Ireland, for that matter -- only ever wanted a fair deal, peace, jobs and a good education for their children. McGuinness seems to have read that well. An IRA military victory over ""Queen and Country"" was never really an option. It was a dream whose time came and went riding on the back of bigotry, sectarian violence, social injustice and the civil rights movement of the late 1960s. The London-backed governments in Belfast had long run roughshod over nationalist, mainly Catholic aspirations. In a handshake, McGuinness will banish that to the history books for ever. An acknowledgment sealed in a formality that the violent divided past should be laid to rest. For a man of peace -- which is how McGuinness wants to be remembered -- he has come a long way, and so have the nationalists of Ireland.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Photographer Anton Fury's hobby of searching weekend garage sales for collectible toys led him to dozens of apparently unpublished photos of a young Marilyn Monroe. Fury has allowed CNN to publish the images just days before what would have been Monroe's 85th birthday. They apparently were taken during a photo session before she was well known. ""I found an envelope of negatives, didn't know what they were, but I realized they were old,"" Fury said. He paid $2 for the folder, which contained two envelopes of black-and-white negatives. That was in Parsippany, New Jersey, in 1980, when Fury says he was ""a fledgling photographer."" ""I took it home, put them on the lightboard with a loupe and, needless to say, these are Marilyn,"" he said. ""That was probably my greatest garage sale discovery ever."" The second envelope was filled with about 70 negatives of actress Jayne Mansfield. Fury held onto the photographs for the last three decades, not knowing much about them. ""The only thing we're sure of is who,"" he said. ""We don't know where, we don't know why, we don't know when, we don't know who shot them. But we do know it is Marilyn."" Fury flew to Los Angeles this week to show the images to David W. Streets, a Beverly Hills art dealer and appraiser experienced with Monroe photos. Monroe was one of the most photographed women ever, but Streets suspects these photos are from her early years, soon after she cut her hair and evolved into the iconic look most people associate with her. ""I've looked for early photographs, early test shots, magazine shots, books, and haven't been able to find anything yet, so the mystery we're just beginning to unravel,"" Streets said. Streets' best guess for now is the photos were taken in 1950, a breakout year for the nearly unknown Monroe because of her minor roles in ""The Asphalt Jungle"" and ""All About Eve."" ""I know they were taken here in Los Angeles,"" which we know ""from the backgrounds that we see in the photos,"" Streets said. ""You see Hollywood Hills, Hollywood 1950s architecture."" There are more questions than answers, though. ""For me as an appraiser and as a researcher, I want people to call, I want people to e-mail and say, 'This is where it is, this is what it is, this is who I think took it,' "" Streets said. One clue that could be important is the coincidence of a man seen in both the Monroe and Mansfield photographs. It is possible he was the photographer for both sessions, Streets said. ""We know that Monroe and Mansfield were here working at the same time, were contemporaries and friends,"" Streets said. ""So, there's an intertanglement there that we're going to unravel and see where the mystery leads."" Monroe, who would have been 24 in 1950, wore two bathing suits, including a bikini, and short pants during the poolside photo shoot. One risk Fury runs as he brings his garage sale find to the public, and possibly for sale, is that someone could make a legal claim to the photos, which are possibly still protected by copyright laws even after 60 years. ""That's kind of what we're trying to figure out,"" Fury said. There's way more questions than there are answers at this point. We don't know where this is going to lead.""","Photographer found Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield negatives in 1980 .

"(CNN) -- Former Tennessee Sen. Howard Baker passed away recently. Although he was known for many things, Baker's most enduring moment came in the middle of the Watergate scandal, when he asked: ""What did the president know and when did he know it?"" The scandal happened 40 years ago. It started with a break-in at the Democratic headquarters in Washington, D.C. and it was followed with subsequent efforts to obstruct an investigation into whether the White House had been involved. In July 1974, the Supreme Court ruled 8-0 that the White House had to turn over recorded presidential conversations to the investigators. The House Judiciary Committee voted in favor of the three articles of impeachment, charging President Richard Nixon with obstruction of justice. The Watergate scandal had a devastating effect on American politics. In his riveting forthcoming book, ""The Invisible Bridge,"" Rick Perlstein skillfully recounts the era that was shaped by the scandal and the way in which the sordid activities of the Nixon administration unfolded on a day-by-day basis. Each revelation gave voters another reason not to trust their elected officials and to believe the worst arguments that people made about government. Americans could never look at government the same way again. The scandal continues to reverberate today throughout the political spectrum. We still live in the era of Watergate. For Democrats, who many thought would have been the beneficiaries of a scandal that brought down a Republican president, the level of distrust that the scandal generated among the public has been an ongoing challenge. At the most basic level, Democrats argue that the federal government offers the best solution to the problems of the day. But if the public does not trust its elected officials, Democrats are left in a position of having to constantly defend the legitimacy of the institutions of government and to convince voters that bureaucrats really will do their job. The intense skepticism surrounding the Affordable Care Act, Benghazi and the Internal Revenue Service scandal have revealed how easy it is for opponents of government to stoke these kinds of fears. Republicans have suffered too, even after the party separated itself from Nixon as its figurehead. The truth is that Republicans promote government as well, just for different reasons. Their programs have, likewise, been subject to constant scrutiny as a result of the lingering distrust from Watergate. For conservatives, national security programs have been a centerpiece of their agenda. Republicans have pushed for expanding the military budget and since 9/11 many have called for an aggressive response to terrorism that includes sweeping surveillance programs and enhanced interrogation techniques. Revelations about what government officials do without public accountability -- such as torture or snooping into e-mails -- have deepened public distrust and created strong pushbacks. Politicians in both parties must operate in a political environment filled with investigations, or accusations of another scandal looming with the suffix ""gate"" attached to it. Whenever some kind of scandal breaks, it doesn't take long for the story to escalate and for questions to arise as to whether this will end up as big as Watergate. Often, this outlook has salutary effects by encouraging politicians to make sure that similar levels of corruption don't happen again. But, too often, as many would say has been the case with the IRS, stories of administrative mismanagement are blown out of proportion, consuming Washington's time and taking their attention away from major problems. The worst effect of Watergate is that it created a climate where Americans fundamentally don't trust their government. It is one thing to be suspicious, another to reject altogether. Recent approval ratings for Congress tanked to 7% and for the President 29%. This is part of the broader trend we have seen since the 1960s. It is extremely difficult for government to do its job or for voters to have the kind of faith in government, which is necessary for a healthy society. When Howard Baker asked his famous question, his hope was not to disparage government but to make it better. He wanted to find the corruption, to seek the reform so that government could do its job once again. Unfortunately, the kind of faith that Baker had in government never returned. To really banish the memories of Watergate and set the government on a better course, reforming politics is the most important solution. Improving our campaign finance system by curbing the influence of private money and imposing stronger restrictions on lobbying, such as the revolving door between the government and lobbying groups, is an essential first start. Until we take those kinds of steps, voters will always be seeing the shadow of Richard Nixon when they look at their elected leaders.","Julian Zelizer: The Watergate scandal had a devastating effect on American politics .

"(CNN) -- On Thursday, in response to widespread criticism, President Obama announced that the administration was delaying enforcement of the Affordable Care Act's insurance market reforms as necessary in order to allow insurers to renew coverage that does not comply with those reforms for individuals and small groups who have been covered in 2013. This change was the President's response to a challenge that he had broken his promise, ""If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health plan."" But this promise has been seriously misunderstood. The promise of the Affordable Care Act was never that if at some point in the future you found a health care plan you liked, you could keep it forever. Rather, it was: ""Nothing in this Act ... shall be construed to require that an individual terminate coverage ... in which such individual was enrolled on the date of enactment of this Act."" This promise has been kept. The Affordable Care Act did, however, offer other assurances that are at risk of not being met. One was that people with pre-existing medical conditions who have been unable to purchase health insurance at an affordable price, or even perhaps to purchase it at all, would, as of January 1, 2014, be able to find affordable insurance that would meet their medical needs. To fulfill this, health insurers were told that if they sold qualified health plans at affordable premiums without considering health status, they would get a sustainable mix of healthy and unhealthy enrollees. But now, Congress is considering allowing health insurance policies that we being sold in 2013 to be sold throughout 2014, even though they violate the 2014 reforms. The good news is that the Obama administration's fix does not go that far, only allowing the renewal of 2013 policies for 2014, and not the sale of new policies that don't comply with the law. But even allowing the sale or renewal of 2013 policies in 2014 is a problem. Insurers have already set their rates for the exchanges based on the promise that they would be getting healthy and as well as unhealthy enrollees. If some healthy individuals instead opt for bargain-basement 2013 policies, insurers are unlikely to get premiums that will cover their costs in the exchanges. Some insurers -- current market leaders -- may be able to survive for a year doing this. But new entrants, including the new cooperative plans backed by federal loans, may not survive. Insurers that lose money will be bailed out to some degree by the taxpayers through the law's premium stabilization programs. But insurers will substantially raise their premiums for 2015 to protect themselves in case this happens again. The promise of affordable coverage for people with medical problems is therefore at risk. It was clear from the beginning that there would be winners and losers under the Affordable Care Act. If insurance is going to be affordable for people who have heretofore been closed out of the insurance market, and if it is going to cover services that have not been covered before -- like equal coverage for mental health services -- it will cost more than it has in the past for those who have been blessed with good health and low premiums. Is this fair? That's debatable. Perhaps it would be more fair for the public generally to bear the cost of insuring those with high medical costs, as we do with Medicare. But let us be clear. Individuals who are paying more for coverage in 2014 than they did in 2013 are not doing so because a promise was broken. On the other hand, turning the exchanges into a high risk pool, and expecting insurers to cover exchange enrollees with premiums based on projections of a normal health insurance market, would break the real promise of the Affordable Care Act: That health insurance would be affordable to all Americans, regardless of whether they were healthy or sick. The Obama administration's fix tries to steer a middle path. Whether it can clear the short-term hurdles to achieve its long-term goal remains to be seen. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Jost.","President Obama, in response to widespread criticism, offered a fix to Obamacare .

"(CNN) -- Kenyan forces shot dead five people allegedly involved in an attack this week that turned a World Cup viewing party into a bloodbath. The five were killed Thursday in the coastal town of Mpeketoni as they tried to escape Kenyan forces, the ministry said Friday. Authorities detained additional suspects in the raid, including the owner and driver of a vehicle used in the attack on soccer viewers that killed at least 48 people, said national police chief David Kimaiyo. Another suspect, who was operating social media accounts allegedly used by Al-Shabaab, was also arrested, he said. Kenyan authorities aggressively looked for suspects in Sunday's attack on the soccer viewers in the same town. Armed men stormed the city center, shooting and hacking people to death before moving into a residential area, where they went from door to door, the witnesses said. Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group active in Somalia, was not responsible, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said earlier this week. Instead, he blamed local political networks. ""The attack was well planned, orchestrated and politically motivated ethnic violence against the Kenyan community with the intention of victimization for political reasons. This therefore was not an Al-Shabaab terrorist attack,"" Kenyatta said. The heavily armed gunmen, many in military uniforms, attacked hotels, a restaurant, gas station, bank, police station and a government office, according to the Kenyan Red Cross. Video from the scene showed burned-out vehicles and walls pockmarked by bullets. Mpeketoni sits to the west of the Kenya-Somalia border, where the Kenyan army is fighting troops loyal to the al Qaeda-linked militant group. The attack in Mpeketoni is the deadliest attack in Kenya since Al-Shabab militants stormed Nairobi's Westgate Mall last year, killing dozens. CNN's Joyce Joseph, Lillian Leposo, Ralph Ellis and Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report.","The five were killed as they tried to escape, ministry says .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Another attacker in an Afghan police uniform killed a member of the NATO forces Sunday in Afghanistan, the latest in a slew of so-called ""green-on-blue"" attacks. The incident took place in southern Afghanistan, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said. The attack brings to 40 the number of NATO troops killed in 32 such attacks this year, according to figures provided by ISAF. U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta urged Afghanistan on Saturday to take further steps to vet security force recruits. NATO: Most attacks on coalition troops driven by personal grievances . In a telephone call Saturday, Panetta encouraged President Hamid Karzai to work closely with the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan to counter such attacks, Pentagon spokesman George Little said in a written statement. There were two green-on-blue attacks Friday. An Afghan police officer opened fire on U.S. troops in Farah province, killing two, the same day that an Afghan soldier wounded two NATO service members and an Afghan security force member in Kandahar province. Even as NATO blamed the majority of attacks on personal grievances rather than an infiltration by insurgents, ISAF commanding Gen. John Allen ordered all troops in the country to carry loaded weapons around the clock. Panetta urged Karzai to work closely with Allen to strengthen ISAF-Afghan cooperation to counter the threat, ""including augmented counterintelligence measures, even more rigorous vetting of Afghan recruits, and stepped up engagement with village elders, who often play a key role by vouching for Afghan security personnel,"" Little said. The attacks come at a critical time for the United States, which has picked up the pace of training Afghan forces as it prepares to withdraw troops by the end of 2014. The telephone call between the two leaders came the same day a NATO airstrike killed a senior Taliban leader in the Kunar province, along Afghanistan's northern border with Pakistan, ISAF said in a statement released Sunday. ISAF identified the man as Maulawi Nur Mohammad, whom it accused of planning and directing all Taliban activity in the Chapah Darah district. ""During the operation, the Afghan and coalition security force observed a large group of heavily armed insurgents engaging in insurgent activity,"" according to the release. ""After ensuring there were no civilians in the area, the security force engaged the insurgents with a precision airstrike."" On Sunday, three ISAF service members were also killed in an improvised explosive device attack in eastern Afghanistan, ISAF said. Official: Man kills 3 US Marines at Afghan base .

"(CNN) -- Take a glass, fill it with marbles and shake. That's what it can feel like inside an airplane hit by turbulence. Recent United Airlines and American Airlines flights have both been hit by unexpected turbulence that resulted in injuries. A United flight bound for New York's LaGuardia Airport last month experienced turbulence shortly after takeoff from Houston, sending five crew and passengers to the hospital. And five people were taken to a hospital Tuesday after an Aruba-to-Miami flight encountered turbulence during its initial descent, an American Airlines spokesman said. Since 2007, there have been 58 reported incidents of turbulence on U.S. airlines, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. These incidents resulted in 64 serious injuries and 97 minor injuries, according to the FAA. Commonly experienced as bumpiness in flight, ""turbulence is rapidly varying or overturning air motions occurring across short distances in the atmosphere,"" Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University meteorology professor Curtis James said. Turbulence can occur at any time on a flight, according to Bonnie Schneider, a meteorologist who appears on CNN and HLN and is the author of ""Extreme Weather: A Guide to Surviving Flash Floods, Tornadoes, Hurricanes, Heat Waves, Snowstorms, Tsunamis and Other Natural Disasters."" There are several common types of turbulence. Convective turbulence can occur when an aircraft passes over an unstable air mass (perhaps near a thunderstorm) and experiences rapidly rising or descending air, according to Schneider. Mechanical turbulence can occur when an aircraft passes over a mountain range, hills or even large buildings. They bring ""waves"" of uneven airflow. Wind shear or clear air turbulence can occur without warning due to changing movements and speeds of air at different heights. ""Because the air can be more unstable at lower altitudes, it may more typically occur as a plane is climbing upwards from taking off or descending to land,"" Schneider said. ""Also, since summer thunderstorms tend to occur often in the afternoon, you may find less 'bumpy' flights in the early morning hours,"" but it can happen any time, even at night, Schneider says. Capt. Chuck Hogeman isn't worried about what turbulence will do to his plane. Planes are designed to withstand the pressure of the atmosphere in flight, even when it feels really bumpy, says Hogeman, chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association air safety committee and a United Airlines captain with more than 20 years of flight experience. He does worry about passengers and loose galley items flying around during unexpected turbulence. Don't let turbulence freak you out . One of the trickiest things pilots have to figure out is ""when to turn that seat belt sign off after there's been some turbulence and it's been smooth for a period of time,"" he said. ""There's no guarantee you're going to have a smooth ride, and the onset of turbulence can be very quick. Passengers really do need to rely on the judgment of the men and women up front."" We've all heard the flight attendant announcements to fasten our seat belts on board airplanes, even when the seat belt sign isn't illuminated. That offers added protection to passengers, who can choose to follow the rules and buckle up. Pilots often order flight attendants to sit down if they know turbulence is coming or it's already hit; otherwise, the flight attendants are moving about the airplane cabin to prepare the airplane for in-flight service and landing. You may not feel particularly fortunate in your cramped coach seat with not even a bag of peanuts to calm you down, but you're luckier than the flight attendant pushing a drink cart during an unpredicted bout of clear air turbulence. That cart weights several hundred pounds, and the flight attendant has to secure it before buckling up, says Corey Caldwell, an Association of Flight Attendants spokeswoman. Bruises, sprains and even broken bones are common among flight attendants, she says. So do what James does on a flight: ""I just wear my seat belt, because I know it can happen at any time."" CNN's Mike Ahlers contributed to this report.","Turbulence can happen at any time, although it often comes during ascent or descent .

"(CNN) -- In all of the fallout surrounding the prisoner exchange for Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, let's get these points out of the way: the case for leaving no soldier behind is a sound and important one — a way to keep faith with our troops. There is historical precedent for the exchange of prisoners. President Obama likely has the legal authority he needs, as commander in chief, to order a swap. Did the president notify Congress — as in the Democratic chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee — in a timely manner beforehand? No. Had this been a matter of some internal controversy for years precisely because of the nature of any trade? Yes. Was the White House aware of the questionable circumstances of Bergdahl's disappearance? Yes. Should National Security Adviser Susan Rice have thought twice before describing him as someone who ""served with honor and distinction."" Yes, because the jury is most definitely out on that one. Should the President have held a triumphal newser in the Rose Garden to announce the release and swap? Um, no. Absolutely no. ""The point is, you have to get him home as a way to keep faith with our troops,"" says a former senior national security official. ""Everybody gets that. Then you deal with him and the circumstances of his departure."" As for the ceremony in the President's backyard? ""That was surreal,"" he says. ""Truly."" Opinion: Five tough ethics issues in Bergdahl swap . In a way, it's all surreal and hard to unspool. So let's start at the policy end of all of this. This is a president whose legacy is up for grabs. One important piece: ending two wars (Iraq and Afghanistan) and capturing and killing Osama bin Laden. ""This (The Bergdahl swap) is tying up loose ends,"" says another former senior national security source. ""The administration made the decision not to leave any people there, so that was that."" The Republicans, of course, argue that a virtually 100% withdrawal is wrong. That the President should have instead planned for a gradual withdrawal, depending on circumstances on the ground. Then he might not have felt such pressure to clear the decks and cut this deal. Or do a victory lap in the Rose Garden. It is, they charge, pure politics. Then Obama played right into their hands. Trouble is, Republicans are playing at it, too. They're tweeting their joy about Bergdahl's release one minute, then un-tweeting it the next. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham charged that this is the President's backdoor way of emptying out Guantanamo without having to close it. Please. Who are the Gitmo detainees? This is a serious matter. Years of internal deliberations have gone into this, according to my sources. That's why the White House needs to make it clear why the swap was a matter so urgent that there wasn't enough time to notify the appropriate people, much less consult with them. Was Bergdahl swap legal? Depends on who you ask . Understandably, there were concerns about his safety. And even given all the delicacies of revealing health issues, it's still an important matter to explain. Because right now, it looks like the lack of consultation is about one thing: the knowledge that there would be pushback. And, as one source puts it, ""fighting over process is always easier than fighting over substance."" In other words, it's easier to apologize than ask for permission. Now the administration has fights on both of those fronts. At least they're consistent: micromanaging foreign policy from the west wing has always been a hallmark. Not that it wins you any friends — or political support. Guess it's too late for that now. If this were Netflix, a replica of SEAL Team Six could have swooped in to the rescue, just like they did in 2011. Ironically, my sources say, the bin Laden raid itself complicated events: If Bergdahl was in Pakistan, would that inflame an already inflamed relationship due to the bin Laden raid? Was the intel good enough? Was the considerable risk worth it? Taliban video shows Bowe Bergdahl's release in Afghanistan . The backdrop to all of this is that the same questions that are now being raised publicly had been raised internally for years — about what a ""fair"" trade would include. As CNN's Elise Labott has reported, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was skeptical of early plans to trade five Gitmo prisoners for Bergdahl. And as my national security source adds, ""people opposed the deal because it wasn't great."" But, he adds, ""they were also looking at a deal that would provoke negotiations with the Taliban."" Hillary Clinton wanted tougher deal for Bergdahl . That is not the case now. The conflict is winding down. We're leaving Afghanistan. No one left behind. Sgt. Bergdahl gets to go home. What lingers, sadly, is the unsettling reality that five really, really bad guys have a ticket home, too.","Gloria Borger: Many of the questions surrounding Bergdahl swap are answerable .

"(CNN) -- As you get older, it's important to make small changes to your diet to protect your long-term health. Here are seven nutrients to zero in on after turning 50. Vitamin D . Why you need it: Scientific journals have been bursting at the seams in recent years with new research about the importance of vitamin D, and according the data, the vast majority of women aren't getting enough. One recent study found that adults with the lowest blood vitamin D levels were about twice as likely to die from any cause compared to those with the highest levels. Other studies have linked adequate intakes to lower rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, depression, certain cancers, and brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. This key nutrient is also tied to enhanced immunity, muscle functioning, and injury prevention (pretty impressive, huh?). Vitamin D's nickname is the ""sunshine vitamin"" because exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays triggers its production in the body, but you can't rely on the sun as your sole source. Your location, cloud cover, smog, time of day and year, and sunscreen use all affect your UV exposure and vitamin D production. How to get it: Some of the best natural food sources include wild salmon, whole eggs (the D is in the yolk), and mushrooms, and it's in fortified foods like dairy, but it can be difficult to eat enough of these foods to meet your needs, so a supplement may be your best bet. Health.com: 12 ways to get your daily Vitamin D . How much is safe: To identify the right amount to take, get your blood level tested. Based on the results, your doctor can recommend the proper daily dose. Calcium . Why you need it: Bone density declines more rapidly after 50, and one in three women over this age will experience a bone fracture. Research shows that in the first years after menopause, women may lose 3 to 5% of their bone mass annually, and increases in calcium intakes generally don't offset the losses. Calcium is also required for muscle contractions, so this mineral allows you to get the most from every workout. It's also needed for nerve function, and helps maintain your body's acid/base balance, so there are plenty of reasons to strive to hit the suggested mark. How to get it: While dairy may be your first thought, there are also several plant-based sources, including dark leafy greens, beans and lentils, nuts, and dried figs. How much is safe: If you choose to use a supplement, just be sure not to go overboard. The recommended daily calcium intake for women over 50 is 1,200 mg per day, but the maximum advised limit, from both food and supplements combined, from age 51 on is 2,000 mg per day. I've seen plenty of women exceed that amount (sometimes unknowingly, sometimes because they mistakenly believe more is better), and getting too much can be risky, with potential side effects including kidney problems, kidney stones, and calcium deposits in soft tissues. High calcium intakes can also lead to constipation, and interfere with the absorption of iron and zinc, and recently, excess calcium has been linked to a higher risk of heart disease. Talk to your doctor or dietitian to be sure you're striking the right balance. Health.com: 14 surprising facts about healthy bones . Probiotics . Why you need them: Probiotics have been shown to boost immunity, improve digestive and skin health, lower ""bad"" LDL cholesterol, fight gum disease, and enhance weight control, so there's plenty to benefit from for women over 50. How to get them: While foods like yogurt, kefir, kimchi, and sauerkraut contain probiotics, it may be difficult to consume enough of these ""friendly bacteria"" on a daily basis through food alone. How much is safe: If you opt for a supplement, ask your doc or dietitian for a recommended brand and amount. There's currently no standard dose for probiotics, like those that have been established for vitamins and minerals; and while probiotics are generally considered to be safe, your personal medical history should be taken into account before you pop a pill.

Why you need them: The omega-3s DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) are essential fatty acids that have been tied to vision and brain protection, healthy hair and skin, improved circulation, reduced muscle soreness, a lower risk of heart disease and depression, and a reduction in inflammation, which is a known trigger of aging and disease. This remarkable list of benefits makes getting sufficient amounts of these good fats particularly important in your 50s. How to get them: Fatty fish like salmon and sardines are rich sources, but a dislike of seafood or concerns about mercury may interfere with getting enough. And while plant-based foods like flaxseeds and walnuts contain a type of omega-3 called alpha-linolenic acid or ALA, your body only converts a small percentage of this form into EPA and DHA -- the two types that the vast majority of the research has focused on. How much is safe: If you choose to take a supplement that provides DHA and EPA (vegan options are available), it's important to note that there's currently no standard daily dose for healthy adults. Many experts recommend 1,000 mg of DHA/EPA combined, the amount advised for those with heart disease, and like some of the other nutrients I've mentioned, it's important not to go overboard. Emerging research shows that too much omega-3 may weaken immunity, and excess intakes have been linked to bleeding, especially when combined with medications or supplements that like omega-3s, also have a blood thinning effect. Once again, to pinpoint the amount that's right for you, rely on advice from your personal health care providers. Health.com: Good fats, bad fats: How to choose . Magnesium . Why you need it: Getting enough of this key ""maintenance mineral"" which is involved in more than 300 bodily reactions can keep your energy soaring and allow you to look and feel like you've turned back the clock. Magnesium helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, preserves strong bones, and slashes stroke and heart disease risk. It also helps regulate blood sugar levels and promotes normal blood pressure, but many women fall short of the recommended intake. How to get it: Good food sources include spinach, almonds, cashews, black beans, quinoa, and pumpkin, sesame, and sunflower seeds. How much is safe: If you opt for a supplement, look for one with no more than 100% of the daily value (400 mg), unless your doctor or dietician has advised differently. Too much magnesium can trigger nausea, diarrhea, appetite loss, muscle weakness, breathing problems, irregular heartbeat, and dangerously low blood pressure. Fiber . Why you need it: Fiber-rich meals result in a steadier rise in blood sugar and a lower insulin response, as well as a slower rate of digestion and absorption, which keeps you fuller longer and delays the return of hunger. It also keeps you ""regular"" by helping your digestive system stay in tip top shape, and getting enough fiber is also a smart weight control strategy. Research has shown that for every gram of fiber we eat, we eliminate about seven calories. That means if you eat 35 grams a day, you'll essentially ""cancel out"" 245 calories -- a savings that could effectively stave off age-related weight gain. How to get it: To bolster your intake, rely on foods that are naturally fiber-rich, like fruits and vegetables (especially those with an edible skin and/or seeds or tough stalk) beans and lentils, and small portions of nuts and whole grains, including oats, whole grain rice, quinoa, and barley. Health.com: 20 best foods for fiber . Water . Why you need it: Water, your body's most important nutrient, is required for every bodily process, and you lose water from your body each minute of the day. Replacing those losses adequately can help you reap the benefits of water, including optimized mood and metabolism, as well as better digestive health (especially if you're stepping up your fiber game), and glowing skin. Good old H2O is also linked to weight control. A recent study found that when middle-aged and older adults drank two cups of water prior to eating a meal, they ate between 75 and 90 fewer calories. Another 12-week study found that adults who gulped extra water lost about 30% more weight following the same diet compared to those who drank less. And a small German study found that drinking two liters of water a day could result in burning up to 95 extra calories, an effect that could help fend off age-related weight gain. How to get (more of) it: According to the Institute of Medicine (IOM), women ages 19 and over need 2.7 liters of total fluid per day (more than 11 cups). About 20% of your fluid needs are met by food, but that still leaves nearly nine cups based on the IOM's guidelines. While other beverages may count as fluid, water is the best way to meet your daily needs, so strive for at least 16 ounces four times a day. This article originally appeared on Health.com.

"(CNN) -- Over the last few weeks there has been a great deal of media attention given to the members of the United States' presidential delegation to the Sochi Olympics. Yes, it does include people, like myself, who are openly gay and it also includes delegates who are openly straight. The important part here is the delegation is inclusive and it is representative of the face of America. Delegate members Brian Boitano, Caitlin Cahow, Eric Heiden and Bonnie Blair are world-class athletes, Olympians who have all won medals when they represented our nation in Olympic competition. Janet Napolitano, William Burns, Ambassador Michael McFaul and Robert Nabors are respected leaders on the world stage. The delegation is an impressive collection of athletes and world leaders and it just so happens some of us are gay. Our real role in going to Sochi is not to demonstrate or disrupt the Olympics, but to support the men and women of Team USA. I have been traveling to Russia since 1962 and I have complete respect for the Russian people. It is a privilege to be asked to be part of the Presidential Delegation and a personal thrill to be able to watch our Olympic team compete in Sochi. READ MORE: What one gay Russian model thinks of law . Is our nation making a statement on Russia's anti-gay propaganda law by sending gay men and women to represent us in Sochi? Perhaps we are. As Brian Boitano said in a recent interview, ""I think the statement is already being made by us being on the delegation â€” Billie Jean and Caitlin â€” and us standing together, united as gay people showing that there is freedom of speech and we are successful human beings and athletes. I think that speaks measures."" While I am not planning to protest or demonstrate, I am concerned with the treatment of the LGBT community in Russia and throughout the world. I want the LGBT community living in Russia to know they are not alone and I hope others realize this is not only a gay rights issue, but a global concern for human rights and equality. As I said when I was named to the U.S. delegation, I hope these Olympics will be a watershed moment for the universal acceptance of all people. READ MORE: Will social media foil Putin's Sochi plan? Sometimes it is hard to do the right thing, especially if it may not be the most popular thing.

I have a saying that 98 percent of winning is showing up. So we will show up in Russia. We will support our athletes and cheer them as loudly as possible.

"(CNN) -- When Suzanne Jablonski moved to New Jersey to start a new life, she felt mostly alone in her struggles raising a special-needs child. Her 18-year-old son, Brandon Timberwolf Munic, has emotional, learning and behavioral difficulties as well as mild cognitive impairment. A single mother, Jablonski often felt as though she were in crisis mode, until she found a support system last year called Mom2Mom. Mom2Mom is the only helpline in the United States focused on mothers of special-needs children. The service, staffed by moms of special-needs kids, operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and callers get follow-up support from a dedicated staff who checks up on them. ""I don't think, 'Oh, my God, this is the end of the world,' even though many times before ... I did,"" Jablonski said. ""I don't feel so alone anymore."" Cherie Castellano, who launched Mom2Mom in 2010, has started a number of initiatives based on the idea of ""reciprocal peer support"": that people with similar experiences can help each other. Having experienced the stress of having a child with developmental delays, she wanted to provide a way for other mothers to have caregiving support. Dads are welcome to call the Mom2Mom line too, Castellano said. Mom2Mom now has about 20 mothers on staff, all of whom have children with some sort of special need, including medical illness and mental health problems. The program is part of University Behavioral HealthCare, which will be under Rutgers University as of July 1. ""It's not just good for the moms they're helping, it's also good for them because they get to feel connected and recognize their own strengths,"" Castellano said. Along the same lines, she also founded a law enforcement crisis hot line called Cop2Cop and the veteran support line Vets4Warriors. A staffer always picks up the hot line, no matter what time of day. In the initial call, the peer counselor mother will find out from the caller what she is calling about and then asks, ""How are you?"" The conversation then turns from the child's needs to the mother's own mental health and impact on the family. Most of the time, the caller agrees to engage in ongoing peer support, Castellano said. Mom2Mom then assigns her a support partner with a child who has a similar condition. Autism: What we know right now . The peer counselors check back often with these mothers, talking about what challenges might arise and the state of everyone's mental and physical health in the family. They can refer them to a network of service providers. Mom2Mom also hosts in-person support group meetings. Because it's a state-funded program, Mom2Mom's activities are aimed at New Jersey residents, but no one is turned away; peer support counselors will research resources to try to find connections for the callers in their own states. The program has gotten calls from more than 20 states where moms struggle to find support as they care for special-needs children. On Monday, more than 40 callers came to the Mom2Mom headquarters -- a call center -- in Piscataway, New Jersey, to meet their counselors in at an event to allow peer partners to meet each other for the first time, in honor of Mother's Day. Castellano met a mother she had been speaking with for two years. Staff members spoke about how much comfort they've gotten from the callers as well. ""For like 20 minutes, there was just hugging, crying and chatter,"" she said. Many mothers of special needs children want to appear as ""supermoms,"" being able to balance all of their appointments and challenges and emotions, Castellano said. ""Moms don't want to seem like they're depressed about it or they're sad about it or they're afraid of what's going to happen to their child when they're gone,"" Castellano said. ""There's a lot of shame and guilt and suffering that nobody wants to talk about."" Mom2Mom has been a big help to Debra Lee, 52, of Newark, New Jersey. The youngest two of Lee's four children are on the autism spectrum: a 27-year-old son and a 20-year-old daughter. Her son graduated from Rutgers and works part-time. She worries about both of them, but especially her daughter, who attends a public school with an autism program and doesn't go anywhere alone. Growing up autistic: My story . She was one of the first callers to Mom2Mom and connected with peer counselor Mary Beth Walsh. Today, she attends in-person support groups as well. ""You meet a lot of people that you can talk to,"" she said. ""You do a lot of crying. At least you can talk to people who can understand what you're going through. It makes you feel much better."" Since connecting with Mom2Mom, Lee said, she realizes how hard she had been on herself. She had put her whole self into her children and had lost sight of taking care of herself. Before, she would never buy nice clothes for herself; now, she'll buy suits. ""It just made me see that I could still look nice even though I'm overweight,"" she said. Walsh, Lee's peer counselor, has a 14-year-old son with autism. She has been immersed in the world of autism advocacy since his diagnosis, and admires Lee's positive attitude toward everyone on the autism spectrum. ""I might say, 'Oh, he's so sensitive to sound,' but Debra will say, 'Oh, it's amazing how he's always listening to the environment and picking up all these cues.' "" Both these mothers took part in a Mom2Mom collaborative project expressing their feelings and struggles through artwork; each sculpture consists of two pieces of glass connected to look like a book. The result is called ""Breathless: Mothers of Children with Special Needs."" Lee's glass panel depicts a tree; she wrote about ""having faith.""

"(CNN) -- She was often portrayed as the archetypal dumb blonde, but behind the golden locks and hourglass figure, Marilyn Monroe was an astute businesswoman. Decades later, the 1950s screen siren is providing inspiration for Mariah Carey's own vast entertainment empire. ""Marilyn Monroe, who I'm a huge fan of, had the first production company as a female, as a woman,"" Carey told CNN's Nischelle Turner, ahead of the release of her 14th album later this month. ""She played the dumb blonde role, she played it well, but that was not who she was."" Gaze across New York's Times Square today and you'll find giant billboards of a sun-kissed Carey in netted swimsuit, her album title declaring: ""Me. I am Mariah."" But Carey had to work her socks off to become the best-selling female artist of the millennium in 2000. A woman who has sold 200 million albums worldwide, and overtaken Elvis Presley's record of U.S. number one singles. Less silver spoon in her mouth -- ""more like a plastic spoon,"" says the daughter of an opera singer mother in Long Island, New York. ""I didn't fit in anywhere, and so music was the thing that I had to cling on to, that made me feel special and like I had this secret,"" added the 44-year-old mother-of-two. The idea of one day making it big, however, was laughable to her classmates. ""I remember once in six or seventh grade, they asked: 'What do you want to do when you grow up?'"" said Carey, dubbed the ""songbird supreme"" by the Guinness Book of Records for her remarkable vocal range. ""I said I wanted to be a singer, I wanted to be an actress. And they were all like 'haha.' Because of course at that point I still didn't really have conditioner or know how to comb through textured hair,"" said the musician, whose mother is Irish-American and father is of African-American and Venezuelan descent. The wide-eyed curly-haired girl next door burst onto the music scene in 1990, with her five-octave vocal range and eponymous album that sold a cool 6 million copies. She has since won five Grammy Awards, been nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance in film ""The Butler,"" been a judge on ""American Idol,"" and become a mother to twins she affectionately calls ""Dem babies."" Arriving in Times Square in a figure-hugging black dress recently, signing autographs for her screaming fans, or ""lambily,"" as she calls them, Carey is as glossy and glamorous as an old-school Hollywood starlet.

"(CNN) -- EasyJet's no-frills aircraft seem an unlikely choice for cabin connoisseurs, but the airline says its customers do have preferences. After polling 10,000 passengers from across Europe and analyzing its own sales data, the UK-based airline claims to have identified the continent's favorite seat: 7F. EasyJet says nationality, age and travel companion all influence the cabin position of choice, but clear trends emerge, with one seen as the most highly desired. It says window seats are generally the most coveted, with 59% preferring to gawp out of a lightly frosted lozenge of perspex than confront the reality of flying super economy. EasyJet says seventh row seats on its short haul routes are typically offered at rock-bottom rates of just a few dollars, hence their popularity. ""Sales also reveal the right-hand side of the plane is more popular than the left and rows 6-7 sell out fastest,"" it says in a statement. End of the undignified scramble . The most unpopular seat is identified as 19C. Other stats offer insight into national preferences. Portuguese passengers apparently covet the window the most, while Dutch and Germans are more tolerant of aisle seating. Nervous fliers also prefer the window, while older passengers are more likely to choose the aisle. ""The window versus aisle debate is one of the most frequently overheard conversations while flying,"" says Peter Duffy, group commercial director for EasyJet. EasyJet notably introduced selective seating for all passengers only two years ago. Prior to 2012, non-premium paying customers faced an undignified scramble to find somewhere to park themselves. The survey isn't the first attempt to crunch the numbers on the perfect place to savor the joys of pressurized air and over-stewed dinners.

"(CNN) -- Britain's Queen Elizabeth II arrived in Northern Ireland Tuesday for a two-day diamond jubilee visit during which she will shake hands with a former IRA commander, Martin McGuinness, in a highly symbolic gesture. She will meet McGuinness, now a Sinn Fein politician and the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, at an arts event in Belfast Wednesday. The meeting is a sign of the significant easing of tensions in British-Irish relations since the Good Friday peace deal was signed in 1998. Ireland's President Michael Higgins will attend the same event. On Tuesday, the queen was greeted in Enniskillen -- the scene of a deadly IRA bombing in 1987 -- by crowds lining the streets and waving Union flags. She was greeted by Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Owen Paterson, who accompanied her to a jubilee thanksgiving service at St. Macartin's Cathedral, an Anglican church, that was attended by more than 700 people. She also went to a smaller service at St. Michael's Church in Enniskillen, a Catholic church. Friday's confirmation that the queen would meet McGuinness prompted wide reaction in the UK media. It follows the queen's visit to the Republic of Ireland in May of last year, which was seen as ushering in a new era in relations. The meeting has an added significance for the queen because one of her relatives, Lord Mountbatten, was killed by an IRA bomb in 1979. IRA members have also killed police officers and soldiers in Northern Ireland, who serve in the queen's name. The nationalist community in Northern Ireland sees the British as occupiers and wants their rule in the province to end. Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams acknowledged the controversial nature of the handshake in a statement Friday. ""Because this involves Martin meeting the British monarch, this will cause difficulty for Republicans and nationalists who have suffered at the hands of British forces in Ireland over many decades,"" he said. However, he said, the party had agreed that McGuinness should meet the queen ""in the context of conflict resolution and national reconciliation, as well as our own republican national objectives."" The event is not connected with the queen's diamond jubilee celebrations, he said. ""This is a significant initiative involving major political and symbolic challenges for Irish republicans,"" Adams added. ""As the record of the peace process demonstrates, Irish republicans have frequently been prepared to take bold and historic initiatives and risks for peace to break stalemates and find agreements."" The Queen's 2011 visit to Ireland was the first by a British monarch to the republic since it gained independence in 1921 and marked a reconciliation between neighboring countries, which once viewed each other with suspicion and hostility. McGuinness has admitted that he was a leader of the Provisional IRA during the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland between pro-British and pro-Irish forces. In recent years, he has received death threats from hardline dissident IRA splinter groups because of his support for the peace process. The majority of the island gained independence in 1921, following two years of conflict, but six of the nine counties of the province of Ulster chose to stay in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the country of Northern Ireland. In the late 1960s the conflict between mainly Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom and largely Roman Catholic nationalists who want the North to be reunited with the rest of Ireland exploded into a political and sectarian war, known as the Troubles. The three decades of ensuing violence between the IRA and loyalists claimed the lives of more than 3,000 people, most of them north of the border, and while the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 effectively ended the conflict, suspicions remain. Under the terms of the landmark accord, terrorist groups on both sides dumped their weapons, and political allies of the two now work together in Northern Ireland's power-sharing government. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.","Queen Elizabeth II is visiting Enniskillen, scene of a deadly IRA bombing 25 years ago .

"(CNN) -- The look on moguls skier Hannah Kearney's face said it all: A bronze medal felt like a loss to the defending Olympic champion. After posting the top score in the qualifying round, it seemed her quest to become the first freestyle skier to win two gold medals was secure. But a mistake on the top of the course in the final round left her with a 21.49, a bronze medal score. After finally regaining her composure, the 24-year-old American tried to find a bright side: ""It's really unfortunate it's at the Olympics, but I'm sure something good will come of it. I'm just not sure what it is yet."" At the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, Nike launched a controversial advertising campaign: ""You don't win silver -- you lose gold."" The company pulled the ads after many complained that it violated the Olympic spirit. Kearney, it seems, would agree, as she later said she was proud to bring the Olympic medal home, albeit one of the wrong color. She is not alone. In 2008, a tepid controversy arose regarding who had ""won"" the medal count -- the unofficial tallying of medals that rose to prominence during the Cold War. At the Beijing Olympics, the United States figured itself atop the medal count with 45 total, 14 of which were gold; the Chinese -- with 41 total -- put itself on top with 26 golds. Although the Olympic Charter states that competitions are between individuals and teams, not countries, a medal's worth depends on who is holding it. While Kearney shed tears over her bronze, British snowboarder Jenny Jones expressed jubilation over hers in slopestyle. Having won Great Britain's very first Olympic medal in a snow sport, Jones could barely contain her joy over her surprise third place finish, and the mayor of her hometown, Bristol, plans to welcome her back with a grand celebration. But bronzes are not just happy occasions when they are surprises. Veteran Alpine skier Julia Mancuso arrived in Sochi as the most decorated American woman in Olympic Alpine history, 1 gold and 2 silvers, and added to that haul on her first day of competition a bronze in the Super Combined. Coming off a relatively miserable season, and always a question mark in slalom, Mancuso has been known to save her best for the most high-profile moments, exemplified by her silver in the same event in Vancouver. Her successful debut in Sochi -- and she's by no means done -- gives Mancuso a medal of every color -- the bronze completed her set. Was she happy? ""I got a medal today,"" she crowed afterward, looking just as ebullient as gold medalist Maria Hoefl-Riesch. Mancuso's seasoned enthusiasm was equaled by the American figure skaters, who captured bronze in the inaugural team competition. With the exception of ice dancers Charlie White and Meryl Davis, predictions for U.S. skaters in Sochi have been gloomy, meaning that any medal -- bronze or otherwise -- was better than none at all. The opposite could be said for snowboarding legend Shaun White. Some competitors met with vitriol his decision to withdraw from slopestyle to stay healthy and focus on halfpipe. Perhaps critics should give him a break. For White, it isn't about a medal of any color. It's about capturing that unprecedented third gold. For others, of course, no medal is required: Mere participation at the Olympics is victory enough. The majority of the athletes who march in the Opening Ceremony will not spend time on a podium. We know it, and more important, they know it. For these athletes, the Olympic Creed has real meaning: ""The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win but to take part."" The day before Opening, during the moguls qualifier in which Kearney did so well, teammate Heidi Kloser broke her leg in a nasty spill. While in the ambulance, she asked her father if she was still an Olympian, to which he replied ""Of course you are."" The next evening she made it so, getting to Fisht Olympic Stadium in a wheelchair, and then walking, albeit on crutches, with her team during the Parade of Nations. In Sochi, Kloser had been a serious medal contender, but in the end it wasn't about competing, it was enough just to be there. For Hannah Kearney, at least initially, it wasn't. Because she didn't win bronze. She lost gold.

"Washington (CNN) -- Shaun McCutcheon is an electrical engineer by trade, but grassroots politics may be his true passion. The Alabama native has worked for years with his local Republican Party in Birmingham, and is chairman of Conservative Action Fund, a so-called ""super PAC"" that ""promotes conservative Republicans' time-proven messages and effective solutions."" McCutcheon's success in business and a willingness to put his money into GOP coffers has put him at the center of a politically tricky Supreme Court fight over federal campaign donations. Oral arguments in the case will be heard on Tuesday, a day after the court begins its new term. The government shutdown is not expected to affect the court's normal work schedule. At issue is whether strict limits on direct campaign contributions by individuals -- in the Federal Election Campaign Act -- violate the First Amendment. A ruling by spring could have an immediate impact on the congressional midterm elections next November, and be another blow to existing federal election laws. The appeal from the 46-year-old owner of a Tuscaloosa-based company is supported in court by the Republican National Committee. They object to a 1970s Watergate-era law restricting someone from giving no more than $48,600 to federal candidates, and $74,600 to political action committees, during a two-year election cycle -- for a maximum of $123,200. Church and state, executive power on Supreme Court docket . McCutcheon says he has a constitutional right to donate more than that amount to as many office seekers as he wants, so long as no one candidate gets more than the $2,600 per election limit. He supports those individual controls, but ""what doesn't make any sense is that you can only give that amount of money to a few candidates, because somehow my giving money to (U.S. Rep.) Martha Roby of Alabama could corrupt (former Rep.) Allen West of Florida. That's just nutty, but that's what the powers-that-be want: to prevent folks who want to get involved from having the same ability to get involved and support candidates that big union PACs have."" Political speech or not? McCutcheon equates his donations to ""core political speech."" But backers of continued congressional regulation do not see it that way. ""The reason we have limitations on the dollars an individual can give is to create some sense of fairness, so that if we do have a campaign finance system driven by donations, we have as many opportunities for as many people as possible to participate,"" said Robert Zimmerman, a prominent Democratic fundraiser. ""That's why there are limitations, so that everyone has an equal or fair voice in the process. Not only are our elections being put up for auction, these donors are making an investment in the democratic system for their own agenda and we taxpayers have to foot the bill,"" he said. Zimmerman, too, lives and breathes politics and is a member of the national party's finance team, helping raise about $500,000 for President Barack Obama's re-election effort. Fundamental debate . A special three-judge federal panel in Washington earlier rejected McCutcheon's appeal. The competing arguments are stark: supporters of campaign finance reform say current federal regulations are designed to prevent corruption in politics. Opponents said it would criminalize free speech and association. The current case deals with direct political contributions. A separate 2010 high court case dealt with campaign spending by outside groups, seeking to influence federal elections. There, the conservative majority -- citing free speech concerns -- eased long-standing restrictions on ""independent spending"" by corporations, labor unions, and certain non-profit advocacy groups in political campaigns. The so-called ""Citizens United"" ruling helped open the floodgates to massive corporate spending in the 2012 elections. It also led to further litigation seeking to loosen current restrictions on both the spending and donation areas. The three-year-old ruling also put corporations on the same free speech footing as wealthy individuals, who have long enjoyed the ability to spend freely on behalf of federal candidates. That and a subsequent decision from a federal appeals court in Washington have led to a proliferation of so-called ""super PACs""-- separate political action committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of cash from businesses, unions, and advocacy groups. These super PACs are independent political organizations operating as ""527s,"" named after the tax code governing their operation. They cannot contribute directly to a federal candidate or political party. Limits on direct contributions to candidates by corporations and individuals remain in place, the focus in part of the current McCutcheon appeal. Some political experts say a ruling in favor of increased, or even unlimited, aggregate individual donor contributions could put party committees and political action committees on a greater competitive track with the ""super PACs."" All PACs are organizations that campaign either for or against candidates, legislation, or ballot measures. The difference is in how they are organized for regulatory and tax purposes, and by the amounts of money they are allowed to spend. Regular PACs may also give limited donations to federal candidates and political parties, while super PACs cannot. Legal, political fallout . If they win at the high court, wealthy donors like McCutcheon -- whether Democrat, Republican, or Independent -- could in theory contribute a maximum $3.6 million to the national and state parties, and the 450 or so Senate and House candidates expected to run in 2014. Key for the conservative majority court is whether the current law has a permissible goal of preventing political corruption or the appearance of it. And both sides of the legal fight have entrenched views on that. ""Limitations on a citizen's First Amendment rights cannot be drawn to target the most outlandish hypotheticals that interest groups can conceive,"" said the National Republican Senatorial Committee and National Republican Congressional Committee in a legal brief. ""Especially where those interest groups have an interest in manufacturing the 'appearance' of corruption that this court has held can justify campaign finance regulation."" But those who want current controls to remain in place say if aggregate contribution limits to candidates or parties disappear, it would make it easier for the money to get routed by party leaders into other close races nationwide. ""If the court continues in the direction of Citizens United,"" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) in a recent speech sponsored by the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center, ""we may move another step closer to neutering Congress' ability to limit the influence of money in politics and another step closer to unlimited corporate contributions given directly to candidates and political committees."" What is the impact? Another point of contention is whether the aggregate spending limits are really having a pervasive effect, or only involve a relative few well-heeled givers. Figures from the Center for Responsive Politics for the 2012 race showed about 600 donors leveraged their money to each give the maximum of about $48,000 total -- benefitting no more than 17 presidential or congressional candidates. Almost 1700 contributors forked over the maximum limit to party committees, which added up to more than $100 million. Loosening those limits, say opponents of the law, would benefit wealthy liberals and conservatives equally. But the Supreme Court has never in its history overturned a federal contribution limit. ""Now imagine that overall contribution limits are struck down. Presidential candidates in 2016 could solicit and each of these donors could contribute as much as $1.2 million to their joint fundraising committees"" said Fred Wertheimer, founder and president of Democracy 21, a longtime activist on campaign spending reform. ""It may well open the door to striking down all of the remaining contribution limits, taking us back to the robber-baron era."" The presidential campaigns of Obama and his Republican opponent Mitt Romney were able to create joint fundraising committees and, working with their respective parties, pool fundraising resources. That meant those campaigns were able to solicit contributions to the maximum $70,800 per donor. Wertheimer says an end to contribution limits would be an ""unmitigated disaster."" But McCutcheon argues that characterizing the legal fight as between ""good"" and ""bad"" simply blurs the truth. ""Getting rid of the aggregate limits is not about corrupting democracy-- it is about practicing democracy,"" he said. ""This case is about freedom-- your freedom and my freedom-- to express ourselves openly and fully within our political system. And if there is one thing that we Americans believe with all our hearts, it is that freedom never corrupts."" The case is McCutcheon v.

"(CNN) -- Syria on Saturday slammed the U.N. Human Rights Council's stinging condemnation of its security crackdown, calling the resolution ""unjust and blatantly politicized."" ""It has become clear to the people of Syria and the countries that realize the reality of the conspiracy against it that the interest of the Syrian people is the last thing on the mind of the countries sponsoring such sessions and their impotent resolutions, and that their true goal is inciting the continuation of terrorism against citizens,"" according to an official source quoted by the government-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA). The council, in a 37-4 vote, passed a resolution Friday that ""strongly condemns the continued widespread, systematic and gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by the Syrian authorities, such as arbitrary executions, excessive use of force and the killing and persecution of protesters, human rights defenders and journalists, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, torture and ill-treatment, including against children."" There were six abstentions at the meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. The group convened to consider action against Syria after a report issued Monday by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry, a body appointed by the council. That report concluded security and military forces ""committed crimes against humanity"" on civilians. The resolution recommends that U.N. bodies ""urgently consider"" the commission report and ""take appropriate action."" Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Mauritania and Djibouti were among the nations who voted in favor of the resolution. Those countries are members of the Arab League, one of the international entities initiating sanctions against the Bashar al-Assad regime for its nearly nine-month long bloody push against peaceful protesters. The United States, the European Union and Turkey also have imposed sanctions. The violence appeared to continue Saturday, with the activist group Local Coordination Committees of Syria reporting 22 dead across the country. The highest number of deaths, 10, occurred in the restive region of Homs city and province, in the west. At least six were also killed in Idlib, two each in Daraa and suburbs of Damascus, and one apiece in Hama and Damascus. Intense shooting was reported in several locales, including the Damascus suburb of Hajar Aswad where army forces had allegedly surrounded the Bilal Habashi Mosque. A video statement posted Saturday on YouTube, purportedly from the Free Syrian Army, a military force of defectors, claimed that government snipers fired at protesters in Idlib. In response, the group said its members stopped them by destroying two Syrian armored vehicles and killing ""several"" security forces. SANA, meanwhile, reported that 13 ""army and security forces martyrs on Saturday were escorted from Tishreen Military Hospital to their finale resting place."" The deaths were blamed on ""armed terrorist groups"" -- a term the government commonly uses to describe the opposition, and rationalize its response -- in the ""Damascus countryside."" CNN is unable to independently confirm events occurring inside Syria because the government does not allow journalists free access to the country. Overall, the United Nations said this week that more than 4,000 people have died since mid-March and the death toll continues to rise. That prompted the the report from the world body's human rights council, which SANA said made judgments ""based on information promoted by some groups outside Syria and known biased mass media sources."" The source cited by SANA contended that ""several countries at the UNHRC said that the report and the resolution don't meet the minimum standards of objectivity and professionalism and overstep the jurisdiction of the UNHRC, in addition to ignoring the issue of weapon smuggling and the funding and training of terrorists in special camps outside Syria."" Russia, Cuba, China, and Ecuador voted against the resolution. Russia's permanent council representative said the resolution ""is designed to further exacerbate the conflict and not to peacefully settle it. The resolution is biased, in reflecting the current situation placing full and total blame on the Syrian government and ignoring those serious crimes by anti-government forces. We believe that there is no basis for calling Damascus's activities crimes against humanity - in any event this goes beyond the mandate of the council."" Russia has been calling for the violence to stop, no matter where it stems from. But it is concerned that several provisions in the resolution could be construed ""as an open appeal to interfere in Syria's internal affairs, allowing for military actions, including military intervention."" The Syrian source was quoted by SANA as saying the council ""deliberately ignored documents and information"" from Syria and failed to mention the government's reforms. Even though it was denied access into Syria, the Commission of Inquiry interviewed ""223 victims and witnesses, including military and security forces who had defected and testified to the role of Syrian forces in the use of lethal violence against peaceful protests. "" The United States, Britain, and Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group, hailed the council's move. ""The time has come for the Security Council to follow the lead of the Arab League and Turkey and impose sanctions. It should put in place an arms embargo as well as an asset freeze and travel ban on Syrian officials responsible for the abuses, and refer the case to the International Criminal Court,"" Human Rights Watch said.

"(CNN) -- The threatening calls reportedly came one after the other to Mexico's main Catholic seminary. Callers, claiming to be from one of the country's feared drug cartels, offered an ominous warning: Pay up if you value the safety of your priests. ""They called several times. They identified themselves as the Familia Michoacana, but who knows?"" Cardinal Norberto Rivera, archbishop of Mexico City, revealed at a Mass this week. ""I spoke with the authorities. We made the appropriate report. Because they wanted us to pay. Because if not, they would kill one of us. They wanted to extort 60,000 pesos ($4,600)."" Reports of extortion have become increasingly common as drug cartels expand their reach in Mexico. But public denouncements of such attempts are rare. Rivera called on parishioners to report extortion to authorities, and he urged them not to pay. His description Sunday of the extortion attempts and a statement denouncing drug violence give a glimpse into the problems faced by a Catholic Church often caught in the crossfire of warring cartels and government efforts to stop them. In the country's capital alone, more than 10 priests have been threatened with extortion, said the Reverend Hugo Valdemar Romero, a spokesman for the archdiocese. ""None of them have paid,"" he told CNN. ""Last year, two extortionists were arrested."" It's not uncommon for individual parishes to face extortion threats, he said. But the calls last month to the Seminary of the Archdiocese of Mexico marked the first time such a large church-run institution in the capital had been targeted, Romero said. Mexico's Catholic priests have long struggled with how to deal with spiraling drug violence and cartel culture. In addition to widespread extortion attempts by gangs, church officials have said clergy have received threatening notes and telephone calls after sermons against drug use and trafficking. In 1993, Cardinal Juan Posadas Ocampo was gunned down in the parking lot of an airport in Guadalajara, Mexico. Authorities said a drug gang had confused him with a rival trafficker, but some church leaders claimed he was targeted for denouncing drug trafficking. In 2009, Hector Gonzalez, the archbishop of the northern state of Durango, raised fears of attacks on the clergy after he said that Mexico's most wanted man, Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, lived in a Durango town and that ""everybody knows it except the authorities."" Days later, investigators found the bodies of two slain military lieutenants in mountains nearby, accompanied by a note: ""Neither the government nor priests can handle El Chapo."" Gonzalez quickly backed away from his comments, telling reporters who asked him about them, ""I am deaf and dumb."" There's also a flip side. Some critics say churches have received large donations from traffickers. A plaque inside a chapel in Mexico's Hidalgo state once boasted a donation from Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, a leader of the Zetas cartel until his death last year in a shootout with Mexican forces. This year, even as government officials have suggested that drug-related violence could be on the decline, church leaders have warned that priests and the congregations they serve remain at risk. Last week two priests were killed in Mexico's Veracruz state. Authorities arrested four suspects after the priests were found slain inside their parish. A group of Mexico's Catholic bishops have said they plan to discuss the violence with Pope Francis during a visit to the Vatican next year. READ MORE: In Juarez drug war, priest is on front lines .

"New York (CNN) -- Nearly 13 years after terrorists hijacked four airliners, crashed them and killed almost 3,000 people, a museum dedicated to the day that changed America will open in New York. The National September 11 Memorial Museum will open to the general public on May 21, the museum and memorial group announced Monday. The museum, located at the site of the original World Trade Center, will feature a core memorial exhibition that pays tribute to the 2,983 people killed in the September 11, 2001 attacks and in the February 26, 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. A second historical exhibition, told through personal artifacts, photographs, audio and video footage and first-person testimonials, will explore what led up to the terror strikes, examine the aftermath and illustrate how 9/11 continues to shape our world, according to a statement from the museum. ""When the museum opens to the public on May 21, millions will come to further understand the experiences, courageous actions, and terrible losses that we saw on 9/11 and in the aftermath. The museum will forever remind us of the capacity we have to come together when the times require,"" 9/11 Memorial President Joe Daniels said. The official opening will be preceded by a five day, 24-hour dedication period during which members of the 9/11 community will have exclusive access to the museum and memorial. During that time, family members of those lost on 9/11, rescue and recovery workers, active duty first responders from agencies that lost members in the attacks and survivors of the attacks -- as well as lower Manhattan residents and business owners -- will be able to visit the memorial and museum when it is best for them, the release said. ""We are honored that the first people to experience this museum will be the men and women who came to our aid and protected us on 9/11, the families of the innocent victims killed that day, and the survivors who lived to tell the tale of an unimaginable horror so that we may learn from the past. The museum is built upon their incredible stories,"" 9/11 Memorial chair and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said. Family members of those killed on that day will not have to pay admission to the museum, nor will rescue and recovery workers who are registered with the Memorial. Tickets for the general public will be available beginning March 26 on the museum's website. The museum will also house a repository of the 8,000 sets of remains that have yet to be identified from the 9/11 attacks. The remains, which are in the custody of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, will be kept behind a wall in an area off-limits to the public, said 9/11 museum spokesman Michael Frazier. The museum's website says the wall, which visitors will be able to view, will be inscribed with the words of Roman poet Virgil: ""No day shall erase you from the memory of time."" Only medical examiners and victims' families will be given access to the repository, where DNA identifications of the unidentified remains will continue, according to representatives from the museum and the medical examiner's office. The decision to house the remains in the museum repository has been controversial. In 2011, 17 families of 9/11 victims filed a petition in court to force the museum to consult with victims' families before deciding what to do with the remains. They eventually asked for a congressional hearing. Both efforts were unsuccessful. On its website, the museum said the decision to move the remains to the repository at the museum was due to the overwhelming feedback received from families after the attacks. ""You will never be able to please everyone. When it comes to human remains, we have to treat them with as much dignity and respect (as) they deserve,"" said Lee Ielpi, president and co-founder of 911 Tribute Center. Ielpi lost his son, a 29-year-old firefighter, on 9/11. ""Now is the time to bring those remains back to where they have been murdered."" When hijacked American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 were intentionally crashed into the north and south towers of the World Trade Center on 9/11, 2,753 people were killed. On the same day, another 224 people died when hijacked planes crashed into the Pentagon and in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania. A February 26, 1993 terror attack -- also at the World Trade Center -- left six people dead. CNN's Adrienne Zulueta and Chris Kokenes contributed to this report.","The National 9/11 Museum will open to the public on May 21 .

"(CNN) -- Evangelical patriarch Rev. Pat Robertson has long been a leader in the conservative movement advocating for a better civil and moral society. But his recent support of marijuana legalization couldn't be more wrongheaded. ""I really believe we should treat marijuana the way we treat beverage alcohol,"" Robertson said last week in an interview with The New York Times. ""I've never used marijuana and I don't intend to, but it's just one of those things that I think: this war on drugs just hasn't succeeded."" ""It's completely out of control,"" Robertson added. ""Prisons are being overcrowded with juvenile offenders having to do with drugs. And the penalties, the maximums, some of them could get 10 years for possession of a joint of marijuana. It makes no sense at all."" Robertson's arguments are wrong on each and every fact. First, regulating marijuana like the way we regulate alcohol (or cigarettes) will only result in the increased use and abuse of marijuana, particularly among youths. As the late, great political scientist, James Q. Wilson, put it, ""The central problem with legalizing drugs is that it will increase drug consumption."" Arguing that adding a dangerous substance to the legal marketplace will reduce its usage is to renounce all common sense. Does Robertson truly believe that addicts and first-time users will be curtailed once the substance they seek becomes easier to obtain? To stay on alcohol for a moment: There are about 79,000 alcohol-related deaths each year. The Center for Disease Control calculated that excessive drinking cost the United States $223.5 billion annually and the government pays more than 60 percent of these health care costs. Is that really the model that Robertson would recommend for the betterment of society? The Household Survey of Substance Abuse tells us that alcohol, more than tobacco and illegal drugs, is the most used and abused drug among youth. Why is that? Because alcohol is legal; drugs are not. Alcohol is easily available; drugs are less so. Alcohol is culturally acceptable; drugs are, for the most part, stigmatized, in large part because they are illegal. Robertson has long respected the importance of the law and the culture. It is a grave error for him to abandon that now. As for his other claims, the 2011 World Drug Report paints a detailed picture of marijuana abusers. Among cannabis users in treatment in the United States, 80.5% are not married, 90% have obtained an education of 12 years or less; 25% are unemployed and 46% are not in the labor force (of which 55% are students). Of the cannabis users who entered treatment services from 2000 to 2008, nearly a quarter report psychiatric problems. In addition, new research suggests that driving under the influence of marijuana could double a person's risk of getting in a serious or fatal car crash. Why should we promote the legalization of a substance that can irretrievably harm our children's brains and makes our citizens less intelligent, less productive and less safe? Open and unrestricted drug use cannot coexist with a free, safe and productive society. Moreover, Robertson's claim that our prisons are overflowing with marijuana users are wildly exaggerated. The U.S. criminal justice system is the largest referral source for drug treatment programs. And, the large majority of inmates in state and federal prison for marijuana have been found guilty of much more than simple possession. The Office of National Drug Control Policy, for example, recently reported that of all the inmates in state prisons, 0.3% are arrested for offenses involving only marijuana possession. Contrary to Robertson's view, we have had successes in the fight against drugs. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, 700,000 fewer teenagers used illicit drugs in 2010 than a decade earlier, a 16% decline. From 2000 to 2010, current marijuana use by teens has dropped 9%, methamphetamine use by teens has plummeted 60%, LSD use has dropped 50%, and current cocaine use among high school seniors has dropped 38%. There have been other important victories, too. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, with the help of the Partnership for a Drug Free America, America's policymakers and opinion shapers got tough on drugs. Through movies, television, mass media, and, yes, sermons, America sent a message: Drug use is not culturally or morally acceptable and it will not be tolerated. The nation was committed to defeating the cocaine epidemic, and it did. We have much work left in our own fight against drugs. We need more drug education and prevention classes in schools, more rehabilitation and treatment centers, and more resources for law enforcement officials. But all this is for naught if our nation's leaders, including its religious leaders, undermine and abandon the cause. During a recent trip to Mexico, Vice President Joe Biden was right to reject the idea of legalization. ""There is no possibility the Obama-Biden administration will change its policy on legalization,"" he said. It's time for a new bipartisan coalition committed to defending our children and our future from the dangers of drug abuse and addiction. Surrendering, like Robertson suggests, is not an option. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William J. Bennett.","William Bennett: Pat Robertson's support of marijuana legalization is misguided .
Bennett: Legalizing marijuana will lead to more drug abuse .
He says that contrary to Robertson's view, we have had successes in the drug fight .
Bennett: Our leaders, including religious leaders, must not undermine the drug war ."
"Kasakakairu, Kenya (CNN) -- Men armed with guns and machetes attacked residents of a Kenyan village before dawn Tuesday, killing at least five people, witnesses told CNN. The attackers went house to house targeting residents in the village of Kasakakairu, the witnesses said. Six people have been admitted to a local hospital with serious injuries, and police are checking the area for more victims. Kasakakairu is approximately 34 kilometers (21 miles) from Mpeketoni, a southeastern Kenyan coastal town where a terrorist attack killed dozens of people earlier this month. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said last week that Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group active in Somalia, wasn't responsible for the Mpeketoni attack. Instead, he blamed local political networks for the attack that witnesses said turned a World Cup viewing party into a bloodbath. Armed men stormed the city center, shooting and hacking people to death before moving into a residential area, where they went from door to door, the witnesses said. Journalist Athman Omar reported from Kasakakairu, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.","Attackers went house to house targeting residents in the village, witnesses say .

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles Clippers co-owner Shelly Sterling is ""moving quickly"" to sell the embattled NBA franchise, with a source familiar with the situation saying she and her representatives would like to make a deal this week. The recent activity includes talks with several high-profile potential suitors for the team, and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver is ""very much involved"" in Shelly Sterling's dealings with potential buyers, according to the source. But as bidders make their pitches for his team, Donald Sterling -- Shelly's estranged husband and the team's other owner -- accused the NBA of violating his constitutional rights in trying to end his ownership of the franchise based on what he says was an illegally recorded conversation during a lovers' quarrel, according to a document provided by Donald Sterling's attorney. The document, Sterling's 26-page response to charges of violating the league's bylaws, adhered to the NBA's Tuesday deadline for the billionaire businessman's reply. The NBA has said the next step will be a special Board of Governors meeting on June 3, when the league's 30 ownership groups -- someone else will represent the Clippers -- will meet to hear evidence on Donald Sterling's behavior, then vote on terminating the Sterlings' ownership rights. Sterling has been prejudged and won't get a fair hearing, the document says, citing comments from 10 other teams. About one month ago, Silver banned Sterling from NBA facilities and functions and ordered him to pay a record fine after racist remarks by the Clippers' owner to former companion V. Stiviano surfaced online. A source close to the situation said roughly two weeks ago that Donald Sterling -- who repeatedly denied he's a racist in a CNN interview -- wouldn't pay the fine, would reject the ban and might sue the NBA. The document says Sterling faces a never-before-issued and unjust punishment. ""In reality, Mr. Sterling is being banned for life, fined $2.5 million, and stripped of his ownership rights for a purely private conversation with his lover that he did not know was being recorded and that he never intended to see the light of day,"" the document says. Other NBA figures have made bigoted or racially insensitive remarks and weren't punished as harshly, Sterling argues. His remarks were made in the heat of an argument, and while they were not justified, they were not meant to harm the NBA, the response says. And while Sterling's remarks were viewed as racist, he says in his response that he was ""instrumental in fostering the diverse body of players, coaches, general managers, employees and fans on which the NBA prides itself."" The document also says Sterling was active in the African-American community and that there was only one court case -- which he won -- of discrimination brought against him as owner of the Clippers in more than 30 years. Sterling asks that the NBA's charges be denied and that his ownership rights not be terminated. The NBA acknowledged receiving a response from Sterling and reaffirmed the June 3 meeting, saying it will start at 1 p.m. ET to ""hear and vote upon this matter."" Donald Sterling's attorney, Maxwell Blecher, had no comment. Stiviano has said Sterling knew she was recording him and that the two were never intimate. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said it appeared the Sterlings were taking a two-track strategy. By filing the document, Donald Sterling is protecting his legal options but, at the same time, he realizes selling the team is the most likely outcome. ""I don't think it's a winning argument, but it is a very impressive document,"" Toobin said. Possible bidders . CNN's source on the potential sale said it was a busy Memorial Day weekend for Shelly Sterling. The source indicated she met Sunday with a group led by former NBA star Grant Hill to discuss the sale of the Clippers. In addition, the source familiar with the situation said she met over the weekend at her Malibu, California, home with ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who made an aggressive offer for the franchise. Shelly Sterling is interested in fielding offers from billionaire businessman Patrick Soon-Shiong, Hill's group, entertainment mogul David Geffen and Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and entrepreneur Magic Johnson and his Guggenheim partners, who two years ago teamed up to buy baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers. Johnson has been at the center of the story from the outset because of controversial banter between 80-year-old Donald Sterling and Stiviano. After TMZ first reported those comments, Donald Sterling lashed out at Johnson in a CNN interview, questioning whether someone who contracted HIV should be considered a role model and asking rhetorically ""what has he done"" for the African-American community. Johnson called the whole situation sad in his own interview with CNN, in which he urged Sterling to sell the team. The former Los Angeles Laker said if that happens -- and if his Guggenheim partners are interested -- ""We'll make a run for it."" One person who apparently won't be the NBA franchise's next owner is media tycoon Oprah Winfrey. Despite much buzz in recent weeks, the source familiar with the situation says that Winfrey is ""out of the running."" The same source said Shelly Sterling will accept offers this week for the Clippers. Shelly Sterling's attorney, Pierce O'Donnell, said no formal offers have been made for the team, which has risen in recent years from a last-place laughingstock to a playoff team with two superstars in forward Blake Griffin and guard Chris Paul. ""Shelly and the NBA are working cooperatively on the transaction,"" O'Donnell said. The Sterlings have been publicly defiant since the story broke, challenging the NBA and its right to force the Clippers' sale. But late last week, the Sterlings agreed that Shelly would try to sell the NBA franchise voluntarily even as the league prepares a vote on terminating their franchise rights. The couple own the team through a trust. Shelly Sterling previously had said she wanted to own at least part of the franchise, but doesn't want to be a controlling partner. But if it sold -- likely for between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, according to the well-placed source -- the NBA doesn't want either Sterling to have any ownership stake. Still, they could take solace in the dizzying profit they'd make from such a deal; Donald Sterling reportedly bought the franchise in 1981 for about $12 million. His response, though, laments that a forced sale would mean the Sterlings would incur ""several hundred million dollars"" in taxes they could avoid if they were allowed to keep the franchise and leave the team to their heirs.

"(ArsTechnica) -- The Federal Communications Commission is releasing the details of its new net neutrality Order in stages. Although the FCC's new ban on ""unreasonable discrimination"" for wired ISPs allows certain kinds of traffic discrimination (not all bits need be equal), the agency made clear after Tuesday's meeting that ""paid prioritization"" deals with Internet companies are unlikely to be allowed. Critics had worried that the new Order would only affect outright website blocking, leaving paid prioritization untouched (or even implicitly sanctioned). ""Pay for Priority Unlikely to Satisfy 'No Unreasonable Discrimination' Rule,"" advises one subheading of the new net neutrality rules. Ed Whitacre's dream of directly charging Google and Yahoo to ""use his pipes"" -- a key event in starting the entire net neutrality debate -- appears to be dashed. ""A commercial arrangement between a broadband provider and a third party to directly or indirectly favor some traffic over other traffic in the connection to a subscriber of the broadband provider (i.e., 'pay for priority') would raise significant cause for concern,"" the Commission then elaborates. This is because ""pay for priority would represent a significant departure from historical and current practice."" Insofar as engaged . As we've reported, the FCC's new rules forbid Internet providers from blocking lawful content and they require transparency from ISPs. They also require that network management and packet discrimination to be ""reasonable,"" but that only applies to wireline broadband. Wireless operators gets a free pass on rationality; they're limited only to the transparency and blocking provisions. Here's the text of the Commission's ""no unreasonable discrimination"" rule: . A person engaged in the provision of fixed broadband Internet access service, insofar as such person is so engaged, shall not unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful network traffic over a consumer's broadband Internet access service. Reasonable network management shall not constitute unreasonable discrimination. What are ""reasonable network management"" practices? Here you go: . A network management practice is reasonable if it is appropriate and tailored to achieving a legitimate network management purpose, taking into account the particular network architecture and technology of the broadband Internet access service. Legitimate network management purposes include: ensuring network security and integrity, including by addressing traffic that is harmful to the network; addressing traffic that is unwanted by users (including by premise operators), such as by providing services or capabilities consistent with a user's choices regarding parental controls or security capabilities; and by reducing or mitigating the effects of congestion on the network. ""Specialized services"" like IPTV (think AT&T''s U-Verse) will also be allowed over the last-mile broadband connection, although the FCC insists it will watch their deployment for anti-competitive behavior. But the Order rather strongly suggests that priority deals are ""unlikely"" to fit into this ""reasonable"" framework. Why not? First, ""since the beginning of the Internet,"" the agency explains, ""Internet access providers have typically not charged particular content or application providers fees to reach the providers' consumer retail service subscribers or struck pay-for-priority deals, and the record does not contain evidence that US broadband providers currently engage in such arrangements."" Second, priority deals would represent a ""departure from longstanding norms"" and ""could cause great harm to innovation and investment in and on the Internet."" They would raise barriers on entry for edge providers and could also boost ""transaction costs arising from the need to reach agreements with one or more broadband providers to access a critical mass of potential users."" Third, pay for priority could hurt users at the low end of the economic ladder -- bloggers, students, libraries, schools, advocacy groups. ""Even open Internet skeptics acknowledge that pay for priority may disadvantage non-commercial uses of the network, which are typically less able to pay for priority, and for which the Internet is a uniquely important platform."" Finally, ISPs that push pay for priority service ""would have an incentive to limit the quality of service provided to non-prioritized traffic."" As some game developers worry, ISPs might effectively charge for non-inferior service, investing ""less in open access and more in services that they can provide at a premium."" ""In light of each of these concerns, as a general matter, it is unlikely that pay for priority would satisfy the 'no unreasonable discrimination' standard,"" this section of the FCC's Order concludes. ""The practice of a broadband Internet access service provider prioritizing its own content, applications, or services, or those of its affiliates, would raise the same significant concerns and would be subject to the same standards and considerations in evaluating reasonableness as third-party pay-for-priority arrangements."" History . All of these assertions will soon be contested. AT&T has all but told the FCC that it could live with net neutrality rules... provided those rules give a green light to priority access arrangements. As AT&T warned the FCC a year ago, a ""strict"" nondiscrimination provision ""would completely ban voluntary commercial agreements for the paid provision of certain value-added broadband services, which would needlessly deprive market participants, including content providers, from willingly obtaining services that could improve consumers' Internet experiences."" On top of that, AT&T has its own take on the history of this matter. The ISP insists that paid priority access was ""fully"" and even ""expressly"" contemplated by the Internet Engineering Task Force decades ago as it mapped out the 'Net's key protocol, TCP/IP. But the Center for Democracy and Technology pushes back that AT&T is misreading early IETF documents, which were purposed to ""describing the technical architecture needed to deploy differential services not the payment schemes that may be associated with it."" Hello, Level 3 . Then there's the sticky question of whether the dispute between Level 3 Communications and Comcast falls into this zone of scrutiny. The Internet backbone and Content Delivery Network operator insists that Comcast crossed the line by charging it to move Netflix movie data to Comcast network subscribers. Comcast pushes back that this is just a private peering/transit dispute, in which Level 3's sudden jump in traffic required a economic response. When asked if the FCC would scrutinize the Level 3 dispute, Chairman Julius Genachowski responded that the agency was ""looking into it."" It seems likely that if controversies like this keep coming up, complaints invoking the FCC's new Order will be filed, requiring the Commission to look into the matter quite a bit over the coming months. Or maybe not. Comcast seems quite sanguine about Tuesday's decision.

The ISPs also insist that they've got the First Amendment right to cut priority access deals with content providers. ""The First Amendment protects the right not just to decide what to say, but how to say it,"" former National Cable and Telecommunications Association CEO Kyle McSlarrow declared last year. ""Does the First Amendment really allow the government to prohibit a content or applications provider from paying to acquire the means to distribute its content in the form or manner it wishes?"" How will all this play itself out? It depends on how the FCC enforces this advisory, and who sues the government in response.

"(CNN) -- It's all over now. Germany won the World Cup, which can't have surprised anyone who watched it demolish Brazil en route to the championship. But according to CNN's calculations, Brazil should have taken home the trophy. While Lionel Messi was battling Thomas Muller to be the tournament's top goal scorer, while Tim Howard and Guillermo Ochoa were batting away shots on goal, while Roy Hodgson and Fabio Capello were stalking the sidelines, CNN was looking at the bigger picture. We started with the FIFA world ranking for each team going into the World Cup, starting with Spain ranked number one, all the way down to Australia at 62. Then we looked at how much each country was paying its manager. Russia topped that table, paying Capello nearly $11.5 million a year, according to Nick Harris of Sporting Intelligence. England came a distant second, with Italy, Brazil and Switzerland rounding out the top five. Soccer-mad Mexico came dead last, paying manager Miguel Herrera about $214,000. Next we added in each country's population size, since bigger countries have larger pools to draw potential soccer stars from. The United States was the biggest country to qualify, followed by Brazil, Nigeria, Russia and Japan. Bosnia-Herzegovina and Uruguay were the smallest, both with populations under 4 million. Then we averaged the three measures -- ranking, manager salary and population size -- to come up with our own prediction for how each team would fare in the World Cup. Our predicted winner: Brazil. It was the second-largest country in the tournament, ranked third in the world by FIFA, and with manager Luiz Felipe Scolari's $3.8 million salary putting him fourth. It fared well enough in the group stages, but once things got serious, the hosts completely fell apart, conceding 10 goals in their last two matches and scoring only 1. That left it in 4th place, three below where we predicted it should end up. Germany, on the other hand, overperformed, but not by much. We picked it to come second, and it came first, for a rating of +1. Our statistics also tell us who the biggest over- and under-achievers of the tournament were. Some are obvious. The numbers suggest Costa Rica should have come 27th overall, but it trounced the big boys in the Group of Death and came out 8th, by FIFA's official statistics. Second-place Argentina also did far better than our predictions. Yes, it was ranked fifth in the world going into the tournament, but it didn't shell out big money for a manager -- Alejandro Sabella was the 22nd-best paid coach -- and Argentina falls in the middle of the population table. Of course, having Messi be one member of that population makes a difference, even if the Hand of God didn't touch him in the final. Spain, on the other hand, was a giant dud. Ranked third in the CNN table, it actually came 23rd. Only one nation came out worse: England. Ranked 10th in the world, with the second-best paid manager and and the 11th-largest population, we think it should have come fifth. It came 26th. Italy and Russia also suffered in our rankings, partly for paying their managers so handsomely. We say Italy should have come third, not 22nd, and Russia should have tied at sixth place with the United States. Russia actually came 24th, while Team USA came 15th. The numbers also show one remarkable coincidence. On paper, Belgium and Greece are almost identical. Belgium was ranked 11th by FIFA. Greece was ranked 12th. Both have populations of about 11 million people, and the two nations paid their managers exactly the same salary. Both teams did better than we predicted. We picked Greece to come 18th, but it managed 13th. Belgium did even better, coming sixth, nine places higher than our calculations suggested.

"(CNN) -- Canada's Supreme Court has struck down the country's laws about prostitution. While selling sex for money isn't illegal in Canada, until Friday's 9-0 ruling, three specific laws had made it difficult for prostitutes to more safely and securely engage in sex work. One of the laws prohibited anyone from operating a brothel. Another forbade people from earning a living working for a prostitute, such as being a driver, bookkeeper or bodyguard. Another law reportedly made it illegal to communicate in public about acts of prostitution. On Friday, Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin said that the court's decision would be ""suspended for one year"" until Parliament amends the laws. McLachlin said the time should be allotted because ""the regulation of prostitution is a complex and delicate matter."" According to the Toronto Star, if 12 months from now the federal government has not redrafted legislation, then prostitutes will be allowed to legally work, hire drivers, bodyguards and accountants, and screen their clients. The law's purpose ""is to target pimps and the parasitic, exploitative conduct in which they engage,"" the court said Friday. ""The law, however, punishes everyone who lives on the avails of prostitution without distinguishing between those who exploit prostitutes and those who could increase the safety and security of prostitutes, for example, legitimate drivers, managers, or bodyguards. .. The living on the avails provision is consequently overbroad."" On another matter, the law on prohibiting soliciting was designed ""not to eliminate street prostitution for its own sake, but to take prostitution off the streets and out of public view in order to prevent the nuisances that street prostitution can cause,"" the high court found. CNN affiliate CBC News, citing a criminologist, said Parliament could criminalize the sale or purchase of sex and choose to regulate where prostitution can occur. Parliament also could do nothing, in which case the provinces and municipalities would likely develop their own provisions, CBC News said.","Canada's Supreme Court justices voted unanimously .

"(CNN) -- Malik Bendjelloul, the Oscar-winning director of ""Searching for Sugar Man,"" committed suicide, his brother said. ""My brother had been struggling with depression for a short period of time, and depression is something you can die from,"" Johar Bendjelloul said in a statement released to CNN by the radio show where he works. ""This is such an enormous loss that I have no words for it. We ask that everyone kindly respect our family's privacy during this devastating time."" The Swedish director died Tuesday in Stockholm, police said. He was 36. Bendjelloul won the 2013 best documentary Academy Award for his debut feature about an obscure American crooner who gained fame abroad but remained almost unknown at home. ""Searching for Sugar Man"" is the story of Sixto Rodriguez, a singer from Detroit who became a legend in South Africa. With lyrics such as ""The system's gonna fall soon, to an angry young tune,"" Rodriguez unwittingly became the voice of the anti-apartheid struggle in the 1970s, even as his records flopped in his own country. The film gets its title from ""Sugar Man,"" a 1970 Rodriguez song about a drug peddler. ""It was this lost masterpiece, like a Cinderella story, a fairy tale,"" Bendjelloul said of Rodriguez's life. ""I never heard anything like that. A story that was so rich and true."" Bendjelloul had likened the Oscar to winning his native country's Nobel Prize.

"New York (CNN) -- One of the people arrested as part of a police investigation into drugs found in actor Philip Seymour Hoffman's apartment was given a no-jail-time plea deal on Tuesday, according to his attorney. Daniel Hochheiser, attorney for Max Rosenblum, said his client received two years on probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of criminal possession of a controlled substance. Conditions of the probation include that Rosenblum continue to attend an outpatient program. ""It's a blessing,"" Hochheiser said. ""He's gotten a second chance to remain at liberty and now he can focus on his rehabilitation, education and his bright future."" Hoffman, an Academy Award-winning actor, was found dead February 2 of an apparent drug overdose. Investigators found close to 50 packets of what they believe to be heroin in the actor's apartment. Police set out to track Hoffman's heroin source. Rosenblum, 22, was among four people arrested in a drug raid on February 4. Police recovered 350 small plastic bags of what is believed to be heroin, law enforcement officials said. The bags were branded ""black list"" and ""red bull,"" not the same brands found in Hoffman's apartment, the officials said. ""He's never met, spoken to, seen, had anything to do with Philip Seymour Hoffman,"" Hochheiser said last month of his client. ""My client is in no way connected to Mr. Hoffman's overdose and there has been no evidence presented that I know of that connects my client to Mr. Hoffman in any way, except that he lived in a building which apparently Mr. Hoffman frequented a different apartment to do whatever he did.""","Max Rosenblum gets probation after pleading guilty to a drug charge .

"(CNN) -- No cyanide remained in the exhumed body of Illinois lottery winner Urooj Khan, preventing investigators from determining how the toxin entered his body, the Cook County medical examiner said Friday. Still, Dr. Stephen Cina maintained his determination from January: that blood samples taken after Khan's death in July show the 46-year-old died of cyanide poisoning and that the manner of death was homicide. Officials in January exhumed the body of Khan -- who died the day after the Illinois lottery issued him a check for about $425,000 for winning a scratch-off game -- hoping to determine how cyanide entered his system. ""Cyanide has a short half-life, and it may be lost over the postmortem interval unless the tissues are adequately preserved,"" Cina said Friday. ""In this case, due to advanced putrefaction of the tissue, no cyanide was detected"" after the exhumation. Investigators initially ruled Khan's manner of death natural. But after being prompted by a relative, technicians retested Khan's blood, leading to Cina's cause of death determination in January, more than a week before the body was exhumed. Cina also said Friday that coronary artery disease was a contributing cause to Khan's death, because the autopsy showed one of his major coronary arteries was 75% blocked. ""Since cyanide affects oxygen utilization in the tissues, it follows logically that a natural disease process that already limits blood flow to the heart could render an individual particularly susceptible to death due to this toxin,"" he said. Before the exhumation, Cina said that cyanide can evaporate from a body after death and that it was possible it would not still be present. The autopsy results have been turned over to Chicago police, who have been investigating the case as a murder. CNN's Shawn Nottingham contributed to this report.","Coroner: No cyanide found in post-exhumation autopsy, likely because death was too long ago .

"(CNN) -- As any seasoned observer of the political dance could have predicted, Mitt Romney's debate performance on Wednesday completed his full-circle journey of ideology. When Romney ran for governor of Massachusetts in 2002 (and for senator in 1994) he was a Republican moderate in the mold of his father. When he began his marathon run(s) for president way back in the middle of the last decade he went through a battlefield conversion. He morphed into a ""severely"" conservative primary candidate, leaning so far to the right he might have suffered from mild attacks of vertigo. Wednesday night a national audience witnessed a kind of homecoming as Romney embraced the successes of his adopted blue state. Romney's ardor for the good times he had as governor came after he spent the last two cycles of Republican primaries ridiculing Massachusetts' liberal tendencies, describing his experience among the lefties as being ""a vegetarian at a cattle ranch."" The Romney we saw on Wednesday was subtly different. He loved education, hated tax deductions, enjoyed working with Democrats and claimed the Romneycare precursor of Obamacare as his own. Romney starts to fill in blanks on his tax plan . He told the debate's moderator, Jim Lehrer: ""Jim, I had the great experience -- it didn't seem like it at the time -- of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87% Democrat. And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be No. 1 in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times."" In short, he painted a portrait of bipartisan bliss. No surprises there. The passage of presidential candidates from the extreme margins of their parties' base to the center is as predictable as the annual migration of buzzards from Miami to Hinckley, Ohio. Still, as a public service, a quick examination of Romney's new embrace of Massachusetts is in order. But before we get into the details, tuck away this truism on the ways of Massachusetts politics. Governors come and go; the overriding constant is an overwhelming Democratic majority in the state legislature. It has the final, veto-proof say on budgets, laws and policy. To credit any Bay State governor for a balanced budget or blame him for a high unemployment rate is akin to holding him responsible for the weather. Let's take it by categories. Education . In the debate, Romney stressed the importance of education, noting more than once that Massachusetts leads the nation in education outcomes. This is largely true, depending on which metric you use (and if you ignore the fact that there are poorer communities in the state that resemble the education outcomes of Mississippi and Texas). But what was Romney's role in all this? He inherited an education system that had been trending to the top of national rankings over the previous decade. In 2003, the year he took office, Massachusetts high school seniors were first in SAT scores and among the top three in percentage of students taking the test. The state continued to rank at the top during and after Romney's term. Massachusetts public schools receive state aid under a law called Chapter 70. The budget ritual begins with the governor setting a number for Chapter 70 distributions. That is usually changed when the legislature's budget committees take over. In his 2004 fiscal year proposal (the state's budget calendar runs from July 1 to June 30) Romney actually budgeted more Chapter 70 money than the legislature settled on. But there is an asterisk that goes with that. Opinion: Romney's demographic bind . Romney's plan would have robbed Peter to pay Paul, cutting other state aid to municipalities to fund his largess to education. The legislature smoothed the differences by returning some of the education money to the other account. In subsequent budget years the legislature raised Romney's proposed education funding by amounts ranging from $3 million to $50 million on total Chapter 70 funding of $3 billion annually, according to state records. Romney gets average marks when it comes to other education issues. His administration launched no major initiatives or reforms. Higher education funding and the state university system's infrastructure languished in his four years as governor -- a time, to be fair, when there was little additional money in the budget. Budget/Taxes . Romney brags that he didn't raise taxes in Massachusetts even though the state budget faced a $3 billion budget gap when he took office. It is true; he didn't. Instead he proposed, and the legislature accepted, dozens of increases on state fees. Marriage licenses went from $4 to $50. The cost of registering deeds and mortgages quadrupled ($25 to $100) and driving permits doubled to $30. Romney also proposed raising the firearms registration fee from $25 to $75. Despite howls from gun owners, the legislature joined in and raised the fee to $100 while extending the life of the license from four to six years. Romney's proposal included a new $10 fee to acquire a state certificate of blindness and $15 for a photo identification card. The legislature removed that provision. The total revenue raised by Romney and the legislature remains a matter of debate. Romney's campaign says fees rose a total of $240 million in the 2004 fiscal budget; others, including the Cato Institute, put the figure around $500 million. Another matter in the Romney revenue debate is the $350 million to $375 million he raised annually for three years by closing business tax loopholes. Romney has contended his move was not a tax increase. Massachusetts business organizations had a different opinion at the time. So did his Republican rivals during the brutal primary season. Opinion: Romney shakes up the race . Romney did benefit from a tax increase - a $1.1 billion tax hike passed by Democrats a year before he took office -- that helped cut the looming deficit. On the other side of the coin, Romney's claim of 19 tax cuts during his term is a bit too self-generous by definition and scope since a number of ""cuts"" originated in the legislature. Among them, a one-year delay in a capital gains tax increase enacted before he took office, prescription drug and property tax relief for seniors, tax breaks for commuters and veterans, a business deduction for installing automatic sprinkler systems, extensions of temporary tax breaks and two ritual sales tax holidays for one weekend in August. Working with the opposition . In criticizing Obama's testy relationship with Republicans in Congress, Romney proudly noted his good times with Massachusetts Democratic legislators. ""I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together,"" Romney scolded the president. ""What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote."" Romney's situation was something of a mirror image. He was unable to push anything through that the Democratic leadership didn't like, including 800 vetoes Romney issued as governor. The legislature overrode all but a few vetoes issued when it was out of session. On Wednesday night Romney used his weekly meetings with the House speaker and Senate president as evidence of his ability to work with the other side. The meetings did happen, but not as a result of Romney's initiative. These weekly sessions have been a regular part of the Statehouse schedule going back at least to the administration of Michael Dukakis. They took place during the 12 years Republicans held the governorship before Romney took office and they continue today. Democratic lawmakers of the time recall Romney as a CEO type who dealt only with the legislative leadership. Even Tom Finneran, the former House speaker who went on to host a conservative talk radio show in Boston, recalls Romney as being imperious when he called legislative leaders in to discuss the budget crisis. ""Initially his sense was, `I have been elected governor, I am the CEO here, and you guys are the board of directors and you monitor the implementation of what I say,'"" Finneran told The Associated Press in August. ""That ruffled the feathers of legislators who see themselves as an equal branch (of government)."" Opinion: The audacity of Romney's Etch a Sketch . Ironically, the single biggest bipartisan achievement during his administration was the state's health care reform law that requires all residents to buy health insurance -- i.e. the individual mandate of Obamacare. Legislators of that time give Romney high marks for working with them to get the law refined and passed. The same lawmakers note, with pride, that the Romney-Democratic love fest resulted in legislation that was a model for Obamacare. Welcome home, Mitt. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fred Bayles.","Mitt Romney painted a portrait of bipartisan bliss in his time as Massachusetts governor .

"(CNN) -- Two therapists who try to turn gay people straight, along with a student who says he was successfully converted to heterosexuality, are suing nearly two dozen California state officials, including Gov. Jerry Brown, saying a new state law infringes on their civil rights. The plaintiffs' legal team will file a motion sometime this month seeking an injunction before the law goes into effect, attorney Matt McReynolds told CNN on Thursday. The legislation known as Senate Bill 1172 -- which the state Senate passed in May, Brown signed into law this weekend, and will take effect January 1 -- prohibits attempts to change the sexual orientation of patients under age 18. ""We have not seen the state of California go this far before in trying to restrict speech,"" McReynolds said. The non-profit Pacific Justice Institute, whom McReynolds works for, filed the lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court on behalf of family therapist Donald Welch, psychiatrist Dr. Anthony Duk, and Aaron Bitzer, who is studying to become a therapist, and who court papers say ""seeks to share his personal experiences with future patients as a mental health professional."" California governor OKs ban on gay conversion therapy . The institute describes itself as a ""legal defense organization specializing in the defense of religious freedom, parental rights, and other civil liberties."" The plaintiffs say they're seeking a judgment finding the new law unconstitutional, injunctions against the law's enforcement, and attorney's fees, according to the legal complaint. Among other concerns, the complaint details arguments that SB 1172 violates Californians' rights to privacy, freedom of religion, and due process. ""Certainly, the religious freedom aspect is very strong in this case,"" McReynolds said. The American Psychiatric Association -- which is the world's largest of its kind, with more than 36,000 members -- has determined that sexual orientation change efforts, as the complaint calls the controversial therapy, pose a great risk, including increasing the likelihood or severity of depression, anxiety and self-destructive behavior for those undergoing therapy. Therapists' alignment with societal prejudices against homosexuality may reinforce self-hatred already felt by patients, the association says. ""This bill bans non-scientific 'therapies' that have driven young people to depression and suicide,"" Brown recently tweeted. ""These practices have no basis in science or medicine."" Earlier this year, psychiatrist Robert L. Spitzer apologized for his 2003 study of reparative therapy in which he suggested that the practice could help gays and lesbians become straight. He said the study was deeply flawed. ""I believe I owe the gay community an apology for my study making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy,"" Spitzer said in a letter to the editor of the Archives of Sexual Behavior. ""I also apologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I had proven that reparative therapy works with some 'highly motivated' individuals."" But according to the complaint, when Bitzer underwent ""therapy described in the statute as"" sexual orientation change efforts and reparative therapy, he ""found it quite helpful in achieving his goals."" Bitzer had ""experienced same-sex attractions. ... However, he never believed the simplistic message of the Gay Community, which states that 'we are born this way and should just live accordingly,'"" the complaint says. The case revolves around a legal issue, not a moral one, according to McReynolds. ""It's not a debate in court about whether reparative therapy is a good thing, or how well it works, so much as it is a debate of the role of the government dictating to professionals, patients, and religious institutions what their options are going to be in that area,"" he said. David Pickup, a spokesman for the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality, told CNN on Monday his group would file its own lawsuit against the new statute. ""We do competent therapy, therapy that truly works,"" said Pickup, who said he underwent such therapy and now administers it to others. A summons filed on Wednesday requires that each of the defendants respond to the Pacific Justice Institute with an answer to the complaint within 21 days after receiving the paperwork. Beyond Brown, the defendants include state officials Anna Caballero and Denise Brown, as well as the members of the California Board of Behavioral Sciences and the Medical Board of California. The first scheduled court hearing in the case is a pretrial scheduling conference on January 22, according to court papers. However, McReynolds said he expects the court will respond to a motion for a preliminary injunction by setting a hearing date later this year, prior to the January 1 implementation of the new law.

"(CNN) -- He was the first golfing superstar, and his legacy lives on more than 80 years after he made sporting history. The U.S. PGA Championship has returned to the home club of Bobby Jones, who bestrode the gentleman's game like a colossus as an amateur in the 1920s before his shock retirement. The only man to win golf's four major tournaments in one year, Jones founded one of his own events that is now among that pantheon -- the Masters. Not only did he buy the plot of land on which he helped build the fabled Augusta National club, the American legend was also instrumental in the move towards mass-produced metal-shafted clubs that made golf more accessible to the general public. Kaymer claims 2010 PGA Championship after last-day drama . But while Jones is inextricably linked to Augusta and the Masters long after his death in 1971, his real home is the Atlanta Athletic Club. Originally located downtown in Georgia's capital, its course was actually the nearby East Lake Golf Club, not the present-day development in Johns Creek north of the city. ""This is his home course. You can't dispute the fact the Atlanta Athletic Club is his home club, and you can't dispute the fact that this is his home course,"" East Lake general manager Rick Burton told the PGA's official website. Jones' family moved to a summer house near there when he was six -- he was a sickly child who could not eat solid food, according to his descendents' business website. But he thrived at Eastlake, winning the club's junior title at the age of nine and even beating his father in a senior final when 13. The following year he became the youngest player to appear at the U.S. Amateur, which then -- like its British counterpart -- was one of golf's four major tournaments. However, despite his prodigious talent, it took Jones time to make his mark as he battled his own demons. He had the ""face of an angel and the temper of a timber wolf"" according to renowned sportswriter Grantland Rice. That was best illustrated at the 1921 British Open when he shocked onlookers at St. Andrews, the home of golf, by picking up his ball in disgust during a difficult third round and effectively disqualifying himself. Jones called it his ""most inglorious failure"" but he subsequently became synonymous with fair play and grace, calling a two-shot penalty on himself at the 1925 U.S. Open before missing out on the title by one stroke. ""You may as well praise a man for not robbing a bank,"" he reportedly said after being praised for his gesture. Jones' breakthrough year was 1923, when he won the U.S. Open for the first of a record four times -- triumphing in an 18-hole playoff after almost throwing away his chances with a disastrous finish to his final round. Between 1923 and his final year of competitive play, 1930, Jones won 13 of 21 major tournaments he entered. A lawyer by trade, he rarely played anything but national championships and spent only three months of each year competing, much of that time in transit. In 1930 he finally won the British Amateur title, the first leg of his unprecedented ""Grand Slam,"" and received a hero's welcome when he returned to New York. It was his second such ticker-tape parade, having also been honored in 1926 when he won the British and U.S. Opens in the same year. ""The accomplishment of the Grand Slam assumes more importance as an example of the value of perseverance in the abstract than as a monument to skill in the playing of a game,"" Jones wrote in his book ""Golf Is My Game."" ""I am certain that in those moments when the success of the project was most in doubt, the decisive factor in each case had been my ability, summoned from somewhere, to keep control of myself and to keep trying as hard as I could, even when there was no clear indication of the direction in which hope of victory might lie."" Jones, who could have embarked on a lucrative professional career, then shocked the sporting world by deciding to quit competitive golf, calling it ""a cage."" ""First you are expected to get into it and then you are expected to stay there. But of course, nobody can stay there,"" he said. Jones instead began his dream of building his own course at Augusta, and made money writing golf books and making short instructional films for Hollywood studio Warner Brothers. He also helped design revolutionary standardized, numbered clubs for Spalding that bore his name for more than 40 years, which replaced the hickory Scottish-style shafts he had used so well. His family company has sold his signature equipment and clothing since 2003. Jones served in the U.S. Army as a lieutenant colonel during World War II, but ailing health ended his playing participation at the Masters after 1948. His best finish at his own tournament was 13th in its inaugural year 1934, as he concentrated on his hosting duties. Additionally, he became president of the Atlanta Athletic Club as his father did half a century before him, and played a significant role in its move to Johns Creek in the 1960s. In November 1971, just a month before his death, Jones wrote a letter to the U.S. Golf Association that led to his club's Highlands course hosting its first major tournament, the 1976 U.S. Open. ""I should be most happy if my old club should become the host for my favorite golf tournament ... I can assure you that the championship will be royally entertained,"" Jones wrote. ""I wish I could look forward to seeing you in Augusta again this fall, but I suppose my days there have about ended."" Confined to a wheelchair by long-term spinal problems, Jones passed away at the age of 69 a week before Christmas. ""That was an impactful letter,"" AAC general manager Chris Borders told the PGA website. ""I'm sure when the president of the USGA received it in 1971 he felt, 'Well I really don't have any other choice, we have to take it to the Atlanta Athletic Club."" The club hosted the PGA Championship for the first time in 1981, when Larry Nelson won, and most recently in 2001 as fellow American David Toms triumphed. Visitors to this week's tournament will be greeted by a statue of Jones outside the clubhouse. ""We specifically did not pick one of him in his swing because we felt it was more important that he gave the appearance of welcoming people into the club, and one of hospitality. He was such a great gentleman,"" Borders said. ""He guided the club not just with golf but with our athletic endeavors, all our dining and social activities. The club was a very important place for him to be.""","Atlanta Athletic Club will host U.S. PGA Championship for the third time this week .

"(CNN) -- Fierce clashes followed suicide bombings and checkpoint attacks Sunday in Yemen, leaving dozens dead as the government fought back in a province largely controlled by terrorist groups, officials said. At least 60 soldiers were killed in action, a Yemeni government official said, and the number of casualties was expected to climb. Dozens of militants were killed, captured and injured, said the official, who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Earlier Sunday, officials in the southern province of Abyan said 15 militants were killed in the clashes. At least five troops were killed when suicide bombers earlier attacked two military posts in Abyan, where the government has been desperately trying to weaken terrorist groups after they took over large parts of the province last year. The bombers used explosives-laden vehicles to hit posts on the outskirts of Zinjibar and in the town of Dofas, the officials said. In a separate attack, militants killed four soldiers and wounded three others at a checkpoint in the town of al-Kod. Residents said heavy clashes with militants erupted Saturday night in all three locations. Air raids were not enough to stop the militants from expanding and taking over two checkpoints in Dofas in addition to the three sites they attacked. ""The attacks were fierce against government forces. They used large amounts of heavy artillery, and this is not normal,"" said a senior security official in the province. The official is not authorized to talk to media and asked not to be named. ""Casualties are high from both sides, and this month will be decisive in our fighting against these militant groups,"" the official said. Officials blame the attacks on Ansar al-Sharia, a group with links to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the global terrorist network's branch in Yemen. The attacks come less than a week after President Abdurabu Mansur Hadi took office and days after he changed top civilian, law enforcement and military officials in southern Yemen. The al Qaeda-linked attacks seem to be aimed at sending a message to the new administration, the Yemeni government official said. Ansar al-Sharia fighters are also close to taking over the strategically important military base 115 on the outskirts of Zinjibar, the security officials said. Clashes have been intense near the base since Saturday morning, with little resistance from the government or air support. The site has been vital in the government attempts to uproot the militant group from the province since clashes started in May. Witnesses told CNN that Ansar al-Sharia also cut off a main road linking the provinces of Abyan and Aden. ""Everyone who is traveling between the provinces would easily notice that al Qaeda is in control of the area,"" said Marwan Abdullah, a resident of Abyan who was heading toward Aden on Sunday. Three senior security officials in Abyan accuse Mahdi Makwalah, the military commander of the southern regions, of handing over heavy artillery to al Qaeda fighters Sunday. Last Thursday, Hadi issued a presidential decree ordering Makwalah to step down from his post, but the powerful military commander has so far refused to do so. Among the weapons that al Qaeda fighters were given are nine tanks and heavy artillery, the officials told CNN. ""The only reason why al Qaeda is expanding in Abyan is because they are receiving aid from corrupt officials within the Yemeni government. This is the sad truth about the war on terror in Yemen,"" a security official in Abyan told CNN. CNN's Jamie Crawford contributed to this report.","NEW: Yemeni official: At least 60 soldiers are killed in the fighting .

"(CNN) -- Never judge a book by its cover -- and never judge a major sports event before it has begun. Just ask Delhi, India, which was rocked by some dismal headlines on safety and infrastructure ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games before recovering to win praise from the head of the quadrennial event. Still, with just under two days to go before the opening ceremony, preparations for the Sochi Winter Olympics are looking far from complete. From hotels that don't appear to be finished, to ongoing security concerns, to reports of officials poisoning stray dogs -- none of this will be what Russian President Vladimir Putin would have hoped to see when he arrived in Sochi on Tuesday. So, what are the biggest concerns? Four issues have been grabbing headlines this week for reasons that have nothing to do with the upcoming sporting activities. Security . The most important duty of any host nation is surely to ensure the safety of athletes and visitors, but simmering tensions in the nearby North Caucasus region of the country -- where Islamic separatists have conducted a string of deadly attacks -- have meant that the threat of terrorism has loomed large over Sochi. Indeed, Doku Umarov, who has named himself emir of a self-proclaimed entity called the Caucasus Emirate, last year called on jihadists to do their ""utmost to derail these satanic dances on the bones of our ancestors."" Tens of thousands of police and troops have been dispatched to the area to create what Putin has described as a ""ring of steel"" protecting the games. But questions were raised about the ability to protect soft targets when Russian officials released photographs of three ""black widows"" -- young women whose husband purportedly were killed by Russian forces -- who allegedly were planning to bomb the Olympic torch relay. There was particular concern about a fourth suspect, Ruzanna Ibragimova, who officials said might be in the Sochi area. On Wednesday, Russian media announced that police in Dagestan had killed the alleged mastermind behind twin bomb attacks in the Russian city of Volgograd in December. The bombings killed 34 people and injured 100. Those attacks, along with a pair of January incidents in the restive North Caucasus republic of Dagestan -- a restaurant bombing that injured at least five people and a shootout that left three policemen and four militants dead -- underscored fears that terrorists might look to strike outside of Sochi during the Games, when all eyes will be on Russia. ""The Russians' task is complicated by remote, forested and often mountainous territory in the North Caucasus, as well as a devolved structure among jihadist groups, organized into autonomous military units known as jamaats,"" noted CNN's Tim Lister. ""Terrorism analysts believe that some among the growing Chechen diaspora in Europe may also be raising funds for the insurgents."" Also Wednesday, a law enforcement source told CNN that the United States has advised airlines with direct flights to Russia to be aware of the possibility that explosive materials could be concealed in toothpaste or cosmetic tubes. The source emphasized that there was no known threat to the United States, but the notice to U.S. and international carriers is based on new intelligence information ahead of the start of the Olympics. Airlines warned about possible toothpaste tube bombs ahead of Olympics . And on Tuesday, Matthew Olsen, director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, warned that the United States was tracking a number of ""specific threats of varying degrees of credibility."" ""[W]e're working very closely with the Russians and with other partners to monitor any threats we see and to disrupt those,"" Olsen added. The United States already has dispatched at least two warships off the coast of the Black Sea city in the event that an evacuation is necessary, while a number of athletes have reportedly asked relatives to skip attending the games. Americans apparently have noticed such concerns -- a CNN poll released Wednesday showed that 57% believed a terrorist attack on the Games is likely. Infrastructure . If the security of athletes and spectators is the biggest issue for the organizers, then ensuring that facilities for both competitors and guests are up to scratch is surely the next concern. After all, athletes have been training for years for this event. For some it will be their only shot at Olympic glory. Is having somewhere comfortable to sleep, perhaps with a fresh glass of water by the bedside, too much to ask as you prepare for the biggest two weeks of your life? In Sochi, according to numerous accounts on social media this week, the answer might just be yes. Bleacher Report has been highlighting some of the early reactions to the accommodations on offer, and draws particular attention to the size of the beds (Canada's men's hockey team may have been hoping to have a bit more space), the bareness of the rooms (reports of missing TVs, chairs and shower curtains) and, perhaps most troubling of all, the sign one reporter snapped warning that toilet paper should not be flushed down the toilet. To cap it all, The Chicago Tribune's Stacy St. Clair reportedly complained that she had been warned about the hazardous water in her hotel room, and a picture she tweeted, showing two glasses of yellowish liquid she said were from the hotel, went viral. Competition conditions . Setting aside the accommodation issues, will athletes be safe when they start competing? The withdrawal of U.S. snowboarding star Shaun White from one of the events could be a troubling sign. White didn't give a specific reason for his withdrawal, but even if a mere wrist injury is the only reason, Sochi organizers are said to have ""faced fierce criticism over the layout at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, with competitors claiming that it is too dangerous to host the event."" Of course, one thing that the organizers have no control over is the weather, and after complaints about the lack of quality snow in Vancouver for the 2010 Winter Olympics, some had worried whether Sochi's climate could provide enough of the white stuff. With such concerns in mind, Russia reportedly brought in state-of-the-art snowmaking equipment. But according to the Wall Street Journal, this won't be necessary. ""The weather for the upcoming week at all the Olympic venues will be just wonderful,"" the paper quoted the head of Russia's Hydrometeorological Center as saying this week. ""Enough snow has fallen, the situation is completely relaxed. Nature has given us everything we need."" Warning to U.S. athletes: No Olympic uniforms outside Sochi venues . Those stray dogs . Yet, while issues like infrastructure and security seem destined to be perennial concerns at major sporting events -- just look at the controversy surrounding Brazil's efforts to prepare for this year's World Cup -- sometimes a story will appear out of the blue and make international headlines for all the wrong reasons. On Wednesday, CNN correspondent Ivan Watson reported that Russian authorities have been rounding up and poisoning stray dogs in the city. ""They always poison the street dogs here,"" Watson quoted one Sochi resident as saying. ""But in December it got terrible...they began poisoning the animals terribly before the Olympics."" Olympic officials, though, have a different take. ""All stray dogs that are found on the Olympic Park are collected by a professional veterinary contractor for the well-being of the people on the Park and the animals themselves,"" the Sochi 2014 Organizing Committee said in a statement this week. ""All healthy animals are released following their health check."" Sochi's organizers will no doubt be relieved when the focus is on the competition and not the venue. At around 8 p.m. local time Friday, perhaps they'll get what they're hoping for. Winter Olympics by the numbers .","NEW: Among the terror concerns is explosives in toothpaste tubes on planes .

"(LifeWire) -- Older woman seduces younger man. Sound familiar? It's a scene from the 1967 coming-of-age classic ""The Graduate."" Actress Demi Moore is 15 years older than her husband, actor Ashton Kutcher. But high-profile Hollywood couples like Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins (12 years her junior) -- who met and began dating while filming an on-screen romance in the 1988 movie ""Bull Durham"" -- have proven that life can indeed imitate art when it comes to matters of the heart. Theirs, however, is a real-life love story of an older woman and younger man -- something that is not so uncommon nowadays. A 2003 study by AARP revealed that 34 percent of all women over 40 in the survey were dating younger men, and 35 percent preferred it to dating older men. ""Societal attitudes have definitely changed,"" says Susan Winter, 52, co-author of ""Older Women, Younger Men: New Options for Love and Romance"" -- and she would know. At age 40, she was dating a 19-year-old. ""We had to break it off. Quite frankly, his mother made it so impossible,"" Winter says of the six-year relationship, which inspired her book. ""But (that kind of discrimination) would not be allowable now."" Hollywood in particular has defied the ageism stereotype, with celebrities like Madonna and Demi Moore marrying significantly younger men (a 10- and 15-year age gap, respectively, with director Guy Ritchie and actor Ashton Kutcher), and the public has come to accept it.  See photos of some famous May-December couples » . Moreover, says Winter, women have experienced a significant financial and status shift over the past half-century. ""When women as a group are able to have their own economic and social standing and have a power base, they are now able to pick the man that they want rather than having to choose the man to support them and give them social status,"" Winter explains. ""Now we have choices."" But these relationships aren't always portrayed in a positive light. Terms like ""cougar"" (slang for an older woman seeking a younger man) depict the woman as a predator, rather than an empowered, independent and loving person. NBC aired a reality dating show this summer -- ""Age of Love"" -- that pitted women in their 20s against women in their 40s in a battle for the heart of tennis star Mark Philippoussis. Meanwhile, online dating sites like GoCougar.com urge older women who seek younger men to ""get what you want."" Such pairings can and do work. Mary Pender, 37, a high school special education teacher in Huntington Beach, California, connected with a truck driver seven years her junior who she met on an online dating site. Though she'd always dated older men before, she ""thought it was exciting to date someone younger""  -- and, as it turned out, he thought it'd be just as exciting a match. ""He thinks it's cool that I am comfortable in my sexuality,"" says Pender. ""He likes that I am secure in our relationship and I have my own things to do without him."" Indeed, the idea of dating an older woman is titillating for some younger guys. Jeremy Abelson, a self-styled dating impresario who organized the Natural Selection Speed Date event that paired wealthy bachelors with beautiful women this past February in New York City, can see the appeal. ""Any young guy who has seen (the movie) 'American Pie' can basically say he was right there with the Asian guy and the white guy as they were cheering ... for Stifler's mom,"" says Abelson, 27. ""I was basically standing there cheering with them. And I think that's a very common fantasy for young men."" The potential issues between such May-December couples are the same ones that challenge the longevity of any relationship: different long-term priorities and emotional temperament. ""He's not thinking about kids and marriage,"" says Pender of her boyfriend, ""and he bugs me when I forget to dye my gray roots."" If you can work through these issues, the adage holds true: Age ain't nothing but a number. ""When I finally found out how much younger he was, I was a little shocked,"" says Kimberly Schmitz, a 34-year-old communications and public relations director in Tucson, Arizona, of her now-fiancé, Bobby Kern, 25, owner of a feed store and pet food distribution company in the same city. ""(But) he is such an amazing man that I decided to let his actions speak more than his statistics. I was right. He is the most mature and sensitive man I have ever dated."" For Kern, the attraction is mutual. ""There was no fear in dating an older woman,"" he says. ""I prefer to date older women, and for some reason I always have, even in high school. It seems that they are easier to get along with -- there is, for the most part, no drama. Older women know what they want, they usually are in a career, are financially secure and not looking for a man to take care of them."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- The consumption of NFL football, America's most popular sport, is built on game-day traditions. This week fans will dress head-to-toe in team colors and try out new tailgate recipes in parking lots before filing into 16 NFL stadiums to cheer on their team -- which, thanks to the league's parity, will likely still be in the playoff hunt come December. But a game-day ritual of the digital age -- tracking scores, highlights and social-media chatter on a mobile device -- isn't possible inside many NFL venues because the crush of fans with smartphones can overload cellular networks. The improved home-viewing experience -- high-def TV, watching multiple games at once, real-time fantasy-football updates and interaction via social media -- has left some NFL stadiums scrambling to catch up. It's one of the reasons why, before rebounding last year, the NFL lost attendance between 2008 and 2011, forcing the league to alter television-blackout rules. In May 2012, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced an initiative to outfit all 31 NFL stadiums with Wi-Fi. But with the start of the 2013 regular season just days away, less than half of the NFL's venues are Wi-Fi enabled and no stadiums have launched new Wi-Fi systems this year. Part of the reason for the delay is some stadium operators are waiting for the next generation of increased Wi-Fi speed before installing networks, said Paul Kapustka, editor in chief for Mobile Sports Report. Another reason, Kapustka said, is that the cost of installing Wi-Fi will come out of the pockets of venue owners and operators who have traditionally not needed to invest in such costly projects. Instead, they receive public money to help build stadiums and television money for the right to broadcast games. ""Stadium owners and operators need to get their hands on the fact that they need to put in Wi-Fi like they need to put in plumbing,"" Kapustka said. Brian Lafemina, the NFL's vice president of club business development, said the league is still searching for a telecommunications partner that can help tackle challenges of stadium location, design and tens of thousands of fans all trying to access the network at the same time. ""Yes, we are working on it as hard as we can,"" he said. ""But the technology just isn't where it needs to be to deliver what we want to deliver."" The league is unveiling a variety of technological enhancements at stadiums in 2013, including cameras in locker rooms, massive video boards that will show replays of every play, a ""fantasy football lounge"" with sleek technological amenities, the ability to listen to audio of other games from inside the stadium, team specific fantasy games and free access to the league's NFL Red Zone cable channel for season ticket holders. Lafemina emphasized the league's role as a storyteller and said it is striving to use technology to provide fans in stadiums with unique content. ""The most important people in that stadium are the 70,000 paying customers,"" he said. Jonathan Kraft, president of the New England Patriots and co-chair of the NFL's digital media committee, told CNN Money in January that he hopes to have all stadiums equipped with Wi-Fi for the start of the 2015 season. The Patriots helped lead the way last year by offering fans free Wi-Fi throughout Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Massachusetts. The network was built by New Hampshire-based Enterasys Networks. ""We certainly encourage that any club would invest the way they have,"" said Lafemina. Eleven other stadiums currently have Wi-Fi capability: MetLife Stadium in northern New Jersey, the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, Sun Life Stadium in Miami, AT&T Stadium in suburban Dallas, University of Phoenix Stadium in suburban Phoenix, Ford Field in Detroit and Soldier Field in Chicago. The 20 other stadiums have Wi-Fi in certain areas, but mostly operate on wireless service provided by Verizon and/or AT&T. Many of these venues have installed distributed antenna systems (DAS) to increase wireless connectivity while they seek answers to the challenges of enabling stadiums with Wi-Fi. DAS connects cellular antennas to a common source, allowing wireless access in large buildings like stadiums. Mobile Sports Report published its inaugural State of the Stadium Technology Survey this year, based on responses from more than 50 NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, university, pro soccer, pro golf and car racing sites. The survey concluded DAS is currently more popular at venues because it boosts connectivity to mobile devices while dividing costs between carriers and the facility. Cleveland Browns fans will benefit from a new DAS tower, installed by Verizon, and an upgraded AT&T tower this year at FirstEnergy Stadium, Browns President Alec Scheiner said the improved technology will serve as a test case for whether to install Wi-Fi in the future. ""If you are a consumer or a fan, you really just care about being able to get on your mobile device, and that's what we're trying to tackle,"" he said during a July press conference. Kapustka said DAS is a quick fix and is not a long-term strategy, especially when it comes to fans watching TV replays on their mobile devices. ""The video angle is the big thing for Wi-Fi,"" he said. ""Cellular just simply won't be able to handle the bandwidth."" He also pointed out that it is not in the best business interest of cellphone carriers to install Wi-Fi, as it would take customers off their networks. Also complicating Kraft's 2015 goal is the lack of league consensus about who will build Wi-Fi networks in all of its stadiums, and when. By contrast, Major League Baseball named wireless-tech company Qualcomm its official technology partner in April, launching a two-year study to solve mobile-connectivity issues in its 30 stadiums. Kapustka said MLB was in a position to strike the overarching deal with Qualcomm because team owners made the league responsible for digital properties during the 1990s. The NFL has a variety of rights deals, including Direct TV and Verizon, which make it more difficult for the league to agree on a single Wi-Fi plan, he said. ""My opinion is they (the NFL) will eventually have something more like MLB,"" Kapustka said. ""MLB has shown it is a great way to make money.""","Despite efforts of commissioner Roger Goodell, less than half NFL stadiums have Wi-Fi .
At games, the crush of fans with smartphones can overload cellular networks .
The improved home-viewing experience may have caused a recent dip in NFL attendance .
Some stadium operators are waiting for a faster version of Wi-Fi to be developed ."
"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama doesn't have much to look forward to in November. While a president's first midterm election rarely goes well for his party, second term presidents don't fare any better. The opposition party, even when struggling in the polls, has traditionally been able to use these elections to mobilize its base. The result has been that second term midterms create great congressional obstacles for the president in his final years in office. And, based on current polls, 2014 could well fit the pattern. Take a look at how midterms have affected second-term presidents: . 1918: GOP gains in wartime . In the midst of World War I, Republicans rebounded in the midterm elections. President Woodrow Wilson had a number of major achievements under his belt. He had moved a sweeping domestic agenda through Congress, including the creation of the Federal Reserve and the creation of the progressive income tax. The president had also been able to mobilize support for American intervention in World War I. Although Wilson strenuously campaigned to convince voters that electing Democrats would help in the war effort, warning voters that Republicans ""sought to take the choice of policy out of my hands and put it under the control of instrumentalities of their own choosing,"" his argument didn't persuade. Republicans gained control of Congress. In the House, the GOP exited the election with a 240 to 192 margin while in the Senate, after picking up six seats, they controlled the upper chamber 49 to 47. The impact would be significant. Senate Republicans would successfully use their power and control of the committees to oppose Wilson's request to ratify the Treaty of Versailles based on their opposition to the U.S. entering into a League of Nations. They ultimately blocked ratification. 1938: Backlash against FDR . Following his landslide victory in 1936, Franklin Roosevelt and the Democrats seemed unbeatable. Roosevelt had transformed the federal government with his New Deal policies. In doing so, he had also formed a powerful coalition of industrial workers, farmers, progressive business leaders and intellectuals. But the sense of power was fleeting. In 1937, Roosevelt tried to expand the size of the Supreme Court so that he could appoint more liberals and prevent the court from knocking down any more of his programs; he also pushed a plan to reorganize the executive branch by granting the president's staff more sweeping power over Congress. The proposals triggered a fierce backlash. Democrats lost 72 seats in the House and seven in the Senate. A conservative coalition of Southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans formed in response and did extremely well in the midterm elections. Given that Southern Democrats controlled most of the major committees, the coalition would be able to block many of FDR's domestic proposals and remain the dominant force in congressional politics for decades to come. 1958: Start of a liberal force in Congress . Republican Dwight Eisenhower was an enormously popular president who coasted to an easy re-election victory against Democrat Adlai Stevenson in 1956. But two years after his success, Democrats scored huge victories in the midterm elections. They retained control of both chambers and vastly increased their numbers. The Democratic seats in the Senate rose to 65, from 49, and 283 in the House, up from 232. It was not just the numbers but the fact there was an influx of liberal Democrats. The new members pushed domestic politics in a more liberal direction for the remainder of Eisenhower's term and put issues such as health care, civil rights, and federal aid to education onto the national agenda. They would be the backbone of Lyndon Johnson's coalition in 1964 and 1965 as he moved forward with the Great Society. 1986: Democrats stymie Reagan's final years in office . Ronald Reagan struggled in 1986. Although he seemed to be on the road to victory after his decisive defeat of Walter Mondale in 1984, Democrats rebounded and in 1986 regained control of the Senate with a nine-seat increase in their numbers, thus controlling both houses of Congress. The next two years would be extraordinarily difficult for the President as Democrats were able to protect domestic programs and even push Reagan toward accepting measures, such as a tax increase, that went against his ideals. More important, the Democratic Congress launched an investigation into the Iran Contra scandal, which severely damaged Reagan's standing and weakened his political position. Reagan would rebound by negotiating a major treaty with the Soviet Union, but his ability to move forward with any big ideas was severely hampered. 1998: Clinton leads Democrats to gains despite impeachment . President Bill Clinton was the only recent president to do relatively well in his second set of midterm elections. For a while, Clinton seemed to be on the ropes after his re-election. Republicans retained control of Congress, and in 1998, House Republicans were conducting an impeachment proceeding against the President for having lied about his affair with an intern. But public sentiment went against the Republicans, not against the Clinton. Riding the wave of a booming economy, Democrats gained five seats in the House though they failed to regain control. 2006: Bush suffers a ""thumping"" President George W. Bush was feeling strong after having mounted a successful campaign against John Kerry in 2004, drawing on the theme of national security. However, public frustration with Bush was mounting. Democrats pounded on the administration for his mistakes in handling Hurricane Katrina and revelations about interrogations of terror suspects caused trouble overseas. Many Republicans were blasting Bush as a big government conservative who had led the nation into an unnecessary war in Iraq. On the domestic front, Bush tried to use his political capital from 2004 to privatize Social Security, but the plan backfired. In 2006, Bush suffered a ""thumping,"" as he called it. For the first time since 1994, Democrats regained control of the House and Senate. Democrats wound up with a majority of the House by 232 to 203. The split in the Senate was 49 to 49. But two independents caucused with the Democrats, giving them a majority. In the coming years, the Democrats used their position to change the national debate and to place immense pressure on the White House to redirect Bush's policy in Iraq. In short, other than Clinton, presidents have suffered greatly in their second terms in the past century. The elation and momentum from the president's re-election fades quickly. The problems and burdens that come from being in office, especially after an entire term of controversial decisions, never disappear. As with all midterms, partisans turn out to vote much more eagerly than moderates and independents who sit these contests out. Perhaps Obama will be able to pull off what Clinton achieved given the unpopularity of Congress, but it's not likely. The continued controversy over the President's health care policies and general frustration with Congress will make things difficult for Democrats. A recent wave of retirements won't make things any easier. And so it's conceivable that Republicans could even regain control of the Senate while expanding their majority in the House. If so, the tough road that Obama has faced will only get that much harder. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: Most presidents fare poorly in their second set of midterm elections .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Congress can force White House aides to testify under subpoena, a U.S. District Court ruled Thursday, rejecting Bush administration claims of immunity. Former White House Counsel Harriet Miers is not immune from congressional subpoenas, a judge ruled Thursday. The House Judiciary Committee has been seeking to force former White House Counsel Harriet Miers to testify before Congress about the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006. The White House has been resisting, claiming she cannot be compelled to appear. But the White House position ""is without any support in case law,"" Judge John D. Bates wrote in a 93-page opinion released Thursday. He said the notion that ""Miers is absolutely immune from compelled congressional process"" is ""unprecedented."" But, Bates added, the ruling does not mean that Miers and Joshua Bolten, the White House chief of staff from whom House Democrats have demanded White House documents, could not assert executive privilege during congressional testimony. The court ""resolves, and again rejects"" the notion that senior White House aides are absolutely immune from subpoena, but the ""specific claims of executive privilege that Ms. Miers and Mr. Bolten may assert are not addressed -- and the court expresses no view on such claims,"" Bates wrote. In a hearing in June, Bates had urged the White House and Congress to resolve their dispute via negotiations. He also expressed concern the clock would run out because he expected an appeal of his ruling no matter which way he decided. That could keep the dispute in the courts until a new Congress is elected in November. The subpoenas expire when this Congress leaves office. Rep. John Boehner, an Ohio Republican and the House minority leader, appeared to agree on Thursday. ""I'm sure it'll be appealed and it'll go on into next year and it'll become a moot issue,"" he said. Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, the senior Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, called the ruling a ""victory for Congress,"" but urged congressional Democrats and the administration to ""seek a reasonable compromise"" rather than continue to fight the matter in court. The House Judiciary committee filed suit against Miers and Bolten in March after the Department of Justice said it would not pursue contempt charges against them for failing to obey the subpoena. The White House has insisted the firings of the nine U.S. attorneys were legal. But Democrats said the central questions behind the dismissals -- who decided the prosecutors should be ousted, and why -- remain unanswered. The position is supposed to be an apolitical one. Democrats accuse the administration of political motives in replacing the nine officials. White House press secretary Dana Perino said the administration is reviewing Thursday's ruling. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, said she was ""pleased"" by the ruling, though she said had not had a chance to study it.","NEW: Miers, others could still assert executive privilege during testimony, judge says .

"(CNN)  -- If it seems like nearly everyone you see these days, from kids to seniors, has some kind of tech gadget handy, it's not just your imagination. According to a new report from the Pew Internet and American Life project, nearly 90% of Americans now own a cell phone, computer, MP3 player, game console, e-book reader or tablet computer. In Generations and Their Gadgets, Pew explores how age groups in the U.S. tend to use their tech devices. It defines six generations ranging from age 18 to 75-plus. A few highlights about how Americans of different ages use mobile devices: . Cell phones . Eighty-five percent of Americans currently own cell phones, making it the single most popular type of tech gadget. Slightly more Americans use their cell phones to take pictures (76%) than to send or receive text messages (72%) -- but across all age groups, those two non-voice call activities are the most popular. Among the 15% of Americans who do not own a cell phone, one-third live in a household with at least one working cell phone. So, overall, ""90% of all adults (including 62% of those age 75 and older) live in a household with at least one working cell phone,"" the survey finds. Also, Pew notes that as of June, about a quarter of all U.S. households had gone mobile-only, ditching their traditional ""landline"" phone connections. This includes more than half of all adults ages 25 to 29, and it indicates how crucial it is to update the U.S. 911 emergency calling system to be more friendly to cell phones, as well as to accommodate more types of communication than voice calls. Even though more people are getting smartphones (30 percent of U.S. cell phone owners, by most estimates), only Americans ages 18 to 34 are especially likely to use their phones for several purposes: internet access, e-mail, games, getting or playing music, sending or receiving photos, recording video, etc. The only widely popular activities across all age groups are taking pictures and text messaging, which may explain why 70% of Americans still rely on non-smart ""feature phones,"" which have fewer bells and whistles. MP3 players . As tech gadgets go, MP3 players are relatively limited devices. So it's a bit surprising that the youngest and most tech-savvy age group Pew studied is by far the most likely to own an MP3 player. Three-quarters of Americans ages 18 to 34 own an MP3 player, but only 56% of the next oldest group (35 to 46) do. Tablets . As of September, 5% of U.S. adults owned tablet computers such as the iPad or Galaxy Tab, up from 3% in May. (Apple's popular iPad hit U.S. stores in April.) With the launch of several Android-based iPad competitors, expect this kind of device to become much more popular in the next year. It'll be interesting to see whether tablet ownership starts to displace some ownership of laptop computers. E-readers . Currently, 5% of Americans own e-reader devices such as the Kindle or Nook, but this vastly underestimates the total number of people who read e-books. Many people read e-books on their smartphones, tablets, and desktop or laptop computers. E-reader devices are most popular among Americans ages 47 to 56. I suspect that in the next year, tablets will shake up all kinds of patterns of mobile device ownership and use in the U.S. If tablet prices start to drop and more options for size and connectivity emerge (especially likely for Android models), it's possible that that many people who rely primarily on feature phones might choose to invest in a Wi-Fi-enabled tablet (a one-time expense) rather than upgrading to a full smartphone (with higher monthly bills and often unexpected charges). The opinions expressed in this story are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Eighty-five percent of Americans currently own cell phones .

"(CNN) -- Four Swedish nationals will stand trial in Copenhagen Friday in what officials describe as the most serious ever Islamist terrorist plot in Scandinavia. The alleged plot, which counter-terrorism officials in the United States and Scandinavia believe was directed by al Qaeda operatives in Pakistan, targeted Jyllands Posten, the Copenhagen-based newspaper responsible for publishing controversial cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. The four persons are alleged to have planned a gun attack on the newspaper, followed by ""the execution"" of hostages. The cell's alleged plans were thwarted by a joint operation by Swedish and Danish security services, which tracked the alleged terrorists as they drove from Sweden to Denmark in December 2010, with a submachine gun, a silencer, and several dozen 9mm submachine gun cartridges. The four persons - Mounir Dhahri, 46, of Tunisian descent, Munir Awad, 31, of Lebanese descent, Sahbi Zalouti, 39, of Tunisian descent, and Omar Aboelazm, 32, of Egyptian descent - are charged with plotting to kill a large number of people at the newspaper. They have denied the charges. Western security services believe the plot was part of a broader al Qaeda conspiracy, authorized by Osama bin Laden, to strike Europe with attacks mirroring Pakistani terrorist group Lashkar e Taiba's Mumbai attack in November 2008, which killed nearly 200 people. In October 2010, the U.S. State Department issued an unprecedented travel advisory warning Americans of the potential for a similar attack in Europe. Dhahri, the suspected ringleader of the cell, Awad, and Zalouti had all travelled to Pakistan in early 2010. Awad and Zalouti - travelling separately - were arrested by Pakistani authorities in August 2010 before they could reach North Waziristan and were subsequently deported, according to a Swedish counterterrorism source. Dhahri evaded capture, and he is believed to have received training in Pakistan and then went to Sweden shortly before the group allegedly began to plot their attack, according to the source. Awad, the Lebanese-born suspect, had long been on the radar screen of Swedish counter-terrorism services. He was suspected of having joined up with jihadist militants in Somalia in 2006, before fleeing the country when Ethiopian troops launched a military operation against Islamist militants there, according to a Danish security source. By October 2010, Swedish security services had begun tracking the cell, placing listening devices in their apartments. A Swedish counter-terrorism source told CNN the group only settled on attacking the newspaper shortly before the planned attack, and often squabbled. On the evening of December 28, 2010, three of the alleged cell members set off from Stockholm in a silver Toyota rental car with Dhahri at the wheel. Security services continuously monitored the progress of their vehicle, including from the air. Zalouti bailed from the journey at the last minute, and was later arrested in Stockholm, according to court documents. It was just after 2 a.m. when their vehicle crossed the iconic Oresund bridge connecting the two countries. When they reached Copenhagen, they were initially unable to find the address where they planned to sleep. Just after 10 a.m. on December 29, Danish police, concerned the men may be about to try launch their operation, moved in to make the arrests. Authorities had already taken precautions. When they learned the group was planning to travel down to Denmark to allegedly carry out the operation, they secretly disabled their weapons, according to a Swedish counter-terrorism source. Plastic wrist strips were also found in their car, according to court documents, and security services said they believed the materials were going to be used to handcuff hostages. Security services believe the plan was to try to take up to 200 journalists hostage at the newspaper and execute many of them, a Swedish counter-terrorism source told CNN. ""Our assessment is that their plan was to try to get access to the Jyllands-Posten building and carry out a Mumbai-style attack,"" the head of Denmark's intelligence service, Jakob Scharf, said in a press conference after the group was arrested. Cash amounting to $20,000 was also recovered from the suspects, and a pistol and ammunition were found in one of their apartments, according to court documents. The trial may shed light on what officials believe are connections between the alleged plotters and al Qaeda terrorists in Pakistan. In total, police made more than a thousand recordings of the plotters' conversations, some of which are expected to be played in court. A Swedish counter-terrorism source has told CNN that investigations have revealed a complex set of connections between the plotters and a network linked to Ilyas Kashmiri, a senior Pakistani al Qaeda operative who Western intelligence believe orchestrated al Qaeda's plans to hit Europe with Mumbai-style attacks. Swedish security services established that Awad, the alleged Lebanese-born plotter, moved in the same circle as ""Farid,"" a Stockholm-based militant of Moroccan descent who is suspected of acting as facilitator for Ilyas Kashmiri's terrorist network, according to a Swedish counter-terrorism source. Also involved with Kashmiri's network was David Headley, an American of Pakistani descent who pleaded guilty two years ago to helping plot the Mumbai attacks. According to an interview of Headley by India's National Investigation Agency that was obtained by CNN, Headley met with Farid in 2009 in relation to a plot Headley himself was planning against the Jyllands Posten newspaper. The newspaper and its cartoonists has been targeted by several plots in recent years, including a plot by a Norwegian al Qaeda cell broken up in July 2010. Western counter-terrorism officials say that despite the reported death of Kashmiri in a drone strike in June 2011, al Qaeda has not given up its hope to launch gun and hostage execution attacks in Europe because of the huge publicity and fear such attacks would create.","Four Swedish nationals are to stand trial for an alleged Islamist terror plot in Scandinavia .

"Olympia, Washington (CNN) -- Joseph Shaun Goodman's seventh arrest for DUI was as sensational as it gets. Police chased him in his Ferrari at more than 90 mph in downtown Olympia, Washington. A passenger, whom Goodman had just met at a bar, begged to leave the car, and his wish was granted while the car slowed. Goodman crashed his sports car, a 2000 model worth $70,000, into a house and two cars. The tall, tan businessman was finally arrested behind the wheel in a church parking lot with police drawing their guns on him just before midnight December 29. Cops noted his watery, bloodshot eyes and smelled alcohol on his breath. Now there's a local uproar over how Goodman, 42, avoided hard jail time -- despite facing his seventh drunk-driving offense and with his blood alcohol measuring 0.16, twice Washington state's threshold for DUI. Goodman was given 364 days of work-release from jail because, a judge ruled, jailing him would harm his small business, his employees and the community. Under work-release, he spends his days as a free man at his telecommunications business, but he spends his weeknights and weekends in jail, his attorney said. But critics such as Sam Miller are outraged. ""It seems like Shaun Goodman and other people that are wealthy are playing by a different set of rules,"" Miller said. ""I think it's also that he's a business owner in this town and that society sees Shaun Goodman more important than anyone else. ""I think Shaun Goodman, when he got his fourth DUI charge or fifth DUI charge, should have faced stiffer penalties then,"" Miller added. ""In a way, it's almost society has said that 'if you're rich, it's OK to do this. You need another chance. I'm sure you'll turn it around' -- as if those who are wealthy have more of an ability to change than those that are poor."" In February, a judge even gave Goodman permission to travel to New York and attend the Super Bowl while his case was being adjudicated, said Paul Strophy, the attorney for Goodman. The defense . Goodman declined to comment, but Strophy said his client ""did not receive special treatment."" The size of Goodman's wealth wasn't immediately available, but his house is a 3-acre gated property, with a boat on a trailer on the driveway to a separate three-car garage. ""It is a benefit to society in the bigger picture, even though I can understand the outrage, but there's also a big cost to society in terms of not just the cost of incarceration,"" Strophy said. ""There's definitely a benefit to society allowing people even such as Mr. Goodman to do work release when they're serving a jail sentence. ""It gives them means to support themselves, their families, and in Mr. Goodman's case, because he's an employer, employees keep their jobs,"" the attorney added. Goodman received the maximum allowed by law for misdemeanor DUI, Strophy said. Some argue that a seventh DUI should have made Goodman eligible for a felony -- and a tougher maximum sentence. But Washington state law doesn't allow for such a felony because Goodman didn't accumulate four DUIs in the past 10 years, Strophy said. The prior misdemeanor DUI accusations occurred in 1993, 1994, 1999, 2004, 2006 and 2011, and two of them -- in 1999 and 2004 -- were reduced to lesser misdemeanors, according to court papers. ""I know a lot of people believe it should have been at felony level,"" Strophy said. ""Under Washington law, the work-release program is still considered a jail program because you do spend your evenings and weekends in the jail, and so you only get out to work. And so based on that, he did in fact get the maximum sentence allowed by law."" The prosecutor . Thurston County Prosecuting Attorney Jon Tunheim disputed accusations that Goodman got a lenient sentence because he's wealthy. ""There was no favoritism allowed here,"" the prosecutor said. ""The gut reaction is to want to punish him more than other offenders because of the fact that he had money, and we're not going to do that, either. We're going to treat him the same as we would treat any other offender. ""I think if you can keep somebody working while they're in custody -- so they're working while they're out of custody -- substantially reduces the likelihood that they would re-offend, particularly when you're talking about someone who is an alcoholic or a drug addict,"" Tunheim said. ""I think you got to set emotion aside and really think about what is the best long term solution for the community."" The defense attorney and the prosecutor acknowledged how some people may express frustration over what protesters contend is an overly lenient justice system toward Goodman. Both attorneys cited the way that the state law is written for such cases as Goodman's: It doesn't allow for harsher sentences. But Goodman is remorseful, Strophy said. ""He acknowledges and understands the gravity of the situation and how serious it is,"" Strophy said. ""Every indication to me is that he's given is that he wants treatment and will continue to do treatment and do everything to conquer that demon"" of alcoholism, he said. The passenger . Henry Griffin, 28, of Olympia met Goodman at a local tavern, where Goodman was flashing $100 bills and buying drinks for people. Griffin was treated to a Fireball, a cinnamon whiskey. ""I had known him less than an hour, and he said, 'Hey, do you want to ride with me?' And I said yeah,"" Griffin said. ""I was just like, wow, yeah, it's a Ferrari. I had never been in a Ferrari before."" They were headed to another saloon. ""As we leave the parking lot, he's already speeding, and there's a police officer right there, and he tries to pull us over,"" Griffin said. ""We go maybe a half a block, and I'm noticing something is wrong. And I'm like, hey, can we please pull over? The cops are here ... and he immediately blurts he can't."" Griffin begged. He even screamed. ""First thing that comes out of my mind, 'I have a son; I have a 2-year-old son. Please let me out!' "" Griffin recounted. He thought he was going to die. He couldn't find the interior handle to open the door. ""I figured, hey, I'm going to die here tonight. I'm going to die in this car. This is a small car; I'm a big guy; I'm going to die,"" Griffin said. Griffin grabbed the wheel while Goodman was driving. The car slowed. Then Griffin jumped out of the Ferrari. He called 911. Griffin says he's still traumatized by the experience: He sees a psychologist weekly and a chiropractor three times a week. When he can get sleep, he dreams of the ride all over again, he said. He can't stand or sit for a long period of time. Goodman has never apologized to him, and Griffin feels the court let Goodman off easy. ""It's just sad to feel forgotten by the justice system,"" Griffin said. ""They're not worried about the people."" Man who confessed to drunken driving in viral video gets more than 6 years . CNN's Dan Simon and Augie Martin reported from Washington state.","Joseph Shaun Goodman's seventh DUI is a misdemeanor under Washington state law .

"(CNN) -- Since the dawn of the iPhone age in 2007, loyal BlackBerry users have watched their favorite device maker stumble into an ever-steepening decline. Some of the collapse is due to the consumer changeover to Apple and Google Android products, but the company -- once known as Research In Motion -- hasn't helped itself with poor planning and delayed product introductions. On Monday, the company that once blazed the trail in the smartphone market announced it's being taken private by its largest shareholder, Fairfax Financial, a Canadian insurance company. The move comes on the heels of an announced $1 billion quarterly loss and layoffs of 4,500 employees. Its future as a maker of smartphones may be in doubt. Now the dwindling numbers of loyal BlackBerry users must decide: Is this the last straw? It's no idle question. For all the attention paid to BlackBerry's fall and the rise of iPhone and Android, there's still a sizable BlackBerry market out there. Forbes magazine estimates that there are in excess of 50 million BlackBerry users, and they remain fiercely devoted to their phones, with their secure e-mail software and physical keyboards. ""You can tear my Blackberry's real keyboard out of my cold dead fingers,"" user Charles Wright of Toronto wrote on Twitter. BlackBerry: Why breaking up is hard to do . Ronen Halevy, an IT security professional who runs the site BerryReview.com, still prefers his BlackBerry because it ""focuses on communications first"" -- even though he's familiar with both Android and iPhone platforms. ""They're very good devices to consume information, but the main point of the phone is that it's more like a computer,"" he says of the Apple and Google phones. BlackBerrys, he says, are better at ""flow"" from e-mail to calendar to other applications. He hopes that the company returns to its roots. ""I think that Fairfax should double down on BlackBerry 10 and the combination of corporate and consumer market that appreciated the rock solid communication platform it offered,"" he wrote on BerryReview.com. ""This means an end to the 'me too' additions of features to BlackBerry 10 and instead appealing to the market that made BlackBerry take off."" One commenter observed, however, that the company will be hard pressed to win new converts. ""Not good news for consumers, people hate the BB name and what it stands for. Self-inflicted suicide,"" kingbernie wrote. He suspected that becoming a corporate-focused software business might be the company's best way out of the wilderness -- even if it means leaving the consumer market behind. From CrackBerry to 'depressing': The BlackBerry's 5-year fall . Chris Umiastowski, a tech analyst and regular contributor to the BlackBerry boards on CrackBerry.com, says BlackBerry fans should remain wary. ""Going private doesn't necessarily change the outcome for the company. All it is guaranteed to change is the ownership structure,"" he said via e-mail. ""It's not a nail in the coffin, nor is it some massive opportunity to fix themselves. No matter who owns the shares they still have to compete with solid competitors. Going private just lets them operate outside of so much public scrutiny."" For those who want to put their BlackBerrys in a drawer next to their PalmPilots but want to keep a physical keyboard on their devices, your options are limited. The Motorola Photon Q and the Motorola Droid 4 are Android-compatible and have relatively large slide-out keyboards, but reviewers have taken issue with their camera capabilities. In addition, BerryReview.com's Halevy observes, those keyboards -- which are landscape-oriented instead of the portrait-style versions on BlackBerrys -- seem like ""afterthoughts."" ""Even if you're in an e-mail and you want to hit the 'delete' button to delete an e-mail -- you think that's logical -- it doesn't work,"" he says. What killed BlackBerry: Terrible apps . The NEC Terrain, another Android phone with a physical keyboard, is marketed for its ""rugged innovation"" but, says Halevy, he doesn't think it's really aimed at the general consumer. That leads to the host of smartphones with virtual keyboards, including the new iPhone 5S and 5C, the Android-compatible Samsung Galaxy S4 and the Android HTC One, among many others. All have their pros and cons, whether it's your comfort with their operating systems or your desire for certain accessories. But for those, like Umiastowski, who want to stick with BlackBerry, it will hard to get them to change. His household includes a number of Apple items -- including his wife's iPhone -- but he prefers the BlackBerry. He's frustrated by the lack of apps for the device but still prefers the overall experience. ""BlackBerry has always been (and still is) the best experience for communicating. At first it was push email and physical keyboards. Now I'm on a Z10 and I find the multitasking + software keyboard + email experience is second to none,"" he wrote. ""An iPhone would feel like a step backwards on those things which matter to me."" Besides, says Halevy, he likes how the BlackBerry creates community. ""The one thing you notice immediately when people change from BlackBerry to other devices is you never hear from them anymore,"" he says. Opinion: Why I'll never ditch my BlackBerry .","On Monday, BlackBerry announced that it was being taken private .
Despite decline in consumer sales, there are still 50 million BlackBerry users .
They're very loyal to the brand and hope change is harbinger of an upswing ."
"(CNN) -- A slender and stylish woman with a full dark beard -- yes, a beard -- stands in the middle of the roiling battle between Russia and the West, adding to the fury of a growing confrontation. Who could have imagined it? I'm talking about the singer Conchita Wurst, alter ego of the Austrian artist Tom Neuwirth. Conchita just won the hugely popular Eurovision contest with overwhelming public support, turning herself into an instant international superstar, a fact that is apparently driving many influential Russians into a foot-stomping rage. In theory, Eurovision, the venerable 58-year-old European tradition, is all about good feelings and understanding between neighbors in a continent once torn by war. In reality, it is a competition driven by crisscrossing rivalries and subtle political overtones. This year the competition was something to behold. More than 100 million viewers across dozens of countries tuned in on Saturday night. When Austria's turn came, the camera slowly zoomed in on the stylish figure in the golden dress standing in the middle of the giant stage. The camera moved in to reveal a thick, well-trimmed beard on the face of a woman with long black hair. Conchita sang ""Rise Like a Phoenix,"" a theme evoking personal rebirth, transformation, and triumph. We might have been able to hear the gasps of surprise that surely rose across European living rooms. We could not record those. But the competition did register the public reaction, and we know millions cheered, because Conchita won the competition. And yet, not everyone found the performance all that inspiring. Russian President Vladimir Putin has in recent years redefined Russia as a rival, an opponent of the West. And among the aspects of ""Western culture"" that he has used to distinguish Russia from its rivals is its attitude toward equality for gays. Putin has quite deliberately become the standard-bearer of traditional morality, cracking down mercilessly on Russian liberals, particularly on its gay and lesbian citizens, even foreign visitors, as part of an effort to stoke popular support in a country that, despite having lived through the cutting-edge social experiment of communism, remains deeply conservative. The ongoing battle over Ukraine, which stands on the edge of civil war, was triggered by a push by Ukraine to strengthen its ties to the European Union, something Putin is loath to accept. The dispute with Ukraine created tensions at the Eurovision contest. Since the voting includes phone and text, organizers had to decide what to do with the vote from Crimea, the province that Russia seized from Ukraine a few weeks ago. (They counted those votes as Ukrainian.) But it was Conchita, ""the bearded lady,"" who stuck like a stone inside the Putinists' shoes. Russia, along with people in Belarus and Armenia, filed petitions to remove Conchita from the competition, or at least edit her out of the broadcast. Wurst didn't just sing. She wowed the viewers. And when the time came to vote, they texted and phoned in with abandon. She won the competition by a wide margin. Who knows what exactly drove the vote? She sang well. But undoubtedly there were other factors at play. In the press conference after her victory, somebody asked her if she had a message for Putin. She did. ""We are unstoppable."" That may be. But in Russia, life for people whose sexual orientation is out of the mainstream is rife with danger. A year ago, Putin signed a law banning gay ""propaganda,"" which makes it illegal to even express support for gay rights in any manner. Gay parents worry about losing their children. Many are leaving the country. It's the tip of the iceberg of Putin's repression of the opposition. Conchita would face harassment in Russia. She uses the pronoun ""she"" to refer to herself, and her sexual identity can make your head spin: She is the creation of Tom Neuwirth, who uses the pronoun ""he"" and describes it as having ""two hearts beating in my chest."" He created Conchita, complete with a fictional birthplace -- the mountains of Colombia -- to deal with the discrimination of his teenage years, when he liked to dress in girls' clothes. Conchita demolishes our conception of femininity and masculinity. She is an individual creation; Neuwirth's creation come to life. But don't expect Russian politicians to have any understanding. The always outrageous ultranationalist member of parliament, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, declared that Conchita's win marks ""the end of Europe. It has turned wild."" He helpfully offered that ""Fifty years ago, the Soviet Union occupied Austria ... we should have stayed there."" Of course, Zhirinovsky is not the man on whose judgment we should rely for issues of morality. A few weeks ago, he was confronted on live television by a Russian journalist, a pregnant woman, on the subject of Ukraine. He accused her of having ""a uterine frenzy"" and ordered one of his aides to ""rape her violently."" Putin's deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin, used the Conchita victory to take a slap at Ukraine, sarcastically tweeting, ""Eurovision showed the eurointegrators their europerspective -- a bearded girl."" That was something of a limp slap. A member of the St. Petersburg legislative assembly officially asked Russia's Eurovision committee to stop participating in the competition, thus to avoid having Russian performers on the same stage as ""the clear transvestite and hermaphrodite Conchita Wurst,"" which would serve as propaganda for ""moral decay."" The despicable Zhirinovsky -- whom I had the inerasable experience of meeting in Baghdad, Iraq, many years ago (he was wearing revealing Speedos doing laps in the hotel pool) -- said: ""There are no more men or women in Europe. Just it."" He might have thought the quip very clever. In reality, Conchita showed us that there are many kinds of people in Europe -- including in Russia. And the people who voted for the new Eurovision champion showed they are very consciously throwing their support behind someone who represents openness, inclusiveness, and the possibility of becoming a human being that may not conform to the standards set by others. With that, European television viewers sent a message to Putin, and to Russia, and to all the people who would like to fight to keep the world from changing. And they put Conchita, in her full-length evening gown, with her bearded face, right in the middle of that battlefield.","Conchita Wurst, a ""woman"" with a full beard, overwhelmingly won Eurovision song contest .

"Doha, Qatar (CNN) -- Making sure another plane is never ""lost"" again is the immediate priority for the airline industry, according to Tony Tyler CEO of the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The group has set up a taskforce comprised of airlines, pilots, flight safety organizations and flight tracking and navigation service providers to try and ensure a mystery like flight MH370 is not repeated. ""We're going to be focusing on the tracking of aircraft and not streaming of data,"" said Tyler at the group's annual meeting, in Doha, Qatar, adding that it will deliver a report in September recommending what changes airlines should take, although they won't be mandatory. The streaming of data is not the focus, said Tyler, as tracking is ""the most urgent first step and can be done relatively easily."" ""There are a lot more issues that come into play when it comes into the streaming of data. If you start having streaming from 100,000 flights a day, you're going to end up with masses of data and that may be manageable or may be not manageable."" Currently a mix of radar, satellite and voice communications tracks aircraft. A one-size-fits-all tracking solution might not work, cautions Kevin Hiatt, senior vice president for Safety and Flight Operations for IATA. While the technology to track aircraft better is already available there is an equipment issue. ""Not all aircraft are equipped the same, it's just like an automobile, there are different options you can fit in the aircraft, so we'll explore what options are currently onboard and see how it can be used to fill this gap. ""Maybe some carriers already have what they need to start and there might be some that have absolutely nothing and have to start."" Many airline CEOs have committed to improving tracking no matter the cost. ""We're already doing quite a lot,"" said Willie Walsh, CEO of International Airlines Group. ""We routinely send position messages with our ACARS messages and that's something we've done for many years an something we'll continue to do. We send ACARS messages every 30 minutes. ""By this time next year (the airline industry) will have cracked this."" ACARS is a data link for sending messages between planes and ground facilities that was developed in the 1970s. Just five years ago Air France suffered a tragedy when flight AF447 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris. The accident brought to public attention that in some locations, such as over ocean areas, the precise location of an aircraft is not known all the time. ""We don't totally track aircraft as there are areas of the world that don't have coverage that allow us to track them with what we would conventionally think of as a GPS or some type a ping that has a geographic location,"" said Hiatt. However, after the incident, the airline, independent of any industry-wide report, made changes to how its planes communicate their location and can be found in an emergency. One was improving the battery life of the black box recorder to three months, the second concerned the frequency with which the plane communicates with land. ""Flight data is now sent from the plane every 10 minutes,"" said Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of Air France-KLM. If a plane deviates from its initial flight plan we send a message every minute to our dispatch office in Paris ... to say that something is wrong. So the tracking is much more accurate and we know minute by minute where the plane is. ""We have the equipment on board; it's a decision plus some investment to increase the frequency of the messages."" Another issue facing airlines and pilots is the question of making something tamper-proof. Manufacturers say that can mean devices that won't be able to be switched off in-flight. ""Speaking as a former pilot myself, if I had a particular piece of kit in the cockpit and I wanted to stop it smoking or being on fire, I could disable that,"" said Hiatt. ""Now they're saying they want to take that away from the pilot. So there are some diverse opinions which will be explored.""","Aviation taskforce wants to ensure planes cannot be ""lost"" in the future .
Tracking, not data streaming, is the answer, says head of IATA .
Air France already uses technology to enable frequent tracking updates ."
"(CNN) -- Striking the right chord with football fans has long proved a tricky proposition for music's elite. Throughout the 84-year history of the World Cup, stars from across the musical spectrum, from Shakira to the late Luciano Pavarotti, have tried -- with varying degrees of success -- to write the soundtrack to the ""beautiful game."" But 24 years ago, ahead of Italia '90, seminal British band New Order arguably penned the ultimate football anthem. To achieve that elusive goal, they had to break a few rules -- most notably, the one that says footballers shouldn't rap. ""There wasn't supposed to be a rap,"" recalls former England winger John Barnes, who not only starred on the pitch but also performed memorably on New Order's ""World in Motion"" -- the team's official song for the 1990 World Cup. ""After a while, and a few glasses of wine, someone drunkenly said 'Why don't we just put a rap in it?' "" he told CNN. The rest is history. ""World in Motion"" not only became a musical success, providing New Order's only British No. 1 single to date, it also helped redefine football in a country which was falling out of love with the sport after a decade darkened by hooliganism and fatal stadium disasters at Bradford, Heysel and Hillsborough. Unlikely bedfellows . New Order, one of the most influential British groups of modern times, and the English Football Association -- then chaired by 75-year-old Bert Millichip -- were unlikely collaborators. The band is made up of ex-members of Joy Division, whose frontman Ian Curtis committed suicide in 1980. After the singer's death, Peter Hook, Stephen Morris and Bernard Sumner decided to carry on making music and -- with the addition of Gillian Gilbert -- New Order was born. The now deceased Tony Wilson, owner of the band's record label Factory Records, was the instigator of a partnership between the suits who ran English football and a group of musicians famed for combining post-punk and electronic dance music. ""Tony never told us about it,"" recalls New Order drummer Morris. ""He goes, 'I've got a great idea, why don't you do the World Cup song.' We thought it was a terrible idea because all World Cup songs, football songs in general, were just naff."" While many World Cup songs feature gimmicky lyrics about scoring goals and chasing dreams, New Order's ditty rebelled against convention. ""World in Motion"" notably included the lyric, ""This ain't a football song."" Morris explains: ""When we did it, we did talk to a lot of people and say, 'How do you think we should go about doing a football song?' ""Basically we ignored everything they said. ""It wasn't weighed down by everything else that you ever thought about football songs."" 'This ain't a football song' One snag was that New Order was under orders to include the England team on the record. With the help of actor-come-comedian Keith Allen -- father of British popstar Lily Allen and ""Game of Thrones"" actor Alfie Allen -- they came across an unlikely solution. ""We knew Keith,"" Morris says of Allen, who has appeared in a host of British TV shows across the last four decades and is a fan of London football club Fulham. ""He'd been hanging out at The Hacienda quite a lot,"" adds Morris, referring to the legendary Manchester club owned by Factory and New Order members. ""Keith turned up and he wrote the rap. That was when it started getting a bit more 'footbally.' "" The rap would go down in English football history but New Order first had to figure out how to turn the players into part-time musicians. The answer, they found out, was champagne. Lots of champagne. ""I thought we were rock and roll!"" said Morris. ""There was a huge fridge that you would usually have soft drinks in, a wall fridge, full of champagne. ""We thought, 'Yeah they'll have a couple of bottles.' They demolished it, it was empty. I don't know how many bottles there were, but we would never have gone through it."" Four of the England squad were dispatched to record the song: Barnes, fellow Liverpool stars Steve McMahon and Peter Beardsley, plus Tottenham's Paul Gascoigne. Beardsley, Gascoigne and McMahon all spoke with broad northern English accents, leaving Jamaica-born Barnes as the man who would rap his way into the hearts of football fans. ""With a Scouser (a nickname for someone from Liverpool) and two Geordies (someone from Newcastle), there was only one person who was going to do the rap,"" jokes Barnes. Gazza's tears . The song's success was helped by an England team which reached the semifinals of the World Cup for only the second time in its history at Italia '90 -- the nation's best performance since winning the trophy at home 24 years earlier. A last-gasp win over Belgium in the round of 16 and a come-from-behind quarterfinal victory over Cameroon sparked a rush of renewed enthusiasm and patriotism through a country rebuilding its relationship with the national game. An agonizing penalty shootout defeat to West Germany broke English hearts, with team talisman Gascoigne bursting into tears when he picked up a yellow card which would have ruled him out of the final. As Gascoigne wept, millions cried with him, but once eyes had dried England could reflect on its most successful World Cup campaign on foreign soil. The performance of the ""Three Lions"" reignited the country's passion for football, thanks in no small part to New Order and a song which helped redefine the image of the sport in England. The Hillsborough Stadium disaster of 1989 had killed 96 fans, while a fire at the Valley Parade stadium in Bradford was responsible for the deaths of 56 people four years previously. The Heysel Stadium tragedy in Brussels, which occurred during the 1985 European Cup final between Liverpool and Juventus, had killed 39 people and led to the expulsion of English clubs from continental competition for five years. The sport needed a makeover, one which the members of New Order were happy to provide. ""I don't know whether you can say it was entirely down to 'World in Motion,' but I think it did come at a bit of a turning point for football,"" recalls Morris. ""I think up until that point it was all very laddish and after 'World in Motion' everybody got a bit loved-up with it. ""Love is a universal thing, so is football."" Lasting legacy . Twenty-four years on the song is mostly remembered for Barnes' rap; even England fans who weren't alive in 1990 can recite his immortal words. But the 50-year-old is quick to pay tribute to New Order, a band that breathed life into a staid and cliched musical genre at a time when the British dance music scene was exploding. ""Every time the World Cup comes around people talk about it, which shows how iconic the song was,"" says Barnes. ""I actually did it on the beach last week and it was all over YouTube. ""In 1990 we captured the imagination of the public, so of course the song went to No. 1. If we'd have got knocked out in the first round, it probably wouldn't have. ""It was nice, I got to do it and maybe I got a little kudos from it, but the song was really just a great song by New Order."" Blog: What went wrong for Spain? What's your favorite World Cup song?

"(CNN) -- Presidential libraries always seem to be the center of controversy and debate. Right now a number of cities are competing to host President Barack Obama's library once he leaves office. There will certainly be a flood of stories about the vast fund-raising that will take place to secure money for the building since, according to the laws governing these libraries, the buildings are privately funded. At President Richard Nixon's archive in Yorba Linda, California, there was a heated controversy over the failure to appoint a new director to replace Tim Naftali, a distinguished historian who came into conflict with the library's board for trying to put together an honest presentation for visitors about the Watergate scandal. The Nixon foundation blocked the appointment of Mark Lawrence, a widely respected diplomatic historian at the University of Texas, because of his writing on Vietnam. There is a heated contest currently taking place to decide which city will house Obama's library after his term ends. Applicants from New York, Chicago and Honolulu are among the 13 that are engaged in a competition to win the right to host the museum and archives that will honor Obama's service to the nation. But the most important question about presidential libraries is not where they're located, but how they handle the release and processing of the White House records. This too has been the subject of controversy. According to the law, most presidential records are to be released by 12 years after a president leaves office. Some documents might still be kept secret as a result of matters such as national security concerns. In 2001, President George W. Bush stirred controversy with an executive order giving former presidents much more leeway in restricting papers after the 12-year period ended. The order came under intense criticism from the historical community and public interest advocates. A judge overturned much of the order in 2007, and Bush himself has signed an order encouraging a speedier release of his documents. But delays in the release of some of President Bill Clinton's papers beyond the 12 years have caused more concerns about the power that former chief executives have over these kinds of documents. Some critics have speculated that Obama has allowed for the continued delays to protect Hillary Clinton from questions if she runs for president in 2016. Obama -- who had been critical of Bush's preference when in the White House toward tighter restrictions on presidential papers -- accepted the delays in the release of Clinton's records. He issued an executive order in 2009 that established a 30-day period for a president to review proposals from the National Archives to release the records of a previous president. Under that order, however, an unlimited number of extensions are permissible. There is important legislation pending in the Senate that would curtail how much authority a president has to restrict the release of these records. This kind of legislation is vital since the archives contained in these libraries are a national treasure -- and access to the archives allows scholars and journalists to really examine the history of each White House. With all the controversies that loom over these libraries, the one thing that's unquestionably needed is a speedy release of papers. These archives, which are an essential part of these museums, are incredibly important for our understanding of presidential history and the foundation of our current politics. The presidential library system took form in 1955 with the Presidential Libraries Act. The legislation created a national system of presidential libraries that would be run by the National Archives but privately funded. Congress passed legislation in 1978 that ensured that the official records of each president and his staff would go to the archives rather than remaining private property, as they had been considered before. The findings from the archives have had a huge impact on how we think about many periods in American political history. Democrat Harry Truman, who ended his term in 1952 as a highly unpopular president, has seen his image rebuilt as historians took a close look at his records and found the important role that his administration played in developing our Cold War policies and institutions to contain communism. A president who once looked as if he made one blunder after another came out of the archives looking much more astute and skillful than anyone ever imagined. Republican President Dwight Eisenhower is one of the most famous cases of how a reputation can be transformed. For many years, journalists and scholars thought that Eisenhower was an affable and incredibly popular president, but a leader who was hands-off and allowed his staff to handle most of the major decisions that took place during his term. But the archives proved that the situation was quite different. According to the Princeton presidential scholar Fred Greenstein, the records show that Eisenhower ran a ""hidden hand"" presidency where he was extremely proactive behind the scenes. He consciously allowed the public to think that he was not doing much, so that he could look as if he was standing above the political fray, at the same time that he was very careful in making decisions about party strategy and public policy. Lyndon Johnson is another case in point. For many decades, the assumption about the war in Vietnam was that Johnson and his advisers blindly followed the logic of the domino theory, meaning the notion that if South Vietnam fell to communism other countries would follow. According to this standard account, policymakers could not see the huge mistake they were making and it was virtually inevitable that the U.S. would end up in this protracted war. But slowly that notion of the war has been shattered. The presidential tapes and the archives in Austin, Texas, have revealed that Vietnam was much more of a choice -- a contested choice -- than we ever thought. Through the archives we have learned that many of Johnson's closest advisers, including hawks like Sen. Richard Russell, expressed strong doubts about the necessity of the war and whether it could be won. As the Cornell historian Fred Logevall wrote in his book ""Choosing War,"" for many reasons, including politics and perceptions of his manhood, Johnson eventually chose the path of escalation despite intense opposition. Nixon's archives have been both good and bad for his legacy. On the one hand, the archives have continued to expose all sorts of wrongdoing that took place in his White House. Nixon was every bit as bad as Americans thought at the height of the Watergate scandal. We learned that he was devious, calculating and ruthless. On the other hand, the archives have helped to change and rehabilitate our image of Nixon by demonstrating his extensive accomplishments on foreign and domestic policy. This was an administration that made huge progress on the environment, affirmative action, detente and more. Sometimes the archives don't produce a huge makeover. President Jimmy Carter's archives in Atlanta, for example, which are extensive and provide a terrific look at the behind-the-scenes events of the period, have not erased the negative images people have. The findings have confirmed many of the political missteps and problems that the administration had with Congress and the public. Ronald Reagan, however is a different story. He was once thought of as a lightweight Hollywood actor who walked his way through political power -- like the character from the film ""Being There."" But we have learned that he was much more strategic and thoughtful than most people ever imagined. Transcripts of his radio addresses in the 1970s show how he carefully tailored particular messages and thought through the rhetoric he wanted to use. Minutes from the National Security Council meetings in his presidency reveal a very hands-on and deliberative person, not the caricature that was so popular in the 1980s. We are only starting to learn about George H.W. Bush, whose archives are beginning to be opened to researchers, as well as about Bill Clinton, as the trickle of findings about his presidency has revealed. Historians will be eager to look at the papers of George W. Bush, someone who once was resistant toward releasing records but has now indicated he will have them out sooner than most. Presidential archives are a national treasure and they are absolutely essential to our ability to understand what actually happened during the four or eight years a person was in office. Legislation moving through Congress now would expand access to presidential records and guarantee that the archivists retain the e-mails of executive branch officials. It passed the House in January on a voice vote, and in May, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee sent the bill to the Senate. The legislation would allow for 60 days of review with only one 30-day extension allowed. The legislation also requires the public to be notified of these proposals when they are sent to the White House. Right now they are not public. Congress must keep the pressure on to make the records public, to require that more are digitized and made accessible online, and to ensure that all of this is done as quickly as possible and with as little interference as possible, so that scholars and journalists can look at the records to start evaluating, analyzing, and interpreting what the nation has lived through.

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles may have become famous for many things over the years -- Hollywood and the Oscars to name but two -- but downtown living is not one of them. What big star of the silver screen could resist the lure of suburban mansions in Bel Air and Beverly Hills after all? Now, a host of new city developments aim to change all that. At least half a dozen major real estate projects are underway in the LA's downtown areas and several others are in the works. One of the largest development will see property firm Mack Urban turn a collection of parking lots in the city's South Park district into 1,500 new apartments. ""We anticipate our build out taking between eight to ten years so this is a long term investment and development plan,"" explained Paul Keller, CEO of Mack Urban. The company intends to invest up to $750 million in South Park, enticed by the proximity of the nearby LA Live complex which includes the Staples Center -- home of the Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers, the Nokia Theatre, and several hotels, restaurants and bars. This will attract a clientele who are looking to live, work and play in the same area, Mack Urban hopes. ""What's driving investment and development here in South Park has really been the continuation of a massive investment that AEG (Anschutz Entertainment Group) made beginning with the development of the arena here in downtown,"" said Keller, in reference to the Staples Center. All in all, South Park can expect to see nearly 300,000 square meters (3.2 million square feet) of residential and hospitality living come online by 2020, according to commercial real estate firm JLL. JLL also say land sales in the area now average nearly $500 dollars per square meter ($47 per square feet), more than double what the going rate was just five years ago. International investors like Greenland Group are paying close attention to these numbers. The Chinese real estate investment firm have already spent more than $140 million on a 2.5 acre parking lot that they plan to transform into a massive condominium project called Metropolis. ""We see a lot of opportunity here for education and also for urban living,"" said Ifei Chang, CEO & President, Greenland USA. ""We believe this should be also with the domestic population, it should be an international community here right in the city."" Greenland expects to spend up to a billion dollars on building the Metropolis and expects that projects like theirs -- along with planned infrastructure improvements like the LA streetcar project currently in build -- will make downtown living the next trend in Los Angeles. If the planets biggest movie stars are spotted moving into the South Park district in the coming years, then they can judged to have been correct. See also: Suburbia gone wild .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- For sale: Hong Kong apartment with sweeping sea views and three rooms, all signs of a recent grisly murder in the bathroom eliminated, will take offers between 15-20% below market value. In Hong Kong, where superstitions can make or break a property deal, a real estate advertisement like this is not beyond the realms of the fantastic. With the local property market showing signs of cooling, almost every angle is worked to increase yields, and a trade in so-called haunted houses is now a visible feature of the market. ""There are a group of people that go around and bid on them,"" explains Eric Wong, a realtor with Hong Kong's Squarefoot.com.hk. ""Chinese people, especially in Hong Kong, don't like houses where something unfortunate has happened. See a list of 'haunted houses' at Squarefoot.com.hk . ""This means they can sell for less, which makes the rental yields greater. The normal yields are between 3-4%, but an apartment where there's been a murder can get a yield of about 7%,"" he said. The apartment is then rented to someone who does not share the same set of beliefs -- normally a foreigner -- although some realtors say there are Chinese clients who don't care and one even identifies doctors and nurses 'who are used to working around the dead' as potential tenants. ""It often depends on the circumstances of the death and what stories and rumors are attached to it,"" says Wong. Particularly gruesome murders or harrowing deaths can affect the market price of the whole floor of apartments; in some cases, the entire building. ""There was a bad murder in an apartment block in Quarry Bay in Hong Kong,"" he says. ""A wife killed her husband, cut the body into pieces and placed the parts in dustbins on every floor. Even 15 years later, apartments in that block are still difficult to sell."" For superstitious Hong Kongers, the building is hongza -- a term derived from the Cantonese word hong, meaning violence, murder or calamity, and za meaning residence. Hongza houses can sometimes sell for as low as 40% below the city average, although 15-20% is more usual. Wong says his company recently opened up a section on its website called Haunted House in response to the growing market. ""We were approached by agents who wanted to access this information more conveniently,"" he says. The section, which details government data on unusual deaths and murders in apartment buildings across Hong Kong since 1977, makes for macabre reading. One typical entry for an apartment block in Yuen Long reads: ""36-year-old female secondary school teacher faced a marriage crisis, jumped off the building after sending a text message to her husband."" With all the details rendered in the sparse language of a police log entry, one could be forgiven for thinking that Hong Kong life was a depressing litany of fatal misfortunes. However, realtors say an apartment is more or less hongza, depending on what happened there. ""I have heard of realtors using this list which identifies places from one skull, which is like a fatal accident, to four skulls which is a high-profile murder,"" says Wong. ""But I think it's really an unofficial thing."" One realtor, who did not want to be identified, told CNN that hongza tends to wear off, as the apartment changes hands. ""A subsequent owner will not attract as much bad luck as the first person who buys the flat after someone died there,"" she says. ""Even so they can sometimes sell quickly -- I was just about to sell a hongza house to a client when another agent made a winning offer for a client. ""My client must have missed it by all of half an hour."" Despite their popularity among savvy bargain hunters, apartments where people have met violent or unusual ends are heavily stigmatised and banks will routinely run checks before lending on a hongza house, realtors say. Agents are legally required in Hong Kong to reveal to a buyer whether something has occurred on a property. ""A Lands Department search will show what has happened in an apartment,"" says Wong. ""If we don't reveal that to a buyer they can take action against the agent."" For those with deep pockets, however, and without a willing foreigner to take up a lease, the investment strategy is simply to wait it out. ""Time heals all wounds,"" notes Hong Kong property speculator and blogger Mo Yu-Wen. ""As time goes on, though, fewer and fewer people will remember what happened and the value will go up again.""","Hong Kong people tend to shun houses where the occupant met a violent death .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi forces have tightened security in and around the Shiite holy city of Karbala as tens of thousands of pilgrims pour in ahead of this weekend's culmination of a revered mourning period. Scores of pilgrims -- who make the journey on foot -- have been killed and wounded in recent days in attacks that have been blamed on Sunni extremists, who have routinely targeted the pilgrims. On Thursday, at least two pilgrims were killed and more than a dozen wounded in two attacks south of Baghdad, the Interior Ministry said. In Latifiya, a roadside bomb detonated near Shiite pilgrims walking to the southern city of Karbala, killing at least one pilgrim and wounding six others, the ministry said. In a separate attack, a parked car bomb exploded near the city of Hilla, killing at least one pilgrim and wounding 10 others, the ministry said. The attacks coincide with a political deadlock -- which has the government divided along sectarian lines -- that is raising fears, in the wake of the U.S. military's withdrawal from Iraq, of a return to the sectarian bloodshed that nearly tore the country apart during the height of the war. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki ordered security tightened following a series of attacks on pilgrims. Security forces have sealed roads and increased the number of checkpoints on the main roads leading into the city, a three-day walk south for pilgrims making their way south from Baghdad. The pilgrimage, known as Arbaeen, marks the end of a 40-day mourning period that commemorates the seventh century death of Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed. Hussein was killed during a battle near Karbala for control of the Muslim nation following Mohammed's death in 632. Hussein's death led to a split between Sunni and Shiite Muslims. During Saddam Hussein's rule, the Sunni leader forbade pilgrims from making the journey on foot. He also banned some ritualistic practices. Following the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam, the pilgrimages grew in numbers. This year's pilgrimage comes just weeks after the U.S. military pulled its troops from the country ahead of an end-of-the-year deadline to withdraw. ""We are used to bombings. It is normal for us to face that in our daily life,"" said Said Duraid Mohammed, a pilgrim. ""And for the pilgrimage and Imam Hussein, we are ready to step on the bombs."" Another pilgrim, who identified himself as Mohammed, said he was going to Karbala in spite of the danger. ""We are going to mourn Imam Hussein, even if the terrorists bomb us and kill us,"" he said. ""We are still going."" At least 12 people were killed and more than 50 wounded Monday in car bomb attacks on two predominantly Shiite communities in Baghdad. On January 5, a suicide bomber struck an army checkpoint in the southern city of Nasiriya where pilgrims were gathered, an attack that killed at least 44 people and wounded 70 others.","NEW: Two pilgrims killed and many injured in attacks Thursday .

"(CNN) -- The incidence of soccer supporters hurling bananas as a way of racially abusing top black footballers playing in Europe's major leagues shows no sign of abating. AC Milan defender Kevin Constant and midfielder Nigel de Jong were left raging by the abuse during a Serie A match against Atalanta in northern Italy Sunday, while fellow teammates applauded in a sarcastic manner. Neither Milan or Atalanta were immediately available for comment, while Liga Calcio, which runs Serie A, is expected to make a statement later on Monday. The FIGC, the Italian Football Federation, have opened an investigation and will issue a statement later this week. Sunday's incident came just two weeks after Barcelona's Dani Alves captured the world's attention by eating a banana which had been thrown at him from the crowd during a league game at Villarreal in Spain's top league. The Brazilian's quick thinking was widely acclaimed by anti-racism campaigners and he gained worldwide support through social media. The fan was banned for life by Villarreal after throwing the banana which landed at Alves' feet as he prepared to take a corner. One week after Alves was abused, Levante's Senegalese player Papakouli Diop claimed he had heard monkey chants from Atletico Madrid supporters. His response was to dance in front of his alleged abusers. It's not the first team Constant has been racially taunted. The French-born Guinean player was racially abused during a preseason friendly game against Sassuolo in July. Constant smashed the ball into the stands and walked off the pitch after becoming enraged by racist chanting emanating from a section of supporters. In January 2013, Constant's teammate Kevin Prince Boateng walked off the field of play after being racially abused by a number of fans during a friendly game against Pro Patria with six people hit with two-month prison sentences. In the past the FIGC has been accused of not taking a tough enough stance against racism. In May 2013, the organization was heavily criticized by FIFA president Sepp Blatter after it fined Roma $65,000 following the racial abuse of Milan's Mario Balotelli by the club's fans. ""What is $65,000 for such an incident? I'm not happy and I will call the Italian Federation,"" Blatter told the world governing body's website at the time. ""That's not a way to deal with such matters."" In April 2013, Inter Milan were fined nearly $60,000 by European governing body UEFA after its fans were found guilty of ""improper conduct"" in chants directed towards Tottenham Hotspur striker Emmanuel Adebayor. Two months earlier, Lazio received its fourth charge of racist behavior this season -- with Roma's city rivals having been fined nearly $300,000 after repeated fan transgressions. In May last year, FIFA adopted tougher penalties for racist behavior during its congress in Mauritius. Punishments for first offenses bring a warning, fine or clubs being forced to play games in empty stadiums. A second offense, or one deemed ""serious,"" could result in demotion, a deduction of points or expulsion from a tournament.","AC Milan duo subjected to racist abuse during Milan's game at Atalanta .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Kitty Wells shocked the country music scene when she first sang about honky tonks and cheating husbands 60 years ago, but it propelled her to stardom and blazed a path for the strong female voices that followed. Longtime Atlanta radio host Rhubarb Jones connects today's young female stars directly back to Wells. ""Before Miranda Lambert, there was Reba McEntire,"" Jones said. ""Before Reba there was Loretta Lynn. Before Loretta, there was Patsy Cline. Before Patsy, there was Kitty Wells."" Country mourns loss of 'Queen' Kitty Wells . ""If I had never heard of Kitty Wells, I don't think I would have been a singer myself,"" Lynn said after learning of Wells' death Monday at age 92. ""I wanted to sound just like her, but as far as I am concerned, no one will ever be as great as Kitty Wells."" ""She was a trailblazer for all the women in country music,"" McEntire said Tuesday. Both Lynn and McIntyre called Wells ""my hero."" ""Kitty Wells was the first and only Queen of Country Music, no matter what they call the rest of us,"" Dolly Parton said. ""She was a great inspiration to me as well as every other female singer in the country music business."" Wells was 32 years old and a mother of three in 1952 when she was asked to record ""It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels,"" a response to Hank Thompson's No. 1 hit, ""The Wild Side Of Life."" The song was a defense of women, giving cheating men some of the blame for causing women to stray. ""Too many times married men think they're still single, that has caused many a good girl to go wrong,"" Wells sang. Despite the Grand Ole Opry's refusal to allow her to sing it on the radio broadcast, the record sold a million copies and dominated the country charts in summer 1952. It even crossed over, reaching the 27th spot on Billboard's pop chart. Until then, she had toured as the ""girl singer"" with her husband's band, singing gospel songs and old folk ballads. She later said the $125 fee was her motivation for recording the song, which made her country music's first female superstar. Wells proved women could sell records and fill arenas by singing country songs from a woman's point of view, according to her Recording Academy biography. Her recording career included 35 Billboard Top 10 records and 81 charted singles. ""Her songs resonated with women in an evolving post-war America, and she unassumingly paved the way for other strong female country singers, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, and Tammy Wynette, among others,"" said Neil Portnow, president of the Recording Academy. ""She performed for seven decades, and she continues to be a model for generations of female country singers."" Wells was the first female country singer to get a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which the Recording Academy presented in 1991. She was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1976.

"(Oprah.com) -- Through the years, Wynonna Judd has publicly shared her most painful struggles. ""People walk up to me in airports and say, 'Why did you put your dirty laundry on Oprah?' I said, 'Because I want to be a teacher,'"" she says. ""I'm willing to teach through my mistakes and my victories."" Now, Wynonna hopes to help others by sharing how she survived an unimaginable betrayal. In 2007, Wynonna's then-husband, Daniel Roach, was convicted of attempted aggravated sexual battery against a minor. Wynonna says she was in a public place when she first learned of Roach's arrest. ""I'm literally in an airport on a golf cart, and people are pointing at me, 'Oh, she's the girl on the 5 o' clock news.'"" Once home, Wynonna says she went into ""mama bear mode"" with her own children, Elijah and Grace. ""He was out of the house within the hour,"" she says. ""I called him everything I could think of. I had a moment where I let it all fly, and then it was done."" Five days after Roach's arrest, Wynonna filed for divorce from the man who had once been her bodyguard. The ordeal, Wynonna says, broke her wide open. ""I trusted him with my life, and I didn't want to stop trusting [people],"" she says. ""It's a little tough because once burned, forever fears the fire. I didn't want to be hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."" Though she'll talk about her own pain, Wynonna says she's reluctant to speak about certain aspects of the case out of respect for the child involved. ""This story is so deep and wide. There's more to it than I can tell you,"" she says. ""Because of the child, I won't speak about it. It's their story [to tell] when they're ready to talk."" Still, she admits she did know the child. ""That's what's so scary is that it is someone that you know,"" she says. ""There's a trust there. There's a bond."" Wynonna says she's had to step back from the child and his or her family since the incident. ""They're in the [healing] process, and it's none of my business,"" she says. ""I had to separate from it or it would have killed me. I literally had to physically, emotionally and spiritually literally place them at the feet of Jesus.""

And if you'll let yourself lean into the pain, you'll wake up one day and you'll stop crying and you'll move forward,'"" she says. ""I just had to have faith and believe in someone else because I didn't believe in myself."" Wynonna says Roach struggled with addiction, and her family had to learn to heal from that. ""That saved me, making sure that my children, that we, could break the cycle of addiction,"" she says. ""It's baffling. It's cunning. We are not our diseases."" According to Wynonna, Roach is in recovery. ""He's sober, and that's what matters to me now."" In the end, Wynonna found strength in focusing on what was best for her and her children.

"(CNN) -- Some of my most memorable travels have been abroad. But I can forgo the passport, lack of Wi-Fi, wading through customs and calculating currency exchanges and still experience all my favorite international elements right here in one city: Portland, Oregon. With Portland around, there are few reasons to leave the continental United States for a worldly experience. Portland has a wine region that, according to Departures magazine, is reminiscent of the South of France. The brewery scene proudly earns the title ""beer capital of the world"" and the nickname ""Munich on the Willamette."" And if you're in the mood to travel to the Far East, there's the Lan Su Chinese Garden, an authentically built Ming Dynasty-style garden. For the more domestically minded, there is terrific, tax-free shopping in the Pearl District and along North Mississippi Avenue. The Pearl District is known for cutting-edge art galleries, designer boutiques and Powell's Books, the largest independent used and new bookstore in the world. On North Mississippi Avenue, you can find independent boutiques and a variety of welcoming, low-key yet scrumptious restaurants and bars. Speaking of restaurants, to talk about Portland and not mention the food would be a travesty. My top three culinary takeaways from the city: . 1. Veggie variety: A foodie's nirvana, Portland restaurants offer outstanding farm-to-table dining options, and I personally reveled in the volume of vegetarian fare on Portland menus. 2. Voodoo Doughnut: ""Where the magic is in the hole!"" Voodoo Doughnut is a little slice of heaven on Earth, at least for those of us who never outgrew breakfast cereal and lunch pail food and still fantasize about having sizable helpings of it heaped upon our baked goods. 3. Farmers Market: Be sure to check out the amazing Portland Farmers Market at Portland State University. I can't think of a better way to start a Saturday than an outdoor market filled with fresh-brewed, caffeinated beverages, delicious fruits and nuts and aromatic baked goods. And since no dining experience would be complete without liquid pleasures, it's worth mentioning that many restaurants employ top mixologists to hand-craft cocktails with seasonal fresh ingredients and house-infused spirits. The proverbial icing on the cake is that, while Portland makes it easy to indulge, it also makes it easy to do so without guilt. The city is active and facilitates walking, jogging and biking, providing a plethora of areas and paths to do so. My favorites are those along the Willamette River. Plus, there's endless potential for more adventurous outdoor activities, given the proximity of Mount Hood, the aforementioned Willamette River and the Pacific Coast. (You can only imagine my delight at spotting the rock from ""The Goonies"" along the coastline!) If you're more of a city person, you can use public transit to get around town. Portland has dedicated bus lanes in the clean downtown area, which stays immaculate partially as a function of the ""waste cans"" that not only accommodate trash, but recyclable disposables. It's the most charming of places, and when you visit, you'll think you've died and gone to, well, Portland.","As part of our Destination USA series, we pit rival cities and let you vote on which is best .

"Washington (CNN) -- Bill and Hillary Clinton's seemingly never-ending political careers have had a tremendous impact on at least one person: Monica Lewinsky. The former White House intern, whose sexual relationship with the 42nd President led to his impeachment, will never be able to escape the spotlight -- as long as the Clintons are still in it. As Hillary Clinton mulls another presidential run in 2016, her husband's relationship with Lewinsky has become fodder for her political foes. Possible Republican 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has invoked Lewinsky and Clinton's affair twice in as many months. ""If (Democrats) want to take a position on women's rights, by all means do. But you can't do it and take it from a guy who was using his position of authority to take advantage of young women in the workplace,"" Paul said this past weekend on C-SPAN's ""Newsmakers"" program. And on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" last month, Paul brought up Clinton's ""predatory behavior."" Documents reveal Hillary's private reaction to Bill's cheating scandal with Monica . Asked if Bill Clinton's past should be a consideration in a potential second presidential bid by his wife, Paul said he's ""not saying that,"" but ""sometimes it's hard to separate one from the other."" When it comes to judging Bill Clinton's legacy, however, Paul said the affair should certainly be considered a factor. The conservative Washington Free Beacon first reported on public documents stored at the University of Arkansas library that detail some of Hillary Clinton's discussions with a close friend, Diane Blair, at the time. Clinton told Blair that Lewinsky was a ""narcissistic loony toon."" Blair, who died in 2000, wrote that ""(Hillary) is not trying to excuse (Bill Clinton); it was a huge personal lapse. And she is not taking responsibility for it."" CNN has confirmed the documents are authentic and has reached out to a spokesman for Hillary Clinton, who has not responded. Lewinsky will continue to be part of the Clintons' story. Which leads us to ask -- where is she now? Immediately after Clinton's impeachment, she remained in the spotlight. She worked with author Andrew Morton on a book about her, called ""Monica's Story,"" which was published in March of 1999. She was a spokesperson for Jenny Craig in 1999, according to IMDb, and worked as an American culture reporter for British Channel 5. She launched a handbag design line and then hosted a reality television program in 2003 called ""Mr. Personality."" In the years following her White House internship, she made herself available for media interviews, including with Time magazine and Barbara Walters. But in 2005, she switched gears completely. She moved to London, where she attended the London School of Economics and graduated with a master's degree in social psychology. Her thesis was titled ""In Search of the Impartial Juror: An exploration of the third person effect and pretrial publicity."" Her publicist at the time, Barbara Hutson, said that ""the audience of students and parents erupted in spontaneous applause. ... It was a very emotional moment for her."" But since 2006, Lewinsky has kept an extremely low profile. She stayed in London for a while job searching, and she was seen in New York with friends in 2009. Hutson, who no longer represents Lewinsky, told CNN that she's ""trying to lead a private live,"" but she promised that she would forward our request for comment. In 2012, however, reports surfaced of a $12 million book deal. If they're true, Lewinsky's life in the shadows might come to an end. According to the New York Post, she was shopping a juicy, tell-all book proposal around to publishers. If such a book were released soon, before 2016, it could be the second time Lewinsky has a major political impact on the Clintons. Will Bill Clinton be a help or a hindrance if his wife runs for president again?","Nearly 20 years later, Lewinsky scandal has become fodder for Hillary Clinton's political foes .

"Washington (CNN) -- North Korea's missile maneuvering has raised the question of how the United States should respond, with some in Congress calling for shooting down anything that goes up. The issue gained new urgency on Thursday with the disclosure that a Pentagon intelligence assessment suggested North Korea may have developed the ability to fire a nuclear-tipped missile at its foes. It was the clearest acknowledgment to date by the United States about potential advances in North Korea's nuclear program, and came amid heightened concerns over recent threats by Pyongyang of attacks against South Korea and even U.S. territory. At a background briefing on Friday, a Republican member of Congress called the assessment of possible nuclear missile capability old news that first came out in 2011. However, the legislator said even a remote chance that a North Korean missile could be carrying a nuclear warhead means the United States should intercept it instead of waiting to find out. 5 things we still don't know about North Korea's nukes . Hawkish Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, endorsed such a response earlier this week, saying that if North Korea launched a missile, ""we should take it out."" ""It's best to show them what some of our capabilities are,"" McCain told Foreign Policy's The Cable in remarks that his office confirmed as accurate. Adm. Samuel Locklear, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee this week that the United States has the capability to shoot down a North Korean missile. While U.S. officials do not specify, a combination of sea and land-based defense systems could be used to intercept a North Korean missile. The Pentagon has announced plans to increase radar detection and land-based missile defense capabilities in Asia in coming months and years. Under questioning by McCain, Locklear advised against automatically intercepting any North Korean missile, saying the United States also had the ability to determine its trajectory and destination before making a decision to bring it down. Nuclear North Korea unacceptable, Kerry says . ""We should have a sense of where it's going to be aimed,"" Locklear said. ""If we don't, it doesn't take long for us to determine where it's going and where it's going to land."" To CNN's Fareed Zakaria, an automatic response to shoot down any North Korean missile would be ""precisely the wrong"" approach. ""It would be a kind of silly tit-for-tat that would escalate in an entirely unpredictable manner,"" Zakaria said this week. ""I think it would be a kind of hot-headed response, when what we need right now are calm and steady nerves."" However, the congressional Republican at Friday's briefing said shooting down any North Korean missile would send a strong message that the United States had limits to its patience in dealing with Pyongyang, and would also demonstrate the ability to counter-act such provocative and potentially catastrophic steps. A declassified portion of the Pentagon intelligence report concluded with ""moderate confidence"" that North Korea had the ability to deliver a nuclear weapon with a ballistic missile, though the reliability was believed to be ""low."" The White House made clear Friday that the government doesn't believe North Korea has the capability mentioned in the Pentagon document, with spokesman Jay Carney telling reporters: ""It is our assessment that North Korea has not demonstrated the capability to deploy a nuclear-armed missile."" Carney's comment was similar to a statement by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who concurred with a Defense Department response that ""it would be inaccurate to suggest that the North Korean regime has fully developed and tested the kinds of nuclear weapons referenced in the passage"" of the Defense Intelligence Agency assessment made public on Thursday. Clapper, the nation's top intelligence official, also said the information from the DIA assessment was ""not an Intelligence community assessment."" Opinion: Why I fled North Korea . ""Moreover, North Korea has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear armed missile,"" Clapper's statement concluded. The GOP member of Congress described Clapper's statement as carefully worded and noted the final sentence indicated North Korea was on its way to nuclear missile capability, even if it had yet to prove it could execute a successful launch. Carney offered a similar assessment Friday, telling reporters that North Korea had demonstrated nuclear capability and missile capability. ""While it might sound simple, it is not surely simple to take the next step,"" Carney said. ""But make no mistake, the North Koreans have thus far demonstrated a desire to continue along this path."" Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday in South Korea that despite the DIA assessment, it would be inaccurate to suggest North Korea can launch a nuclear-armed missile. ""Obviously they have conducted a nuclear test, so there's some kind of device,"" Kerry said in reference to three underground nuclear weapons tests by North Korea since 2006. ""But that is very different from miniaturization and delivery and from tested delivery and other things."" North Korea has unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the United States and South Korea in recent weeks, including the possibility of a nuclear strike. Any missile launch by North Korea would be a ""huge mistake,"" Kerry added as a warning to the nation's young leader. ""If Kim Jong Un decides to launch a missile, whether it's across the Sea of Japan or in some other direction, he will be choosing willfully to ignore the entire international community, his own obligations that he has accepted, and it will be a provocative and unwanted act that will raise people's temperature with respect to this issue,"" Kerry said. The United States was prepared to enter into talks with the North, but only if Pyongyang was serious about negotiating the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, according to Kerry. ""North Korea will not be accepted as a nuclear power,"" he told a news conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Yun Byung-se. U.S. officials say China is growing more concerned about the North's provocations, but it also is closely watching Washington's latest military moves in the region. The GOP legislator at Friday's briefing said China has the ability to quickly impact North Korea, which depends on Beijing for aid to keep it solvent. In particular, China could cut off black market supplies of fuel and food across North Korea's northern border, or shut down an oil pipeline between the countries, the legislator said. CNN's Barbara Starr, Jill Dougherty, Jethro Mullen and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.","Sen. McCain says show the North Koreans we can stop whatever they send .

"(CNN) -- As millions of Americans think about how they can do better in 2014 through their New Year resolutions, President Obama might want to make a few of his own. Although it is true that the president has faced a horrendous political environment -- filled with tea party Republicans intent on obstructing every proposal and media that are often too willing to report dubious facts -- Obama has not made his situation much easier for himself. In a number of areas, he might think about strategies that can improve his political standing and put him in a better position for the political fights over immigration, the budget, climate change and foreign policy that loom ahead. Treat your Democrats well: President Obama has not taken enough care of Democrats on Capitol Hill. Throughout the year, Democrats have continued to express frustration with the White House for putting them into extraordinarily difficult political situations and sometimes leaving them to stand alone as they face the fallout. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was reportedly angry with the president for failing to give his caucus any credit for helping him to get out of the jam with the health care website. ""I did communicate to him,"" Reid told The Hill, ""that there have been things done by the White House that improved the health care bill, and those fixes were suggested originally by my senators, and they got no credit for it. I thought that was improper."" Last week, House Democrat John Lewis criticized the administration for not listening to the advice of civil rights leaders regarding appointments for the federal bench in Georgia. This story fits a familiar pattern that has created ongoing tensions with Capitol Hill since 2009. Obama needs to remember that his fate is closely tied to the Democrats on Capitol Hill -- Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi should be his best friends -- and he needs them to help him in his struggles with Republicans. Sweat the small stuff: There is considerable evidence that President Obama seems uninterested with detail. His major concern is in the big picture, trying to find ways to achieve his long-term policy goals, whether that be a diplomatic solution to the nuclear buildup in the Middle East or achieving health care reform, without as much interest in the nitty-gritty of how these policies will happen. It is true that any president needs to keep his eye on the big picture in order to avoid the fate of President Jimmy Carter, who became so mired in the minutiae of policy that he lost his ability to lead the nation through crisis. But as former Secretary of State Colin Powell says in his famous presentation about leadership, ""Check the small things. The devil is in the details; sometimes the solution to a sticky problem, too. Don't sweat the small stuff, but don't ignore it, either."" The dangers of President Obama's approach became apparent with the rollout of health care reform, in which the president and his team were not on top of the details of implementation in the weeks leading up to the launch of the website, and they allowed technical mistakes to turn into a huge political fiasco. The continual delays over implementing other parts of the program have also caused huge embarrassment and offered fodder to his political enemies. The President can't afford for this to happen again. He will need to hold more of his staff accountable for these kinds of mistakes, bringing in some fresh voices, as he has done with John Podesta, and getting rid of those who have made huge mistakes. He needs to realize that making sure that the small stuff is in order is essential to big achievements. Control the conversation: For a president who is as professorial as Barack Obama, it is difficult to accept the harsh reality of the media world within which Washington operates. It is an environment where spurious information goes viral and political rhetoric appears as fact. The blogosphere makes it difficult for producers and editors to control the flow of information, while the plethora of partisan reporting and commentary makes it nearly impossible for consumers of the news to separate fact from fiction. President Obama's outlook has been to sit back and allow the truth to find its way to the surface. He has maintained a steadfast determination that, given the facts, Americans will reach the right decision. But in our political world, this just doesn't happen. The result has been that his opponents have been remarkably effective at shaping the national dialogue over public policy. President Obama has been forced to constantly play defense, to explain his failures and to dig himself out of holes rather than spending time talking about what he has done and what else he hopes to accomplish. Re-energize the grass roots: When Obama started on his road to the White House, he thrived on the energy and support he received from average Americans who were inspired by his call for a new kind of politics and his determination to have a campaign that was built from the bottom up. The local networks of campaign supporters spread the word about who this candidate was while raising money and motivating voters to line up behind his campaign. The enthusiasm and energy of his grass-roots supporters have grown weak. Many of his supporters have become disillusioned with a president who seemed far too much like other politicians and who abandoned some of his key promises in areas like national security. The revelations about the NSA surveillance program were a huge blow to these constituencies. This is most notable with younger Americans, once enamored with the president but now disillusioned by broken promises on issues such as civil liberties and a still-difficult economy. With the 2014 midterms as a focal point, the President should get back to communicating with grass-roots Americans and shaping the agenda of his final years in office based on some of the issues they feel have been sidetracked in the past few years. Focus, focus, focus: Over the past year, the President has frequently moved from one subject to another without a clear rhyme or reason. One of the few areas where a president has control is over his or her own agenda. During the President's first few years, he had a laser-like focus on health care, financial reform and the economy. On foreign policy, he spoke to the world about improving America's relations overseas. That kind of focus, however, has largely disappeared. President Obama has delivered some important speeches, such as his address on inequality, but quickly moved on to other issues rather than follow through. Throughout the battles over the budget, the president turned from one crisis to the next without stopping and really putting forth a clear vision and set of priorities in response to the austerity zeal of the GOP. He has allowed his opponents to define the agenda, as opposed to the White House. Even when Secretary of State John Kerry moved aggressively to put into place diplomatic solutions to nuclear threats, President Obama seemed to follow his lead rather than outline this as a priority in foreign affairs. Obama would do well to stick to a few subjects, to articulate the direction he hopes to take the nation and move forward methodically to make sure they come to fruition. Resolutions are easy to make but difficult to follow. In the world of politics, the stakes of sticking with those promises are big. Given the tremendous difficulties that this president has faced and the dire approval ratings he is seeing, it is time for President Obama to double down and make certain that he does everything possible to put himself in a position to strengthen his presidency, his party and his nation in his final years in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: President Obama should adopt resolutions for 2014 .

"(CNN) -- Acting Veterans Affairs Secretary Sloan Gibson, visiting the Phoenix VA facility where a report found 1,700 veterans were left off waiting lists, said Thursday that changes there signal the beginning of needed reforms. The VA has contacted the veterans cited in an internal report and has begun to schedule appointments, Gibson said. ""Getting this right is our top priority, and taking care of the veterans here in Phoenix is a good place to start,"" he said. The Veterans Affairs scandal has mushroomed since CNN first reported last November on allegations of alarming shortcomings within the VA medical care system that potentially had deadly consequences in dozens of cases. The most disturbing and striking problems emerged in Arizona last month, with sources revealing to CNN details of a secret waiting list for treatment. According to the sources, at least 40 veterans died while waiting for care at the Phoenix medical center. The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care. Gibson said the results of a nationwide audit and numbers from patient wait data will be released on Monday and will show how systemic problems are at the agency. The VA is looking to contract with non-VA medical-care providers in the Phoenix area to assist with primary care, he said, and is sending three mobile units. Gibson said that the VA will hire temporary workers to ensure veterans get the care they deserve. He also announced the department has suspended bonuses for senior executives for the financial year. ""Additionally, we will remove the 14-day scheduling goal from employee performance contracts to eliminate any incentives to engage in inappropriate behavior,"" he said. In some cases, wait times were manipulated to meet employee performance goals needed for bonuses, two VA reports revealed. Gibson replaced Eric Shinseki, who resigned last week. Were bonuses tied to VA wait times? Here's what we know . The announced changes come the same day Senate negotiators reached a deal -- which will have to be approved by the full Senate -- on a bill that would approve the building of new VA facilities, bring about the hiring of more doctors and nurses and allow veterans in rural areas to go to non-VA doctors. It should go to the Senate floor next week, according to aides. Senate reaches deal on VA bill .","VA is contacting 1,700 veterans in Phoenix to schedule appointments .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- A high-profile terrorism trial for an Indonesian man accused of assembling the bombs used in the 2002 Bali attack got under way Monday in Jakarta. The defendant, Umar Patek, faces charges including premeditated murder, and a maximum penalty of death if convicted. The bombings on the Indonesian resort island of Bali killed 202 people, including foreign tourists. Patek also faces charges of bringing in illegal weapons; giving weapons and explosives training; and planning and assembling explosives for church bombings in Jakarta in 2000. The 44-year-old Patek was one of Indonesia's most wanted terrorists, with a $1 million bounty on his head from the U.S. government's ""Rewards for Justice"" program. After almost a decade on the run, Patek was arrested on January 25, 2011, in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A few months after his capture, U.S. Navy SEALs found and killed al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in the Pakistani city. Patek was extradited to Indonesia in August. Abbottabad: The military town where bin Laden hid in plain sight . He arrived at the court building Monday in an armored vehicle at the start of a trial that is expected to last months. He smiled as he descended from the vehicle in handcuffs and walked past cameramen and photographers into a holding cell. The court session Monday lasted less than two hours after Patek's lawyers asked for another week to respond to the charges. The defense team criticized the charges as being vague. ""In many ways, how he was linked to terrorism, and how it was classified as premeditated murder -- I think for the defense team, the charges are disproportionate and too far from the truth,"" said Husni Syaifuddin, one of the defense lawyers. Indonesian authorities allege that Patek admitted his role in the Bali attacks to investigators, saying he helped assemble the explosives. Noor Huda Ismail, an Indonesian terrorism expert, told CNN that Patek's detention and trial ""should go beyond the Bali bombings."" ""Umar Patek is a gold mine of information for security authorities, not only here in Indonesia, but also in Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines. He has valuable information about the extent of the network, who are the people moving from one place to another and how they're doing it,"" Ismail said. Ismail said Patek also may give clues on the ties between the region's militants and international terror networks such as al Qaeda. ""It may be no coincidence that Patek was found in the same village where bin Laden was living,"" Ismail said. Patek is one of the last figures associated with a splinter group of the terror network Jemaah Islamiyah, responsible for the Bali bombings and other major attacks on Indonesian soil. Many in that group, like Patek, trained and fought in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the early 1990s and were deeply influenced by bin Laden's teachings. Three of the masterminds of the Bali bombings -- Imam Samudra, Amrozi bin Nurhasyim and Ali Ghufron -- were executed in 2008. Patek fled to Mindanao in the southern Philippines with several other Indonesian militants. One of them was Dulmatin, another former JI member, who returned to Indonesia and helped set up a military-style training camp in province of Aceh. He was killed in a police raid, just outside Jakarta in October 2010. Patek is also charged with failing to disclose knowledge he had about the militant training camp. According to Ismail, Patek refused an offer to train at the camp and instead chose to leave for Pakistan and Afghanistan. Indonesian authorities have tried and convicted hundreds of terrorists since the 2002 bombing. The arrests of senior militants with combat experience have weakened the terror network and its capability to launch major attacks. According to recent reports by the International Crisis Group, the terror threat in the country remains but has shifted to attacks on Indonesian authorities, with smaller groups or radicalized individuals targeting the police.","Umar Patek has been one of Indonesia's most wanted terrorists .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- We are still living in Woodrow Wilson's America, says A. Scott Berg -- for better or for worse. It's not just the income tax and Federal Reserve, cornerstones of the financial system that were put into place during Wilson's administration. By aggressively meeting with Congress and fighting for legislation, Wilson gave the executive branch new power. It was under Wilson that the State of the Union address became a major speech to Congress. It was Wilson who began the modern presidential press conference. And it was Wilson who, by stating that ""the world must be made safe for democracy,"" established the United States as an outward-looking, internationalist state. ""Every incursion America has had in the last 100 years has been based on that,"" says Berg, relaxing in an Atlanta hotel restaurant. Even the debt ceiling is a remnant of the Wilson era, having been first enacted as a measure during World War I. Other biographies have focused on Wilson the statesman and president. In his new biography, ""Wilson,"" Berg wanted to humanize the man who was president from 1913 to 1921. ""I've not seen a book that I felt had captured the essence of the man,"" he says. ""All the books are filled with his deeds, but not about the person behind those deeds. So the attempt was to write a genuinely personal biography of Woodrow Wilson."" That meant wading into some roiling waters. Wilson was once hailed as an American exemplar for his intellect -- he was president of Princeton for several years -- and for his progressive politics. But his reputation has suffered in recent years because of his racial policies and suppression of free speech. Once ranked among the five greatest presidents, he's since fallen out of the top 10 at times, though in recent years he's moved back up. But the 28th president has long been a particular passion for Berg, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his 1999 biography of Charles Lindbergh. ""I've long had an interest in Wilson, going back to my teenage years,"" he says. ""He's just somebody who's never failed to interest me."" CNN spoke to Berg about Wilson's political savvy, his personality and some of the myths surrounding the man. The following is an edited and condensed version of the interview: . CNN: Your take on Wilson is sympathetic, despite his thoughts on race. He was born before the Civil War and raised in the Reconstruction and Jim Crow South. Was he a man of his time? A. Scott Berg: I think he was much more enlightened than many of his countrymen. But he knew the darkness of the Southern spirit when it came to race, and I honestly believe he felt the country was not ready to integrate. On top of that, he had a political agenda as well. He knew he could not pass his progressive agenda without the complete backing of the bloc of Southern Democrats, who made up a third of the legislature. He needed that as a base. CNN: I always thought of Wilson as humorless. But you reveal there are some deep emotions there, and some wit. Berg: There are a couple of scenes that are so moving to me. Everybody writes about Wilson going to Congress and asking for a declaration of war. He gives an incredible speech, and the place goes wild. But most biographies leave out the next moment: Wilson and (his wife) Edith get in the car and drive back to the White House in silence. Wilson goes into his office, puts his head on a table and sobs. The bookend of that is a few years later when he's in Paris, concluding the peace agreement on Memorial Day of 1919, Wilson gives a speech about the American soldiers buried there. In essence he says, I killed them, and that's why I have to go home and fight for this League of Nations, so that no mother will ever have to bury her son again. I can't name another President who has copped to war deaths. They really moved him. He has the melancholy of Lincoln. CNN: He did have high-minded ideals. He knew about the rough-and-tumble of politics, but he seemed caught up short when he had to immerse himself in it. Berg: A little. Although he proved to have pretty sharp elbows -- and he had the power of oratory. He really knew how to use that. He was always the smartest man in the room, so he could lord that over people as well. CNN: When you started this a decade ago, you had no idea that Barack Obama was coming down the pike -- another professorial type, a powerful orator with little political experience who had a sudden rise to the presidency. Do you think there are comparisons to be made? Berg: I think Wilson was intrepid. He used his lack of Washington background as a great tool and used his knowledge of the Constitution and the way the government worked -- or should work -- to his advantage. A few months ago, I wrote an open letter to Obama, which (recommended he) take some pages from the Wilson playbook. CNN: Wilson has been credited with -- or blamed for -- the idea of the modern imperial presidency. Before, power had been in the hands of Congress. Berg: That drove him crazy. He felt that was not the founders' intention. He also felt that Congress had accrued too much power and it had also had become corrupt. Wilson really wanted to level the playing field for Americans, and he wanted to provide a genuine balance of power. CNN: You write that the story about Wilson and ""Birth of a Nation"" -- that he described it as ""history writ by lightning"" -- is false. Berg: It's one of the great myths. Wilson wasn't even there for the whole screening. He knew how incendiary it was. CNN: Another rumor is that his wife, Edith Wilson, ran the presidency after his 1919 stroke, but from the book it seems like she deferred whenever possible. Berg: Mrs. Wilson said she was nothing more than a steward. I think she's something more than that, but she was no Lady Macbeth. It was not a power grab for herself. It was really all to keep her husband healthy and alive. CNN: And after leaving office, despite his severely weakened condition, Wilson still had fantasies of returning to the White House. Berg: They weren't fantasies. He was planning it. It was a genuine mental condition, probably as a result of the stroke. CNN:  Franklin Roosevelt, who served under him, drew lessons from Wilson. Berg: There's a scene where James Cox and FDR are running in 1920 (as the Democratic ticket) and they pay a visit to the Wilson White House, and FDR can't believe what has happened to this man. But you can see him recording it all. The whole FDR demeanor in office -- robust, look straight ahead -- he takes from Wilson. I suggest a baton being passed at the end of the book. CNN: Did you come out of this experience with greater admiration for Woodrow Wilson? Berg: I come out with greater admiration, and also greater frustration, and also occasional detestation. He is a giant of the century. He just changed everything. All that being said, the deeper I got into the racial issue, and the suppression of free speech, the more I really disliked him. And ultimately, you can't romanticize what happened with the League (which the U.S. never joined). I think he did himself in, stabbed himself in the heart by not giving an inch. He had numerous opportunities to make small compromises, and he just wouldn't do it.","Woodrow Wilson established many federal institutions we take for granted .

"(CNN) -- Energy ministers at Wednesday's OPEC meeting in Vienna agreed to maintain oil production levels, after negotiating in the shadow of flaring violence in the second-biggest city of Iraq, one of the consortium's key producers. More than 500,000 citizens have fled Mosul as extremist militants overrun the town. The impact of the insurgency has so far been limited, but a drive into the deep south, around Basra, or further into the Kurdish region, could quickly alter the dynamics of the oil market. The OPEC agenda has also been destabilized by complications on the path to an agreement between world powers and Iran over its nuclear program. Further, chaos continues to reign in Eastern Libya, which has brought down the country's production to an eighth of its pre-war average of 1.6 million barrels a day. OPEC agreed to keep production at 30 million barrels a day, despite rising production from Iraq and Iran. They will meet again in Vienna in November. In a statement, OPEC said member countries affirmed they would ""if required, take steps to ensure market balance which is so important to world economic activity."" Further, they ""reiterated their willingness to firmly respond to developments that might jeopardize oil market stability."" Strategists say the cartel's traditional swing producer Saudi Arabia (the one that balances market demand for OPEC crude) may need to step in to produce a record 11 million barrels a day to fill a potential void. The Kingdom moved to increase production capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day when the former government in Iran threatened to chock off exports through the Strait of Hormuz. The situation could be much worse for the group that produces about 40% of the world's daily oil output. These countries -- dominated by the major players of the Middle East -- have enjoyed triple digit oil prices, meaning $100 or more, for three years. This has kept export revenues within OPEC above $1 trillion since 2011. So far, we are witnessing the same scenario playing out in 2014. Four investment banks raised their annual forecasts for North Sea Brent based on the uncertainty that prevails over supply. At the same time, Paris-based think tank the International Energy Agency said that OPEC production would need to rise in the second half since inventories for April were at their lowest level since 2008. That amounts to a 180 degree turn in sentiment from the last time OPEC members convened in December. With North American output at a 30-year high as a result of the shale oil and gas boom, many expected OPEC members to be vying amongst themselves for global market share. The Middle East uncertainty is allowing OPEC to delay tough decisions. Long-time rivals Iran and Iraq both say they will take production to four million barrels a day in 2015, if geo-politics and violence do not stand in the way. But all eyes will remain on Iraq, and the insurgency. So far, the real oil bounty has not been hit. Andrey Kuzyaev, president of Lukoil Overseas, the Russian oil group told me in an interview back in April ""to date we had zero cases of kidnappings and zero terrorist attacks."" The company plans to move forward with an estimated investment of $36 billion in the West Qurna field near Basra in southern Iraq. But the situation remains fluid. The Iraqi government was hoping to boost production in Kirkuk, near where the violence has broken out, from its recent low of 260 thousand barrels a day. Those plans seem to be in jeopardy as the insurgence spreads. The siege of Mosul: What's happening? Why is it significant? More from John Defterios: Investors welcome el-Sisi .

"Washington (CNN) -- There was good news and bad news Thursday at a congressional hearing on the embattled Veterans Affairs health care system. Politicians, health care experts and a VA official agreed solutions exist, but more than three hours of questioning by the House Veterans' Affairs Committee showed that responses so far by Congress and the administration fall short of what's needed. ""It's going to take wholesale, systematic reform of the entire department,"" said Republican Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, the committee chairman. ""It's very clear the status quo is not acceptable and it's time for real change."" Dr. Robert Jesse, a top official in the VA health administration, also acknowledged the need for major changes after revelations first reported by CNN of sometimes deadly waits for medical care faced by veterans. ""We own this"" ""We know that we have let veterans down, but we're going to make it right,"" Jesse told the panel, adding that ""you all deserve better from us."" Declaring that ""we own this"" and ""we're going to fix it,"" he later said: ""Today we really need to be looking at the entire structure of the organization to move forward. We really need to examine everything."" An internal VA audit released Monday found that tens of thousands of newly returning veterans wait at least 90 days for medical care, while even more who signed up in the VA system over the past 10 years never got an immediate appointment they requested. The VA has acknowledged 23 deaths nationwide due to delayed care, and CNN's reporting uncovered the deaths of dozens of others who were waiting for VA care in Phoenix. Despite efforts in recent years to address longstanding problems at the department, including reductions in backlogs for benefits and the number of homeless veterans, the long waits have continued for newly enrolled veterans to get initial appointments for care. Reasons for the chronic problems include the increasing number of veterans returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and a bonus system that rewarded managers for meeting goals regarding access to treatment. The VA audit confirmed CNN reports of secret wait lists used to cover up wait times that exceeded department guidelines. The controversy led to the resignation of Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki, while some VA officials have been put on administrative leave pending investigations by the VA inspector general's office and Congress. FBI getting involved . On Wednesday, the FBI said it opened a criminal investigation of the VA in conjunction with the inspector general's probe, which has expanded to 69 facilities. ""At the department's direction, the FBI has instructed agents in its Phoenix office to conduct an investigation into the allegations related to the VA,"" a Justice Department spokesman said. ""Federal prosecutors will be working with these investigators to determine whether there is a basis for criminal charges."" Meanwhile, both the House and Senate have passed legislation to permit veterans experiencing long wait times for medical appointments to seek care at non-VA facilities at the government's expense. They now will negotiate a compromise between differences in the two measures. Interim Veterans Affairs Secretary Sloan Gibson, who took over when Shinseki stepped down, also has announced a series of steps in response to the problems. They include a hiring freeze at central headquarters and 21 regional facilities, suspension of all performance awards for senior managers in fiscal year 2014, eliminating an unattainable goal of getting newly enrolled veterans an appointment within 14 days, and ordering an independent outside audit of VA medical care scheduling practices across the system. The VA also has contacted 50,000 veterans waiting for care and will continue reaching out to others, Gibson said after the release of the VA internal audit. Health care audits told the House committee on Thursday that such steps, while welcome, failed to address the underlying need for systemic reforms at the VA to instill a culture of serving the veterans, rather than the bureaucracy. Outside cultural assessment . ""There is a pervasive VA culture that puts personal gain in the system ahead of veterans. That's wrong,"" said Tim McClain, president of Humana Government Business. Saying more than ""band-aids"" were needed, McClain added that ""any long-term solution must include a culture and organizational assessment from the outside."" Betsy McCaughey, a conservative health care activist known for her opposition to President Barack Obama's health care reforms, complained the Senate legislation included provisions that would undermine the intended goal of letting veterans access civilian medical facilities. McCaughey, the former lieutenant governor of New York, pointed out that veterans would need to prove they had experienced unacceptable waits for VA care, and that any private doctor treating them would have to first call the VA for authorization. Noting the bureaucratic dysfunction at the department, she said: ""Good luck getting anybody to answer that call."" Jesse, the VA's acting under secretary for health, insisted the VA had the capacity to handle the system proposed in the Senate legislation, though he acknowledged that problems occurred at some facilities. The VA legislation was moving quickly through Congress, showing the political sensitivity of the issue in an election year defined by partisan divide. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi signaled Thursday that a final compromise must leave intact the government role of providing health care for veterans instead of privatizing it, as sought by GOP conservatives.

"(CNN) -- Imagine that Ted Cruz became the GOP nominee for president in 2016, running against Hillary Clinton. And now imagine that he won the general election in a landslide, getting record-high vote percentage for the Republicans and capturing states and constituencies the GOP had not won for decades. That seemingly unlikely scenario is the rough equivalent of what happened in India last week, when Narendra Modi, head of India's conservative, pro-business Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, and bÃªte noire among the Delhi and Mumbai smart sets, led his coalition to the best general election performance in India in three decades. Modi will lead India's first majority government not run by the Congress party, which has ruled India for the vast majority of its 67 years of Independence. While Modi's electoral success first and foremost has implications for India, it has broader lessons to teach as well, ones that Republicans might do well to heed as they attempt to develop a working majority in America's own increasingly multicultural democracy, which, however fractious, pales in comparison to the complex vagaries of Indian politics. That Modi has managed to create a broad conservative and pro-market parliamentary majority in a country with more than 1.2 billion people, numerous ethnic groups, thousands of castes, and 22 official languages is, to say the least, no small feat. To understand Modi, and the implications of his victory for American conservatives, one must begin by understanding the existing social and political landscape of Indian elites. The Congress Party, which for decades has championed welfare programs and central planning as its economic identity, has long been India's ""natural"" ruling party. Congress is more internationalist in its origins, and is favored by India's upper classes and intelligentsia. The BJP, meanwhile, is the party of the Hindu heartland, culturally and religiously conservative, and generally speaking, far more supportive of the free market than Congress. The BJP is also supported by businessmen and industrialists, and increasingly, India's rising middle class. In fashionable drawing rooms of Delhi, the BJP is frequently treated with dismissal and derision, similar to that faced by Republicans from the Hamptons to Hollywood. It is a measure of elites' continued control of India's image in both the national and international media, that Modi was regularly referred to in the media as ""divisive"" even after winning a popular mandate unprecedented in the last several decades. So how did Modi, long dismissed as unelectable, manage to win an unprecedented electoral mandate for his conservative party without compromising on his principles, and what can the GOP learn from him? First, he embraced populist conservative themes consistently against his entitled and out-of-touch opponent, Rahul Gandhi, who claimed to speak for India's common man while living a life of luxury. Modi regularly mocked Gandhi, drawing attention to his role as the scion of a political dynasty that has ruled India dating back to his great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru. As long as the GOP faces Hillary Clinton and nominates someone without the last name Bush, it will have a compelling similar story to tell. Potential candidates like Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal, both children of immigrants, will provide a welcome contrast to the privileged daughter of Wellesley and wife of the former President . On economics, in the face of a Congress Party that endlessly discussed continued expansion of India's notoriously corrupt and inefficient safety net, Modi relentlessly focused on growth and economic opportunity. His positive message was about growing the pie, not sharing the crumbs, and could have been taken out of the playbook of free market conservatives from Jack Kemp to Ronald Reagan. Furthermore, Modi's electoral wave decimated the Communist parties in India, which have long been a powerful national force and now find themselves with just 10 seats in the 543-seat Lok Sabha, India's most powerful legislative body. Modi referred many times to his successful leadership of more than a decade of the Indian state of Gujarat, where numerous Indian and international businessmen testified to the way Modi's government streamlined regulations, cut through India's notorious red tape, and put people to work. Compared to other Indian states, Gujarat's governance was known for its efficiency and probity. Conservative economic reformers from Paul Ryan to Scott Walker can take lessons from Modi's successful challenge to the establishment. Throughout his career, Modi has also been an unapologetic social conservative. His political origins are in the RSS, a group that would be considered nationalist Hindu fundamentalists (somewhat politically analogous to conservative evangelical Christians in the United States). But while not backing down at all from his views during the campaign, he did not make them the focus of his effortâ€”and in India as in America, focus and message matters. Indians, like Americans, were most focused on the economy, and for that reason, Modi's campaign made sure he was, too. Republican cultural and religious conservatives could do well to study Modi's campaign tactics for winning with unapologetic social conservatism without scaring off moderate voters. Also notably, though Modi comes from a low-caste background in a country in which it is often said that ""people do not cast their vote they vote their caste,"" he didn't play the ""caste card,"" nor did he allow it to be played against him. Instead, he dramatically expanded the BJP's appeal beyond its traditional upper-caste base, and in the process, he decimated the electoral clout of corrupt caste-based hucksters who have typically wielded heavy influence in North India's Hindu heartland. Modi's BJP campaigned seriously in areas where the BJP had never contested before. He didn't talk about India's 47%. In India at least, identity politics has been trumped for the time being by the politics of prosperity. For those from Rand Paul to Susana Martinez looking to write a new GOP narrative on race, Modi's campaign offered an example of forthrightly addressing a core issue of group identity without pandering. On foreign policy, he projected strength and confidence without unnecessary saber rattling. Pakistan frequently tested the Congress government, according to militants who said it tacitly cooperated with terrorist infiltrations and other provocations, most notably the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai that killed and wounded hundreds. They will likely be more cautious about testing Modi, who was persistently critical of Congress' often-timid reaction to Pakistani provocations, particularly on their contested border. Here Modi's example would offer much to a GOP that has wearied of neoconservative interventionism, but is also critical of Obama's passivity and worries that our failure to draw bright lines around our interests has invited provocation. Modi won on not just substance, but style: He refused to let the traditional media play gatekeeper, instead skillfully using social media to reach out to India's rapidly urbanizing professional classes, to whose aspirations for good governance he spoke so strongly. At a time in which the Republicans find themselves flatfooted in technology compared to the Democrats, Modi ran technological rings around his liberal adversaries. Some cautions are in order, of course. Campaigning is not governing, and, as Prime Minister, Modi a relative novice on the national and international stage, may not be successful. He must also continue to deal with the legacy of serious religious violence that occurred in Gujarat during his first term as chief minister that left more than 1,000 dead and caused international concern. While India's Supreme Court cleared him of charges that his government did not act decisively enough against the rioters, he was still blamed by others, including the United States, which refused him an entry visa. There is little doubt that given Modi's history, he will be under a great deal of scrutiny to make sure the tragedies of 2002 are not repeated nationally. But whether Modi succeeds or fails in governing, the GOP could learn a number of lessons from his successful campaign, one that showed how an allegedly ""extreme"" candidate of a party disdained by media and cultural elites can achieve unprecedented electoral success without sacrificing its principles. In that vein, it is perhaps appropriate that Modi began his professional life selling tea in his family's tea stall. In more ways than one, he represents the victory of India's tea party.","Jeremy Carl: Narendra Modi's victory in India can teach U.S. Republicans some lessons .

"(CNN) -- President Obama is ""deeply concerned"" about the growing number of deadly attacks on U.S. forces by Afghan security forces, and plans to contact the Afghan president to discuss taking tougher actions, he said Monday. ""I'll be reaching out to President (Hamid) Karzai,"" Obama told reporters at the White House, adding, ""We've got to make sure that we're on top of this."" Obama spoke Monday with Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The top U.S. military official is in Afghanistan for meetings with coalition and Afghan leaders, including Gen. John Allen, commander of NATO forces, and Afghan Army Gen. Sher Mohammad Karimi, Dempsey's counterpart in the country. There has been some success, including better counterintelligence, Obama said. ""But obviously we're going to have to do more."" ""And hopefully over the next several weeks we'll start seeing better progress on this front,"" he added. An incident Sunday brought the death toll in attacks by Afghan military and police personnel this year to 40, according to U.S. military officials. Twenty-three of those killed were Americans, according to the U.S. Defense Department. The NATO death toll in what the military is now calling ""insider attacks"" is already higher than it was last year, according to statistics compiled by the New America Foundation, a public policy think tank. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said Friday that 39 people had been killed in these attacks in 2012. That was before Sunday's attack killed one ISAF service member. The exact number of attacks remains unclear. While the U.S. military said there have been 40 insider attacks this year, ISAF tweeted last week that there had been 27 such attacks this year. There have been two more since that tweet. An ISAF spokesman told CNN on Friday there had been 31 such attacks before Sunday's attack. NATO and the United States say the vast majority of the attacks are not the work of the Taliban or insurgent groups. ""Some 10% we know are related to the insurgency,"" Brig. Gen. Gunter Katz, a spokesman for the ISAF, said last week. An April report by the U.S. Defense Department said, ""Investigations have determined that a large majority of green-on-blue attacks are not attributable to insurgent infiltration of the ANSF, but are due to isolated personal grievances against coalition personnel. There is no indication that these recent attacks are part of a deliberate effort by insurgents, nor were they coordinated with each other."" The term ""green-on-blue"" refers to a color coding system used by the military, in which blue refers to the friendly force, in this case ISAF; and green refers to an allied friendly forces, in this case Afghan National Security Forces. When investigators traveled to the attackers' home villages to investigate what was known about them, the information they collected led them to believe most of the attackers were generally not aligned with an insurgent group, but had their own grievances, military officials say. But the motivations of about half the attackers are difficult to determine definitively because the perpetrator is dead or has fled, CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen and Jennifer Rowland of the New America Foundation write in a column on CNN.com. Some of the incidents appear to have taken place after arguments between Afghan and international troops, the column notes. Last year, U.S. military behavioral scientist Jeffrey Bordin interviewed more than 600 Afghan soldiers and police and found they held overwhelmingly negative perceptions of Western soldiers, stemming from incidents including alleged indiscriminate shootings that killed civilians and the public searching of Afghan soldiers outside NATO bases, as well as U.S. soldiers urinating in public or cursing at their Afghan counterparts, Bergen and Rowland write. ""Another likely cause of the increase in the number of green-on-blue incidents is straightforward: In the past two years the size of the Afghan army and police force has almost doubled from around 200,000 to around 350,000,"" the column says. Afghan President Hamid Karzai spoke Sunday with U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. ""They expressed shared concern over this issue and agreed that American and Afghan officials should work even more closely together to minimize the potential for insider attacks in the future,"" Pentagon spokesman George Little said. Dempsey, in a statement Monday, said Karzai's public statement condemning insider attacks was ""tremendously important, and I hope it permeates to the lowest levels of the Afghan government and military."" Afghan police are most likely to launch such attacks, Dempsey said. ""The vulnerability of local police to (terrorist) influence is great. ... They don't move around the country the way the Army does, so they live at the point of corruption. I'm sure that's the case here too."" Officials are examining the vetting process for Afghan soldiers and police ""and investigating where it failed,"" a Defense Department statement said. All troops at NATO headquarters and all bases across the country have been ordered to carry loaded weapons around the clock, CNN learned Friday. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","NEW: President Obama says he will talk to President Karzai about the issue .

"(CNN) -- Yemen has poured thousands of troops into a battle with al Qaeda fighters in two southern provinces amid new airstrikes that killed a dozen of the militants Thursday, security officials said. Yemeni warplanes have been bombarding al Qaeda hideouts all week in a series of U.S.-supported airstrikes on the southern provinces of Lahj and Abyan. Three raids on Thursday killed 12 jihadists and destroyed large weapons caches near Jaar, in Abyan, with no losses among government forces, three security officials told CNN. Defense Ministry officials said the strikes are expected to last two more days. Meanwhile, the government has put thousands of troops into the effort to flush out the al Qaeda fighters and tighten security in the surrounding areas, the officials said. The Defense Ministry announced today that the militants are losing ground and casualties in their lines are high. On Tuesday security officials said at least 38 militants had been killed in 48 hours of continuous airstrikes, three of which had unspecified U.S. involvement. The strikes forced them to evacuate some of their hideouts, but the jihadists remained in control of key towns linking both provinces at that time, the officials said. The offensive comes after militants killed dozens of troops and seized large quantities of weapons when it raided a military zone earlier this week. Numerous other Yemeni soldiers are still being held hostage by militants since the attacks, two officials confirmed. Yemen's al Qaeda movement has expanded its control over parts of the country in the past year, leading politicians to consider the option of dialogue with the militant network. Sheikh Sadeq Ahmar, head of the country's most powerful Hashed tribe, said Monday that he supports talks with the jihadists. And in March, Ali Obaid, the spokesman for the country's highest security authority, told CNN that Yemen's military committee welcomed dialogue with al Qaeda if they accept specific terms, lay down their arms and hand over territory under their control.","New airstrikes kill 12 jihadists in Abyan province, Yemeni officials say .

"(CNN) -- Jim Carrey's ""Kick-Ass 2"" co-stars may accept his decision not to support their film because of its intense violence, but that's not to say they agree with him. Returning stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, ChloÃ« Grace Moretz and Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who were all in 2010's ""Kick-Ass,"" told CNN that they view the story of everyday citizens who create superhero alter egos to fight crime as a form of escapism rather than an encouragement to behave the same way. ""Here's the thing: you know, it's a movie,"" said Moretz, 16. ""I think if you are the type of person who's going to be affected by a movie, you shouldn't go see anything. You shouldn't go see a princess movie because then you're going to think you're a princess! ... I make movies for fun. And I think movies are for people to escape and to see stuff that is completely unrealistic."" Like its predecessor, the sequel's adapted from the graphic novels by Mark Millar, who's said that while his work lives up to its title, it's meant to be pure entertainment. For Carrey, though, the debate is a matter of conscience. ""I did Kickass a month b4 Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I cannot support that level of violence,"" he tweeted in June. ""(M)y apologies to others involve with the film. I am not ashamed of it but recent events have caused a change in my heart."" ""I think with all the tragedies that happened (in the past) year with the movie theater shooting, and Sandy Hook, and all that stuff ... he had to step back and he's like, 'I can't promote this movie, it's not in my heart.' And I respect that opinion,"" Mintz-Plasse told CNN of Carrey's announcement. ""I see movies as a kind of escape to get away from the real world for a couple hours. But I don't know what kind of people are out there. Like chemically imbalanced in their minds, you know, what they think, what inspires them."" Portraying a teen character named Hit-Girl, Moretz said she always thinks about how her job can impact society, but the answer to her is a separation of fact from fiction. ""I'm not playing myself, you know? And as Chloe, I would never in a million years do it, and I know that difference,"" Moretz said. ""Even when I was 11, I knew that difference."" The reality, said Taylor-Johnson, who plays the titular Kick-Ass, is that moviegoers buying tickets for an R-rated film are going to have certain expectations -- even from Carrey's new character, Col. Stars and Stripes. ""Jim brings such a fantastic element to this movie. The same kind of mad kookiness that (Nicolas) Cage did in the first ('Kick-Ass'),"" Taylor-Johnson said. ""That's kind of what 'Kick-Ass' is, it's so off the wall. But the violence is all comic book violence, and it's a fictional piece. I think that's what people are expecting to see -- it's an R-rated movie."" For the fans who are anticipating the same tone as the first film, Taylor-Johnson promises they've kept that level of darkness in tact. ""At the end of the day, it's entertainment,"" he said. ""This is even darker. ... I think there's so much packed in that they're not going to come out going, 'Aw, I wish I saw her do this or do that.' They're going to be like, 'Oh my God,' what?!' Just processing it all is going to take a couple days."" CNN's Jane Caffrey contributed to this report.","Some of the stars from 'Kick-Ass 2' have reacted to Jim Carrey's stance .

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- When it's revealed that a prominent member of a clandestine movement has been giving information to the FBI for months, you'd think it would intimidate others in the group into backing off. And that may have been the case when it was discovered that ""Sabu,"" real name Hector Xavier Monsegur, had been arrested in June and provided information that helped lead to the arrest of five other alleged members of the ""hacktivist"" collective, Anonymous. For a few minutes, anyway. ""That night, after everyone found out, it was a bit chilling,"" said Gregg Housh, one of the few people associated with Anonymous who speaks publicly using his real identity. But in the hours and days that followed, something very different happened. ""That switched. A lot of people we hadn't seen for months, or years, started showing up. An attack [on some sites by Anonymous] happened that night,"" he said. ""It just angered them, not frightened them."" Housh was speaking at South by Southwest Interactive on Tuesday, the annual festival in Austin devoted to Web and digital culture. He appeared on a panel with the director of a documentary about Anonymous, and two people who spoke (one via Web chat) wearing the movement's trademark ""Guy Fawkes mask."" The masks, patterned after the one worn by the shadowy anti-hero from the comic book and movie ""V for Vendetta,"" gave an almost surreal air to the panel at a conference where black-framed glasses are a more common fashion accessory. As a crowd of about 200 watched, ""Anonymous 9000"" spoke on a big screen, his mask and white gloves lending theatrics even as he talked soberly about the inner workings of a movement that has alternately inspired, intimidated and baffled the Web. ""I was kind of mesmerized by what was going on,"" said Brian Knappenberger, who directed ""We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists."" ""This is an attempt to define that culture."" In recent years, Anonymous has been involved in some of the most high-profile cyberattacks on the Web -- hobbling the websites of governments and businesses, hacking into sites to reveal private data and, along the way, getting dubbed cyberterrorists by authorities in the United States and elsewhere. Who is Anonymous? Everyone and no one . The group claims no leaders or power structure and doesn't require any sort of membership. That, some members say, is a blessing and a curse. ""That's the double-edged sword of Anonymous,"" said Anonymous 9000. ""Anyone can claim the name of Anonymous and do whatever they want. If anyone wants to make Anonymous look bad ... it's easy to do."" For example, he said he and many other ""Anons"" disagree with actions by Sabu and others under the banner of Anonymous splinter-group Lulzsec. Those included posting private data, including credit-card and Social Security numbers, of Web users and launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against media sites who posted stories they didn't like. Lulzsec targets Arizona law enforcement . ""When I got into this, I felt Anonymous was a group of groups who fight for the users,"" Anonymous 9000 said. ""To see people getting DDOSed .. there's a pretty good argument that's a form of censorship."" Last week, five men in the United States and Europe were arrested and charged in federal court for what investigators called among the ""most sophisticated hackers in the world."" Monsegur and others have claimed responsibility for cyberstrikes between December 2010 and June 2011 that included denial of service attacks against the websites of Visa, MasterCard and PayPal. Housh, who said ""Sabu"" had always been ""vocal,"" ""angry"" and ""a complete ass,"" said he suspected something was amiss when the alleged Lulzsec member disappeared from the Web for a while, then returned more animated and aggressive than ever. ""I watched, and some of these people who did these hacks would not have gotten arrested [except for the fact that] he taught them how to do the hacks,"" he said. Knappenberger's film chronicles the rise of Anonymous from a disparate group hanging out in the forums of notorious website 4chan to the day recently when members of the Polish parliament, in protest of a vote they said would restrict Web freedom, donned their own Guy Fawkes masks in solidarity with the group. Housh was, in his words, ""around near the beginning,"" which means about 2006. Shortly after that, in 2008, Anonymous gained visibility after launching an operation to defy the Church of Scientology. After leading protests and other efforts against the church, which Anonymous attacked after it deleted leaked copies of a video that actor Tom Cruise made for it, Housh's identity was revealed. He then shifted his activism to acting as a sort of public spokesman for the movement. While the collective has no single unifying goal, those associated with Anomymous often work against what they consider censorship, hypocrisy and heavy-handedness by governments around the world. Anonymous members say they were active in Arab Spring uprisings in places such as Egypt and Libya, have outed members of alleged child pornography sites and vocally opposed the Stop Online Piracy Act -- federal legislation Web activists felt could hamper freedom online. They've also backed the Occupy political movement, which is how the other masked panelist said he got involved about four months ago. An activist with Occupy Austin, he said the collective, in effect, became tech support for efforts here. He recalled a protest during which he says a police officer was acting aggressively toward protestors at a demonstration at Austin City Hall last month. As cameras streamed the protest online, he called out the officer's name and badge number, saying that all of his personal information would be online within hours. ""And they were,"" the masked panelist in Austin said. ""I was able to call on Anonymous and know they would deliver."" So what will become of Anonymous in the wake of the recent arrests? Housh said most people he talks to seem to realize arrest is a possibility. ""I don't think anything is going to change,"" he said.","Anonymous member appears on a documentary panel at surreal SXSW panel .

"Kagadi, Uganda (CNN) -- Two more people have died in Uganda's Ebola outbreak, officials working at a hospital said Wednesday. This brings the death toll to 16 people. They died in an outbreak that began in the Kibaale district in western Uganda. One of the two latest deaths was of a 14-year-old boy whose nine relatives also have died in the outbreak in the district's Nyanswiga village, where the first case is thought to have been. The two died in a hospital in Kagadi, a town close to the Congolese border. About three dozen suspected cases have been reported, World Health Organization spokesman Tariq Jasarevic said Tuesday. What does the Ebola outbreak mean? The deaths have stoked heightened fear about the spread of the virus, a highly infectious, often fatal agent spread through direct contact with bodily fluids. Symptoms can include fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, a measles-like rash, red eyes and, at times, bleeding from body openings. Market day was canceled Wednesday after Uganda's president warned people not to gather in large groups. Drivers of taxi motorbikes called boda-boda have become reluctant to take on passengers and there have been rumors that public transportation will be banned. Health officials urged the public to report any suspected cases, to avoid contact with anyone infected and to wear gloves and masks while disinfecting bedding and clothing of infected people. Officials also advised avoiding public gatherings in the affected district. Teams in Uganda are taking an aggressive approach, including trying to track down anyone who came into contact with patients infected with the virus and health workers have been gearing up for better protection of health workers and an influx of cases. The workers include people from Uganda's ministry of health, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the WHO. The outbreak initially went undetected because patients did not show typical symptoms, Ugandan Health Minister Dr. Christine Ondoa told CNN on Sunday. Patients had fevers and were vomiting, but did not show other typical symptoms, such as hemorrhaging. Diagnosis in an individual who has only recently been infected can be difficult since early symptoms, such as red eyes and skin rash, are seen more frequently in patients who have more common diseases, the CDC said. Uganda's Ministry of Health declared the outbreak in Kibaale district Saturday after the Uganda Virus Research Institute identified the disease as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Sudan strain. Some people delayed seeking treatment, in part, because they believed that ""evil spirits"" had sickened them, according to a report from district health authorities. ""This caused civil strife among the community, requiring police intervention to quell the animosity,"" the Health Ministry said. An emergency team of 100 volunteers underwent training this week to help spread the word in vulnerable communities about the disease and its transmission, the Uganda Red Cross Society said. Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, helped set up a hospital isolation center. The WHO did not recommend any travel or trade restrictions be applied to Uganda because of the outbreak. The U.S. Embassy in Kampala issued an emergency message for U.S. citizens that said the outbreak appeared to be centered in Nyamarunda Sub County, Kibaale district, although one suspected victim is reported to have traveled to Kampala for treatment at Mulago Hospital, where he died on July 22. It urged avoiding contact with dead animals, especially primates, and refraining from eating ""bushmeat."" The Ebola virus was first detected in 1976 in the central African nation of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo). The virus is named after a river in that country, where the first outbreak of the disease was found. There are five species of Ebola viruses, all named after the areas where they were found: Zaire, Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire, Bundibugyo and Reston, according to the WHO.","One of the dead is a teen whose relatives previously died of the virus .

"(CNN) -- Singer Beyonce, the United Nations and dozens of global aid groups have one message for the world Sunday: Perform a good deed, no matter how big or small, to help another person. Sunday marks World Humanitarian Day, which honors those who face danger in helping others and also encourages people to volunteer or help someone in need. Beyonce and aid organizations are trying to reach 1 billion people through social media for this year's campaign, called ""I Was Here."" ""'I Was Here' says I want to leave my footprints in the sands of time, and that is leaving our mark on the world,"" Beyonce told CNN's Anderson Cooper. ""We all want to know that our life meant something, and that we did something for someone else, and that we spread positivity no matter how big or how small."" The singer recorded a music video for the song ""I Was Here,"" which was performed at the U.N.'s General Assembly Hall. The video premieres Sunday on big screens in Dubai, Geneva, New York's Times Square and other locations. ""This year's World Humanitarian Day presents a historic opportunity to bring together 1 billion people from around the world to advance a powerful and proactive idea: people helping people,"" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement. ""From international efforts to avert a hunger crisis in West Africa, to urgent assistance to civilians in Syria, to a single good deed from one neighbor to the next, the spirit of people helping people improves conditions for all,"" Ban said. The United Nations lists a variety of ideas for participating in World Humanitarian Day, such as making a sandwich for a homeless person, donating one's skills to a community project and giving away an item you no longer use. Four years ago, the U.N. General Assembly proclaimed August 19 as World Humanitarian Day to commemorate the 2003 Canal Hotel bombing in Baghdad that killed 22 U.N. staff members, the global body said. But the dangers of international aid work continue today. ""Every day in Somalia, nongovernmental organizations and the U.N. humanitarian agencies work with the Somali people to overcome the effects of drought, hunger and conflict on innocent people,"" Mark Bowden, U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator in Somalia, said in a statement. ""The dangers are very real. Since the last World Humanitarian Day, 19 aid workers were killed and eight others kidnapped in Somalia, four of whom remain in captivity,"" Bowden said. The World Food Programme has also suffered casualties while carrying out its work. In the past year, 12 WFP staff, contractors and partner staff have been killed while working to fight hunger in Haiti, the Ivory Coast, Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan, the group's executive director, Ertharin Cousin, said in a statement. The U.N. chief said the best way to honor fallen aid workers is to carry on their mission by helping those who are suffering. ""Individual actions may seem small, but collectively they will reverberate around the world, generating unstoppable momentum for a better future,"" Ban said.","World Humanitarian Day encourages benevolence and honors fallen aid workers .

"(CNN) -- Earlier this week, al Qaeda issued the seventh issue of Inspire, a glossy English-language online magazine that emerged as a mouthpiece for the preaching of now-dead American-Yemeni terrorist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki. The message the magazine emphasized most was that supporters of al Qaeda in the West should take matters into their own hands and launch attacks themselves. A dedicated section provided them practical advice with how to carry out such attacks in the West. It was a publication that caused great concern to counterterrorism officials on both sides of the Atlantic. Distributed widely on jihadist websites, forums, and blogs, not only did the magazine attract a following in the United States and the United Kingdom, but also in several European countries like Germany. But it is possible that the seventh issue will be its last, with news that Samir Khan, its American Saudi-born editor, was also killed in the airstrike targeting al-Awlaki. Drone strike killed senior al-Qaeda cleric . Khan left North Carolina for Yemen in October 2009, according to U.S. officials, and had become radicalized while previously living in the Queens area of New York City. Even while living in the United States, Khan had attracted significant attention for publishing a blog sympathetic to al Qaeda. The loss of al-Awlaki and Khan is likely to significantly curtail al Qaeda's English-language propaganda output, one of the factors, according to U.S. counterterrorism officials, behind increased radicalization in the United States in recent years. ""They're presenting a message in English which automatically increases the accessibility to an American audience,"" Mitch Silber, the New York Police Department's director of intelligence analysis told CNN in an interview in 2010. Al Qaeda still has one highly visible English-language propagandist: Oregon-born convert Adam Gadahn, who over the past half decade has recorded many tapes in and around the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, where he is still believed to be operating. Gadahn, like al-Awlaki, has urged Western supporters to launch attacks on behalf of al Qaeda in the West. For example in an al Qaeda video released in June titled ""You are Only Responsible for Yourself,"" Gadahn said it is easy for American al Qaeda sympathizers to go to a gun show and purchase an automatic assault rifle without having to submit to a background check. Also, Adnan Shukrijumah, a Saudi-born American who left for jihad a decade ago, is believed to have taken on a senior role for al Qaeda, allegedly helping to orchestrate a plot to bomb New York subways in September 2009. But he has yet to appear in any al Qaeda videotapes or other propaganda output. Time will tell if al Qaeda decide to push Shukrijumah into a more visible role. But Gadahn and Shukrijumah have nothing like al-Awlaki's religious knowledge or following in militant Islamist circles in the West. Before al-Awlaki joined forces with al Qaeda in Yemen about three years ago, he built up a large mainstream following in the United States and the United Kingdom because of his charisma and his ability to transmit religious teaching in a vernacular young Muslims could understand. When he preached in mosques and meeting halls in Britain on visits from Yemen in the early to middle 2000s, there was often standing room only, according to those present, and he reached a much bigger audience worldwide by recording his sermons onto DVDs and making them available on the Internet. In smaller gatherings in Britain during this period, al-Awlaki's message could be much more radical. ""Behind closed doors I was told he conducted study groups which justified suicide bombing, for example, against the West -- justified suicide bombings against civilians,"" Usama Hasan, a British imam, told CNN's Nic Robertson in 2009. Hasan, at whose mosque in east London al-Awlaki once preached in 2002, recalled that that al-Awlaki at the time did not explicitly preach a message of violence, but his anti-American message and charisma were dangerous because they left congregations ""all revved up, not knowing what to do."" More than any other factor, it was al-Awlaki's popularity in mainstream Muslim circles before he joined forces with al Qaeda that made him such a dangerous voice for the group in the past two years, a young British Muslim who has seen his impact firsthand told CNN. His previous popularity allowed him to play the role of a ""spiritual sanctioner"" for Western radicals deliberating whether to launch attacks, for example for alleged Fort Hood shooter Maj. Nidal Hasan, who exchanged Internet message with him. A recent case in the United Kingdom perhaps best illustrated the power of al-Awlaki's message. Roshonara Choudhry, a British-Bangladeshi woman jailed for life last November for attempting in May 2010 to stab to death a British member of Parliament for supporting the Iraq war, was radicalized by watching more than a hundred hours of al-Awlaki's Internet sermons during a short time frame. ""I started to get really into it and I listened to everything ... like all of his recorded lectures that he made. ... Everybody listens to him and likes him anyway,"" she told police hours after her arrest. ""He explains things really comprehensively and in an interesting way, so I thought I could learn a lot from him."" Several others convicted of plotting terrorist attacks in the West were followers of al-Awlaki. They include several of those convicted for plotting to blow up trans-Atlantic airliners leaving from London's Heathrow Airport in 2006 and several of those convicted of plotting to attack the Fort Dix military base in New Jersey in 2007. At least one member of Najibullah Zazi's New York group who plotted to attack subways in the city in September 2009 regularly listened to al-Awlaki lectures, according to court documents. Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a Somali-American charged with attempting to blow up a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland in November 2010 appears to have been such a fan of al-Awlaki that he sent an article he hoped would be published by Inspire magazine, according to the complaint in his case. Mohamud has pleaded not guilty. Antonio Martinez, a Muslim convert who allegedly plotted to bomb a military recruiting station near Baltimore in December 2010 , was recorded by undercover agents describing al-Awlaki as his ""beloved sheikh."" (Martinez has pleaded not guilty.) While American and British radicals respected, admired, and were inspired by bin Laden, recent cases have made clear that many of them loved and listened to al-Awlaki even more. In the medium term, his removal from the scene will make Western countries safer. As well as being an inspirational figure to Western Islamist radicals, al-Awlaki was the key driver of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's ambitions to launch attacks against the United States, playing a key operational role in orchestrating plots and recruiting Western operatives who could help carry them out. But in the short term, counterterrorism officials on both sides of the Atlantic will be worried that his followers will carry out a revenge attack, as he taught them, in his name.","Al-Awlaki and Samir Khan were two important English-language voices for al Qaeda .
Al-Awlaki built up a large following in the United States and the United Kingdom .
Many who carried out or attempted various attacks have connections to him .

"Editor's Warning: This report is about the rapper Nas and his controversial album. It contains language you may find offensive, including the n-word, which was originally the title of the album. Since this story is about his use of the word in his songs but not on his album, should you continue reading, we must warn you that we have included the word in the story. Nas, 34, says he thinks he can still deliver his message without naming his album what he originally intended. (CNN) -- When Nas said he didn't name his album ""Nigger"" because there might be problems getting it into stores, it was no surprise. But when he said pressure from black leaders played a role, it seemed out of character. The Queens-reared rapper has never been one to kowtow. Just last month, he referred to the Rev. Jesse Jackson as ""the biggest player hater"" and declared Jackson's time as a voice for black America over. But in a recent CNN interview, Nasir Jones explained he didn't change the album's name to please the Rev. Al Sharpton and other black leaders. Rather, they were stealing his thunder. ""I don't think I liked the attention I was getting from some of the elders in my community,"" he said. ""I saw it kind of leaning toward being about them ... only about them. I kind of wanted to just shake that off of me.""  Hear Nas discuss the controversy » . His remedy? To drop the title altogether -- literally. The album, out Wednesday, has no name. But don't think Nas is cowering from controversy -- the cover features the rapper shirtless with his iconic, gothic ""N"" digitally whipped into his back. With a host of racial issues -- the Jena Six, Don Imus, nooses -- fresh on America's mind, naming an album ""Nigger"" seems ill-advised. Nas, however, said his goal wasn't to upset; it was to upend a society that focuses more on pejoratives than the racial plights that spawn them. ""There's still so much wrong in the whole world with people -- poor people, people of color -- I just felt like a nice watch couldn't take that away, make me forget about that. A nice day on a yacht with rich friends couldn't make me forget about reality, what's going on,"" he said. ""That's why I named the album that -- not just that the word is horrible, but the history behind the word, and how it relates to me, how it's affected me, offended me."" Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy delves into the frustrating duality of the slur in his 2003 bestseller, ""Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word."" Since colonist John Rolfe first coined ""negar,"" referring in 1619 to a shipment of Africans to Virginia, the epithet has lived a largely opprobrious life, with one exception, Kennedy writes. ""Currently, some people insist upon distinguishing nigger -- which they see as exclusively an insult -- from nigga, which they view as a term capable of signaling friendly salutation,"" Kennedy writes. Kennedy, who is black, concludes his book expressing satisfaction that the word's use causes anxiety. Politicians should avoid uttering it at all costs, he writes, and uses by nonblacks is most often a no-no. But never underestimate the word's complexities, says Kennedy: ""For bad and for good, nigger is thus destined to remain with us for many years to come -- a reminder of the ironies and the dilemmas, the tragedies and glories, of the American experience."" Kennedy declined to comment for this story, and Sharpton's press office did not respond to an e-mail and voice message requesting an interview. Because Nas rescinded the title doesn't mean the multiplatinum rapper isn't prepared to engage in debate on the word's merit in today's lexicon. ""It's all about the intent and what you mean and how it's coming off and the reason why you're saying it. You know, if it's ill intent, if you're angry, being ignorant, being meanspirited, saying that word -- it means the worst,"" he explained. ""If you're just a couple of black guys on the street corner, doesn't mean it's a great thing, but it's not that they're trying to harm each other when they say it."" As for a wholesale ban on the word -- something Jackson and Sharpton have suggested -- Nas scoffed. ""For some people, you should never be able to use it,"" he said. ""For others, it's way too late. It's too late to try to stop using it. It's something that's just part of the language now."" That ""elders"" had anything to do with changing the album's name might be a sign the 34-year-old is continuing the personal growth so easily charted since he released his 1994 debut, ""Illmatic,"" an album that would help earn him the No. 5 spot on MTV's list of the top MCs of all time. Back then, Nas was a 20-year-old, street-hustling rhymesmith from the rough-and-tumble Queensbridge projects, on the brink of earning the admiration of some of hip-hop's biggest names. He's been called ""the king"" (Producer Dallas Austin), ""a genius"" (Island Def Jam Chairman L.A. Reid) and ""the greatest rapper of all time"" (rapper Kanye West). After ""Illmatic,"" fans watched Nas -- and his ego -- grow through the years as he proclaimed himself ""Nastradamus,"" ""God's Son"" and the ""Street's Disciple."" His legions watched him become jaded with age when, in 2006, he declared, ""Hip Hop is Dead,"" and lashed out at the rappers and DJs he felt had rendered the genre hackneyed. Though Nas dabbled in advocacy before Wednesday, his lyrics dwelled more on his rhyming skills, hot sneakers, women and blunts. Violence was regularly invoked, especially in regard to any would-be dissers. On the untitled album, there's still an air of militancy, with the threats of violence directed toward those who aim to oppress African-Americans. He boasts likenesses to Black Panther founder Huey P. Newton and threatens to throw Molotov cocktails in the name of civil rights murder victim Emmett Till. On ""Testify,"" Nas warns that he's loading a magazine to ""send these redneck bigots some death in a bag/choke him out with his Confederate flag/I know these devils are mad."" ""I really like 'Testify' because it's like a man who's just frustrated and doesn't know how to fight. It's when you feel like there's no one to call. Who do you call when you're of the ethnic group that the police have been wiping out for years and the government doesn't do anything?"" Nas asked. Nas explains his growth on ""Project Roach,"" crediting a Guyanese anthropologist and literary critic with helping him mature: ""I used to worship a certain Queens police murderer/Till I read the words of Ivan Van Sertima/He inserted something in me than made me feel worthier/Now I spit revolution, I'm his hood interpreter."" Other messages on the album seem designed to inspire the black community, or to decry a separate-but-equal culture that purports to incubate fairness but rarely produces results. On ""America,"" he opines, ""Too many rappers, athletes and actors/But not enough niggas in NASA/Who gives you the latest dances, trends and fashion?/But when it comes to residuals they look past us."" Nas acknowledged he's a different person today than when he dropped ""Illmatic,"" and his music has grown along with him. Fans should recognize and enjoy the evolution rather than make comparisons, he said. He tentatively agreed that his untitled album addresses the plight of black America with a more positive voice, but he almost bristled when asked if he was a ""conscious rapper,"" guys like Common, Mos Def and Talib Kweli who largely refrain from talk of violence and misogyny. Nas, he said, will remain an individual, an artist, a lyricist, whose style and message can't be placed in a tidy case like one of his albums. ""I just look at myself as a man who's trying to figure shit out in the world, and God is amazing because He's never going to let us figure it all out,"" Nas said. ""So I don't really have a category. I'm just a man that's in search, that's always in search, that's always going to question things, you know?""","Nice watches, yachts couldn't make him forget America's racial problems, Nas says .

"(CNN) -- English marine experts have laid their hands on an octopus that's missing two of its own: a six-limbed creature that they have dubbed 'hexapus.' Henry the 'hexapus' photographed by staff at Blackpool's Sea Life Centre, in northwest England. Ordinarily, octopodes have eight arms and legs. And should they lose one or more in an accident, they can grow the limbs back. Which is what makes 'Henry' -- as staffers at Blackpool Sea Life Centre in northwest England have dubbed their find -- so unique. His missing limbs stem from a birth defect. ""If you look closer between the legs, there's webbing that attaches each of the arms together,"" John Filmer of the Sea Life Centre told CNN Tuesday. ""You'd assume if he'd lost one of his legs in an accident, there would be space for an arm to grow back. ""But there's no space for two extra legs to grow back. That's just how he is."" Staffers called others zoos and aquariums and scoured the Internet to see if there were records of similar creatures. ""No one has ever heard of another case of a six-legged octopus,"" said display superviser Carey Duckhouse. 'Henry' was picked up from a local zoo along with seven other octopodes for a new exhibit at the center. No one noticed his missing legs until he attached himself to the inside of his glass tank. They named him 'Henry' because it alliterated well with 'hexapus.' ""It has also been mentioned in the grapevine that he was named after King Henry the VIII who had six wives when he should have had eight,"" Filmer, the centre's marketing director, said. Until Henry, the most famous six-legged octopus was one that appeared in a 1955 B-movie, 'It Came From Beneath The Sea.' As was common of many science fiction movies of the era, the film was made on a shoestring budget -- and designers left off two legs from the creature because of budget contraints. Octopuses are renowned for having three hearts, blue blood and the ability to alter their skin complexion in the blink of an eye. But, said the center, ""(e)ven these astonishing characteristics however are commonplace compared to Henry's unique tally in the leg department.""

"(CNN) -- The Texas town devastated by an April fertilizer plant explosion is suing the company that supplied the plant with ammonium nitrate, arguing the supplier sold the volatile compound ""blindly"" to a firm that didn't handle it properly. The city of West, Texas, accuses Adair Grain, which operated as the West Fertilizer Company, of negligently storing ammonium nitrate on its grounds before the April 17 blast. It also accused Illinois-based CF Industries of selling West Fertilizer about 200 tons of the compound without investigating whether the plant could store it safely. ""The CF Industries defendants, in the best position to know and understand the full nature of the dangers of the product manufactured by them, made no effort to determine the risk to the community into which their product was shipped,"" the lawsuit states. ""Instead, they blindly sold hundreds of tons of hazardous ammonium nitrate to West Fertilizer Company and delivered it to a facility located within a community of people, houses, parks, schools and a nursing home."" The suit also argues that CF Industries provided outdated safety information to West Fertilizer and failed to include additives that would have prevented a detonation. It was filed the week after the Federal Emergency Management Agency denied additional aid to the town, notifying Gov. Rick Perry's office that the state could handle the remaining reconstruction costs. That decision was ripped by local and state officials who accused President Barack Obama of having ""gone against his word."" In a statement on the lawsuit, CF Industries said it was ""sympathetic to those whose lives were affected by this unfortunate incident"" but believes there is ""no basis for this suit."" Adair Grain did not return a request for comment. The explosion devastated West, a town of about 2,800 people south of Dallas. It leveled numerous homes and damaged two schools and a nursing home and could be felt 50 miles away. After a month of investigation, fire marshals said they could not determine a cause. Investigators have opened a criminal probe, but no one has been charged.","The April explosion in West, Texas, killed 15 people, damaged nursing home, schools .

"(CNN) -- Let me tell you about the amazing kid who lives in our house. She's 6 and she is the most hysterical, sarcastic, intelligent, funny, sweet, naÃ¯ve, confident, strong, independent, considerate person I have ever met. I have no idea how she got to be this way. You see, my husband is a quadriplegic. I care for him, I work full-time, and there are days when I feel like our daughter gets very little of my attention. Isabel was 6 months old when her dad was injured. During her first six months, he was just OK at changing diapers and he had no fashion sense when it came to dressing her. But he loved feeding her and playing with her and those two spent tons of time together. Then, our lives changed. It was December 21, 2007, three days before Isabel's first Christmas. At our annual Christmas party with our friends, around midnight, my husband decided to jump into the snow to make a snow angel. Why? Because he's Ben. I remember looking at him, smiling and shaking my head. He looked at me, grinned and ran out into the snow -- and never got up. He had broken his neck at the C4/C5 level and was paralyzed completely from the shoulders down. I do not remember my daughter's first Christmas. My parents and sisters spent it with her while I was in the hospital with my husband. I went from hugging and snuggling her before the accident to barely being able to look at her without crying. I couldn't even hold her because the responsibility of being a ""single parent"" in the physical sense was so overwhelming, I shut down. Every single minute of the day, I begged someone to fix my husband. I remember one night in the ICU, the nurses got a rocker for me from the NICU and made me sit with Isabel in Ben's room. It was like they knew we needed time together, just the two of us. It felt very foreign to me for a very long time. I felt like her babysitter, not her mom. While I rocked her, I stared at her wondering how we were going to manage as a family and how unfair it was to her that we were putting her through so much. My mom became Isabel's surrogate parent for almost eight months because I needed to focus on my husband. She was the one who got up with our daughter when she cried, and brought her to visit in rehab. Looking back, it still hurts to know how much time I missed with my daughter. I missed her first steps. I missed her first words. I missed so much. And it took years until I could let that all go, until I felt like her mom again. I'm finally realizing how hard it must have been on my husband. He was no longer able to hold her. To help her. To play with her. He had to watch from the sidelines while everyone else took care of his child. As new parents, you expect things to be difficult. But when dealing with a spinal cord injury, difficult doesn't begin to describe it. I went from caring for a 6-month-old with my husband to caring for a 6-month-old AND my husband. I liked how things were before the injury. My strong, confident husband took charge and I followed. In a second, it changed. I had to be responsible for our family. I am always the first one up and the last one to bed. I am pushed to the limit physically, emotionally and mentally almost every single day. But it has made us stronger. As we learned how to live our ""new"" life, things became easier. We developed a routine. We found our sense of humor again. We worried about the relationship between Ben and Isabel. A lot. Every time she said that she didn't like him or want him around, we worried that it was because of his injury. We made a big deal out of it. We stressed about it. We talked to her teachers about it. We talked to a counselor about it. We thought that our daughter wouldn't connect with her dad because of his injury. It turns out we were wrong. Very wrong. Isabel is your typical 6-year-old who just happens to have learned more about life than most ever do, one who will place her hands on my face and solemnly tell me, ""Everything will be OK."" Our daughter loves her daddy. She knows he's disabled. She knows he broke his neck. She knows there are limitations to what they can do together but trust me, they push the boundaries every single day. More than once, she's come running to tell me that daddy got stuck in the mud or fell forward in his wheelchair or ran out of battery while on a walk. She's come to me crying because she bumped her head or arm falling from her daddy's chair when she was climbing on it, or riding in his lap, or jumping onto the couch from his chair. Too many times I've had to yell at both of them for chasing each other through the house; he in his chair and she on her scooter. Too many times I've had to tell them to STOP IT because they were about to get into trouble together. She's figured out the best way to crawl into his lap to watch a movie. She climbs onto the counter so she can give him a kiss at night. She turns off his chair when he's in her room at night so he has to stay while she falls asleep. She puts clips in his hair and puts makeup on him to play dress up. She rolls her eyes when Ben tells a terrible joke and thinks it's hilarious when she tries to tickle him, even though he cannot feel it. Isabel doesn't see Ben as a quadriplegic. She sees him as her father. She goes to him when she's sad. She celebrates with him when she's happy. His injury does not define their relationship. Their love for each other does. Every day I get to see that love they share grow into something even bigger. She has taught me how to look past her dad's disability to see him for who he really is: my husband. The man I married. The man I love. That little kid has taught me more about love and life in her six years than anyone ever could. She taught us how to laugh again. How to have fun again. How to love each other again. She was the one who taught us that life was worth living. I cannot wait to see else what else she can teach us as she grows.","Erin Hayes' husband broke his neck on December 21, 2007 .

"(CNN) -- When the Republican National Convention kicks off this week in Tampa, Florida, the nation will notice one thing before anything else: This is not your father's or grandfather's Republican Party. Rather, it's a party with leaders as diverse as the country it intends to represent. With the nation's changing demographics, Republicans can no longer rely on the South and Midwest to carry them to victory in 2012. Instead, they must broaden their base into traditionally purple and blue states. It's an uphill battle: President Obama leads by a sizeable margin with women and by wide margins with Latino and black voters. But it's not insurmountable. Romney already leads with men by roughly the same number President Obama leads with women. Nor is it unprecedented. Republicans won a landslide victory in the 2010 fall midterm elections. Now they must devise a strategy to repeat that. Republicans, in short, must repeat what they did in their landslide victory in the 2010 fall midterm elections. Opinion: Unfriendly to women? Not my GOP . Bolstered by the rise of the Tea Party, Republicans won back the House in historic fashion then. Independents went to Republicans by 15 points, an incredible 23-point swing from 2008. Republicans virtually eliminated the gender gap with women -- their best showing since 1982. Writing in The Wall Street Journal this week, Michael Barone notes, ""White noncollege voters and white evangelical Christians were only 42% and 37%, respectively, of the winning Republican coalition in the 2010 congressional elections."" 2010 was a watershed year for Republicans because they were able to lure away much of the Democratic base, particularly Northern and Midwestern suburbanites and college graduates. They did so by campaigning on major policy issues and reforms, such as Obamacare and the national debt, that inspired and enthused the electorate. As the 2012 Republican convention dawns, look for Republicans to display a similar election strategy: a diverse cast of party leaders with bold policy ideas reaching for a diverse electorate. For one of the few times in GOP history, the top of the Republican ticket hails exclusively from the North, with Mitt Romney from Michigan and Paul Ryan from Wisconsin. The de facto leaders of the GOP bring a newfound party interest in these traditionally blue states. Already, Ryan has put Wisconsin in play for Republicans in some of the latest polls. In Michigan, which President Barack Obama won by more than 16 points in 2008, Romney trails Obama by only 2 points, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls in Michigan. The nation is familiar with the likes of Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor, but in Tampa, viewers will be introduced to a new, even deeper and more diverse cast. Scheduled to speak Tuesday night is Ted Cruz, Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Texas. The son of a Cuban immigrant, Cruz rose to attend Princeton University and Harvard Law, becoming a gifted orator. As the solicitor general of Texas, he argued and won high-profile cases in front of the Supreme Court. Also speaking on Tuesday night is Nikki Haley, the first female governor in South Carolina and the daughter of Sikh immigrants. She made her name as governor fighting the Obama administration's National Labor Relations Board lawsuit challenging Boeing's right to build a new plant in South Carolina. The NLRB dropped the suit after the union reached an agreement with Boeing. The plant could bring thousands of jobs to her state. Opinion: GOP -- big tent, or big mess? With the reshuffled convention schedule, also speaking Tuesday will be Mia Love, the mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, and candidate for the 4th Congressional District there. Love, the first black female mayor in Utah state history, is already making a name for herself with her outspoken, firebrand conservatism. Susana Martinez, the first female governor of New Mexico and the first female Hispanic governor in U.S. history, is set to take the stage Wednesday night. More important than diversity, however, is substance, and this year's crop of Republican leaders is a bolder, more conservative group than we've seen in decades. After paying a steep price at the polls in 2006 and 2008, the Republican Party might be in a new era in 2012, one ripe with intrepid, limited government and Constitutional reformers such as Govs. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, Chris Christie of New Jersey, Bob McDonnell of Virginia and Rep. Ryan, now the vice presidential nominee. The purpose of a convention, after all, is to coalesce individuals into parties and ideas into causes. With the selection of Ryan for vice president, the race takes on clear shape and focus -- repealing Obamacare, restoring fiscal sanity and jump-starting the economy -- that voters can rally for, rather than just rallying against President Barack Obama. For all the hand-wringing and second-guessing in the Republican primaries, the post-convention GOP will take on a new, united face. The goal, inevitably, is to replicate the results of the GOP's 2010 landslide victory. But to do that, it must replicate the same vision, clarity and diversity, not for diversity's sake, but for the sake of the wide swath of America's voters in need of help. Look for the GOP to harness, focus and refine that message all week in Tampa. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William Bennett.","William Bennett: GOP convention will demonstrate the party is as diverse as the nation .

"Seoul (CNN) -- South Korea has rebuffed North Korea's demand to meet two of its fishermen whose boat strayed into the South's waters. Three North Korean fishermen were found Saturday in a boat off South Korea's eastern coast, according to the South's Unification Ministry. Two of the men sought to stay in the South and one expressed a desire to return to his homeland. That fisherman was sent back to North Korea through Panmunjom, the border village in the middle of the Demilitarized Zone on Tuesday, said a Unification Ministry spokesman. The remaining two are expected to be the subject of a South Korean investigation. On Tuesday, North Korea sent a fax, demanding to meet the remaining two fishermen, saying that if their request for a face-to-face meeting was rejected, it would consider the incident ""an act of abduction and take firm action."" South Korean officials rejected the request, saying it was ""not appropriate... because those two sought to defect to South Korea."" North Koreans who come to South Korea typically go through an investigation, then attend a settlement support center called Hanawon. At this center, they are taught how to live in South Korean culture and society. After completing the six-month program, they are given a resettlement fee of up to $24,000. In 2013, more than 1,500 North Koreans are known to have defected to South Korea and more than 26,000 are known to have defected overall. CNN's KJ Kwon reported from South Korea and Madison Park in Hong Kong.","South Korea rebuffs North Korea's demand to meet two fishermen .

"(CNN) -- In a city where football is a religion, Daniel Sturridge is fast becoming a deity. The Liverpool striker's skyward salute -- he is a committed Christian -- has become a familiar sight around English Premier League grounds, with the 24-year-old netting 18 league goals so far this season. With nine goals in nine league matches this year, scoring has come easy. Explaining his hot streak, however, is a bit more difficult. ""I'm not too sure,"" Sturridge told CNN's World Sport. ""I just think that I've had my faith in God, been praying a lot, been working hard on the training field, and expressing myself, playing my natural game and playing my natural position also."" A switch from the wing -- where his former club Chelsea often deployed him -- to a more central attacking role at Liverpool has transformed Sturridge's scoring fortunes. The statistics speak for themselves: 13 goals in 63 league appearances during four years at Stamford Bridge compared to 28 from 35 games in the 14 months since completing his Â£12 million ($20 million) move to Anfield. Goals and a blossoming partnership with Uruguay striker Luis Suarez have propelled Sturridge to new heights of stardom, but his nimble feet remain firmly planted on the ground. ""Maybe off the pitch it's changed in terms of people paying more attention, but in terms of myself and my family and my friends nothing has changed,"" he says. ""I live the same lifestyle, I'm the same old happy self that I've been in my whole life."" Sturridge and Suarez have netted 43 times in the league this season, but come June 19 they will likely be lining up against each other when England take on Uruguay at the World Cup in Brazil. ""It will be strange but I'm looking forward to it,"" Sturridge says of the Group D clash. ""We play against each other in training and we have a lot of battles, but come game time we will be enemies and he'll be somebody that I'll be looking to take out if necessary because we got to win the game."" Sturridge's renaissance at club level has also been mirrored on the international stage, where he's gone from fringe player to first-team regular. His fifth England goal in this month's 1-0 friendly win against Denmark at Wembley merely confirmed his growing stature and confidence ahead of the trip to South America. ""It's gonna be great to be involved in the World Cup because it's something I've dreamed of ... It's gonna be a great occasion and as I've said, if I'm selected, I'm looking forward to it,"" he says. The priority now, though, is on domestic matters as Liverpool continue their quest for a first league title in 24 years. Sunday's 3-0 drubbing of Manchester United at Old Trafford was Liverpool's fifth straight league win and confirmed Brendan Rodgers' team as genuine title contenders, although Sturridge refuses to be drawn on the subject. ""I think it's important that we just go out there, work as hard as we can as a team in every game and perceive what the future holds,"" he told CNN before the victory over Liverpool's northwest rivals. Sturridge can look forward to home clashes against two of his former clubs -- league-leading Chelsea and Manchester City, the bookmakers' favorite -- as the EPL title race heads down the final straight in April. ""We're gonna play them both at Anfield. It's going to be a great occasion for myself and for the fans and my teammates of course. But it's important that we go out there and play the Liverpool way and enjoy it,"" he says. Win those two games and Liverpool fans will be on the verge of Premier League heaven.","Daniel Sturridge says his faith has helped him hit top form for Liverpool .

"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (CNN) -- The search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 resumed Sunday, but stormy weather may cause problems, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. A Chinese aircraft took off at 6:20 a.m. local time (6:20 p.m. ET). Other aircraft, including a South Korean P-3 Orion and a U.S. P-8 Poseidon, were preparing to depart from Perth. Ten planes will fly over 123,167 square miles (319,000 square kilometers) located about 1,150 miles (1,850 kilometers) west of Perth, the AMSA said. Weather in the search area is forecast to worsen with light showers and low clouds, though search operations are expected to continue, the authority said. Eight ships will join the search by the end of the day, including the Australian Ocean Shield, which will be fitted with a ""black box"" detector and an autonomous underwater vehicle, AMSA said. All ships will seek to locate and identify objects sighted by aircraft over the past two days. Search experts said the clock is ticking. Michael Kay, a former adviser to the UK Ministry of Defence, said on CNN that the batteries on the flight data recorder, sometimes called the black box, are designed to last only about 30 days. The plane disappeared March 8 -- three weeks ago. Eight planes and a number of ships scoured some 97,000 square miles of water Saturday for signs of the plane, with aircraft reporting sightings of objects similar to those reported Friday, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said. Two vessels -- one of them a Chinese warship -- retrieved objects, ""but so far no objects confirmed to be related to MH370 have been recovered,"" the authority said. Crew members aboard a Chinese plane dropped buoys to mark three suspected debris sites, China's state-run CCTV reported. ""After entering the search area, the airlifter flew for about 20 minutes,"" crew member Wang Zhenwu told the television network. ""We found an L-shaped debris in orange color right below the plane's right wing. Then within around three minutes, we found a stripe-shaped object. We immediately reported our findings to the captain."" The captain, Liu Jun, said buoys containing dye were dropped on each of the suspected sites, according to CCTV. Relatives complaining . Relatives of the 239 people on board the plane have complained about receiving mixed messages. Earlier this week, they heard this: ""All lives are lost."" But Saturday, a Malaysian official met with relatives and then told reporters he had not closed the door on the hope of relatives that survivors may exist among the 239 people aboard the Boeing 777-200 ER that went missing March 8. ""Even hoping against hope, no matter how remote, of course, we are praying and we will continue our search for the possible survivors,"" said Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia's acting transportation minister. ""More than that, I told the families I cannot give them false hope. The best we can do is pray and that we must be sensitive to them that, as long as there is even a remote chance of a survivor, we will pray and do whatever it takes."" Chinese relatives in Kuala Lumpur told CNN that Malaysian authorities are restricting their movement and access to information . When a briefing for them was not held Saturday, the Chinese relatives said they were deterred from attending a briefing for Maylasian relatives. They ended up talking to a Malaysia Airlines official after the briefing. 'They're still alive' In Beijing on Saturday, some of the relatives of the missing vented their anguish in the streets. ""They're all still alive, my son and everyone on board!"" yelled Wen Wancheng, 63, whose only son was among the passengers. ""The plane is still there, too! They're hiding it."" He held aloft a banner that read: ""Son, mom and dad's hearts are torn to pieces. Come home soon!"" Many relatives doubtless remember the speculation from early in the search that the plane may have landed somewhere. They implored Hishammuddin to redouble the efforts, and he said Malaysian authorities would do so. ""What they want is a commitment on our part to continue the search, and that I have given,"" Hishammuddin said. ""For me, as the minister responsible, this is the hardest part of my life, at the moment,"" he told reporters. ""Miracles do happen, remote or otherwise, and that is the hope that the families want me to convey -- not only to the Malaysian government, MAS (Malaysia Airlines), but also to the world at large,"" he said. He said the effort was still to find survivors. Sea objects . On Saturday that meant hunting again for plane debris in an ocean awash in debris -- including odds and ends from passing ships -- in hopes that among it are pieces of the jet. After the latest data analysis, experts says they believe that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared three weeks ago, ended up in the southern Indian Ocean. Investigators concluded this week that, during the flight's initial phase, the plane was traveling faster -- and therefore burning fuel faster -- than they had thought. Authorities have concluded that it could not have traveled as far south as they had thought earlier. The new search area is 1,100 kilometers (680 miles) northeast of the previous one and closer to Australia's coast, so it's easier to reach. It's also marked by calmer waters. Ships plowed the waters of the search area and eight planes searched from above. ""Unfortunately, we didn't find anything of significance out there,"" flight captain Russell Adams said after returning to Perth. Malaysia plane saga: Your questions answered . Pieces of debris spotted Friday were hundreds of miles away from each other, but given the ocean conditions and the time passed since the airplane's purported crash, they could be part of the same object. Friday's sightings included 11 small objects spotted by a military P-3 plane. CNN's Kyung Lah, who went out on a U.S. Navy P-8 search plane Friday, said its crew spotted white objects, orange rope and a blue bag. ""At one point, sure, everybody on board got a little excited, but it's impossible to tell from that distance what anything is,"" she said. If and when the jet is found, the key question would remain: Why did it go down? That may not be answered until investigators retrieve the aircraft and try, literally, to piece together what happened to it. Vast, shifting search . The shifting hunt for Flight 370 has spanned vast bodies of water and continents. It started in the South China Sea between Malaysia and Vietnam, where the plane went out of contact with air traffic controllers. When authorities learned of radar data suggesting the plane had turned westward across the Malay Peninsula after losing contact, they expanded the search into the Strait of Malacca. When those efforts proved fruitless, the search spread north into the Andaman Sea and northern Indian Ocean. It then ballooned dramatically after Malaysia announced March 15 that satellite data showed the plane could have flown along either of two huge arcs, one stretching northwest into the Asian land mass, the other southwest into the Indian Ocean. The search area at that point reached nearly 3 million square miles. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that further analysis of the data led authorities to conclude the plane went down in the southern Indian Ocean, far from land. Malaysian officials then told the families of those on board that nobody would have survived. On Saturday, after confronting relatives' grief, they made that conclusion seem less final.

"(CNN) -- Las Vegas police still don't know what set off the incident, what prompted the driver of a gray Honda Accord to hit an man and leave him writhing in pain on the pavement of Las Vegas gas station. In the two weeks since the incident, the motorists has eluded them. But they do have one thing: surveillance camera footage. And like other enforcement around the country, they think by releasing the video, by posting it online, they'll get the help they need. The start of the video seems mundane. Cars line up to get gas, people coming and going. Then, a gray Honda Accord pulls into the parking lot of an AMPM gas station. The Accord cuts off a man's car. The man, wearing a red cap and sweatshirt, drives around it to avoid an accident. Later, as the man crosses the parking lot, the Accord drives up to him, nearly clipping him. Then the car moves forward, bumping the man and running him over. As the car turns out of the station, the man is seen lying on the ground. His cap is knocked off his head. He clutches his legs. ""The guy was on the floor for 10 minutes, screaming,"" gas station employee Sheyla Rodriguez told CNN affiliate KVVU. ""We tried to help him the most we can."" The man was seriously injured and taken to a hospital for treatment, the affiliate said. The incident occurred February 6. That all happened on February 6th. Police have some information about the driver, some information about the car and they know it's has a California plate. They're hoping if the video gets views, they'll get their man. It's not a farfetched idea. Earlier this month, police in San Antonio released a frightening helmet camera video recorded by a motorcyclist weaving in and out of traffic. In about a week, they had their suspect in custody. And last fall, video of an altercation between motorcyclists and an SUV driver in Manhattan resulted in several arrests. Officer Larry Hadfield in Las Vegas thinks the same could happen in his case. ""It could take just one viewer,"" he told KVVU. ""At no point does anyone deserve to be run over by a car in this way.""","Police think releasing surveillance footage will lead to arrest .

"(CNN) -- NASA's staggering budget shortfall has put its rocket program at ""high risk"" of missing the planned 2017 launch date for its $12 billion deep-space rocket, a federal watchdog said. A report by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, estimates that NASA may need an additional $400 million to meet the December 2017 deadline for launch. The GAO reports the space agency's Space Launch System program lacks funding and long term focus. ""Without identifying a range of mission possibilities and their required funding, the program is at risk of making uninformed decisions and pursuing development paths that may not make the most efficient use of limited resources in the near term and could negatively impact longer term affordability,"" the report states. It acknowledges that NASA metrics indicate the program is on track in terms of design goals, which demonstrate the capability of the system. In NASA's response to the report, it warned that ""delaying the SLS development schedule or diverting funding from other priorities to satisfy a schedule confidence level could jeopardize these goals and result in an increase in costs to the taxpayer."" NASA said the SLS is set to be ""the most powerful rocket in history for deep space missions,"" with hopes of eventually going to Mars. The office running the program told GAO investigators there is a 90% chance at this time the rocket will not make its launch date. Orion, NASA's newest manned spaceship, is set to launch on the first SLS test flight, according to the agency's website. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. If SLS misses its first launch date, NASA has a second flight scheduled for 2021. What to know about NASA . Scientists: We're 'very close' to finding another Earth .

"(CNN) -- The largest kosher food brand in the United States, Hebrew National, known for its tagline ""We Answer to a Higher Authority,"" is being sued in federal court for allegedly not meeting the kosher standards it famously advertises. The lawsuit, which was first filed by 11 plaintiffs in May, alleges that the popular brand has been negligent and violated several consumer fraud laws when it failed to follow its own standards for kosher meat. According to accusations made in the complaint, Hebrew National products are not being made from 100% kosher beef and the food processing plants used by the company fail to follow the procedures necessary to meet its kosher definition. Hebrew National's ""deceptive and wrongful conduct is designed to mislead and deceive consumer into purchasing its Hebrew National products, at premium prices, by labeling and marketing it as 100% kosher,"" the complaint states. Pastor's reality food show pitch: Christians and Jews bonding over hot dogs . ConAgra Foods Inc., the parent company of Hebrew National and defendant in the case, denies the allegations. ""Hebrew National hotdogs are kosher, and this lawsuit is without merit,"" according to a written statement from Teresa A. Paulsen, vice president of communications and external relations for ConAgra Foods. ""Hebrew National's kosher status is certified by a well-recognized and authorized third party. There is close rabbinical supervision of the food preparation process and packaging equipment."" The complaint stipulates that Hebrew National receives meat products from AER Services Inc., an Illinois-based company that provides kosher meat processing and inspection services. In addition, Hebrew National employs a third party, Triangle K and Associates, to act as a certifier, guaranteeing the kosher nature of all AER products received. Hot dog eating championship is marketing magic for Nathan's . ""The Triangle K symbol is a trademarked logo that signifies 'kashruth' (kosher) as defined by the most stringent Jews who follow Orthodox Jewish Law,"" the Hebrew National website states. ""It's a symbol of integrity, representing the most trusted and reliable name in strict rabbinical food certification and supervision."" But according to the lawsuit, certain AER employees involved in the process have complained to supervisors at both AER and Triangle K that certain procedures were rendering the meat not kosher. The lawsuit alleges that despite warnings, little or nothing was done to fix the problem, ""rather, the persons making the complaints were terminated or otherwise threatened with adverse retaliation, such as job transfers."" A statement from Triangle K described the accusations as ""outrageously false and defamatory,"" claiming they had ""been made by anonymous disgruntled individuals against Triangle K's strict rabbinical supervision of Hebrew National products."" Neither AER Services nor Triangle K and Associates is listed as a defendant in this lawsuit. Attorneys for the plaintiffs are now pushing for the case to be granted class action status. Court documents indicate that ConAgra has until July 13 to respond to the class action complaint.

"(CNN) -- And so the carnival carries on. Brazil, the team which manages to thrill and frustrate almost simultaneously, clinched its place in the quarterfinal of the World Cup following a tension-fueled encounter with Chile. A 3-2 victory on penalties following a 1-1 draw in Belo Horizonte means Luiz Felipe Scolari's side's quest to win the World Cup on home soil remains alive. It will now turn its attention to a last eight contest with Colombia -- a team which has thrilled so far in this tournament. While Brazil will take the plaudits, Chile should be commended for a performance which at times defied the ability of the human body to run and hustle as its players did. Having already scored an own-goal to gift Brazil a 19th minute lead, Gonzalo Jara was to be the fall guy at the death. With Brazil leading the shootout 3-2, Jara needed to score to keep his country in the tournament. As he stood, eyes firmly on the goal, two nations held their breath -- but only one broke out into ecstasy as the ball smashed against the post and rolled away to safety. As those in red flopped to the ground, their bodies bruised and beaten, tears running down their faces, their opponents danced their way around the field, perhaps more out of relief than happiness. Brazil, still haunted by its failure 64 years ago when it was beaten by Uruguay in the 1950 final, cannot afford anything but triumph. It will now move on to face Colombia in Fortaleza on Friday -- but there will still be some concerns over Brazil's performance. This was not the showing of a side which appeared ready to become World champion. Poor in possession, unnerving in defense, most of those at the Estadio Mineirao were put through a painstaking afternoon as its side seldom showed what has become expected of a Brazilian side. And yet, before kickoff, every single historic fact pointed towards a Brazil victory. Brazil, which had not lost a competitive home game since 1975, has dominated encounters between the two sides in recent years. On the 26 occasions Chile had ventured onto Brazilian turf to face the host nation, it had lost 20 and drawn six -- not a record to inspire confidence ahead of a last-16 clash. Add to that Brazil's victory over Chile in South Africa four years ago and it's easy to understand why Scolari's men headed into the contest as the favorite. But this Chile side, coached by the irrepressible Jorge Sampaoli, appears to have little interest in history. Its victory over world champion Spain during the group stage gave a glimpse of the talent within the squad and led by the prolific Alexis Sanchez, it soon gave notice that it was not about to allow Brazil to simply swat it aside. Even when it fell behind, Jara, inadvertently directing Thiago Silva's header into his own net off eventual goalscorer David Luiz, Chile refused to buckle. Playing with an energy and intensity which belied the energy sapping conditions, the visiting side soon crafted an equalizer, which perhaps owed more to Brazil's poor defending than any Chilean magic. A careless pass allowed Chile to pick up possession and Sanchez weaved his way into the penalty area before carefully placing the ball beyond the outstretched arm of Julio Cesar. The Barcelona forward, who has scored 10 goals in his past 14 international games, has been his side's talisman throughout the tournament -- and his pace, power and trickery continued to cause Brazil problems. But where Sanchez managed to shine, Neymar, the man who had lit up this World Cup, failed to find his way into the contest. The 22-year-old, who had scored four goals in his opening three games, received a kick in the first half which appeared to leave him struggling. But Brazil's golden boy, even when not fully fit, still managed to cause problems and his header from an Oscar cross flew narrowly wide as the host nation threatened. Minutes later, Neymar was at it again -- this time leaving the Chilean defense for dead only for the much maligned Fred to lash the ball harmlessly over the crossbar. After a fierce and frantic first half, both teams emerged in more cautious manner following the interval. Chile, so disciplined in defense and careful in possession, appeared to be the calmer of the two as nerves began to creep into Brazil's game. And yet, for all of Brazil's inability to keep the ball, it still looked the more threatening. As those draped in yellow packed inside the Estadio Mineirao began to raise their voices, its players began to respond. But instead of the goal it so badly craved, Brazil could only find frustration. Hulk, the man with a comic book hero's name but with the first touch of a dastardly villain, thought he had found a way through. The forward took Marcelo's long ball on his chest but the ball appeared to roll down his arm before he fired the ball past Claudio Bravo. As the Brazilians around the world rejoiced, the whistle of English referee Howard Webb could scarcely be heard. First, there was disbelief. Then there was frustration. Then anger. Webb's call looked to have taken the wind out of Brazil's sails -- and it could have been heading out of the tournament but for a wonderful save by Cesar. Mauricio Isla made his way down the right and his cross picked out the tireless Charles Aranguiz, whose effort was brilliantly parried by the Brazilian goalkeeper. With both sets of players appearing to settle for extra-time, chances were at a premium, although Bravo denied both Neymar and Hulk as the clock ticked down. Extra time became a war of attrition with both sides guilty of giving the ball away and both sets of players desperate not to lose rather than being desperate to win. And yet, with a minute of extra time remaining, Chile came within millimeters of dumping Brazil out of the World Cup. Maurico Pinilla, a substitute, received the ball just outside the penalty area before swiveling sharply and smashing an audacious effort against the crossbar. ""That near goal right at the end has been really hard for us,"" Chile coach Sampaoli told reporters. ""If we had scored, we would have made history for ever. It would have been the 'Mineirazo'. We so nearly won."" With the crossbar still shaking, both sets of players were left to confront the dreaded scenario of penalty kicks. Luiz was the first man to step up -- showing no sign of being overawed by the occasion and coolly firing the ball past Bravo. Then it was left to Cesar to steal the show as he denied Pinilla and Sanchez with two fine saves. Brazil appeared to be coasting but there was still a twist in the tale as Willian and then Hulk both failed and Aranguiz and Marcelo Diaz brought Chile level. Neymar then showed nerves of steel to put Brazil back in front before Jara struck his effort against the inside of the post. Up stepped Jara -- the weight of a nation upon his shoulders and a sea of yellow shirts which would drown him given the chance. The defender stepped up and struck his kick to the goalkeeper's left only for the ball to hit the inside of the post and roll away to safety. First, there was silence. Then came the roar -- the outpouring of relief. Then the singing, the dancing, the realization that Brazil's dream remains alive. While Chile's players fell to the ground inconsolable with grief, Brazil's ran into each others arms and celebrated. Lucky? Fortuitous? Nobody wearing yellow will care. The dream lives on.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A senior al Qaeda leader and another member of the terrorist network were killed in a security operation by Afghan and coalition forces, NATO said Tuesday. Sakhr al-Taifi, a Saudi al Qaeda leader, and the other al Qaeda member, who was not identified, were killed Sunday in the eastern Kunar province, NATO's International Security Assistance Force said in a statement. Al-Taifi, also known as Musthaq and Nasim, was al Qaeda's second-highest leader in Afghanistan, responsible for commanding foreign insurgents and directing attacks against coalition and Afghan forces, NATO said. He frequently traveled between Afghanistan and Pakistan, carrying out commands from senior al Qaeda leadership, according to NATO. He also supplied weapons and equipment to Eastern insurgents and managed the illegal transport of insurgent fighters into Afghanistan, NATO said. After identifying al-Taifi and the other al-Qaeda terrorist, and ensuring no civilians were in the area, ISAF engaged the targets with a precision airstrike. A follow-up assessment of the area determined no civilian property was damaged and no civilians were harmed, ISAF said.","Sakhr al-Taifi, a Saudi al Qaeda leader, and another al Qaeda member are killed .

"(CNET) -- On an otherwise placid holiday weekend, one blog's commentary on a change to Facebook's terms of service created a firestorm of banter on the Web: does the social network claim ownership to any user content on the site, even if the user deletes it? Facebook is addressing users' concerns about its ownership of images and other content. Facebook reorganized its terms of service last Wednesday. In a blog post, company legal representative Suzie White provided an explanation. ""We used to have several different documents that outlined what people could and could not do on Facebook, but now we're consolidating all this information to one central place,"" White wrote. ""We've also simplified and clarified a lot of information that applies to you, including some things you shouldn't do when using the site."" The blog post sounded benign. But the brouhaha arose on Sunday over a revision in the wording of Facebook's policy over what happens to profile content--shared items, blog post-like ""notes,"" photos--when members delete their accounts. Consumer advocacy blog The Consumerist phrased Facebook's fresh policy as ""We Can Do Anything We Want With Your Content. Forever,"" pointing out that Facebook's ToS spruce-up removed several sentences in which the company said its licenses on user content expired upon account deletion. And that's where the hysteria began. ""Facebook should now be called The Information Blackhole,"" one Consumerist commenter proclaimed. ""What goes in never comes out. Be careful what you huck in there."" Truth be told, most Facebook users won't give a hoot, the same way that the flurry over the Beacon advertising program in late 2007 was fueled by a few vocal privacy advocates while the general population didn't seem to care about it one way or the other. But for advocates of copyright reform and privacy, not to mention photographers and writers who may want the photos they upload or ""notes"" they write on Facebook to eventually lead to some kind of profit, the news was alarming. Some prominent Twitterers and bloggers, like New Yorker music critic Sasha Frere-Jones, announced that they were deleting their Facebook accounts or pulling all uploaded content. So Facebook issued somewhat of a clarification on Monday to explain what the change really meant. ""We are not claiming and have never claimed ownership of material that users upload,"" a statement from Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt read. And indeed, Facebook's terms of service do say that ""User Content and Applications/Connect Sites"" are exempt from its claims on content ownership. ""The new Terms were clarified to be more consistent with the behavior of the site,"" Schnitt's statement continued. ""That is, if you send a message to another user (or post to their wall, etc...), that content might not be removed by Facebook if you delete your account (but can be deleted by your friend)."" The statement also noted a few fine points. First, Facebook's license only permits it to use user content ""in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof,"" indicating that CEO Mark Zuckerberg does not plan to make the site profitable by selling scandalous user photos to the National Enquirer when those Facebook members run for elected office. And second, if that Facebook content was not public, the site will respect the member's chosen privacy settings. In other words, if your profile and the photos you have uploaded to it are only accessible to people on your friends list, Facebook says it does not have the right to show those photos to anyone outside your friends list. Facebook has expressed disapproval when photographs and profile screenshots normally protected by the site's login wall or privacy settings have been made public on the Web. The site reportedly threatened gossip blog mogul Nick Denton with an account deletion when one of his properties, Gawker, posted photographs found on a socialite's Facebook profile. Suffice it to say it would be hypocritical for Facebook to publicly distribute, let alone sell, the same content itself. Things are a little bit murky for sure, though. Unlike the Yahoo-owned Flickr, Facebook does not have extensive copyright preferences, meaning that a professional photographer might want to choose a media-sharing site where there's less of a gray area as to what can actually happen down the road. But as Facebook becomes more and more of a content-sharing hub, especially now that the Facebook Connect product expands its reach to third-party sites, it's likely there will be a louder cry among members--especially those involved in creative industries who use their Facebook profiles for professional promotion or publicity--for clearer terms. iReport.com: Too much information posted online? The way they stand now, Facebook's terms of service claim that the company does not have ownership over content, yet that it does have ""an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (to)...use, copy, publish, stream, store, retain, publicly perform or display, transmit, scan, reformat, modify, edit, frame, translate, excerpt, adapt, create derivative works, and distribute"" material as long as it doesn't violate the privacy preferences set by the user. Considering Facebook content is login-protected by default, the outcry should be quelled somewhat by that ""subject only to your privacy settings"" phrasing. Still, this is a debate that might not go away so quickly. Zuckerberg wrote a post for the Facebook blog later on Monday about the issue: ""We still have work to do to communicate more clearly about these issues, and our terms are one example of this,"" he wrote. ""Our philosophy that people own their information and control who they share it with has remained constant. A lot of the language in our terms is overly formal and protective of the rights we need to provide this service to you. Over time we will continue to clarify our positions and make the terms simpler."" Zuckerberg continued: ""We're at an interesting point in the development of the open online world where these issues are being worked out. It's difficult terrain to navigate and we're going to make some missteps, but as the leading service for sharing information we take these issues and our responsibility to help resolve them very seriously."" © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc.

"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Thirty-eight al Qaeda militants were killed in clashes with Yemen's military, local security officials said Friday. At least 15 troops also died in the violence Thursday morning in the southern provinces of Abyan and Lahjj, the officials said. Dozens were also wounded in a fierce battle involving several army brigades and the air force, state-run news agency SABA said. Militant leaders and foreign elements were among those killed, the news agency said. The Yemeni government this week blamed an affiliate of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for a massive suicide bombing Monday that killed more than 100 soldiers. Jihadist websites posted a statement purportedly from the group, Ansaar al-Sharia, claiming responsibility for the attack. But CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the statement. The partially lawless Middle Eastern country has become a central battleground in the fight against al Qaeda. The terror network's leader recently called for an uprising against the nation's new president. The Yemeni branch of the group calls itself al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula; Ansaar al-Sharia is an affiliate of AQAP.","Dozens of al Qaeda militants died in clashes with Yemeni forces, security officials say .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. default on its debt would be ""devastating"" for the global economy and would hit the poor particularly hard, World Bank president Jim Yong Kim told CNN's Richard Quest Wednesday. Quest spoke to Kim in Washington D.C., where the world's economic and political world leaders have gathered for the annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. READ MORE: Will glitches derail Obamacare? The meetings come in the shadow of a partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government and amid fears the world's largest economy will be unable to pay all its bills later this month due to failure by politicians to raise the country's borrowing limit. On Tuesday, President Barack Obama said he was ready to talk about Republicans' demands in an effort to end the stand-off, but he wanted Congress to first end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling, even if just for a short period. Kim said he did not want to comment on the politics but those involved in the wrangling needed to remember that ""even if there is something heroic right at the end...it's having an impact on the little guys.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration has dramatically ratcheted up the American drone warfare program in Pakistan. Since President Obama took office, U.S. drone strikes have killed about a half-dozen militant leaders along with hundreds of other people, a quarter of whom were civilians. As a result of the unprecedented 42 strikes by drone aircraft into Pakistan authorized by the Obama administration, aimed at Taliban and al Qaeda networks based there, about a half-dozen leaders of militant organizations have been killed. The dead include two heads of Uzbek terrorist groups allied with al Qaeda and Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, in addition to hundreds of lower-level militants and civilians, according to our analysis. The number of civilian deaths caused by the drones is an important issue, because in the charged political atmosphere of today's Pakistan, where anti-Americanism is rampant, the drone program is a particular cause of anger among those who see it as an infringement on Pakistan's sovereignty. A Gallup poll in August found that only 9 percent of Pakistanis favored the strikes, and two-thirds opposed them. And, according to Philip Alston, a U.N. human rights investigator, the use of drones to carry out targeted assassinations that end up killing civilians may well violate international law. On Tuesday at a news conference in New York, Alston publicly warned that unless the Obama administration explains what the legal basis is for selecting the individuals targeted by drone attacks, ""it will increasingly be perceived as carrying out indiscriminate killings in violation of international law."" An important factor in the controversy over the drones, put forth by some commentators, is the widespread perception that they kill large numbers of Pakistani civilians. Amir Mir, a leading Pakistani journalist, wrote in The News in April that since January 2006, American drone attacks had killed ""687 innocent Pakistani civilians."" A month later, a similar claim was made in the New York Times by counterinsurgency experts David Kilcullen and Andrew Exum, who wrote that drone strikes had ""killed some 700 civilians. This is 50 civilians for every militant killed, a hit rate of 2 percent."" In other words, in their analysis, 98 percent of those killed in drone attacks were civilians. Kilcullen and Exum advocated a moratorium on the strikes because of the ""public outrage"" they arouse. A very different picture was presented this month by the Long War Journal, an American blog that closely tracks terrorist groups, in particular al Qaeda and the Taliban. Bill Roggio, the editor of Long War Journal, concluded that according to his close analysis of the drone strikes, only 10 percent of those killed were civilians. Our analysis suggests quite different conclusions than those of either Kilcullen and Exum or the Long War Journal. But first, a word on our methodology. Our analysis of the drone campaign is based only on accounts from reliable media organizations with substantial reporting capabilities in Pakistan. We restricted our analysis to reports in the New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal; accounts by major news services and networks -- the Associated Press, Reuters, Agence France-Presse, CNN and the BBC -- and reports in the leading English-language newspapers in Pakistan -- The Daily Times, Dawn and The News -- as well as those from Geo TV, the largest independent Pakistani television network. (Links to all those individual reports can be found here.) The news organizations we relied upon collectively for our data cover the drone strikes as accurately and aggressively as possible. And though we don't pretend that our study is accurate down to the last civilian death in every drone strike, we posit that our research has generated some quite reliable data on the number of militant leaders killed, a fairly good estimate of the number of lower-level militants killed and a reliable sense of the real civilian death rate. Since 2006, our analysis indicates, 83 U.S. drone attacks in Pakistan have killed between 760 and 1,050 people. Among them were about 20 leaders of al Qaeda, the Taliban and allied groups, all of whom have been killed since January 2008. It is not possible to differentiate precisely between militant and civilian casualties, because the militants live among the population and don't wear uniforms and because the militants have the incentive to claim that all the casualties were civilians, but government sources tend to claim the opposite. However, of those killed in drone attacks from 2006 through mid-October 2009, approximately 500 to 720 were described in reliable press reports as militants, or roughly two-thirds of the total killed. Based on our count of the estimated number of militants killed, the real total of civilian deaths since 2006 appears to be in the range of 260 to 320, or one-third of those killed. That finding tracks with polling by the Aryana Institute for Regional Research and Advocacy, described by The News of Pakistan as ""a think tank of researchers and political activists"" that works in the Pakistani tribal region along the Afghan border, where the drone attacks have consistently taken place. It found that more than half the people surveyed in winter 2008 in this region, known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, said the drone strikes were accurate and were damaging the militant organizations based there. Under President Obama, the strikes have taken out at most half a dozen militant leaders while killing approximately 450 other people. Of those, about 75 percent are reported to have been lower-level militants, and about a quarter appear to have been civilians. The strikes appear to have killed a slightly lower percentage of civilians in the past nine months than during the earlier years of the American drone campaign in Pakistan. Obama, far from curtailing the drone program he inherited from President George W. Bush, has dramatically increased the number of U.S. Predator and Reaper drone strikes. There have been 44 strikes in Pakistan this year (two while Bush was still in office), compared with 34 in all of 2008. None of the strikes under either Bush or Obama has targeted Osama bin Laden, who seems to have vanished like a wraith. The leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, the mastermind of Benazir Bhutto's December 2007 assassination and many of the suicide bombings in Afghanistan, was a frequent target of the drone attacks. Under Obama, according to our analysis, 15 drone strikes specifically targeted Mehsud. But he still didn't see it coming. On August 5, Mehsud, a diabetic former gym instructor, was receiving a leg massage on the roof of a house in South Waziristan when a missile from a drone slammed into his hideout, killing one of his wives, her father and the terrorist chief himself. The Pakistani press was jubilant. ""Good Riddance, Killer Baitullah"" was the lead headline in the quality Dawn newspaper. Much of the previous coverage in Pakistan of U.S. drone strikes in the tribal region had ranged from critical to downright hostile. But in the case of Mehsud, U.S. strategic interests and Pakistani interests were closely aligned because the Pakistani Taliban's victims included not only Bhutto, the country's most popular politician, but hundreds of Pakistani policemen, soldiers and civilians. As the drone attacks have put al Qaeda and allied groups under increased pressure, law enforcement authorities have uncovered few serious plots against U.S. or European targets that are traceable back to militants who had trained in Pakistan's tribal regions since summer 2008, when the drone program was first expanded. A major exception is Najibullah Zazi, a onetime coffee-cart operator on Wall Street who later worked as a shuttle van driver at the Denver, Colorado, airport. Authorities say Zazi, an Afghan immigrant, was planning to launch this fall what could have been the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since September 11. He had traveled in late August 2008 to Pakistan, where by his own admission he was trained in explosives by al Qaeda members in a tribal area along the Afghan border. The FBI found pages of handwritten notes on Zazi's laptop computer about the manufacture and initiation of explosives and the components of various detonators and fusing systems, technical know-how he had picked up at one of al Qaeda's training facilities between late summer 2008 and January 2009, a period of intensified drone attacks. Drone strikes are an important tool to disrupt al Qaeda and Taliban operations and to kill the leaders of these organizations, but they also consistently kill Pakistani civilians, angering the population and prompting violent acts of revenge from the Pakistani Taliban. For the time being, however, they appear to be the least bad option the United States has for reducing the threat from Pakistan's militants, given that an American ground assault into Pakistan's tribal regions is out of the question and that U.S. and Pakistani strategic interests are more closely aligned today than they have been in years because of the two countries' shared interest in attacking the Pakistani Taliban and their al Qaeda allies. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann.

"(CNN) -- Al Qaeda militants seized control of a military base and two checkpoints during raids in southern Yemen on Monday in which at least 30 people died, security officials and residents said. Hours of firefights erupted after the militants hit an army barracks in the Loder district of Abyan province in an assault that included heavy artillery, according to the officials. The dead included 17 militants, 11 soldiers and two members of pro-government tribes, they said. This is the second militant attempt to take over Loder this year. The first was in early January. Last week, Yemen poured thousands of troops into the country's south to battle al Qaeda fighters and tighten security, officials said. Yemeni warplanes bombarded al Qaeda hideouts all week in a series of U.S.-supported airstrikes in Abyan and Lahj provinces. The offensive came after militants killed dozens of troops and seized large quantities of weapons when they raided a military zone. Numerous other Yemeni soldiers were taken hostage, officials said. Yemen's al Qaeda movement has expanded its control over parts of the country in the past year, leading politicians to consider the option of dialogue with the militant network.","Militants hit an army barracks in Abyan province, officials say .

"Washington (CNN) -- Insurgents were able to use a mass-market software program to view live feeds from U.S. military Predator drones monitoring targets in Iraq, a U.S. official indicated to CNN Thursday. The breach by Iranian-backed Shiite militants was discovered late last year, according to U.S. military and defense officials. The story was first reported in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the information, said no U.S. troops or combat missions had been compromised because of the intrusion. There also is evidence that unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) feeds also have been hacked in Afghanistan, according to the Journal article, but there was no evidence the militants were able to take control of the remote aircrafts' systems in either country. The inexpensive software, created by a Russian company called SkyGrabber, is downloadable off the Internet. It allows users to take advantage of unprotected communication links in some of the UAVs. A senior defense official who was not authorized to speak about the security breach said, ""This was an old issue for us and it has been taken care of,"" but he would not elaborate on what specifically had been taken care of. The official said that many of the UAV feeds need to be sent out live to numerous people at one time, and encryption was found to slow the real-time link. The encryption therefore was removed from many feeds. Removing the encryption, however, allowed outsiders with the correct tools to gain unauthorized access to these feeds. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman would not comment on any of the article's details but said that any security breaches that arise are addressed. ""The department constantly evaluates and seeks to improve both the performance as well as the security of various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems and platforms,"" Whitman said. ""If and when we identify any shortfalls we obviously correct them as a continuous process of seeking both improved capabilities as well as improved security."" Lt. Gen. David Deptula, who is in charge of the Air Force's UAV mission, said the military is trying to fix vulnerabilities with improved encryption on UAV feeds. ""Those kinds of things are subject to listening and exploitation,"" he told reporters Wednesday when asked about vulnerabilities of UAV systems. One U.S. official said special operations troops identified the threat ""years ago"" in Iraq and over the past two years have been ""vastly improving"" encryption on their various communications systems, including full-motion video. The official said the United States generally can operate these systems with impunity in third-world countries that don't have the technology to tap into open satellite feeds. However, according to the official, Iran has been pushing the SkyGrabber-like technology to Shiite militants in Iraq essentially to see what the United States is looking at because Iranians believe they will be invaded next. The vulnerability could date back to the 1990s, said Peter Singer, a military technology analyst for the Brookings Institution. ""In fact, in the Balkans, people with any satellite dish were able to intercept the communications from these systems, and watch special operations raids in Bosnia while sitting in their home,"" he said. Before the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, it is believed Saddam Hussein was able to monitor drone feeds. The Iraqis ""located and downloaded the unencrypted satellite feed from U.S. military UAVs,"" a 2005 CIA report surmised. The U.S. military and intelligence operations use pilotless drones in Iraq and Afghanistan both for surveillance and to fire missiles at targets. While the CIA has never publicly acknowledged it, the agency operates the unmanned planes in Pakistan, where it has used drones to strike at Taliban and al Qaeda operatives, according to officials familiar with the strategy. But a U.S. official with knowledge of CIA and military UAV missions told CNN the drones used in Pakistan missions use encrypted feeds and are not vulnerable to hacking like the military drones used in Iraq. The official said the drones employed by the intelligence community in Pakistan, which use state-of-the-art encryption technology, are used in a much more limited capacity than the military drones. One of the developers of the SkyGrabber technology told CNN via e-mail that the software was developed to pull unprotected satellite feeds so that people in Russia could watch TV or gain access to the Internet in areas otherwise unable to get such signals. ""The software is intercepting data received from a satellite dish -- it doesn't say whether or not the data is classified, let alone that it is military data,"" said Andrew Solonikov. He said the U.S. military has not contacted him about the reported security breach. ""Even if I wanted to do something about it, I wouldn't know what to do,"" he said. Solonikov insisted the software was not developed for the use it has been put to in Iraq. ""[It seems that] somebody has invented a way to use this program outside of its intended purpose,"" he said. ""But generally speaking, this points to a large security gap that the American military has missed."" CNN's Pam Benson and Michael Sefanov contributed to this report.","U.S. official: Insurgents used mass-market software program to view live drone feeds .

"(CNN) -- It used to be called ""fringe"" or ""unconventional"" medicine -- or simply quackery. Today, it's called ""alternative,"" ""complementary,"" ""holistic"" or ""integrative."" And it has moved into the mainstream. Hospitals now have dietary supplements on their formularies (list of stocked medications); offer reiki masters to cancer patients; or teach medical students how to manipulate healing energies. Forty-two percent of hospitals offered some form of alternative therapies to their patients, according to a 2010 survey of 5,800 facilities. When asked why, almost all responded ""patient demand."" Further, private practitioners encourage megavitamins, dietary supplements, acupuncture, chiropractic, homeopathy and naturopathy. Although nontraditional therapies can be valuable, sometimes a line is crossed. So how can you tell if your alternative healer is a quack? Here are a few red flags: . The therapist offers medicines that don't work instead of those that do . Steve Jobs, for example, suffered from a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. With early surgery, Jobs had a 95% chance of recovery. But Jobs chose acupuncture, herbal remedies, and bowel cleansings instead, and died as a consequence. Homeopaths have recommended their products (which are diluted to the point that active ingredients aren't there anymore) for treatable diseases such as cancer, malaria, cholera and AIDS. In 2006, a 6-year-old boy with severe asthma was treated with a homeopathic remedy instead of the bronchodilator that would have saved his life. In Canada, homeopathic vaccines, which have no chance of preventing illness, are worrisomely popular. Also, naturopaths' objections to the contrary, many studies have shown that garlic doesn't lower low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (bad cholesterol), chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine don't treat arthritis, and saw palmetto doesn't treat prostatic enlargement; in each of these cases, conventional treatments are available that actually do work. Warning: Men's natural sex supplements may not be . The therapist doesn't tell you about the dangers of alternative therapies . Alternative medicine is perceived as more natural and less harmful than conventional medicine. But medicine is medicine, and any drug or therapy that has a positive effect can have a negative effect. For example, at least 86 people have died when acupuncture needles have lodged in hearts, lungs or livers or inadvertently transmitted viruses like hepatitis A, hepatitis B, or HIV. Chiropractic manipulations have killed at least 26 people, virtually all by ripping the vertebral artery in the neck. Dietary supplements also have unseen harms. For example, kava can cause severe and occasionally fatal liver damage; blue cohosh can cause heart failure; nutmeg can cause hallucinations; comfrey can cause hepatitis; monkshood can cause heart arrythmias; wormwood can cause seizures; stevia leaves can decrease fertility, concentrated green tea extracts can damage the liver, bitter orange can cause heart damage, and Aristolochia, found in Chinese herbs, can cause kidney failure and bladder cancer. Because dietary supplements and herbs aren't regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, most people don't know about these problems. The therapist makes a fortune off your misfortune . Perhaps no one is more susceptible to quackery than parents of children with autism: a disorder without a clear cause or cure. Bogus treatments have included ion-exchange machines, lymphatic drainage massage, electrical or magnetic stimulation, Rife machines, hyperbaric oxygen chambers, intravenous immunoglobulins, and stem-cell transplantation. Some of these same therapies are offered for ""chronic"" Lyme disease and cancer. Dramatically different disorders, identical cures. All quite expensive and all without any chance of actually working. Docs should know about kids and alternative medicine . The therapist promotes 'magical thinking' Reiki masters who claim they can manipulate healing energies; chiropractors who claim that all diseases are caused by misaligned spines; homeopaths who claim that their highly diluted potions contain even a single molecule of an active ingredient; acupuncturists who claim that healing can only be achieved by balancing yin and yang; or naturopaths who claim that a drug found in nature is different from a drug synthesized by a pharmaceutical company (when they have the exact same molecular structure) are appealing to our sense of magic. And although the notion of something beyond our level of understanding is attractive, current gaps in medical knowledge aren't going to be filled by energy fields, acupuncture meridians, or the notion that all things natural must be good for you. ""Isn't it enough to see that a garden is beautiful,"" wrote Douglas Adams in ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"" ""without having to believe that there are fairies at the bottom of it, too."" Like conventional therapies, alternative remedies shouldn't be given a free pass. They should be held to the same high standards of safety and efficacy. And where scientific studies don't exist, we should insist that they be performed. Otherwise, we'll continue to be susceptible to the worst kinds of quackery.

"(CNN) -- As scenic drives go, the Monaco Grand Prix is not a bad one. Squeezed into a two-mile circuit looping around the streets of Monte Carlo are views of the world-famous casino, five-star hotels, A-list celebrities and a splash of the azure waters of the Mediterranean Sea. The principality on the French Riviera covers less than a square mile -- just half the size of New York's Central Park -- but its legendary grand prix weekend packs a sensual punch despite its diminutive size. ""It's special,"" two-time Monaco Grand Prix winner Mark Webber tells CNN. ""You've got the ocean, the background of the cliffs ... If they can't build a nice bit of road in Monaco, where can they do it?"" It's an unparalleled experience that stimulates all five senses for all involved. Sight . From the open cockpit of an F1 car, hitting top speeds of 176 mph, the 22 drivers who line up for Sunday's race have a unique perspective on Monaco. ""Starting the lap you see the apartments, the five and six-storey buildings around the outside of the track,"" explains Webber, who finished his F1 career with world champions Red Bull Racing last season. ""You drive very close to the Casino, the top of the Hotel de Paris then, when you come along the harbor, you know there's water on the left and boats. ""The drivers do see things from a very different perspective -- if you went around the track sitting on a little skateboard then that is the same height we're at in the F1 cars. You know all these sights are there but you don't see much of them."" The squeezed crowd on the sidelines gets closer to the racing action than at any other F1 circuit in the world, and the Monaco GP is almost as famous for people-spotting as it is for the racing spectacle. The four-day weekend attracts a 200,000-strong crowd as racing fans, royals and the rich and famous mingle in Monte Carlo, peering from their pews on hotel balconies and yachts, grandstands and roadsides. Smell . Stirling Moss, a three-time race winner in Monaco between 1956 and 1961, remembered cheekily waving at female fans as he drove around the principality. ""When I won there in 2012 I could literally see the crowd standing up out of their seats in the last few laps,"" recalls Webber. ""Another classic thing about Monaco for me was recognizing some of the photographers as they're standing inside the barriers taking photos. ""There's been quite a few scenarios when you actually spot someone you know! On other tracks you don't see that."" Hearing . Racing around Monte Carlo's elegant, legendary circuit is not just a visual sensation -- the magic of Monaco piques each of the five senses. ""You might get a bit of the salt water,"" says Webber, pondering whether there was a particular scent in the Monaco air. ""I actually always thought it was cooler through the harbor section of the lap because you got a bit of a sea breeze -- but maybe that was a driver clutching at straws on a hot race day! ""The echo in the tunnel is also very unique. The tunnel is quite low so the cars used to be very loud through there."" Touch . When it comes to the business of the race weekend -- points and podiums -- it is a racing driver's instinct for feeling that is the sense that counts the most. An F1 car may have high-tech sensors on every corner funneling information back to the engineering boffins on the pit wall, but no machine can understand what it feels like to grapple with the exacting streets of Monaco from the seat of the world's fastest racing cars. ""When you're driving you feel it in your butt, hips and back,"" reveals the 37-year-old Webber, who put his body through 217 grands prix before moving to endurance racing in Porsche sports cars in 2014. ""You also pick up sensations through your hands on the steering wheel. ""You're constantly putting information in the library in terms of sensation, grip level and how close you can go to the barriers. ""When you get out of the car after a couple of fast qualifying laps in Monaco, your heart rate is probably as high as anywhere it's ever going to be and you're sweating a bit more. ""You know what's at stake, any small error and you're going to pay a big, big price."" Over the last six decades of the F1 world championship, there have been layout changes to Monaco's street circuit but the precipitous, narrow racing roads remain largely unchanged. The odd drain cover and fence might have been replaced but, unlike the purpose-built racing circuits in Bahrain and Texas, there are no runoff areas or pace-slowing pools of gravel traps. If a driver loses concentration, he can find himself in the wall or following Albert Ascari's fabled 1955 dip into the Mediterranean. Even the fearless Ayrton Senna -- who won the Monaco GP a record six times -- admitted to reeling in his racing instincts around Monte Carlo. The Brazilian, who was killed in a crash at the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix, famously spoke of entering a trance-like state as he attacked the Monaco track. ""I felt the circuit was no longer really a circuit ... I suddenly realized that I was over the level that I considered reasonable,"" Senna said after dominating qualifying at the 1988 Monaco GP, though he spun out late in the actual race while leading. ""I think every racing driver can try to relate to what he was talking about,"" Webber says. ""He did some laps round there which were two seconds clear of the field, which is unheard of. ""But at Monaco, more so than anywhere, the most important thing is the next corner, so all of your energy and concentration to get the car on the limit through the next corner is incredible. ""It's going to drive you to that narrower focus point that Ayrton touched on a lot around there, because that's what the track demands. ""Physically Monaco is not that draining but mentally it is massive."" Taste . Each year, the ability to master the senses in Monaco rewards one driver with the sweetest sensation of them all -- quaffing champagne from the top step of the podium. ""I'm not big into the red carpet stuff,"" Webber says with a dose of his down-to-earth Australian understatement. ""But Monaco is up there for us as drivers and as race teams. ""You have the victory champagne on the race track, which is brilliant. We spray the champagne over the mechanics, whoever's in sight. Generally we try to spray the police but they're a bit serious so we give them a nudge. ""Then we spray the car and the track. It's how it should be, in my opinion. A lot of traditional things have been lost but Monaco still has those in abundance. ""To win in Monaco is certainly worth a few victories. There are a few guys who'd like to have that one -- and it's certainly a proud moment for me."" The Monaco Grand Prix remains one of the most challenging races for any driver but, odd as it may seem, the F1 cockpit offers a form of escapism. With charity football matches and fashion shows to attend, not to mention catching a skiff from one side of the harbor to the other, the drivers are in danger of sensory overload. ""The first thing that hits you at Monaco compared to other tracks is how claustrophobic it is,"" adds Webber, who chose not to join peers such as Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in making Monaco his home. ""It is a bit of a zoo because it's such a small area and you have so many people there. ""There are some quiet areas. On a Friday I always went for a ride on my bike and got away from Monaco altogether. ""It's difficult to explain to people who haven't been there, but you've got to have tried pretty hard to get away from the chaos."" It may be the slowest, shortest, smallest grand prix of the year, but when it comes to epicurean delights and distraction Monaco remains F1's crown jewel.

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Students at a school outside Atlanta were in hot water Wednesday after they reportedly hung a banner from their school's roof that read, ""N---a We Made It."" The sign at South Forsyth High School may have been meant to celebrate graduation, but struck many as offensive. ""This morning, without our knowledge, students placed a derogatory sign with a verse from a song by Drake on our school as a senior prank,"" Principal Jeff Cheney said in a note to parents, referring to the rapper Drake. ""We removed it as soon as it was brought to our attention and deeply apologize for their behavior. This is unacceptable, and I promise you that the students will receive the appropriate consequences for their actions,"" the principal said. Susan Newsome, a parent of a student at the school in Cumming, Georgia, said she first heard about the banner from the principal's e-mail. ""South Forsyth has a very diverse population, so I was surprised and disappointed to hear that some students would think this banner was acceptable. It's hard to know the intentions behind the actions of these students, but I can't help but think that they knew it would cause controversy,"" she said. More than 70% of the student population at South Forsyth High School is white, while more than 10% is Hispanic, 12% is Asian and less than 5% is black, according to school statistics. ""Hopefully the actions today have initiated a lot of dinner conversation about how senior pranks should be lighthearted and clever, not mean-spirited and destructive,"" Newsome added. According to CNN affiliate WSB, the banner wasn't the only prank seniors pulled at the school. Students also reportedly turned a hallway into a slip and slide and put a for-sale sign on Cheney's car. The principal told the affiliate that some pranks are fun, while others are just not acceptable. ""There's many things I can live with, but the banner was what most offended me and our school.

"London (CNN) -- Art exhibitions don't usually float on water but the CNM Estates Fine Art Sails regatta, which debuted this weekend on London's River Thames, is no ordinary expose of contemporary culture. Part fine-art show, part boat-race, the three-day event saw 10 sailboats -- skippered by a host of Olympic and World Championship sailors -- take to the water bearing sails adorned with the work of some of Britain's foremost modern artists. Monochrome prints of giant facial features, manic flocks of imposing seagulls and a menacing child with tribal war-paints comprised just a few of the surreal and arresting works on show during a snow-blanketed weekend in the UK capital. Organizers say the concept marks a first of its kind collaboration between art and top-class sailing and could soon be casting off at famous waterside locations around the world. See also: Inside the mind of a yachting cartoonist . ""This is the first time anyone has really tried to do this and the reaction has been quite amazing,"" said the founder of Fine Art Sails, Michael Ross. ""There is already interest in staging an event on the [Moskva] River in view of the Kremlin,"" he said, adding the possibility of others in San Francisco, Miami and on the Caspian Sea. Artists who contributed works to the riverside event -- which formed part of the week-long London Boat Show -- include the fashion duo Mark Eley and Wakako Kishimoto, portrait artist Christian Furr, as well as musician and actor, Goldie. As Fine Art Sails moves on to other locations, Ross hopes creatives of all disciplines and nationalities will be inspired to add their handiwork to the project. ""It's a totally new way for artists to display their work,"" he explained. ""This event has given those involved the opportunity to try new things, display their art in a very public place and access to an audience they otherwise might not reach."" Ross also makes a point of highlighting the artistic difficulties encountered in this new mode of exhibition. See also: World's unluckiest boat bows out . Racing sails are generally made from Dacron, an ultra-lightweight cloth that differs greatly from some of the more the conventional materials artists use, such as canvas. The manner in which sails are designed to capture wind meanwhile ensures that any design, painting or print is constantly moving and changing shape when on the water, altering the appearance of the artwork in the process. According to British sculptor, David Begbie, who donated a print for the regatta entitled ""An Eye for the Buoys,"" tackling these unorthodox requirements was an enjoyable part of the creative process. ""The sails are a very rich concept for artists to work with and it has culminated in something of pretty majestic proportions,"" Begbie said. ""It's a versatile and adaptable format [which] when you think about it is basically a new kind of art form. ""Most artists work in a rectangular format but this creates a totally new shape,"" he added. See also: Computer hackers conquer high seas . Begbie's enthusiasm is shared by competing sailor and British Olympic gold medalist, Pippa Wilson. While unsure about the extent to which artistic sails can integrate into sailing at the very highest level -- where sails have to be as light as possible -- Wilson believes they can be a valuable asset in garnering the attention of a non-traditional sailing audience. ""This is something that has never been done before and hopefully it will add a little bit of culture to our sport,"" Said Wilson before taking to the water. ""I've been so lucky to be involved in sailing since a young age and know how wonderful it can be, so if an event like this can grab people's attention and get them involved then it will definitely have been worthwhile,"" she added.","The CNM Estates Fine Art Sails regatta debuted this weekend at London's Royal Victoria Dock .

"(CNN) -- The lawyer for Bryan Stow, the San Francisco Giants fan severely beaten at a Los Angeles Dodgers game in 2011, argued Thursday that the former owners of the Dodgers went cheap on safety, and that played a factor in his client's debilitating injuries. The attorney for former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt, meanwhile, countered by claiming Stow was drunk and aggressive at the time of the brawl that left Stow brain-damaged and disabled. So went the opening remarks at a civil trial in which Stow is suing the Dodgers and claiming the team had faulty security measure and defective facilities that contributed to the attack. Stow, who uses a wheelchair and lives with his parents in Capitola, California, wasn't in the courtroom, located two miles from Dodgers Stadium. Stow's attorney's, Thomas Girardi, told a jury that McCourt had an irresponsible approach to fan safety. ""(He) got rid of uniformed officers in (Dodger Stadium) because it was cheaper,"" said Thomas Girardi in his opening statement. Girardi argued that under McCourt, the Dodgers dropped the number of uniformed security officers from 120 in 2009 to 19 in 2011. Girardi said Stow's lawsuit is not against the current Dodger organization and its management group that includes NBA legend Magic Johnson. But the lawyer for McCourt and his former Dodgers management argued his clients acted reasonably, and called Stow intoxicated and aggressive before the assault. Stow's blood alcohol level was at least 0.16, which is twice the legal threshold for DUI in California, attorney Dana Fox said. ""This occurred due to a hot tempered, intoxicated flash firefight,"" attorney Fox told the jury. Fox argued the McCourt Dodgers spent a record $66,000 dollars on 2011 opening-day security against the rival Giants -- the day when Stow was severely beaten. Stow's mother, Elizabeth Stow, testified her son cannot walk or use the toilet unassisted. Stow wears adult diapers all day and a catheter at night, the mother said. ""He just doesn't have the sense that he had to go to the bathroom right now,"" Stow's mother, a former church secretary, said. Stow takes what seems to be an alphabet-long list of prescription drugs daily, from Ambien to Xarelto, she said. He takes 27 to 28 medicines a day, she added. Fox said no one disputes that the two men now serving time for the savage attack caused Stow's injuries, and he emphasized that no one from the Dodgers organization assaulted the former paramedic. In February, Marvin Norwood, 33, and Louie Sanchez, 31, were sentenced to four years and eight years, respectively, for their roles in Stow's beating. Stow's lawyer argued Thursday that Norwood and Sanchez began swearing and throwing food at Giants' fans in the second inning of the 2011 game and should have been thrown out by stadium security then. The lawsuit seeks a total of $50 million, mostly to cover Stow's long-term medical costs, for him and his two children.

"(CNN) -- Though Bill Clinton has received lots of attention for getting healthy since his 2004 heart surgery -- losing weight, exercising more, improving his diet -- associates of the former president Thursday stressed that Clinton continues to live at a breakneck pace and raised questions about the extent of his lifestyle changes. ""While he eats a lot better than he used to,"" one friend tells CNN, ""he certainly indulges every once in a while consistent with past behavior -- [for example] fries with his fish."" ""He still works long days and stays up very, very late,"" the friend said. ""He has gone from a frenetic pace to what most people would consider a frenetic pace. He's approaching Social Security, and he's living a life not that different from his 30s."" After undergoing quadruple bypass operation on four blocked arteries in 2004, word spread that Clinton had reformed the lifestyle that was immortalized in ""Saturday Night Live"" skits about the then-president jogging to McDonald's. When Clinton left the White House, his cholesterol level was 233, well above the recommended upper threshold of 200. And his so-called bad cholesterol jumped 40 points during his final year in office, to around 177 -- about 50 points above normal. After his surgery, Clinton stepped up his advocacy for fighting obesity. In 2005, he announced he was partnering with the American Heart Association to fight rising childhood obesity rates. The following year, he appeared before the National Governors Association to urge state executives to fight rising obesity rates, mentioning his McDonald's habit and wishing out loud for the fast-food chain's french fries to be cooked in olive oil. Even while crusading against obesity and appearing trimmer than in his White House days, however, Clinton has shied away from discussing lifestyle reforms since his surgery. ""I ate a lot of stuff that was high in fat. ... I ate a lot of it,"" the former president told CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, as he described his life before surgery in a 2005 interview. ""And you know, I just didn't think about it. And I didn't have regular exercise."" But Clinton has avoided giving details about his post-surgery diet and exercise routine. Friends say Clinton introduced healthier foods to his diet but hasn't written off fries and steaks entirely. And they stressed that his schedule is as nonstop as ever, with the president frequently skipping sleep until his next plane trip. ""[The] whole time I have known him -- goes back 20 years -- he's led a hectic life,"" said former Clinton adviser and CNN analyst David Gergen. ""[There] ought to be two Bill Clintons in order to keep up the pace he does. I think it has been especially relentless in the last few months."" Clinton's role as the United Nations special envoy for Haiti has taken him twice to the earthquake-ravaged nation and he is leading efforts to raise money for the hard-hit area. Douglas Band, a counselor to the former president, said Thursday -- citing the former president's doctors -- that the symptoms that provoked Clinton's hospitalization weren't related to work, diet or cholesterol. While keeping mostly mum on lifestyle changes, Clinton has opened up about his lifelong struggle with weight since undergoing surgery. In announcing the American Heart Association partnership in 2005, for instance, Clinton disclosed that he weighed 210 pounds by the time he was 15. ""I was probably in the last generation of Americans where people widely thought a fat baby was a healthy baby,"" Clinton told CNN's Gupta. ""I always battled my weight, all of the way through school."" In a series of 2007 ads for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, Clinton poked fun at his weight struggles. One spot showed the former president daydreaming about a cheese burger while running on a treadmill. ""Exercising is hard,"" a voice in the ad said, comparing it to the ease of attending an Iowa caucus. CNN's Dan Gilgoff and Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.","""He still works long days and stays up very, very late,"" the friend said .

"(CNN) -- On the surface of one of Saturn's icy moons, scientists have discovered the possible existence of a very important, life-sustaining element: liquid water. NASA scientists announced Monday the identification of 101 distinct geysers erupting on Saturn's moon Enceladus. Their analysis suggests that water, a crucial component for life beyond our planet, can reach the Saturnian moon's surface. First sighted in 2005, the geysers erupt from four ""tiger stripe"" fractures along the moon's south polar terrain and spew tiny ice particles and water vapor, NASA said in news release. After seven years of collecting mission data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft, scientists found the geysers to be powered by small hot spots -- the result of water vapor condensing and venting from subsurface seawater; thus, answering questions about the geysers' origins. Researchers had previously thought the ice particles and water vapor came from either frictional heat or from water vapor below the surface. ""Once we had these results in hand, we knew right away heat was not causing the geysers, but vice versa,"" said NASA adviser Carolyn Porco, who led the Cassini imaging team. ""It also told us the geysers are not a near-surface phenomenon, but have much deeper roots."" More space content: Supermoon linked to supercreativity? We think so .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- Confusion and uncertainty swirled in Libya over the results of a vote on Sunday by the interim parliament on a new interim prime minister as disagreements over the legality of the outcome have been raised. Initial reports indicated the country's General National Congress elected businessman Ahmad Mitig as interim prime minister Sunday. Mitig was sworn in after reportedly receiving 121 votes in a volatile debate in the GNC that included multiple votes. After Mitig was sworn in, the GNC gave him two weeks to form a government. ""We hope it is less than two weeks. As you know, we rushed because the country can not bear this. We need a government to grant a budget in the coming days. ... We wish him luck,"" said a deputy parliament speaker who was chairing Sunday's session. Then later Sunday, the First Deputy Speaker of Libya's interim parliament, Ezzedin al-Awami, announced that the vote naming Mitig as interim PM was invalid. The parliament first failed to elect the new Prime Minister after a confidence vote fell short of the 120 votes needed. It took two rounds of voting before Mitig emerged as the frontrunner for the post, but in another confidence vote, he received only 113 votes. Speaker al-Awami said in a letter posted to the Libyan interim government's Twitter account that the session was actually adjourned at this point, after Mitig failed the confidence vote and did not get the required 120 votes. ""... continuing the process, increasing the votes and announcing that the candidate won the vote of confidence to form a Cabinet, is an invalid procedure and illegal,"" he said in the letter. Al-Awami is the acting speaker and highest-ranking elected official in Libya. The government also posted a second letter by al-Awami. This one was addressed to the caretaker prime minister, Abdullah al-Thinni. Al-Thinni, the country's former defense minister, was chosen by parliament to temporarily take over for acting Prime Minister Ali Zeidan, who was voted out by parliament in March. Last month, al-Thinni was selected as the new Prime Minister, but he later stepped down after he and his family were attacked. He then agreed to continue as a caretaker until a new prime minister is chosen. In the letter, al-Awami asked al-Thinni to continue as caretaker Prime Minister until a new vote is held. Meanwhile, other parliament members insisted the vote on Mitig was legal and that he was rightfully elected interim Prime Minister. Until parliament reconvenes on Monday, it is not yet clear who the Libyan Prime Minister is. Political and security challenges are adding to the turmoil in the fledgling democracy. Libya's government has been unable to impose its authority over a myriad of militia groups that have grown in power and influence since the 2011 revolution that toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi.

"(CNN) -- The first ever video footage of a giant squid swimming in the ocean depths is ""an enormous breakthrough,"" according to a prominent marine conservationist who wrote a book about the quest to find the mysterious creatures. ""People have been searching for them for hundreds of years, literally,"" said Richard Ellis, the author of ""The Search for the Giant Squid: The Biology and Mythology of the World's Most Elusive Sea Creature."" Scientists and television broadcasters released images this week of the 10-foot-long giant squid they had filmed deep in the Pacific Ocean, far off the coast of the Japanese mainland, during hundreds of hours of underwater research. The discovery is significant for both science and mythology, in which giant squids have long played a notable role, Ellis said in an interview on CNN. ""We're going to learn how this thing moves,"" he said. ""How it swims, what it does with its arms when it swims."" He described the squid as having eight arms and ""two very, very long tentacles which it uses to grasp its prey."" Its limbs have suckers lined with sharp teeth. Monsters reminiscent of giant squids have been featured in fables and imagery through the ages, like the Kraken in Norse legend and the Scylla in Greek mythology. ""For a long time, people didn't even think they existed,"" Ellis said. The carcasses of dead giant squid that washed ashore eventually proved that the creatures were real, but finding live ones in the wild has proved extremely challenging. The first still photographs of one of the huge creatures were captured in 2004, and footage was taken of one floating on the surface of the water in 2006. But researchers and cameramen had never before managed to catch a glimpse of them in the ocean abyss where they live. The mission that finally tracked down the creature involved 55 dives in two special submersible vehicles that spent a total of more than 285 hours far beneath the waves. Some of the dives went deeper than 3,000 feet. The team of scientists and filmmakers on the mission came from a variety of institutions, including the National Science Museum of Japan, the Discovery Channel and the Japanese broadcaster NHK. They used equipment including ""ultra-sensitive camera systems with light invisible to squid, bio luminescent lures and secret squid attractants,"" the Discovery Channel said. NHK and the Discovery Channel say they plan to air their programs about the squid sighting this month.","The 10-foot-long giant squid was caught on tape deep in the Pacific Ocean .

"(CNN) -- Pull over for a second, America. We know it's hot out there. But Congress is about to decide whether your life on the road will get easier or be more difficult. In just over two weeks, the multibillion-dollar Federal Highway Trust Fund will hit a financial wall. Yes, another fiscal crisis. This time with the account that funds road and bridge projects. But unless Congress extends more funding by August 1, the Department of Transportation says the account balance will dip too low and the agency will start pulling back on money paid to states for transportation infrastructure. The House on Tuesday approved a nearly $11 billion proposal to keep the money flowing for about a year, and the Senate appears ready to follow up. Take in five ways this highway crisis could affect you: . 1. Your car repair bill: Seriously. According to AAA, the average American spends $324 a year on additional repairs and maintenance caused by poor road conditions. And that's just average. People in Los Angeles pay an estimated $832 a year because of bad roads, according to the nonpartisan TRIP organization which is funded by a variety of transit industry groups. It's $673 in New York City, $784 in Tulsa. It's a lot of money. And now, because of the uncertainty with the Highway Trust Fund, many states have delayed repair projects slated for coming months. Take New Hampshire, unhappy owner of massive cracks and potholes from the overly long winter. Thanks to congressional indecision, the state put off seven major paving projects and 11 other projects (including bridge repairs). That bump you feel from the road could be a crack in the Highway Trust Fund. 2. Prices at the pump: Brace yourself. The price of gasoline could go up. Not because of the federal gas tax, which is the main source of money for the highway trust fund. Congress hasn't raised the 18.4-cent fee in 20 years. (That's one reason the account itself is continually running out of fuel). But while ""tax"" has become a four-letter word for some in Washington, states are starting to see it as a solution. Eight states raised their gas taxes last July. Just last month, tax-averse New Hampshire enacted its first gas tax increase in 23 years. Even conservative Texas lawmakers are seriously considering it. 3. Traffic problems: Here's where things get really interesting. For some, the highway funding tangle could briefly improve their traffic situation. For others, it means a longer wait for help. Where will traffic improve? In a few places where road construction crews have derailed the usual traffic patterns. In those places, in the very short term, a freeze in funding could also freeze the hassle and bottlenecks caused by construction. Where will traffic take a hit? Places that need road or bridge expansions. Like southeast Iowa. A new $1 billion fertilizer plant is under construction near Ft. Madison and the state was planning to expand the nearby highway -- US 61 - from two-lanes to four. Instead, Iowa DOT spokesman Stuart Anderson said the start of that work is delayed at least until October. So, the heavy trucks going back and forth to the fertilizer work site share the road, a smaller road, with everyone else. Or Oklahoma, which is holding its breath, waiting as long as it can before delaying any work. Spokesman Terri Angier of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation said the state is planning to take bids for new road projects next week, but won't act on the bids until Congress agrees to a trust fund deal. Furthermore, if there's no deal by August, Angier said the Sooner State may suspend some major traffic projects already underway, including the widening of a major interstate, I-40, to a rapidly growing Oklahoma City suburb. And in Massachusetts, a state whose roads are known for their heavy traffic, ""the vast majority of MassDOT's road and bridge projects"" could grind to a halt, according to spokesman Michael Verseckes. He sent an e-mail, saying ""virtually everything would be forced to stop"" if the Highway Trust Fund started to run dry. 4. You've heard about the economy, right?: You may not be a construction worker. Or maybe you are. But you probably are someone who realizes the U.S. economy is still fragile. How much could a highway trust fund freeze hurt the economy? You may see some figures on the Web, but the truth is there is no reliable estimate for how many jobs could be affected, in part because not every state has decided exactly which projects to suspend. The White House Monday said it would mean ""many thousands"" of jobs. We do know this. The American Road & Transportation Builders Association estimates 1.7 million Americans are directly employed in road, bridge and transit construction. And another 1.7 million have jobs that supported by the road construction business or infrastructure they put in place. Just the loss of thousands of construction jobs alone -- at the height of construction season -- is something that could ripple out to everyone else in the economy. 5. Congress keeps acting badly, operating in crisis mode: Perhaps worst of all, lawmakers could walk away from this crisis, like they have from others, without any significant change in the impending fiscal problem. That's true whether they meet the August 1 deadline or not. But there appears to be movement toward a rare bipartisan solution. Senate Democratic leaders have agreed to pass a nearly $11 billion House measure that would extend the life of the Highway Trust Fund through next spring, CNN has learned. Two top Senate Democratic leadership sources said the plan is for the Senate to vote on the issue early next week. Multiple Democratic and Republican sources also said the House bill is expected to get strong bipartisan support in the Senate. Regardless of what happens with this deadline, the next Congress is likely to face another Highway Trust Fund crisis next May. Just in time for your Memorial Day.

"(CNN) -- A competitor has died and another is in hospital following a tragic end to the World Sauna Championships in southern Finland. Russian Vladimir Ladyzhenskiy died Saturday after taking part in the final of a competition in which contestants are required to withstand rising temperatures for as long as possible. Finnish finalist Timo Kaukonen was also taken to hospital for treatment, organizer Ossi Arvela said in a statement posted on the event's website. Images of the contest showed Ladyzhenskiy and Kaukonen sitting side by side in the sauna. Both contestants can then be seen lying on the ground, apparently doused in water. Ladyzhenskiy appears to be suffering from severe skin burns. ""The event was interrupted immediately after the accident. Competition organization grieves these sad events,"" Avela said. Finnish police and organizers are investigating the incident, Arvela said. But he said first aid personnel had been in place and all competitors taking part in the contest had provided doctor's certificates. ""All the rules were followed,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Perhaps the oddest part of Donald Sterling's interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper was the way he unloaded on Magic Johnson. It was the second time in about a month that the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers launched into tirade against the NBA Hall of Fame point guard, entrepreneur and philanthropist. In the recorded conversation that earned Sterling a lifetime ban from the NBA, he was caught telling friend V. Stiviano that he doesn't want her posting pictures with African-Americans, including Johnson. In Monday night's CNN interview with Anderson Cooper, he went further -- much further. ""What has he done? Can you tell me? Big Magic Johnson, what has he done?"" he said, turning the question on the CNN host. ""He's got AIDS. Did he do any business, did he help anybody in South LA? ""What kind of a guy goes to every city, has sex with every girl, then he catches HIV? Is that someone we want to respect and tell our kids about? I think he should be ashamed of himself. I think he should go into the background. But what does he do for the black people? He doesn't do anything."" So, let's ask the question: What has Magic Johnson ever done? As it turns out, quite a bit -- and he's been doing them for a long time. Sterling insists he's no racist, still slams Magic Johnson . He won championships . For more than three decades, Earvin Johnson has had the ""Magic"" touch. He led Michigan State to a national title in 1979 before going first in the NBA draft and winning the championship with the Los Angeles Lakers during his very first year in the league. The paycheck was nice too. Johnson signed a 25-year deal for $25 million. It was the longest and highest-paying gig in sports at the time. In 13 seasons with the Lakers, he racked up five NBA championships and three MVP awards. And don't forget the Olympic gold medal in 1992 as a part of the ""Dream Team"" -- the first year pro players could take part. Nine months earlier, Olympic gold seemed like anything but a dream. He helped change attitudes about HIV/AIDS . When Johnson announced he was HIV positive and retiring from the Lakers in November 1991, it sounded more like a death sentence -- so little was known about the disease at the time. But he helped change America's attitude toward the disease. In an interview with Cooper in November, he described himself as ""the blessing and the curse of HIV."" ""I'm the blessing because people were talking about it, they ran out and got tested at that time,"" he said. ""Then I'm the curse because...people now say, oh well, HIV is nothing because if I get it I can be like Magic. He's doing good, and I can do the same thing he's doing or take the same medicine he's taking and I'll be okay."" ""But what they don't understand,"" he added, ""in 22 years, millions of people have died."" And so, he says, his work isn't done. He's raised millions for charity . The same month he tested positive for HIV, he formed the Magic Johnson Foundation which ""works to develop programs and support community-based organizations that address the educational, health and social needs of ethnically diverse, urban communities."" Fact-checking the Sterling interview . In the two-plus decades since the world gasped at his HIV announcement, the foundation has raised more than $20 million for charity and given out almost $4 million in scholarships. He's brought business to minority communities . As it turns out, Johnson was a pretty good businessman too. He founded MJ Enterprises in 1987. The focus again was on serving diverse communities, bringing high-quality businesses to minority areas typically under served by larger corporations. And Johnson seemed to invest in nearly everything -- theaters, restaurants, fitness centers, sports teams and a TV network. A partnership with Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz made him millions. So did a share of the Lakers he bought and sold. All together, Johnson's business empire is estimated at $500 million. He's taken the high road . With numbers like that, it's no surprise that Johson's longtime agent and friend Lon Rosen came to his defense Monday night, saying Magic was ""the exact opposite"" of the way Sterling portrayed him in the CNN interview. ""I've known Earvin since 1979 and his whole mission in life has been to create business opportunities in urban America and to be charitable,"" Rosen said in a Los Angeles Times interview on Monday. ""He has literally donated tens of millions of dollars of his own money to organizations and individuals forever and ever and ever."" For his part, Johnson didn't dignify Sterling's contentions with a remark. Johnson posted a series of tweets after the interview aired, but he didn't respond to the specific allegations. ""I'd rather be talking about these great NBA Playoffs than Donald Sterling's interview,"" he said in one. ""After this week, no more Sterling talk. Just the NBA Playoffs,"" he said in another.

"(CNN) -- Jane Jeong Trenka, adopted from Korea at the age of six months in 1972, never felt she belonged growing up in a rural Minnesota town. But decades later the 40-year-old discovered her adoption began with a lie. While trying to apply for a visa in 2006, Trenka was told her legal birthday didn't match birth papers supplied by her orphanage. After an investigation, Trenka unraveled the mystery: an adoption agency in Korea had given her a fake identity to make her more attractive for adoption, she said. ""I could see where they lied to get me adopted,"" said Trenka. Her family history and physical description was rewritten to hide the fact that she was in poor health, having been abused by her father. And the agency had lied to Trenka's Korean mother, saying she would be sent to a pair of wealthy Dutch lawyers. South Korea was a pioneer on international adoptions. In the aftermath of World War II and Korean War, more than 200,000 children were sent to live with families abroad, according to the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare. As recently as 2005, South Korea was the fourth largest provider of children to U.S. families, sending more than 1,600 orphans that year, according to the U.S. State Department. But Trenka, who repatriated to South Korea in 2008, is part of a vanguard of American adoptees who have led the fight to stop overseas adoptions from Korea and change the cultural stigma tied to unwed mothers. ""The best option is always for a child to be parented by his or her birth parent,"" she said. ""Then domestic adoption, and only then intercountry adoption."" ""If you take a look at what's going on in (Korean) adoption reform, all of it is led by adoptees,"" said Kevin Haebeom Vollmers, a 36-year old Korean adoptee in Minnesota and publisher of Gazillion Voices, an online magazine on adoption issues. ""We've been disenfranchised for so long, and we're finally writing our own history, for the first time, on our own terms."" In 2012, the Korean National Assembly implemented the Special Adoption Law, crafted by Trenka with a coalition of adoptee activists and allies. The law explicitly discourages sending children abroad. Under the law, birth mothers must nurse babies for seven days before the child can be considered for adoption. If a mother chooses adoption, her consent must be verified and her child's birth registered. Finally, a mother may choose to revoke the adoption up to six months after her application. ""It's a paradigm shift,"" Trenka said. ""We're checking to make sure things are done ethically and properly. In my generation, people did things with blindly, deadly, and unethical speed."" Even before the new law took effect, the number of children being adopted abroad from South Korea has been in decline. Only 621 South Korean children were adopted by U.S. families in 2012, compared to nearly 1,800 in 2002, according to the U.S. State Department. 'Ungrateful' Not all adoptees are cheering the reform. Steve Choi Morrison, 57, is a defender of intercountry adoption and the founder of the Mission to Promote Adoption in Korea (MPAK). ""God came down to adopt human beings as his own children, even when we did not deserve it,"" he said. ""I believe it is our human duty, that if we have more than people from other nations -- then we should share."" Born in the aftermath of the Korean War and orphaned at age 5, Morrison spent his early childhood wandering streets and sleeping under bridges, he said. After moving to an orphanage, he was finally adopted at age 14 to a Christian family in Utah. ""They didn't have to adopt me, but they did,"" he said. ""I really, really love them for what they did."" He opposes the new Korean law's requirement for mothers to register their children's birth before adoption, arguing that it counters cultural norms. ""In Korean culture, face-saving is very important,"" he said. ""Mothers are afraid the birth record will later show up, and that husbands will not marry them later. If you force birth mothers to register for adoption, they're just going to abandon their children."" Korean adoption activist Kim Stoker, 40, disagrees. Morrison's criticism is based on ""incorrect information,"" said Stoker, who was adopted as an infant in 1973 and returned to live permanently in South Korea in 1995. ""After a child is placed in a family, that child will be removed from the birth mother's registry."" Stoker rejects the idea that the law is not suitable for Korean culture. ""There's the idea that Korean culture, as large as it is, and as vast as it is, is somehow static. That is not true. I've lived in the country since 1995, and there's been tremendous cultural change."" Fight for single-mother rights . Korean returnee activists are now fighting to improve government support for single women who have children. ""Mothers are mothers,"" she said. ""If you give them a real chance, most will want to parent their children. Who is the parent should not be a contest of who has the most stuff."" Stoker believes South Korea's adoption reform movement will set an example for other countries. ""We're the first generation of international adoptees that are telling our own stories,"" she said. ""A lot of the adoptees leaving China, for example, are going to look at our model to see what's important."" But Jane Trenka said she's not ready to celebrate. Single mother welfare remains lacking and adoption agencies as well as groups like Steve Morrison's MPAK are fighting to overturn the Special Adoption Law. ""The Koreans have a saying, after a mountain, there's another mountain,"" she said with a sigh.","Fight to end adoptions from South Korea being led by U.S.-Korean adoptees .
South Korea pioneered international adoptions in the wake of the Korean War .
As recently as 2005, South Korea was among the top nations for sending orphans abroad .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Charlie Sheen threatened to kill his estranged wife over the weekend, according to a declaration made in a restraining order against the actor. ""I will cut your head off, put it in a box and send it to your mom,"" Brooke Mueller claims that Sheen told her Sunday night. The revelations were in a court document that resulted in a court order that removed Charlie Sheen's twin boys from his home. In an interview with NBC's ""Today Show,"" Sheen denied that he threatened her. The quote against him was fabricated, he said, calling the allegation ""colorful."" Mueller alleges Sheen was abusive to her and filed for a temporary restraining order and a custody order. ""I am in great fear that he will find me and attack me and I am in great fear for the children's safety while in his care,"" Mueller wrote in her declaration. She added, I am very concerned that (Sheen) is currently insane."" Sheen's representatives had no response Wednesday to questions about Mueller's claims. Mueller's family members told CNN that Mueller went with an off-duty sheriff's deputy and a nanny to get the 2-year-old boys. They said Sheen's attorney spoke with Mueller's attorney before Sheen handed over the children. But Sheen said he plans legal action to regain joint custody. ""You're in my heart. Bob, Max, it's your dada,"" he said to his sons on CNN affiliate KTLA. ""I have never lied to you, and this is another example of that. I will see you soon. You're in my heart and I love you."" Sheen said authorities arrived at his home Tuesday night. He said he remained calm and videotaped the entire episode. Mueller's family members told CNN the sons were with Brooke Mueller, her mother and the children's nanny. ""I think she is latching onto some of this recent press,"" Sheen said of his most recent troubles. CBS halted production of the sitcom ""Two and a Half Men,"" the show Sheen was starring in, after Sheen's rant on a radio show last week. Sheen denied any anti-Semitic intent in the comments he made about his show's co-creator, Chuck Lorre, whose real name, Sheen said, was Chaim Levine. ""I've never had that in my past,"" he said. ""You can look as deep and as far as you want."" But Abraham H. Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement last week, ""By invoking television producer Chuck Lorre's Jewish name in the context of an angry tirade against him, Charlie Sheen left the impression that another reason for his dislike of Mr. Lorre is his Jewishness. This fact has no relevance to Mr. Sheen's complaint or disagreement, and his words are at best bizarre, and at worst, borderline anti-Semitism."" Sheen has reportedly demanded an apology from the Anti-Defamation League for Foxman's comments. Warner Bros. Television said Tuesday it will pay ""Two and a Half Men's"" crew for the four episodes initially set to begin production this week. Warner Bros. spokesman Paul McGuire confirmed the payments will be made. Warner Bros. Television is owned by Time Warner Inc., the parent company of CNN. According to TMZ, the payments will amount to about $2 million for the 200 core crew members. On Monday, Sheen threatened during various interviews to sue CBS for halting production of the show. He also told NBC he wanted $3 million per episode instead of the $2 million he was previously making, but later backed off that assertion, telling CNN's Piers Morgan that his only hard-and-fast demand was that he and the crew get paid for another eight weeks of work. He started a Twitter account Monday that had gained nearly 870,000 followers by Wednesday afternoon. ""My sons' are fine,"" he said on Twitter. ""My path is now clear ... Defeat is not an option ..!"" Sheen said he is determined to keep a public eye on what happens with his sitcom crew. ""I wanted to get everybody's attention and throw the eyes of the world on this, and clearly my plan is working,"" he told KTLA. ""I'm going to keep shaking the trees until I get the answers I need."" CBS previously placed the sitcom on ""production hiatus"" after the actor began rehab treatments, and had planned to resume taping on four more episodes this week. It's not clear if ""Two and Half Men"" will return for a ninth season. ""Everything is as it I stated at the beginning -- I am clean, focused and ready to get back to work,"" Sheen said.","Sheen allegedly threatened Mueller over the weekend .

"(CNN) -- ""Keep your feet on the ground, and keep reaching for the stars."" That signature sign-off of Casey Kasem's was recalled by fans of his syndicated weekend radio show ""American Top 40"" Sunday after the legendary disc jockey died at the age of 82. Kasem began that show in 1970 and hosted it and variations of it until finally ending his radio career in 2009. But for more than just those encouraging words, Kasem will be remembered for helping to elevate the radio disc jockey gig to one of storyteller and observer of the human condition. Fans would write in to his show for ""long-distance dedications"" -- requesting a song for a loved one, a friend or a personal connection far away. In his smooth baritone voice, Kasem would begin ""Dear Casey"" and proceed to tell tales that ranged from heartbreaking to inspirational. The dedications poured in from around the world. In 1986, Kasem read a dedication request from a woman in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, who wanted to honor her sister who -- despite suffering paralysis -- was studying for her master's degree in the United States. ""I'm so proud of her, not only for her achievements, but proud of her will and toughness and of her stubborn determination to pick up the pieces and start all over again when most of us would break down and quit,"" Kasem read. ""Casey, could you kindly play 'Broken Wings' for my sister Ayesha at Oklahoma State University? I do hope she's listening, for this is a message from those who love her, all the way from home here in Malaysia."" Kasem got personal after the death of Beatle John Lennon. The DJ offered up moving words in 1980 after Lennon was gunned down near his New York City apartment by Mark David Chapman. ""But John died having discovered who he was,"" Kasem said. ""John Lennon, husband to Yoko, father to Sean [Lennon's young son with wife Yoko Ono]."" The role of music orator was one Kasem took very seriously. ""It's so simple: what do people love?"" Kasem said to the New York Times in a 1999 article. ""Plato said it best. 'People who tell the stories rule society.' And we tell the stories, and people love to hear the stories. Of course, we've got tremendous responsibility to become accurate with those stories. And in most cases to be wholesome."" On Sunday, the ""AT40"" website posted a tribute to Kasem. The site for the program, now hosted by Ryan Seacrest, included audio clips of Kasem on the show throughout the years.","Kasem's show featured long-distance dedications .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government's ""no fly"" list violates constitutional protections by depriving travelers of a meaningful way to have their names removed, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Anna Brown of Portland, Oregon, ordered the Justice Department to redraft procedures ""with the requisite due process"" and without jeopardizing national security. Thirteen plaintiffs, mostly Muslim-Americans, challenged their inclusion on the list. They said they were denied boarding on flights without explanation and were not allowed to present evidence to show they were no threat to public safety. ""A traveler who has not been given any indication of the information that may be in the record does not have any way to correct that information,"" Brown wrote in her 65-page opinion and order. The ""no-fly"" list produced by the FBI was created after the 9/11 al Qaeda hijacking of four airliners as an anti-terror measure. It has been expanded over the years and includes thousands of names. It also has been the subject of controversy at times over its size, the criteria for selecting names, and claims that it unfairly singled out Muslims. The American Civil Liberties Union cheered the decision on Tuesday. ""For years, in the name of national security the government has argued for blanket secrecy and judicial deference to its profoundly unfair No Fly List procedures, and those arguments have now been resoundingly rejected by the court,"" ACLU National Security Project Director Hina Shamsi, one of the attorneys who argued the case, said in a statement. ""This excellent decision also benefits other people wrongly stuck on the No Fly List, with the promise of a way out from a Kafkaesque bureaucracy causing them no end of grief and hardship. We hope this serves as a wake-up call for the government to fix its broken watch-list system, which has swept up so many innocent people,"" Shamsi said.","NEW: ACLU hopes decision will serve as a ""wake-up call"" to the government .

"(CNN) -- Update: Britain's Civil Aviation Authority reported Friday, that it is satisfied ""that while this was a reportable event, and both pilots were concerned they were suffering symptoms of severe fatigue and took controlled rest separately, they did not fall asleep at the same time."" Previous update published on September 26, 2013 -- 2247 GMT (0647 HKT): . Cruising at 30,000 feet, pilots snoozed in the cockpit of a 300-passenger airliner en route to Britain last August, UK aviation authorities told CNN on Thursday. A spokesman for the UK's Civil Aviation Authority tells CNN that the Airbus A330 incident occurred while the aircraft was operating on autopilot on a long-distance flight. The CAA wouldn't reveal any other details of the flight, its route or its destination airport. Sources told CNN's Richard Quest the airline is Virgin Atlantic. The airline in a statement said, ""Virgin Atlantic can confirm no safety reports have been received about pilots falling asleep simultaneously whilst in control of an aircraft."" British pilots are allowed to sleep while in the cockpit under certain circumstances. The August 13 incident appears to be the result of bad scheduling by the airline, said the CAA spokesman Richard Taylor. The pilots reported having only five hours of sleep over two nights ""due to longer duty period with insufficient opportunity to sleep,"" the CAA report states. ""Both crew rested for 20 minute rotations and fell asleep."" The aircraft apparently arrived at its destination safely. It's the first British incident of its kind in two years, said Taylor. He said it's unlikely the pilots will be disciplined. ""You can't have five hours of sleep in two days,"" says veteran airline pilot and aviation consultant Mark Weiss. ""That doesn't work."" Fatigue ranks among the most sensitive issues in the pilot community. Rules surrounding sleep and relief crews vary from country to country. Jim McAusian, general secretary of the British Pilots Association, used the incident to blast the CAA's record on pilot fatigue in a statement Thursday, accusing it of being ""far too complacent about the levels of tiredness among British pilots and failing to acknowledge the scale of the underreported problem."" Next week, the European Parliament is expected to vote on new EU rules regulating pilot flying hours. McAusian said the proposed rules will increase ""tiredness among pilots and the risk of dangerous incidents."" In the U.S., flights longer than eight hours require a relief pilot on board to take over so pilots can take a break to sleep. If the flight is scheduled to last more than 12 hours, an additional reliefÂ pilotÂ must be added. Should cockpit sleeping be allowed? Believe it or not, some experts say pilots sleeping at the controls isn't always dangerous. Aviation rules in some nations allow pilots to nap in the cockpit during ultra-long-haul flights -- across oceans, for instance. Rules vary, but generally, the sleeping pilot must be supervised by another pilot during the naps. There are also backup alarm systems in place to awaken pilots if an emergency arises. The CAA refused to tell CNN whether it has evidence that both pilots were asleep simultaneously. The report is ambiguous, the agency says. If both pilots at the controls had fallen asleep simultaneously, Virgin Atlantic would be required to file a report with the CAA. The airline told CNN that it has no record of both pilots falling asleep at the same time. It's possible the pilots were resting one at a time under an authorized cockpit napping program. Among U.S. pilots, cockpit napping violates FAA rules. But some experts, including Weiss, favor the idea. ""This is a personal belief,"" he said, ""but I would rather have somebody take a nap during a cruise part of a flight so that pilot would be at peak performance during a high-traffic situation or a landing."" Unauthorized cockpit napping among U.S. pilots isn't ""that prevalent,"" Weiss says, ""but that's not to say it doesn't happen."" Curt Graeber, who was with Boeing for 19 years, headed a NASA/FAA study that recommended the FAA allow cockpit napping. But the FAA has never adopted the idea. ""I think it's political,"" he told CNN. ""I guess it's difficult to tell the public that the captain is asleep on the flight deck."" ""Everyone I talk to who uses it says it's a stopgap measure to improve safety and reduce the risk of sleep loss."" Studies have shown, Weiss says, that taking a 20-minute nap will allow pilots to regain energy. ""It's not a bad idea to allow pilots to take short naps,"" he said. Instead of allowing in-flight napping aboard U.S. airlines, the FAA has mandated that long-haul routes include relief pilots and special onboard sleeping quarters that must be available for the flight crew. Other sleeping incidents . Of course the UK sleeping incident revealed Thursday isn't the first of its kind. Last February, the Dutch airline Transavia said it had launched an investigation after a Boeing 737 pilot was locked out of the cockpit and his first officer was later found asleep at the controls. The sleeping pilot had been left alone at the controls while his co-pilot took a bathroom break.

"(CNN) -- Patrick Vieira will forever be known as a World Cup winner, but had the country of his birth acted quicker his destiny might have turned out rather differently. Vieira was a member of the France side that landed football's greatest prize on home soil in 1998, but having been born in Dakar, Senegal, the former Arsenal captain has often faced questions as to why he didn't play for the country of his birth. Notably from former midfielder rival Roy Keane who reportedly said in 2005: ""It makes me laugh, players going on about how they are saving this country and saving that country but when they have the opportunity to play...well, it's probably none of my business."" Vieira attributes his decision to play for les bleus partly to the Senegalese Football Federation's failure to notice his burgeoning talent following his move to France as an eight-year-old. ""I didn't have anybody from the Senegalese national team who came to me and proposed for me to play in the national team so the question was never there,"" Vieira told CNN. He came on as a second-half substitute in the 1998 World Cup final against Brazil, delivering the pass for Emmanuel Petit's third goal in the 3-0 victory over the reigning world champions at the Stade de France. And having won 107 caps for France between 1997 and 2009, Vieira has no regrets about the decision he made. The 37-year-old arrived in France with his family, who were seeking a better way of life, and he remains forever grateful for the opportunity that the European nation presented him with. ""I enjoyed playing for the national team, the French national team, because I think France gave me a lot and gave my family a lot, so to wear the French national team shirt was really good and I wore it with pride,"" he said. ""It had never been a decision to choose between the French national team or the Senegalese national team because I was growing up in France and playing in the French youth national team so it was something really normal."" Eligible to play for France through his grandfather, Vieira went on to become the the fifth most-capped Frenchman behind Lilian Thuram, Thierry Henry, Marcel Desailly and Zinedine Zidane. Along with Vieira, that quartet of players was key to France's World Cup win in 1998 and the European Championship two years later. Senegal's inability to spot Vieira as a youngster and secure his international future provides evidence of African football's structural failings, argues the current head of Manchester City's elite development squad. ""I think what African football needs is better organization, better structure, and I think after that we'll help the players to be more professional when they're coming to play for their national team,"" he said. ""And I think the federations have a massive responsibility on their shoulders because we know there is talent. ""When you look at the last five-to-six years, the number of players we had like Yaya Toure, Didier Drogba, Samuel Eto'o, Kolo Toure, Salomon Kalou and Jay Jay Okocha -- I can give you hundreds of names. ""I think the structure around these players is not strong enough and I think if we don't have that, it will take time [for an African nation] to win the World Cup.""","Patrick Vieira says he was never offered the chance to represent Senegal .
Vieira instead opted to play for France and was proud to do so .

"Khartoum, Sudan (CNN) -- ""Father we ask that you stand with your child Mariam. We ask that you strengthen and support her and grant her your grace."" It's the Sunday service in Khartoum and the pastor is leading the Christian congregation in prayers for Mariam Yahya Ibrahim, the mother of two convicted last month for the crime of apostasy after a court ruled that she abandoned the Muslim faith. It's crime she strenuously denies, maintaining both that she was raised Christian -- in spite of being born to a Muslim father -- and that she would have been within her rights to leave the faith. Neither statement has won her clemency under Sudan's harsh interpretation of Islamic law. As the pastor finishes his sermon, praying that God grant her strength, even ""as the hangman's noose swings before her,"" he asks that the congregation pray that if she is not granted freedom, the Holy Father will grant her eternal life. More than half the pews arranged before him are empty, and members of the choir struggle to fill the hall with their voices. As Mariam's case has dragged on, Sudan's churches have begun to empty. We were asked to conceal the identity of the congregation; it is clear many Christians here are scared. And activists tell us it is within good reason. After the secession of the majority Christian South in 2011, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir announced this new Sudan would be Arab and Islamic in identity. Although Sudan's constitution made provision for both ethnic diversity and religious freedom, shortly after the president's highly-publicized speech, the then-minister of religious affairs announced that no licenses would be granted to allow for the building of new churches. Since South Sudan gained independence, problems between Khartoum and the mostly Christian regions bordering the new state have intensified. The new edicts, many activists told us, felt highly politicized. So how deep does the tolerance enshrined in the country's constitution actually run? Not very, says Nabeel Adeeb, a prominent Sudanese human rights lawyer, himself a Christian. ""If you look at the laws of the country,"" he tells us, ""the laws favor Muslims."" ""Number one, the crime of apostasy, which is creating a wall around Islam that nobody is allowed to leave."" And what is worse, he says, is the sense that extremist sentiment toward Christians is increasingly tolerated. ""In the war of propaganda between the two religions, Christianity will stand no chance. All the media is used to promote Islamic beliefs and to speak about Islam as the only religion and to insult other beliefs, especially Christianity which is normally referred to as being an infidel."" Last year, Adeeb says he documented around 200 cases of Christian foreigners deported for the crime of ""evangelizing."" ""It was almost en masse,"" he says. ""They confiscated bibles and searched Christian centers. Deported them without instigating any legal procedures."" CNN has placed an interview request with Sudan's foreign ministry and has been promised that the foreign minister will address the concerns raised. In the past, the Sudanese government has pointed to the many churches lining the streets of their capital as evidence of its tolerance. Many Sudanese we spoke to think the government is obsessed with a belief that -- as one put it -- ""Christian missionaries (are) converting on every street corner."" One Christian activist, who also declined to be identified, said: ""The church is now contaminated with terror. You don't feel safe in prayer."" The only hope, she said, was that Mariam's trial had now brought that terror out into the international spotlight.

"(CNN) -- Rafael Nadal has been upset early at Wimbledon the past two seasons. His opponents in the opening rounds this year aren't easy, either. Nadal, coming off a record-extending ninth French Open title and 14th major overall, begins with dangerous Slovak left-hander Martin Klizan and then could face the man who beat him in 2012 in the second round, Lukas Rosol. Ivo Karlovic, who possesses one of the game's biggest serves ever, might confront Nadal in the third round. But here's something that should give the world No. 1's fans hope: Nadal owns a splendid record against left-handers, is rarely upset by the same player twice and Karlovic owns a 2-21 record versus the so-called ""Big Four"" of Nadal, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray. Second-seeded Nadal -- Wimbledon has flexibility in its seedings and gave Djokovic the top billing -- was placed in the same half as Federer, who is seeking an eighth crown at tennis' most famous postcode of SW19. Federer -- ousted prior to the quarterfinals in three of his last four majors -- starts against Italian Paolo Lorenzi before potentially meeting Julien Benneteau. Benneteau stretched Federer to five sets at Wimbledon in 2012. Defending champion Andy Murray has no such trouble, it seems. He is in the same quarter as David Ferrer, who prospers on clay and hard courts. Djokovic opens against Andrey Golubev. Serena Williams fell to Sabine Lisicki at Wimbledon one year ago and was upset in the second round of the French Open. She has landed in the same quarter as French Open winner Maria Sharapova and French Open semifinalists Eugenie Bouchard and Andrea Petkovic. Top-seed Williams could play Bouchard in the fourth round and Sharapova in the quarterfinals. It was 10 years ago that a 17-year-old Sharapova stunned the tennis world by opening her grand slam account at Wimbledon. If the seedings hold, 17-time grand slam champion Williams would face second-seed Li Na in the final. Like Williams, Li was bundled out of the French Open in the first week, eliminated by Kristina Mladenovic in the first round.

"Mariupol, Ukraine (CNN) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that he wants a delay in a referendum on whether certain eastern Ukrainian residents want sovereignty from Kiev and that presidential elections scheduled for this month are ""a step in the right direction."" But he said that the planned May 25 presidential vote Kiev wants to hold would ""not solve anything unless all of Ukraine's people first understand how their rights will be guaranteed"" once the election has taken place. The comments, according to a transcript published by the Kremlin, came after Putin met with the chairman of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. Separatists in Ukraine's Donetsk region have scheduled a referendum for Sunday. Putin called for the delay ""in order to give this dialogue the conditions it needs to have a chance."" He said that direct talks between Kiev authorities and representatives of the pro-Russian sympathizers in southeast Ukraine were key to settling the escalating crisis. Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk dismissed Putin's comments on the referendum as ""hot air."" ""There is no point in dealing in hot air, especially for the President of a big country. Since Russia is asking to postpone some referendum on May 11, I think the Russian President needs to be informed that there was no referendum planned on May 11 in Ukraine to begin with. ""But if terrorists and separatists supported by Russia got an order to postpone something that doesn't exist, then this is an internal matter,"" he said. In March, voters in Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula approved a controversial referendum to secede from Ukraine and join Russia, which subsequently annexed the Crimea region. That event highlighted the turmoil rocking Ukraine. Meanwhile, NATO has ""no indication"" that Russia has moved its troops from the Ukrainian border, a NATO military official said Wednesday on the condition of anonymity. White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest echoed that. ""There is not evidence to date that there has been a meaningful and transparent withdrawal of Russian forces from the Ukrainian border,"" he told reporters. The comments came after Putin said Wednesday that Russian forces are ""now not on the Ukrainian border but are carrying out their regular exercises at the test grounds."" Putin spoke after a meeting with OSCE chairman Didier Burkhalter. Also from the White House, President Barack Obama notified Congress he intends to withdraw Russia's eligibility for trade benefits under the Generalized System of Preferences. ""Russia is sufficiently advanced economically that it no longer warrants preferential treatment reserved for less advanced developing countries, consistent with the requirements of the GSP program,"" the White House said in a statement. Violence in southeastern Ukraine . Also Wednesday, Putin spoke about the release of pro-Moscow movement leader Pavel Gubarev, who was arrested on March 6 for leading an occupation of the regional administration office. ""We welcome the release ... but we hope to see all the other political prisoners released, too. We think the most important thing now is to launch direct dialogue, genuine, full-fledged dialogue between the Kiev authorities and representatives of southeast Ukraine,"" he said. Elsewhere, five pro-Russian activists were killed overnight when Ukrainian forces attacked barricades on the outskirts of Ukraine's southeastern city of Mariupol, a spokeswoman for the pro-Russian camp said. Ukrainian forces detained 15 other activists, Irina Voropaeva said. The violence comes amid an escalation of tensions as Ukrainian forces seek to regain control of some of the administrative buildings seized by pro-Russian separatists in a swath of the country's south and east. The activists briefly abandoned the Mariupol City Council building, according to Voropaeva. But the security forces remained in the building for only a short time, saying they had been ordered to leave. The activists re-entered, and Russian and regional flags went back up, to the cheers of the crowd outside. Later Wednesday, witnesses told CNN that Ukrainian forces dressed in black had fired over the heads of separatists who had gone to a Mariupol police station to demand the release of the 15 detained activists. The witnesses said several people were taken away in ambulances. Elsewhere in the volatile Donetsk region, an uneasy standoff continued Wednesday between the Ukrainian military and the separatists. Both sides clashed at the rebel stronghold of Slovyansk on Monday. Ukraine's security services said 30 ""heavily armed"" militants had been killed in recent days as part of the ""anti-terrorist"" operation in the area. Referendum plan . As the tensions rise, uncertainty reigns. The eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions had said they would hold a referendum on autonomy Sunday, but there have been no visible preparations for a vote. In Kiev, the interim government plans to hold presidential elections on May 25, but it acknowledges it has lost control of part of the country. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday said it would be ""unusual"" to hold a presidential election in the country when the army was being deployed against the population. ""In the situation where they use the army against their own population, it's quite unusual. This is not Afghanistan; this is a completely different situation,"" he said, adding that constitutional reforms promised by Kiev's new leaders would not be implemented in time for the vote. Lavrov, speaking after a meeting of Council of Europe foreign ministers in Austria, also ruled out holding a second international meeting in a bid to defuse the crisis in Ukraine, saying that the provisions of a first international pact signed in Geneva, Switzerland, last month had yet to be put into force. The agreement called on all parties to refrain from violence and required illegal armed groups to disarm and vacate seized public buildings. 'Gravest crisis' Kiev and many in the West believe that the separatists are backed by Moscow and fear that Putin is fomenting trouble to increase his influence in the region. In a briefing to U.S. senators on Tuesday night, the Obama administration provided a ""sobering"" assessment of Russia's intentions in Ukraine, including a concern that Putin will ultimately landlock the former Soviet nation, multiple sources on Capitol Hill and in the Pentagon said. Russia now has its sights set on the southeastern port city of Odessa and will not allow it to stay under Ukrainian control because Moscow views it as too crucial to both trade and the resupply of Russian troops in the occupied Transnistria region of Moldova, the sources said. The ultimate goal would be to create a landlocked Ukraine. In addition, the United States sees no letup in Moscow's direction of pro-Russian separatists and paramilitaries inside Ukraine and the continuing presence of Russian agents and special forces on the ground, the sources said. But Moscow says that right-wing, ultranationalist groups are behind the violence in Ukraine and that it has no direct influence over the pro-Russian groups. The rising tensions could have an impact far beyond Ukraine's borders, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen warned Tuesday. ""Today we are facing the gravest crisis to European security since the end of the Cold War,"" he told reporters. ""But this is not just about Ukraine. This crisis has serious implications for the security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic area as a whole."" A week in eastern Ukraine . Ukraine crisis: Small numbers, global impact .

"(CNN) -- What's in a name? If you are Mohamed Ibrahim Makkawi, years of trouble and the shadow of a senior al Qaeda figure lurking over your every move. Makkawi's arrival at Cairo's airport Wednesday caused a brief flutter of excitement. Could it be that one of the most senior figures in al Qaeda had been detained in dramatic (and highly unlikely) fashion after stepping off an Emirates flight from Islamabad in Pakistan? The confusion arose because Saif al-Adel -- regarded as al Qaeda's third-most-senior figure -- had long been associated with an alias identical to Makkawi's name. The two men do have some common background. Both were Egyptian military officers who joined the Egyptian Islamic Jihad. Makkawi was a major and an explosives expert in Egypt's Special Forces. He went on trial in 1987 for his Islamist connections and was dismissed from the army. Both he and al-Adel -- then a lieutenant and apparently a more active militant -- left for Pakistan and joined Osama bin Laden's jihad. By 1988, Makkawi was fighting Soviet forces and their surrogates in Afghanistan. ""I last saw Makkawi in 1989 when we fought together,"" Mohamed Omar Abdel Rahman, another former jihadist from Egypt, told CNN Wednesday. ""I also knew al-Adel well and fought alongside with him during our jihad,"" added Abdel Rahman, who is also the son of the blind sheikh now serving a jail term in the United States for his involvement in the 1993 attempt to blow up the World Trade Center. According to a source who followed al Qaeda at the time, Makkawi fell out with bin Laden and Ayman al Zawahiri, al Qaeda's current leader, soon after arriving in Pakistan. By about 1990, the source says, Makkawi had given up the gun in favor of contributing to a magazine in Islamabad -- Akdas Wakadaya or ""Events and Issues."" Nearly a decade later, al-Adel became a wanted man for his part in the plots to blow up the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. U.S. authorities published his profile as part of the Rewards for Justice program and listed ""Muhamad Ibrahim Makkawi"" as an alias. And the real Makkawi's nightmare began. By then, he had married a Pakistani woman and was living as a political refugee in Islamabad. For 10 years, Makkawi was regularly confused with al Qaeda's rising star. He adopted the e-mail address ""Unjustly_Guilty@.....,"" and from his home in Islamabad's Upper Portion began a campaign to clear his name. CNN has obtained a copy of a letter Makkawi wrote to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in 2009 that recounts his appeals to authorities in several countries. ""I am trying to resettle my normal life in Pakistan after getting married to a Pakistani lady but have accomplished nothing as a result of the Egyptian and Saudi regime's pressure on Pakistani agencies and my moral obduracy,"" he began. Makkawi said his children had been expelled from school and friends, neighbors and relatives had become informants for intelligence agencies. ""After the agencies lost hope to force me to accept fake al Qaeda No. 3 role and the big 9/11 lie, they attempted to kill me and my two elder sons by despicable means,"" Makkawi claims, adding that at one point there had been an attempt to poison him. In desperation, he told the UNHCR, he appealed to President George W. Bush and also asked the FBI to detain him. ""Hoping to put an end to this preposterous puppet show and to put myself under the responsibility of FBI, I sent an e-mail on 7th September 2005 to the head office of FBI requesting to be arrested and to face all accusations raised against me in a fair trial,"" he wrote. He did not receive a reply. Somehow, after being denied travel papers for more than 10 years, Makkawi was apparently able to obtain travel documents from the Egyptian Embassy in Islamabad. And then he boarded a plane to Cairo Wednesday, in an effort to clear his name and expunge the shadow of Saif al-Adel. The confusion over his real identity persisted for some hours after his arrival. Eventually, the Egyptian Ministry of Interior confirmed that al-Adel was still at large. ""Mohamed Ibrahim Makkawi is not Saif al-Adel,"" the ministry said. ""There is obvious confusion of data among security apparatus and the media. They are two different people. "" But the real Makkawi's troubles are far from over. The Interior Ministry confirmed to CNN that Makkawi was still a wanted man and faced charges of terrorism and conspiracy to topple the regime. He will remain in detention and appear before the Higher State Security Court, the ministry said. CNN's Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.","There are many similarities between Makkawi and al-Adel .
Makkawi has fought for years to clear his name .
Egypt's Interior Ministry says al-Adel is still at large ."

"Washington (CNN) -- Call it domestic housekeeping, a political dotting of ""i""s and crossing of ""t""s on a checklist for launching punitive military strikes against Syria for last week's chemical weapons attack. The Obama administration briefed members of Congress late Thursday in a display of consultation intended to fulfill a murky obligation under law and address the inevitable complaints by minority legislators that no one ever talks to them. Officials including Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were among those on the 90-minute telephone conference call, the White House said in a statement. ""The views of Congress are important to the president's decision-making process, and we will continue to engage with members as the president reaches a decision on the appropriate U.S. response to the Syrian government's violation of international norms against the use of chemical weapons,"" it read. A lawmaker on the call said that its main message was that the administration has no doubt the Syrian government used chemical weapons. No decision has been made yet on military action, and there is no time table, the lawmaker said. Hagel reportedly stressed that both action and inaction on Syria carry risk and consequence. ""Tonight the administration informed us that they have a 'broad range of options' for Syria but failed to layout a single option. They also did not provide a timeline, a strategy for Syria and the Middle East, or a plan for the funds to execute such an option,"" said Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Oklahoma after the call. Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Maryland, warned that the United States ""cannot be the lone sheriff of the whole world."" ""The United States must be careful in how it proceeds and must act together with a coalition of countries,"" he said. While informal briefings and phone calls have taken place this week, the latest sessions with congressional leaders and others represent an official effort to lobby support while meeting an imprecise obligation under U.S. law. Does Congress need to give blessing? The War Powers Resolution passed by Congress in 1973 requires that the president seek consent from Congress before force is used, or within 60 days of the start of hostilities. It also says the president must provide Congress with reports throughout the conflict. Since 1973, the United States has used military force in Grenada in 1983, Panama in 1989, Iraq in 1991, Haiti in 1994 and Kosovo in 1999. In all those instances, presidents -- both Democrats and Republicans -- sidestepped Congress and committed U.S. military forces without obtaining congressional approval. Congress did, however, provide President George W. Bush with its approval for the war in Iraq in 2002 and the war in Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. Now, House Republicans lead the calls for President Barack Obama to convene a joint session of Congress to lay out his case to the lawmakers and the American people. Some in both parties demand a vote before any military strikes occur. More than 90 members of Congress, most of them Republican, have signed a letter to the president urging him ""to consult and receive authorization"" before authorizing any such military action, according to the office of GOP Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia. Meanwhile, 54 House Democrats mostly representing the party's progressive wing sent Obama a letter Thursday that said ""we strongly urge you to seek an affirmative decision of Congress prior to committing any U.S. military engagement to this complex crisis."" However, others acknowledge the reality that Obama has the authority to order limited attacks on Syria without first asking permission. What next in Syria: 5 lessons from Iraq . McCain: Obama can act without congressional approval . Veteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona expressed the prevailing view when he said Obama should consult with Congress first, but nothing legally required him to get approval before launching missiles at Syria in response to what U.S. officials call a major chemical weapons attack by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad that killed hundreds on August 21. ""No, the president does not have to,"" McCain told Fox News on Wednesday. ""But he is required to consult with Congress, and it would be in his interests to consult with Congress, rather than acting in a unilateral fashion."" Agreeing was GOP Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan, who chairs the House Intelligence Committee. ""Under the War Powers Act, I don't believe there has to be a vote,"" Rogers told MSNBC on Thursday. He added that it would be both politically wise and follow the law to have full discussions with Congress, saying: ""You have to have these discussions. You have to bring members in. I think the administration is obligated to do that."" So far, the administration has failed to properly meet its obligation to fully consult Congress, Rogers said, describing its efforts as ""trying to do it on the cheap."" At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest disagreed, saying the ""robust consultations"" cover a wide range of information, including classified briefings for some members of Congress. ""It involves some insight into the perspective of our diplomatic partners around the globe,"" he said. ""It involves reading out conversations that the president and others have had with our allies. It involves a review of the options that are available to the president as he considers an appropriate response."" Along with the congressional briefings, the administration is expected to publicly release a declassified intelligence report this week on what happened in Syria. The White House has made clear that the report would come out before any U.S. action occurs. War Powers debate arises again around possible action in Syria . Boehner seeks ""clear, unambigous explanation"" At home, polls show Americans are conflicted over the U.S. intention to respond in Syria. While national polling over the past few months suggests most Americans don't favor military involvement in Syria, some surveys indicate the public feels Washington would be justified in using military action against Damascus in the event of chemical weapons attacks by the regime. For almost two years, Obama has avoided direct military involvement in Syria's civil war, only escalating aid to rebel fighters in June after suspected smaller-scale chemical weapons attacks by Syrian government forces. However, last week's attack obliterated the ""red line"" Obama set just over a year ago against the use of Syria's chemical weapons stocks. The United States has concluded Syria carried out chemical weapons attacks against its people, Obama said Wednesday. ""If, in fact, we can take limited, tailored approaches, not getting drawn into a long conflict, not a repetition of, you know, Iraq, which I know a lot of people are worried about - but if we are saying in a clear and decisive but very limited way, we send a shot across the bow saying, stop doing this, that can have a positive impact on our national security over the long term,"" the president told ""PBS Newshour.""

Calls for a role in the decision-making process appear motivated both by the incessant grappling to shift Washington's power balance and the general public distaste for more war after more than a decade of conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq. In a letter to Obama on Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner called on the president to ""provide a clear, unambiguous explanation of how military action -- which is a means, not a policy -- will secure U.S. objectives and how it fits into your overall policy"" regarding Syria. ""I respectfully request that you, as our country's commander-in-chief, personally make the case to the American people and Congress for how potential military action will secure American national security interests, preserve America's credibility, deter the future use of chemical weapons, and, critically, be a part of our broader policy and strategy,"" Boehner's letter said. ""In addition, it is essential you address on what basis any use of force would be legally justified and how the justification comports with the exclusive authority"" of Congress to declare war under the Constitution, the Ohio Republican wrote. On Thursday, Obama spoke by phone with Boehner to brief him on Syria, according to the speaker's spokesman, Brendan Buck. Boehner was also on the conference call Thursday night. ""It is clear that further dialogue and consultation with Congress, as well as communication with the American public, will be needed,"" Buck said of Obama.

"Dolpa, Nepal (CNN) -- Ram Bahadur Jafra and his two brothers crouch on a field, picking through blades of grass and staring at the soil. They have traveled five days by foot to a Himalayan meadow at a 4,300 meter elevation deep inside Nepal's Dolpa district. They came, as tens of thousands do each year, to harvest a highly valuable commodity from the high-altitude soil: the Himalayan caterpillar fungus -- also known as Himalayan Viagra. Caterpillar fungus, or as it's called in Tibetan, ""yartsa gunbu,"" meaning ""summer grass, winter worm,"" is a specimen created when a parasitic fungus infects caterpillars underground which, were they not forestalled by the fungus, would produce ghost moths. After the fungus mummifies the caterpillar underground, it thrusts out of the soil. It's this tiny protuberance that the harvesters spend weeks each spring searching for. A hundred or so people crawl across the field in a mulled silence until a sole searcher lets out an excited cry. Dozens rush over to witness, Jafra is the first to arrive. The woman who has discovered the specimen uses an ice pick to prod the earth and dig a hole about six inches in diameter. She then lifts a clump of earth up and sifts out the specimen. The crowd gossips about its value -- ""it's small, only 300 rupees!"" (about $3). A middle man will offer her that amount, then walk it to a market in Tibet and sell it for three times the price. Jafra explains: ""We pay attention when other people find them. This is our first time coming for the harvest. We've been here for nearly a week. We haven't found anything, because we don't know what they look like -- we don't know what we're looking for."" See also: Himalayan glaciers 'buck melting trend' Like many others, Ram and his brothers traveled for the harvest betting on hope alone. ""People in our village talked about the money to be earned, so we came,"" he says. The rumors of riches are not baseless. According to experts, the market value of yartsa gunbu has increased by 900% between 1997 and 2008. One study says 500 grams of top quality yartsa gunbu can sell for up to $13,000 in Lhasa, Tibet, or up to $26,000 in Shanghai. Average annual income in Nepal's rural mid-and-far-western hills, where many harvesters live, is just $283, according to the government. Police in Dolpa expect 40,000 people to migrate to the district this year. The influx of migrant harvesters speaks volumes to the increasing global commodification of yartsa gunbu. Prized in traditional Tibetan and Chinese medicinal practices for its power as an elixir or an aphrodisiac, in recent years commercial dubbing of the product as ""Himalayan Viagra"" has driven up both demand and market value around the world. But the unprecedented flood of harvesters has observers concerned about the environmental impacts of this informal economic boom. ""Look at the hills,"" says Gyalpo Thandin, a student in Dolpa, ""they're all torn up from people digging. By next year they'll be deserts."" Thandin, who was visiting home for the harvest, remembers when the yartsa gunbu season meant local bounty, not commercial competition. ""Just five years ago the numbers were lower,"" he says. ""Every year we see more people come and more grasslands get damaged. People who come hack at the land with tools and leave it to dry out."" He says his family's yaks have died in recent winters due to depleted grass caused by the harvest. See also: Bringing Nepal's ghost town back to life . Environmental protection measures offer some hope. Six years ago, a committee of community leaders in Dolpa instituted a taxation system on harvesters in an effort to control numbers and ensure the local community remained resilient amidst environmental changes. The committee charges locals 1,000 rupees ($11) and outsiders 3,000 rupees ($33) to join the harvest. The system is intended to spend the money on environmental protection measures and to subsidize food for villages in the district. Similar systems exist in harvest areas across the Himalayas. However, some worry the measure is ineffective. A former committee member who spoke on the condition of anonymity suggests that charging admission to the harvest has only made it seem even more valuable, and as a result, drawn more harvesters. ""The goal of the system was to charge people and therefore limit the number who would want to come for the harvest, but putting a price on the entry might actually be encouraging more people,"" he says. A leading expert on Himalayan caterpillar fungus, ecologist and geographer Daniel Winkler, believes the future of the harvests is contingent on many factors -- collection intensity, rainfall, and climate change among them. ""Centuries of collection indicate that caterpillar fungus is a relatively resilient resource,"" he says. But his research suggests that over-harvesting is contributing to fewer fungal spores being around for the next season. Winkler believes education is the key element to promoting sustainable resource conservation. ""Knowledge of fungal reproduction ... and (establishing) an end-date to the collection season might allow for sufficient spore dispersal to guarantee sustainability,"" he adds. As communities in Nepal, one of the world's poorest countries, cope with the economic need and the increasing desire for high-value commodities like yartsa gunbu, conservation efforts will require cooperation between leaders at village, district, and national levels. There is no question this Himalayan ""gold rush"" buoys rural economies. Keeping it around for future generations will be the challenge.","Caterpillar fungus -- known as Himalayan Viagra -- is prized in traditional medicine .

"(CNN) -- It's not the first time John Daly has had to ask for help -- but it must be one of the most embarrassing. Twice a champion of golf's biggest tournaments, the reformed alcoholic -- who has also battled gambling and weight problems -- is seeking advice after the worst round of his professional career. The 47-year-old carded 19-over-par 90 in Friday's second round of the PGA Tour's Valspar Championship, including an octuple-bogey 12 at the 16th hole of the Copperhead course at Innisbrook resort in Florida. Whereas the younger Daly, known as ""Wild Thing"" among other nicknames, might've stormed off without a word, or broke a club or two, this time the veteran American was happy to explain his woes. ""When you've got the yips, it's no fun,"" he said, referring to the 37 putts he needed over the 18 holes. He three-putted three times, and needed four at the fourth hole. ""When you play a putt to go left-to-right and push it three feet right, you look like an idiot. ""When I shorten my stroke, I get quick and miss it left. When I try to do my normal long stroke, I come up and push it. I've never had that problem before."" However, it was not just the short game that let ""Long John"" Daly down. Known for his ""grip it and rip it"" approach, he hit three balls into the pond at the 16th, and then shanked a seven-iron ""dead right."" ""It was just one of those days when nothing went right,"" said Daly, who eclipsed his previous worst round of 89 at the 2008 British Open. ""You hit it in the bunker, it buries. Hit it in the fairway, you're in a divot. I even hit it in a divot in a bunker."" Daly also defended himself on Twitter, where he has 368,000 followers, after one tweet that showed a screenshot of his scorecard claimed he was ""way too drunk."" ""Haven't drank in six years, be nice,"" he responded. Daly won the 1991 PGA Championship in his debut season on the main U.S. circuit, and followed that up with his second major success at the 1995 British Open. However, his off-course problems were reflected in his declining playing fortunes and these days he has to rely on sponsor exemptions to enter PGA Tour events. He has not played at the Masters since 2006, but is often seen selling his merchandise outside the hallowed Augusta club. Daly is still a draw at overseas tournaments, but had trouble at the 2011 Australian Open when he walked off the course after hitting seven balls into water hazards. The PGA Tour's website reported that Daly had been considering trying to get entry into a secondary tour event in Louisiana in two weeks, but will instead seek help with his putting ""yips."" ""I've got to call somebody that's had them,"" he said.","Two-time major champion John Daly cards the worst round of his top-level golf career .

"Marianna, Florida (CNN) -- This weekend, Florida will begin digging into its tragic past as anthropologists start unearthing what they believe are the remains of dozens of children buried on the grounds of a former reform school. The exhumations at the Dozier School for Boys -- which closed in 2011 -- are the culmination of years of controversy surrounding the reform school and a mythology that has taken on a life of its own. Rightly or wrongly, the Florida Panhandle town of Marianna -- just west of Tallahassee -- has become synonymous with the school and its dark past. Some of those who were once sent to Dozier -- now senior citizens -- have come forward with stories of abuse at the school, including alleged beatings, torture, sexual abuse, killings and the disappearance of students, during the 1940s, '50s and '60s. On the school grounds buried deep in the woods lies a small unkept patch of land with 31 white crosses. Rusting away with time, they mark the final resting place for the unknown students that the state has confirmed were buried there. Nearly 100 children died while at the school, according to state and school records, many as a result of a tragic dormitory fire in 1914 and a deadly flu epidemic in 1918. The poorly kept state records cannot account for what happened to 22 children who died at the school. And no one knows who is buried where. ""They were poor kids and a lot of times, people never came to visit them,"" said Elmore Bryant, a lifelong Marianna resident and head of the NAACP in Jackson County, Florida, which includes Marianna. ""Even when they were dismissed, they got home, their family had moved. So, who was going to pay attention if something happened to them while they was at Dozier?"" Some believe the bodies are African-Americans, disposed of by the Ku Klux Klan. This gravesite is in what was traditionally known as the ""black side"" of the reform school -- a reference to the era of segregation. Many believe another cemetery exists on the sprawling, wooded, 1,400-acre property, but it has not been found. Last year, a research team from the University of South Florida, on a humanitarian mission to help identify these bodies for surviving families, used ground-penetrating radar, and found that there are as many as 19 more bodies buried in the surrounding area -- completely unmarked. After clearing the area, the team determined that 49 graves exist. ""These are children who came here and died, for one reason or another, and have just been lost in the woods,"" said Erin Kimmerle, a forensic anthropologist leading the USF team, who once worked on an international forensics team that amassed evidence used in Yugoslavian war crimes trials. She has lobbied for an exhumation of the remains because, as she put it, ""When there's no knowledge and no information, then people will speculate and rumors will persist or questions remain."" 'White House Boys' Robert Straley spent about 10 months at the Dozier School for Boys between 1963 and 1964 for allegedly stealing a car. He says he was taken to the ""White House"" on his very first day. ""I came out of there in shock, and when they hit you, you went down a foot into the bed, and so hard, I couldn't believe,"" said Straley. ""I didn't know what they were hitting you with."" Years ago, Straley and several others who spent time at Dozier came forward with allegations that they were beaten with long leather straps inside a small white concrete building they forever call ""the White House."" The men became known as the ""White House Boys."" One former administrator, Troy Tidwell -- a one-armed man accused of abuse by several former students -- admitted that ""spankings"" took place, but denied that anyone was ever beaten or murdered. Florida first started looking into the allegations in 2008, after some of the White House Boys -- who had met on the Internet and shared similar stories -- called on then-Gov. Charlie Crist to investigate. At Crist's request, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement launched an investigation and its final report in 2009 accounted for 31 boys buried in the cemetery. The investigation failed to clear up the mystery over what happened to the dozens of other students who died at the school whose bodies have never been accounted for. FDLE closed the case due to lack of evidence that anyone had died as a result of criminal conduct. The Florida Department of Juvenile Justice closed the school in 2011, 111 years after it first opened. Then last year, forensic anthropologists from USF used their ground-penetrating radar to find what appeared to be 19 more remains than previously thought to have been buried on the school grounds. That discovery, along with pressure from the NAACP and high-level officials, including Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, led to action by the state. Earlier this month, Florida Gov. Rick Scott and his Cabinet voted to allow the USF forensics team to exhume the bodies, against the objections of Jackson County commissioners. ""There were children that disappeared that really were not accounted for, so I think that a new day has come here,"" said Wansley Walters, secretary of the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice. ""What we have now is an opportunity to really get down to the truth and also try to bring some healing to the victims and the families."" Owen's story . State records say one boy buried here is 14-year-old Owen Smith. ""He had no ambition to do anything but play music,"" said his sister Ovell Smith Krell, 84. She says her older brother ran away from home in 1940 at age 14 to become a musician in Nashville, but never made it. Owen Smith was arrested in a stolen car, and sent to the reform school in Marianna. He ran away from the school, but got caught, he wrote in a letter to 12-year-old Ovell a short time afterward. A few months later, his family received a letter from the school, notifying them that Owen had run away for a second time. ""So far, we have been unable to get any information concerning his whereabouts,"" wrote Millard Davidson, the school's superintendent at the time. ""We will appreciate your notifying us immediately if you receive any word from or concerning him."" Owen's family decided to travel to Marianna to find out what was going on, but just before leaving, there was a call from the school with word that Owen had been found dead. ""They think he crawled under a house to try and get warm and that he got pneumonia and died,"" said Krell. She said her mother asked that Owen's body be taken to a funeral home. The family had to borrow a car for the trip and when they arrived in Marianna two days later, school officials allegedly told them that their son was already buried. ""They said that the body was so decomposed, you wouldn't be able to identify him. ... They took him straight out to the school and buried him,"" she said. Owen's classmate told the family a different story. According to Krell, the boy said as he and Owen tried to escape, ""my brother was running out across a field, an open field, and there was three men shooting at him, with rifles."" ""I believe to this day that they shot my brother that night, and I think they probably killed him and brought him back to the school and buried him,"" she said. Closure, but criminal charges unlikely . Ovell Smith Krell, like other relatives of those believed to be buried at the school, is hoping the exhumations result in a sense of closure for her family. Any remains that are exhumed will be taken to the University of South Florida in Tampa to be examined in an effort to reunite these lost boys with their families -- if possible. Earlier this summer, DNA swabs were taken from a handful of surviving family members that have been found. If DNA can be matched to the bodies exhumed, these families want them to be buried properly in family plots. ""I would take him and put him down with my mom and dad in their cemetery,"" Krell said. ""I hope I get that chance."" Whatever may be found in the exhumations of these long-forgotten children, it's highly unlikely that anyone could ever be charged with any crimes. ""You have to have witnesses,"" said Glenn Hess, the state attorney of Jackson County. ""Nobody can place a name with a homicide victim and a perpetrator."" And that's nearly impossible considering the amount of time that has passed. ""There are these general stories about the beatings and all that went on, but that's not unusual for reformatories in the '30s and '40s,"" he told CNN. But this doesn't matter to Elmore Bryant, the NAACP leader. He's lived here all his life. He thinks the truth behind the mystery of Marianna will finally be found. ""I don't think the bones will lie. The bones will tell the truth,"" he said. ""I'd want the truth to be known how I died.""","Forensic researchers will begin exhumations this weekend .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama and his South Korean counterpart hailed a new trade deal and close ties between the two countries at a state dinner Thursday night at the White House. While Obama spoke of the strong bonds, President Lee Myung-bak said he will win over American critics of the pact, which was approved by Congress Wednesday. The agreement is ""going to create a lot of good, decent jobs for the people of America,"" said Lee. The two leaders exchanged toasts in the East Room, which was adorned with apples and other fall decorations. Obama praised the Senate's confirmation Thursday of Sung Y. Kim as the first Korean-American ambassador to South Korea. Lee spoke of his personal friendship with Obama and the debt his country has to the United States for its sacrifices in the Korean War. Obama and Lee earlier Thursday said the trade agreement is promising for both economies. Obama said he will sign it in the coming days. ""In short, this agreement will boost American exports by up to $11 billion and support some 70,000 American jobs. It has ground-breaking protections for labor rights, the environment and intellectual property, so the trade is free and fair. It will promote green jobs and clean energy, another area where we're deepening our cooperation,"" Obama said. ""And it keeps us on track to achieve my goals of doubling American exports."" Lee said he is ""confident that the Korean National Assembly will soon ratify this very important agreement in the near future."" It is ""an historic achievement that will become a significant milestone in our 130-year relationship,"" Lee said. ""This agreement will create more jobs, generate more trade and stimulate our economies. This free trade agreement will bring numerous benefits to our workers, our companies, our small businesses, and our consumers alike."" Congress voted Wednesday on a bipartisan basis to approve free-trade agreements with Colombia, Panama and South Korea. Obama and Lee also said they will continue to cooperate on efforts with respect to North Korea. ""We agree that North Korea's continued pursuit of nuclear weapons poses a serious threat to peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and the world. We will continue to work towards denuclearization in the peninsula,"" Lee said. Earlier, at a welcoming ceremony, Obama hailed Lee as a ""good friend and partner."" ""Our two nations have stood together for more than 60 years,"" Obama said. ""Over the past two years, we've deepened our cooperation. Today, I'm proud to say the alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea is stronger than it's ever been."" Lee said he had paid respects at the Korean War Memorial shortly before the ceremony, remembering the 37,000 U.S. service members killed during the Korean War. ""The Korean people have never forgotten what these fallen soldiers and their families gave up,"" Lee said. Lee's visit includes several bilateral meetings with Obama, the state dinner, and an address to Congress, which Obama described as ""a high honor reserved for America's closest friends."" Lee is a reliable ally for Obama, especially when it comes to U.S. policy on North Korea. Increased tension between the Koreas has prompted the United States and Seoul to delay until December 2015 the transfer of wartime operational control of troops on the Korean Peninsula to South Korea. South Korea has seen the North launch artillery fire at Yeonpyeong island and sink one of its warships, at which time the United States stepped up joint military exercises with the South. A warming of relations between the Koreas has been a U.S. condition of resuming nuclear talks with Pyongyang. In addition to coordinating responses to the shared threat of North Korea, Washington and Seoul are also working together on climate change, economic issues through the G20, and a nuclear summit scheduled for next year in Seoul. CNN's Elise Labott and Scott Spoerry contributed to this report.","NEW: Obama, Lee exchange warm toasts during White House state dinner .

"(CNN) -- There's a good chance you've seen more of Greenland in magazines or on TV recently. With its ice cap and glaciers melting at a rapid rate, the island is at the center of climate change conversation. The stories are troubling, but it's not all bad news for the folks in Greenland. You see, the increased attention has helped Greenland. Its tourism business is, by Greenland standards, booming. ""Our tourism is still very small,"" said Anders la Cour Vahl, a senior consultant at the Greenland Tourism and Business Council. ""But we've seen quite an increase in cruise tourism and an incremental increase in land-based visitors."" La Cour Vahl said Greenland gets about 30,000 cruise visitors per year, a four-fold increase in the past decade. About 35,000 people fly in for visits. It's a lot for a nation that's bigger than Alaska but with a population the size of Ames, Iowa. Most visitors to the island still come from Denmark (Greenland is a self-governing Danish territory). But the second-largest group used to be Germans, la Cour Vahl said, and their numbers have been overtaken by people from North America. Only a few come because they want to see the ice cap before it vanishes, they say. More than 80% of the island is covered by it, and the ice is as thick as 14,000 feet in some places, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. But it is disappearing. ""Greenland has been a major concern because there is a lot of ice sitting on land, and it's melting a lot faster than we thought it was going to,"" said Keya Chatterjee, director of international climate policy for the World Wildlife Fund. ""It's a big unknown in the system."" Last year, the book ""100 Places to Go Before They Disappear"" selected two sites in Greenland for its list -- the town of Ilulissat, to the west, and Zackenberg, in the northeast, where there's an ecosystem research center. The book noted that temperatures in Greenland are substantially higher and said the water around Ilulissat no longer has permanent ice cover. For the Greenland tourism bureau, climate change is often a part of the discussion. They even devote a page to it on the greenland.com website, where they try to assure potential tourists that melting ice doesn't mean there's nothing to see. ""While doubt still prevails as to the speed at which the volume of the ice is declining and the complex relationships between causes of temperature increases,"" the site reads, ""there is one thing that is certain: New ice will continue to be created on the ice sheet, and there will still be enormous amounts of ice to admire in Greenland for the next many generations. It is just a question of how much."" La Cour Vahl said that people who come to Greenland can witness firsthand the results of climate change. ""You can see how glaciers have been retreating. You can see the marks on the sides of the glacier where it used to be and where it is now,"" he said. ""Actually being there and being a witness to what is happening to our environment, that has great appeal."" Chatterjee, whose organization works with tourism boards to promote eco-friendly practices, said places affected by climate change need to plan ahead. ""Many local economies are so dependent on tourism,"" she said. ""Forward-looking cities are starting to plan how do you diversify you economy and how do you develop other attractions. People can disagree about when the worst consequences of climate change will hit, but we know it's already happening."" The effects of climate change have ""put us on the map,"" la Cour Vahl says. The challenge now is to convince more people that Greenland isn't really that far a trip or such a forbidding land. But it's not a destination for everyone, he admits. Most of the top tourist trips revolve around the ice or wildlife, such as watching polar bears or whales. Patricia Schultz, the author of ""1,000 Places to See Before You Die,"" calls Greenland ""the ultimate frontier."" The weather, while brutally cold in recent winters, can be surprisingly warm in the spring and summer, the top two tourist seasons, la Cour Vahl said. So when you pack your bags, don't worry, you can even throw in a T-shirt. Or if the warming trend continues, a few T-shirts.","Greenland is getting more media attention as climate change affects the country .
The attention has drawn more tourists to the island, including 30,000 cruise visitors per year .

"(CNN) -- You know the drill. Pony up a little (or a lot) more scratch at America's top theme parks, sports stadiums, wildlife sanctuaries, lounges and museums and you can expect a different deal. The VIP deal. But where and when does it pay to go VIP? You should always take those three letters with a grain of salt, but sometimes they really do sweeten the pot, provide a once-in-a-lifetime experience or just save your sanity. Here are 12 VIP options in nine categories that are worth the extra cash. Theme parks . If money was no object, who wouldn't do the whole destination amusement park thing differently? As in, no lines anywhere, front row seating everywhere and a personal park operative to maneuver you through the madness. The Disney World Premium VIP Tour (from $315 per hour) is about as close to that parallel universe as it gets in the Magic Kingdom, Epcot and beyond. The package includes a door-to-door resort guide overseeing your own personally customized, multipark itinerary -- with all the line-skipping, special-seating and headache-saving that groups of up to 10 can pack into six hours. The Six Flags VIP Tour (from $199) also offers fully customized tours for private groups, assigning a hands-on guide to keep you oriented and on-task with preferred everything from parking to show and restaurant seating to front-of-line privileges on most rides. Major League baseball . Unless you're about to be tackled by security at midfield, stepping onto the actual turf at one of the world's most venerable sports venues is strictly reserved for pro athletes and umps, right? Not if you book The Wrigley Field Experience (from $25,000) for a private VIP event. Then the hallowed home of the Chicago Cubs, the nation's second-oldest ballpark, is yours for the experiencing at home-plate level. Customized events let you tour ""The Friendly Confines,"" play ball right on the field with accompanying scoreboard and sound system, and even take batting practice with legends of the game. Will they play the Seventh Inning Stretch song for you? You bet. Wildlife . Not that jockeying for position to glimpse gorillas among the weekend zoo crowd isn't a privilege in its own right. It might even inspire some comparisons with the guy standing beside you. Just know that there are premium animal encounters to be had at some of America's most popular wildlife parks and attractions from coast to coast. Left Coast: San Diego Zoo's Exclusive VIP Experience (from $599) provides a customized, intimate journey through one of the world's most famous zoos. The tour includes up-close animal encounters, a special lunch and access to off-exhibit areas tailored to your zoological hankerings. Right Coast: SeaWorld Orlando's Private VIP Tour (from $299) lets guests dodge crowds for intimate feeding sessions with dolphins, sea lions and stingrays -- plus jump to the front of every ride line and enjoy reserved seating at live shows -- before their own feeding at Sharks Underwater Grill. Hollywood . Hollywood studios have been inviting folks for behind-the-scenes peeks since the silent era, when Universal boss Carl Laemmle came up with the idea of selling bleacher seats during shoots for 25 cents a pop. While the standard 45-minute Universal Studios Tour is more or less a warmup for the theme park, the Exclusive Universal Studios VIP Experience ($299) at the world's largest movie and TV studio includes a personal park guide, VIP meal service, hours of front-of-line ride benefits and back-lot access to otherwise off-limits sound stages, props warehouses, costume departments and all those immortal exterior sets from your favorite old Jim Carrey and Michael J. Fox flicks. Warner Bros. Studios is home of ""Casablanca,"" ""Rebel without a Cause,"" ""Two and a Half Men"" and the Warner Bros. VIP Tour ($52), which whisks guests for more than two hours around the 100-acre lot of Hollywood's oldest studio. No two tours are the same here, because this is workingman's Hollywood. You're seeing life on the lot as it plays out during the week without the aid of a theme park ride: through props departments, craft shops, sets of hit TV series and sound stages. Museum . You love the American Museum of National History's great Fossil Halls, the Earth and space section covering the universe's 13-billion-year history and those fascinating human origins dioramas. But you'd love it even more without all those other humans milling around. Take it from Ben Stiller and Robin Willia ... er, Theodore Roosevelt -- New York's natural history museum is an entirely different place outside regular public hours. While the American Museum of Natural History's VIP Tour ($500 for a group of up to five) can't guarantee you'll befriend Sacajawea or a T-Rex that fetches rib bones (that stuff only happens after sundown), the facility's premier private tour (9-10 a.m., before doors officially open) walks you through the place like it's your own. Then, when all the regular guests arrive, you get pre-seating at the Space Show, IMAX viewing and access to special exhibits. Tough to come up with a sequel as good as that. Live music . Snagging any old seat to hear The Eagles crank out ""Take It Easy"" for the millionth time or watch Sting, LL Cool J, Ozzy Osbourne and Kiss strut on stage (no, not all together) means a call to TicketMaster. Sitting front row at any of these upcoming summer concert tours, attending a pre-show party and doing a meet-and-greet photo op with some of these stars means a trip to VIP Nation.

"Mumbai (CNN) -- When I first heard that a nine-year-old boy had been found tied to a bus stop in Mumbai, I was surprised. He can't have been, I thought. In Mumbai? When I found out where the bus stop in question was, I was even more surprised. I pass by that area often. I'd never seen a young boy chained to a pole. Had I passed by and just not noticed? Like me, thousands of Mumbaikars didn't see Lakhan Kale, who suffers from cerebral palsy, on the pavement. According to the last census conducted in 2011, around 26.8 million people are in living with disabilities in India. That's 2.2% of the population of more than 1.2 billion. Other bodies, including the World Bank, say the figure is much higher. However, many of disabled people, like Lakhan, are allowed to quietly fade into the background in a populous country wracked by poverty where the worth and survival of many depends on their ability to work. Let me tell you Lakhan's story. Life on the pavement . In addition to cerebral palsy, the general term for a group of neurological conditions that affect the body's movement and coordination, Lakhan is deaf and mute. ""He was fine when he was born, in fact he was a chubby baby,"" his paternal grandmother Sakubai recalls. She says a few months later, Lakhan developed a high fever. ""One night, he shook violently,"" she says. ""He was never the same again."" Sakubai tears up when she talks to us about her grandson. We meet her at her home -- a grimy stretch of pavement, right behind the bus stop. Desperately poor, this is where she lives. She sleeps here on a sari she spreads onto the ground. She eats here, buying food from a street vendor when she can afford to. She is Lakhan's only caretaker. She tells us his father passed away four years ago. His mother deserted them. His older sister ran away. For a long time, it was just Sakubai and her grandson living, eating, sleeping and surviving together on the pavement. She may be in her 70s, but Sakubai still works to earn a meager living selling small toys and trinkets on Chowpatty, a popular beachfront in the heart of Mumbai. She says she had no choice but to tie him to a pole. ""He is deaf so he would not be able to hear traffic coming. If he ran onto the road, he'd get killed,"" she says. ""See, it's a long rope,"" Sakubai says, as she shows me the frayed cloth she would use to tie Lakhan's leg. I notice many of them, tied to different poles. Lakhan is not alone . There are many children like Lakhan in Mumbai, says Meena Mutha, a social worker. Mutha's been involved with his case since the end of May. Lakhan was taken into care after a photographer published his photo in the local newspaper. A police constable saw it and asked Mutha to intervene. ""When I saw him first, I did feel he needs help. He needs a home,"" Mutha recalls. Since his grandmother is already 70 years old, he could be without a caretaker in five or 10 years, she says. He needed somewhere secure to stay. Unable to find a shelter that looks after children with special needs, Mutha took him to a government-run juvenile center in Mumbai. Lakhan is there now but Mutha isn't happy because it's not a home for children with special needs. And that's the problem, Mutha says. There's a serious shortage of residential facilities for children with disabilities in Mumbai. The superintendent of the facility, S. A. Jadhav says Lakhan is being well looked after but he too is trying to find him a more suitable home. According to Jadhav, there is only one shelter for children with special needs in Mumbai and he can't get Lakhan a spot there because that too is severely overcrowded. CNN attempted several times to contact the minister responsible for women and children's affairs in Mumbai, Varsha Gaikwad, but received no response. Her office is a short walk away from bus stop 59 where Lakhan was found. Poverty and disability are dangerous combinations, says Dr. Shabnam Rangwala, who works with Able Disable People Together (ADAPT), a nonprofit organization whose mission is to create an inclusive disability-friendly India. Those who can afford to give their children or family members the care they need, do so. Those who can't, end up like Lakhan; on the streets, with no recourse to social services, invisible to the public.

"(CNN) -- The deaths of four people this week at a Florida mansion leased out by tennis star James Blake were murders and a suicide, with a man shooting his wife and teenage children in the head and setting the home on fire before shooting himself, authorities said Friday. Authorities have identified the dead as Darrin Campbell, his wife Kimberly Campbell, and their teenage children, Megan and Colin, Hillsborough County sheriff's Col. Donna Lusczynski told reporters. The family, found dead at the burning Tampa home on Wednesday, had been renting the 5,800-square-foot mansion from Blake for the past two years, authorities said. Blake was not at the home at the time, police said. Investigators don't know Darrin Campbell's motive, Lusczynski said. Authorities believe he used a gun that was registered in his name, Lusczynski added. The sheriff's department hasn't said exactly what led investigators to believe he shot his family, but it did say the Florida Department of Law Enforcement performed a ballistics test. Information on whether the four died from their gunshot wounds, the fire or some other manner wasn't immediately available. Firefighters first learned of the blaze in a 911 call around 5:45 a.m. Wednesday reporting an explosion and flames. Campbell used an accelerant to feed the fire and also placed fireworks throughout the home, Lusczynski said Friday. Campbell bought fireworks and cans of gasoline on Sunday and bought more gasoline from two stores on Tuesday, Lusczynski said. A surveillance video obtained by CNN shows a man believed to be Darrin Campbell inside a Phantom Fireworks store in Tampa on Sunday, buying about $600 worth of fireworks. He walks out of the store with one cart, and an employee seems to help him out with a second. Blake, 34, born in Yonkers, New York, starred at Harvard before breaking into professional tennis. He peaked at No. 4 in the world rankings in November 2006, according to his ATP World Tour profile. He retired from the sport last year, and remains active with his namesake foundation and Thomas Blake Sr. Memorial Research Fund to support research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. CNN's Alina Machado, Greg Botelho and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Police: Man shot his wife, teen children and himself .

"(CNN) -- ""The father of my child began cheating on me with this whore on July 14th, 2013,"" begins one post on the website ""She's a Homewrecker,"" on which scorned women publish the names, photos and, in some cases, contact information of women with whom their husbands and partners cheated, along with detailed narratives of how the affair went down. The website, which has 250,000 likes on Facebook, operates under the guise of offering important reader service or, as the tagline goes, ""Exposing the women who choose to become involved with an involved man."" Who knows if any of these affairs actually happened. But no words are minced here for the so-called ""other women"" who are, invariably, ""life sucking whores,"" ""homewrecking sluts,"" ""tramps"" and ""skanks"" who ""stole"" someone else's man. But wait -- doesn't it take two to tango? Of course it does. Although sleeping with a married man is of questionable morality -- and that's, of course, assuming the woman is even aware the man's attached -- the job of staying faithful belongs to the man who took the vow. And yet on ""She's a Homewrecker,"" the men get off largely scot-free. They are not named or pictured. In many cases, they are forgiven, even in cases where the man ""abandoned me and my child ... He then kicked me and our baby out of the house and onto the street to be with her,"" as one woman writes. Another woman writes about the ""twit"" who started ""talking to her husband at work."" After the ""twit"" got pregnant with the husband's baby, the woman says she and her husband fought for custody of the child and won. She writes: ""Our marriage is now the best that it ever would have been because we have worked through issues that we didn't even know we had. We are a happy family ..."" Despite this, the ""homewrecker"" still must pay, and does, in the form of having her name, details of her life and no fewer than six photos of herself splashed all over the site. The fact that this site exists, and was created by women with the sole intent of bullying and shaming other women, is especially notable given the recent discussions about how to deal with the problem of ""revenge porn,"" in which scorned people -- men, mostly -- post explicit, formerly private photos of their exes online without their consent. States are working to criminalize both the posting of such photos and the host sites, with advocates saying that under existing law, it's nearly impossible to get remediation or the pictures removed. Revenge porn exists to belittle and shame women and to ""put them in their place."" But what's happening at ""She's a Homewrecker"" is just as misogynistic; that it's women targeting women doesn't make it any less so. Bullying among grown women has often happened out of public sight: undermining in the workplace, whispers during the PTA meeting. Although sleeping with a married man is of questionable morality -- and that's, of course, assuming the woman is even aware the man's attached -- the job of staying faithful belongs to the man who took the vow. As Jennifer Aniston told Glamour magazine this summer, ""We're living in a time where, whether it's the Internet or tabloids, being sh-tty has become a sport."" With revenge porn and sites such as She's a Homewrecker, the damage is tangible: intimate photos and character attacks that may turn up with a simple Google search of a person's name. Despite the women's stories of betrayal and humiliation and the sympathy they hope to elicit, humiliation is exactly what they intend to dole out, continuing the cycle of meanness. They play the victims while making victims of someone else, bullying others in the name of ""just desserts."" The whole M.O. of bullying is, of course, to gain leverage and power. At least some of the women posting on She's a Homewrecker do so, it seems, out of desperation to regain some of the control they lost when they were betrayed by their partners. But that doesn't make their retaliatory actions defensible. For one thing, it doesn't explain why the cheating men aren't taken to task. What's happening on She's a Homewrecker is bullying. In many cases, it's illegal -- it's flush with defamatory comments -- and not without consequences. By turning on their own gender and by encouraging a community based on judgment and fear, women sabotage their ability to develop strong female relationships. They promote the idea that other women are untrustworthy. And so, instead of finding empowerment and community just when they need it most, women who use and read sites like these will end up feeling more alone than ever. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Peggy Drexler.","Betrayed women post details about partners' mistresses on ""She's a Homewrecker"" site .
Peggy Drexler: ""Other women"" called ""life-sucking whores,"" ""skanks"" who ""steal"" men .
Drexler: Women never blame the men; posts seem to be attempts to regain control .
She says posting details, photos on ""She's a Homewrecker"" is simply cruel bullying ."
"New York (CNN) -- The New York nanny suspected in the killings of two children in her care began knifing herself when their mother entered the bathroom and saw the bodies in the bathtub, police said Friday. ""We believe now that the nanny began to stab herself as the woman entered the room,"" Police Commissioner Ray Kelly told reporters in a revised account of Thursday's events. ""We initially thought that had already been done but now information is coming out that she did it as the mother entered the bathroom."" Earlier, police had said that Marina Krim found nanny Yoselyn Ortega, 50, on the bathroom floor of the family's Upper West Side luxury apartment with self-inflicted wounds. In the tub lay the clothed bodies of two of Krim's children: Leo, who had recently celebrated his second birthday with ""Pinkalicious-inspired cupcakes;"" and his 6-year-old sister, Lucia, who had performed ""beautifully in her ballet recital"" in May. Both children had been repeatedly stabbed, police said. Ortega started stabbing herself in the neck with a kitchen knife, police said. Her wrists were slit. ""The charge is still to be determined,"" Kelly said. A mother's greatest fear . Krim had left the two children with the nanny, known as ""Josie,"" to take her third child, 3-year-old Nessie, to a swim lesson at a nearby YMCA, Kelly said. She had expected to meet the nanny at a dance class for the 6-year-old around 5:30 p.m. When the nanny and children didn't show up, Krim went up to the apartment, where she found the lights were off, police said. Krim then returned to the lobby and asked a doorman whether he had seen her two other children leave with the nanny; he had not. ""There comes a time when she goes looking for her children and enters the bathroom and finds her 6-year-old daughter and son stabbed to death in the tub,"" Kelly said. That's when neighbors heard a scream. The children's father, Kevin Krim, a senior vice president for CNBC Digital and former Yahoo executive, was en route back home from the West Coast. Police broke the news to him at John F. Kennedy International Airport. ""A member of the CNBC family has suffered an unimaginable loss,"" NBC Universal said in a statement. ""The sadness that we all feel for Kevin, Marina and their family is without measure."" The nanny was taken to a hospital, where she was in critical but stable condition. The bodies of the two children were removed from the building on a single stretcher and taken to a hospital where they were pronounced dead. Ortega was heavily sedated and under police watch on Friday at Weill Cornell Medical Center, said Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne. Kelly said she was breathing with the aid of a tube and unable to talk. A native of the Dominican Republic, Ortega had been a naturalized U.S. citizen for 10 years. Friends had introduced the family to Ortega, and she had worked for them since Leo's birth two years ago, police said. She lives at another address on Manhattan's West Side with her son, her sister and her niece, Kelly said. ""We're just grieving. Worst nightmare anyone could ever imagine,"" said grandmother Karen Krim, who lives in California. ""We don't have a clue what set her off."" Police on Thursday evening escorted from the apartment building the mother and her 3-year-old daughter, covering them with a white sheet to shield them from photographers and gawkers. The mother was treated at a hospital for trauma, police said. Less than an hour before the killings, Charlotte Friedman rode in the elevator with the nanny and the youngsters. ""I told the little girl 'do you know how beautiful you are?' and she gave me the biggest smile I've ever seen and said 'thank you,'"" Friedman said. Nothing seemed amiss with the nanny or the children, she said. Later, Friedman was back in the elevator -- heading out to run errands -- when she heard a ""primal scream"" from somewhere in the building. ""It was pure terror,"" she said. ""...It was unlike anything I've ever heard before."" She isn't sure who she heard scream. But after she got off the elevator, Friedman saw the youngsters' mother screaming on the mezzanine. News of the crime spread quickly. Some parents in the neighborhood said they rushed home to hug their own children. Maryellen Conway, 39, a mother of two, said she called her children's nanny and they cried together. ""She was in tears. I trust her, obviously, with my life and she's part of our family,"" Conway said. ""There's no words to describe what they're going through."" On Friday morning, Jasmarin Rothbarb was pushing a stroller near the Krims' apartment building. She said she employs a nanny, but the killings have made her question whether to continue. ""It's a tough call,"" she said. ""You trust these people with your most precious joys. I think I see more mothers out today than nannies. It's a horrible thing."" Outside the building, Kathleen Peters placed flowers at a makeshift memorial. Peters, a mother herself, also works as a nanny for children who live a few blocks away. ""It makes me really, really sad,"" she said. ""I can't understand why (the nanny) would do something like that."" The apartment is a block west of Central Park and four blocks south of the American Museum of Natural History, two locations popular with nannies. It is not unusual for their employers to treat nannies as extended members of their own families. That was the case with the Krims. Marina Krim's blog, ""Life with the Little Krim Kids,"" offered the loving mother's view of a family life that included Ortega as a member. Last February, the Krims traveled to the Dominican Republic, where they met their nanny's family. ""We spent the past nine days in the Dominican Republic,"" Marina Krim wrote on February 18. ""We spent half the time at our nanny, Josie's sisters home in Santiago and the rest at Balcones de Atlantico in Las Terrenas, a condo-style hotel where the 'Real Housewives of Dominican Republic' and their families hang on weekends. It was wonderful."" She added, ""We met Josie's amazing familia!!! And the Dominican Republic is a wonderful country!!"" One photograph showed the families together, the nanny holding the girl who was learning how to swim at the time her siblings were killed. The blog included hundreds of photographs and notes about picking blackberries, celebrating birthdays, going to a pumpkin patch. On September 30, Marina Krim posted a photograph of her son after his second birthday. The boy had a mischievous look as he played at a toy kitchen set. ""Leo 'Lito' Krim!!!!! Yes, the 2 year old boy,"" his mother wrote. ""One of the best parts of my day is after I drop both girls off at school and have 3 precious hours with little Lito all to myself. Ok, I'm near getting cheesy I adore this boy so much!!!"" Weeks before his birthday, mom and son walked home, with the lad pointing at toy cars, trucks and fire engines, excited in anticipation of his birthday. ""Mama, present, present,"" he said after spotting a toy helicopter. ""Lito, I must say, is a very clever little boy,"" she wrote. ""He is super talkative and just has a million thoughts running through his brain and can express himself amazingly well for an almost-2 year old."" In April, 6-year-old Lucia, known as Lulu, accompanied her father on a take-your-child-to-work event. On the whiteboard in her father's office, she wrote: ""I like your ofis Dada. Love LuLu."" Marina Krim logged her final entry at about 2:30 p.m. Thursday, three hours before the killings were discovered. ""Leo speaks in the most adorable way possible. Firstly, he speaks super clearly, so you can understand every word (he) is saying. And he does things like, 'I want a fresh bagel' and 'Dito (what he calls himself) wants cold milk' and most adorable of all, 'No thank you' -- he never uses 'No' alone, it's always paired with 'thank you.'"" Within hours of the killings, hundreds of people had left messages of condolences on the blog; by Friday morning, it had been taken down. CNN's Deborah Feyerick, Ross Levitt, Erinn Cawthon, Logan Burruss and Brittany Brady reported from New York. Wayne Drash reported from Atlanta and wrote this article.","NEW: Nothing appeared amiss between the nanny and children, a resident says .

"Islamabad (CNN) -- More than 100 Taliban fighters crossed over from Afghanistan and attacked three Pakistani military posts Sunday night, killing at least eight soldiers, Pakistani military officials said. At least 15 Taliban fighters were killed in firefights that followed the attacks in the district of Upper Dir in northwest Paksitan, Colonel Wasim Ahmed told CNN. Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan told CNN the Afghan Taliban carried out the attacks. The Pakistani Taliban helped with reconnaissance and information before the attack, Ehsan said. Three other Pakistani military officials confirmed the attack but asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak to the media on the record. Sunday's attacks were the latest in a series of cross-border assaults from regions in eastern Afghanistan where U.S. troops began pulling out last year. In 2011, cross-border attacks by militants killed scores of Pakistani soldiers and increased tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Kabul and Islamabad have long accused one another of not doing enough to secure the border. Washington has almost always sided with Afghanistan in the finger-pointing, often blaming some of the deadliest attacks against western targets in Afghanistan on militants based in Pakistan's mostly ungoverned tribal region.

"(CNN) -- Usain Bolt's training partner Kemar Bailey-Cole proved a golden substitute for the six-time Olympic champion by winning the Commonwealth Games 100m title Monday in Glasgow. Bolt is only running the 4x100m relay at the Games, leaving the way clear for Bailey-Coley to underline Jamaica's strength in depth in sprinting with a superb performance. He held off the challenge of England's 20-year-old prospect Adam Gemili to win in 10 seconds dead, a world class performance in chilly conditions in the Scottish city. Bailey-Cole's teammate Nickel Ashmeade took the bronze. Bolt immediately took to Twitter to congratulate his teammates and they will come together over the weekend for the heats and final of the relay, where they will be hot favorites to add to their success at the Olympics and world championships. But Jamaican domination in the women's sprints was ended by Nigeria's Blessing Okagbare, who won the 100m title in a Games record 10.85 seconds. Jamaicans Veronica Campbell-Brown and Kerron Stewart were well beaten in second and third with England's Asha Philip in fourth. Away from the track and field, there were more top class performances in the swimming pool, with South African pair Cameron van der Burgh and Chad le Clos confirming their status as Olympic champions. Van der Burgh won the 50m breaststroke title in a time of 26.76 seconds, just outside the world record, edging out 19-year-old Adam Peaty of England for gold. Le Clos, who beat the great Michael Phelps at the London Games over 200m butterfly, rounded off a superb night of competition at the Tollcross Centre by claiming the 100m title in a Games record of 51.29 seconds. It completed the butterfly double for Le Clos, with 19-year-old Joseph Schooling taking Singapore's first ever swimming medal at the Games. Adam Barrett of England won the bronze. In the women's 100m freestyle there was an Australian clean sweep with Cate Campbell and her sister Bronte take gold and silver respectively. Emma McKeon took third. The trio were in the quartet which broke the world 4x100 freestyle relay record last week. The squash competition reached its climax with Malaysia's Nicol David retaining here Commonwealth singles title by thrashing England's world champion Laura Massaro in straight games in the women's final on Monday afternoon. The world number one recovered from a slow start to win 12-10 11-2 11-5 in just 44 minutes. ""It is a great win - probably even more special being the Commonwealth Games gold medal,"" said David. David's male counterpart at the top of the rankings, England's Nick Matthew, also retained his Commonwealth Games title after a five-game thriller against compatriot James Willstrop. Both men had injury fears going into the competition but shrugged them off in a grueling one hour 40 minute encounter, won 11-9 8-11 11-5 6-11 11-5 by Matthew.","Kemar Bailey-Cole wins 100m title at Commonwealth Games .

"Miami (CNN) -- The 9-year-old girl critically injured when an airplane struck her on a Florida beach last weekend has died, the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday. The girl, Oceana Irizarry, and her father, Ommy Irizarry, 36, of Georgia were struck Sunday afternoon by a plane making an emergency landing, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The father died at the scene, and the girl was rushed to a hospital. Venice Municipal Airport officials reported a plane in distress Sunday afternoon, sheriff's spokeswoman Wendy Rose said. The pilot of a 1972 Piper Cherokee radioed that he would be unable to make it back to the airport and that he was instead going to attempt a landing on Caspersen Beach, just to the south. The pilot, Karl Kokomoor, and his passenger, David Theen, were uninjured. They are from Englewood, Florida. Kokomoor -- the president and CEO of local engineering firm -- is ""emotionally distraught and devastated,"" his pastor, Victor Willis, said Tuesday. ""Words cannot express the sorrow I feel,"" said a statement that was read by Willis. 'Never saw them' Kokomoor said that he was losing altitude fast and had little time to make a decision. He said he aimed for an area on the water's edge that appeared to be remote. ""I never saw them,"" he said. ""It was only after I landed and we exited the plane that I realized that there were people on the beach."" The investigation into the crash is being conducted by the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board. The death investigation -- which is being conducted by the sheriff's office -- will determine if Kokomoor will face any charges, said Rose. ""I send my heartfelt apologies to the Irizarry family for my role in this tragic accident,"" the statement read. ""I will fully cooperate with the FAA and NTSB in their investigations."" Family was celebrating wedding anniversary . On the same day he died, Ommy Irizarry posted a love message on Facebook to his wife, as they were celebrating their ninth wedding anniversary. ""Thank you for being with me through thick and thin. I love you with all my heart, mi Roma. I am very happy and can't wait to see what the next 100 have in store for us,"" Irizarry wrote. According to his Facebook page, Irizarry was originally from Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. He was an Army sergeant first class stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia. He was a platoon sergeant assigned to Fort Stewart's Warrior Transition Battalion, the Army said. He twice deployed to Iraq since joining the Army in 2002. ""This is a heart-wrenching situation, especially losing loved ones while on vacation to celebrate a family milestone,"" said Maj. Gen. Mike Murray, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division and Stewart-Hunter. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the Irizarry family.""

"(CNN) -- Threats of violence. Sexual abuse. Strip searches. Dirty conditions. Young mothers whose children became sick. These are among the reported abuses of 116 minors by agents from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, according to a complaint filed Wednesday by the American Civil Liberties Union and four immigrant-rights groups. The groups say in their complaint that the incidents have been occurring for years and called for an investigation and improved federal policies toward young undocumented immigrants. ""Given these longstanding problems, and in light of the rising number of unaccompanied children seeking relief from dangerous conditions in their home countries, the need for broad and lasting agency reforms is clear,"" the complaint says. A spokesman for Customs and Border Protection said the agency has taken ""extraordinary measures"" to look after the children, some of whom are new parents. Michael Friel wrote in an e-mail that children get regular meals and drinks, constant monitoring, and those who appear sick get medical care. ""Mistreatment or misconduct is not tolerated,"" he added. The crisis of unaccompanied minors from countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras is growing. Because the children are not from countries that border the United States, federal law prohibits them from being immediately deported. Instead, after three days they are turned over to the Department of Health and Human Services. But the ACLU and the other organizations say children have too often reported incidents of abuse, freezing cold cells and rooms where dozens of people are jammed in with access to only one toilet. About 70% said they were held past the 72-hour detention period. Four out of five described a lack of water and enough food, according to the complaint, addressed to the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the department's inspector general. Americans for Immigrant Justice, the Esperanza Immigrant Rights Project, the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project and the National Immigrant Justice Center also joined the complaint. The children were between the ages of 5 and 17 when the incidents allegedly occurred. DHS wouldn't comment on whether it was investigating the allegations. Chris Cabrera, a leader of a chapter of the National Border Patrol Council, a labor union representing U.S. Border Patrol agents, estimated that more than 60,000 unaccompanied juveniles will cross the Mexican border with the United States in 2014 and that the numbers will rise from there. Many of the youths turn themselves in to the Border Patrol. ""They know that once they get to the station, we are going to give them paperwork and we are going to set them free into the United States,"" Cabrera said. The numbers are overwhelming American facilities, particularly in Texas. On Wednesday, Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson told a Senate committee that he recently visited the border. He also told Judiciary Committee that the U.S. would open three new facilities to house the children and would pull scores of agents from their duties watching the border so they could watch the youths.

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Welcome to democracy, Afghan-style. An Afghan woman in a burqa veil holds up a photograph of President Hamid Karzai. An incumbent president and 38 challengers, including two women, are vying for the votes of 17 million registered Afghans against a backdrop of war, graft, poverty and illiteracy. More than 3,000 donkeys, 3,000 cars and three helicopters will traverse harsh terrain to carry voting materials to remote polling stations. And 30 observer groups, domestic and international, will be on hand to help guard against fraud. This Thursday, Afghanistan holds its second-ever popular election, the results of which will put into office a new president and 420 provincial council winners. Preliminary results are scheduled September 3, with final results expected two weeks later. At the heart of every vote will be the two biggest impediments to progress for one of the poorest nations in the world: stifling corruption and an increasingly bloody Taliban resurgence. The number of Afghan civilians killed increased 24 percent in the first six months of this year compared with the same period last year, according to the United Nations. NATO and U.S. forces have suffered record losses this summer, with 75 troops killed in the month of July alone. Amid the violence, the candidates continued their last-minute campaigning, with the hope that the elections can showcase Afghanistan's fledgling democracy. ""We hope that this election will go ahead in accordance with the constitution of this country and the rightful freedoms of our people, in the best manner possible, so that the Afghan nation can determine its future,"" said historian Omar Khan Massoudi, director of the National Museum in Kabul.  Watch young Afghans talk about their hopes » . International donors are helping pay for the $223 million undertaking, and hundreds of U.S. Marines and Afghan soldiers have moved into southern Afghanistan to protect voters against possible Taliban attacks. The top U.S. envoy to the region, Richard Holbrooke, expressed optimism that Thursday's vote would be Afghanistan's moment to shine. It's tough to organize elections during a war, he said, but the reality is that violence during elections is common place in many parts of the world. ""Afghanistan has never had a contested election,"" Holbrooke said. ""So this is a remarkable experiment in democracy and something that Afghanistan needs to give legitimacy to the new government."" That legitimacy has become a key issue in the campaign. Frontrunner President Hamid Karzai's chief challengers -- former finance minister Ashraf Ghani and former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah -- have both lashed out at the incumbent for failing to rein in corruption. In its annual global corruption perception index in 2008, Transparency International ranked Afghanistan 176 out of 180 countries and said graft was ""a major factor impeding the country's stability and future growth."" Ghani told CNN the most significant challenge Afghanistan's next president faces is earning back the trust of the people. ""This government has lost it,"" he said in a recent interview. ""There is no sense of trust, not only in the current leadership, but in the political class as such. And in the capacity of the state or the international community to improve the lot of our people."" Ghani characterized Karzai as a ""very poor manager"" who failed to deal with pressing issues and create any sense of momentum for the nation moving forward. As a guest on CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS earlier this month, Ghani said Afghanistan's corruption had become a cancer that was ""eating through the society."" Babrak Babarkhale, a former journalist and Mujahadeen fighter in the war to end Soviet occupation in the 1980s, said he planned to vote for Abdullah because he was fed up with corruption. ""We want to support Dr. Abdullah Abdullah to be our future president, to take all Afghans out of this corruption, away from this weak government,"" he said. Abdullah argued that people's dissatisfaction with the Karzai government has helped strengthen the insurgency. ""There is no doubt there is a hardcore element in it,"" he told CNN. ""But there are thousands of people under the same brand, Taliban, [who] have joined the insurgency because of other reasons."" The insurgents are filling a vacuum left by Afghanistan's Western-backed government, which foreign diplomats and military commanders concede now suffers from nepotism, corruption and predatory practices. During a political debate Sunday, Karzai admitted that corruption was a problem but offered no specific cures. He also has been blamed for what has become the bloodiest summer since the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001. Abdullah said last week that Karzai's government had failed to capitalize on the opportunities presented by international aid and troops. The government, Abdullah said, had failed to ""stabilize Afghanistan to the extent that eight years down the road, we would have been able to say less troops rather than more."" Most polls, however, show Karzai with a commanding lead. Latifa, a Kabul housewife, said she was pleased with Karzai's stewardship and would vote for him. ""Like raising a child for seven years, in seven years he has helped our Kabul, our Afghanistan, stand on its own two feet,"" she said. ""We didn't know an election before, we hadn't seen a parliament."" But can a nation as troubled as Afghanistan carry out fair and free elections? Some observers of Afghanistan and human rights activists have voiced their doubts. Kai Eide, the United Nations special representative in Afghanistan, said Thursday's election will be the most difficult he has encountered in his life. Besides the violence and corruption, weak infrastructure and a high illiteracy rate will add to election woes, he said. A new Gallup Poll found that fewer than one in four voting-age Afghans are confident the election will be fair and transparent. Voting in Afghanistan, Eide said, is not yet the kind of democratic expression understood in the West. ""If you look at the well-established democracies in the West, for instance, that's not possible under these circumstances,"" he said. ""But ... my objective is that we have credible, inclusive elections where the result will be accepted by the people. That is our level of ambition, and I think we will achieve that."" Eide said a significant number of polling stations in strife-torn Helmand, Kandahar, Ghazni and Wardak provinces will not be able to open due to security reasons. He said ballots ought to be counted at the polling center itself instead of transporting them elsewhere and increasing the possibility of fraud, encountered in the last election in 2004. Eide said 3,000 donkeys were ""mobilized"" to carry ballots to remote mountainous regions. Of the 4.6 million new registered voters, 39 percent are women. So thousands of women had to be employed to search burqa-clad female voters. Human Rights Watch, however, said Tuesday that the recruitment drive for women began too late, and as a result, not enough women will be available for security checks. ""Women voters have been badly let down by their government and its international backers,"" said Brad Adams, the organization's Asia director. Women's votes are key in Afghanistan, where the Taliban stripped women of equal rights and education. Human Rights Watch also said Tuesday that election-related violence was a serious impediment. Between April 25 and August 1, the rights group documented at least 13 political killings and at least 10 abductions of electoral commission officials, candidates and campaign workers. It said provincial council candidates had withdrawn after receiving death threats. The overall security situation is ""considerably worse than during the last elections,"" Human Rights Watch concluded. But despite the violence, despite the threats from the Taliban to disrupt the voting, enthusiasm filled the air Monday as the presidential candidates wrapped up their campaigns. A campaign rally resembled more a rock concert than a political event in Afghanistan, as Kabul stadium transformed into a sea of blue, Abdullah's campaign color. Supporters hoisted banners and sported T-shirts emblazoned with Abdullah's face. ""I believe there is a dire need for a change of course in Afghanistan, irrespective of who becomes the president,"" said Rauf Roashan of the Institute for Afghan Studies, a scholarly center founded by Afghans living abroad. Not yet old enough to vote, Ferishta, 15, a beauty school student, echoed Roashan's sentiments. If she could, she'd cast a ballot for Ghani. ""We want a president who is peaceful and caring,"" she said. ""We don't want any more bombs. In these bombs, so many Afghans have died, one person's son, one person's child."" No one can say with any certainty whether abounding energy will translate into high turnout. Not in a war-ravaged nation. As though to serve reminder of the high stakes, Kabul came under attack again on Tuesday -- just two days before the polls open.

"(CNN) -- Pope Francis made headlines Friday by coming out against the legalization of drugs, saying ""drug addiction is an evil, and with evil there can be no yielding or compromise."" Elbowing out space in the news cycle is familiar work for the 77-year-old leader of the world's Catholics, whose man-of-the-people style and frank way of speaking have endeared him to millions. Here are a few of the comments that have generated both praise and criticism: . Homosexuality . Nearly a year ago, Francis thrilled the gay and lesbian community when he said of homosexuals, ""Who am I to judge?"" He later said the church shouldn't ""interfere spiritually"" in the lives of gays and lesbians, who saw the statements as a crack in church's teaching that homosexuality is a sin. Francis revisited the issue in a wide-ranging interview released by Jesuit magazines last year. ""By saying this, I said what the catechism says,"" the Pope said, referring to the Catholic Church's book of official doctrine. The catechism condemns homosexual acts, but says gays and lesbians ""must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity."" He spoke out again on the issue in March, when he said that economic needs could perhaps justify civil unions for gay couples, even if church teaching still forbids same-sex marriage. His comments were ""the first time a Pope has indicated even tentative acceptance of civil unions,"" according to Catholic News Service. But the Vatican later denied Francis' comments signaled any change in church policy toward same-sex unions. Pope Francis' greatest hits of 2013 . Capitalism . At times, Francis has been so critical of the wealthy that critics have taken to calling him a Marxist. He's lambasted consumerism, chastised people for throwing away food and rapped titans of industry on the knuckles for what he says is an unhealthy focus on money. The exclusive focus on profits ""goes against God,"" he said a few months after becoming Pope. He warned in a major policy document that the ""idolatry of money"" would lead to a ""new tyranny"" and questioned ""a crude and naÃ¯ve trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power."" Church reform . He has spoken out against slavish attention in the church to issues such as abortion, contraception and divorce, and has criticized it for focusing less on caring for the world than its own preservation. He's made suggestions about carving a greater role for women in the church, reportedly told an Argentine woman that her divorce doesn't precluding her from taking Communion, and famously said a year ago that even atheists are redeemed by God. Throughout, he's urged church leaders to relax their focus on doctrine and move into the trenches to bring hope and healing into a broken world. ""I prefer a Church which is bruised, hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets, rather than a Church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security,"" the Pope said in his statement. ""I do not want a Church concerned with being at the center and then ends by being caught up in a web of obsessions and procedures."" Pope Francis: No more business as usual . CNN's Daniel Burke, Dan Merica, Eric Marrapodi, and Alanna Petroff contributed to this report.","Pope Francis has astonished millions with his commentary on social, church issues .
He's given hope to gays and lesbians with comforting words .
And he's poked capitalists who he says are too focused on money .

"(CNN) -- Five-time Olympic swimming champion Ian Thorpe is sick from post-surgery infections and probably won't ever swim competitively again, his manager James Erskine said Tuesday to Australian news media, including CNN affiliate Seven Network. The Australian's condition is serious but not life-threatening, and he is being treated at a hospital in Sydney, Erskine told the Australian Associated Press. Erskine denied earlier media reports that Thorpe could lose the use of an arm, the AAP reported Tuesday. Seven Network had reported that ""those close to Thorpe"" were worried infections could jeopardize the use of an arm. The network did not name the sources. Thorpe required shoulder surgery in January after falling at home, his management company has said. He retired from competitive action in 2006, only to launch a comeback in which he tried but failed to qualify for the 2012 Olympics. Ian Thorpe: Swimming star in rehab . He had hoped to be selected for the Commonwealth Games in Scotland last July, but a shoulder injury led to him again retiring from competitive swimming. The swimmer, nicknamed ""Thorpedo,"" won three gold and two silver medals at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. He followed up his success four years later in Athens by taking two more gold medals. Thorpe also won 11 World Championships gold medals, including six in 2001.

"(CNN) -- The roar of the crowd was deafening on April 9, as 30,000 Indians cheered on their teams at one of Kolkata's most hotly anticipated sporting events -- except this crowd was not supporting record-breaking batsman Sachin Tendulkar or marveling at Harbhajan Singh's fast spin bowl. The event was the Kolkata Derby -- a fierce soccer rivalry between Mohun Bagan AC and Kingfisher East Bengal Football Club that has seen both teams clash 299 times over the last eight decades. The passion of the crowd was a sign of Kolkata's long romance with the ""beautiful game,"" and indicative of a sport on the rise in India. Soccer's history on the subcontinent stretches back to the late 1800s when it was introduced by British colonial administrators and its subsequent growth means that today it boasts 83 million television viewers, according to the India-based TV ratings agency TAM Media Research. This figure is third only to India's de facto national sport and first love, cricket, which comes first with 122 million viewers, and wrestling which attracts 96 million. Furthermore, a data study conducted by TAM Media Research between 2005 and 2009 found that India's football audience increased by 60% within this five-year period. This trend was reinforced by a Nielsen survey in 2010 which found that 47% of India's 1.2 billion (2009 World Bank figures) population would describe themselves as football fans. The popularity of the English Premier League, which is broadcast on satellite channels such as ESPN, has also mushroomed among India's affluent middle class, who are increasingly passionate about a game traditionally perceived as working class. According to Manu Sawhney, managing director of ESPN STAR Sports, the channel broadcasts more than 230 English Premier League matches live every season and offers over 1500 hours of programming, thereby feeding the growth in demand. Jonathan Hill, the FA's group commercial director, said: ""Together we have grown the popularity of English football in Asia and we look forward to continuing this strong relationship in the coming years."" India's World Cup audience has also witnessed a marked increase in recent years. In 2006, the tournament was viewed by 50 million people in India through ESPN STAR Sports alone -- a 44% rise from the 2002 figure. Popularity paradox . The paradox of the recent boom in popularity is that -- unlike like other countries such as Japan, Australia and South Korea -- the growth in demand has not been led by the success of the national team. India last qualified for the World Cup in 1950 and currently places 146th in FIFA's global rankings thanks to a series of qualification failures for major tournaments -- albeit interspersed by victories in the Asian Games, the Asian Nations Cup, the South Asian Football Federation Cup and the AFC Challenge Cup. For Kalyan Chaubey, CEO of Mohun Bagan Football Academy, there are a number of factors that have contributed to the current state of affairs. ""I think a lack of international matches [is] a problem and our neighboring countries Bangladesh, Nepal and Pakistan are not strong enough, so we are not getting competitive matches,"" Chaubey told CNN. ""[But] the All India Football Federation (AIFF) has restructured their administration and recently money has been pouring into the game, so more windows of opportunity are opening up,"" he added. ""I'm sure football has a viable market in a country with a population of 1.2 billion. There are many pockets across [India] where football is equally or more popular than cricket, such as Goa, Kolkata, Kerala, Bangalore, parts of Delhi and the whole northeast of India. The passion is really high -- we just need to achieve something internationally."" The domestic dilemma . The national team is not the only area of untapped potential, according to many working in football in India; the domestic leagues and infrastructure could both be areas for development. Chaubey cites heavy competition for an insufficient number of stadiums prone to monsoon-inflicted damage as a notable obstacle stifling the potential of Indian football, which he says regularly attracts up to 500,000 spectators in the northeast of the country. ""Every state has its own football league and there are at least five divisions,"" Chaubey said. ""Each division has 15 to 20 teams, so getting grounds is an issue. ""When there are 100 grounds in a city that has 500 football teams that practice regularly, [clubs] hardly have time to maintain those grounds."" Building for the future . But it is at the grass roots where arguably the need is greatest and the most effort is being focused, according to Chaubey. ""Lots of youths are keen to play football but we are lacking quality coaches and infrastructure. [Many] senior teams get the facilities but youths don't."" Football coach Bill Adams, agrees with the sentiment and founded the Super Soccer Academy in New Delhi in 1998 as a way to combat what he saw as poor standards of youth coaching. ""There was a big disconnect between what I'd been doing and the kind of things the schools were doing with my child,"" he told CNN. ""The coaching was designed for adults not for seven-year-olds."" Adams says the professional football he encountered when he relocated to India from Britain in the early 1990s was ""amateurish"" and held back by the government-controlled Sports Authority of India and the AIFF, which administers association football in India and controls the top-tier I-League. But due to funding from the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), which has recently insisted on the AIFF employing professionals, Adams thinks the situation is improving. ""The AFC have really worked hard to professionalize football in India,"" he said. ""Ten years ago, there was nowhere near this level of professionalism.  The AFC are insisting on a particular management structure and a particular academy structure, otherwise [clubs] will not be recognized and allowed in the national league."" There are further moves from the AIFF to build on these foundations too, after the body announced in April plans to restart the AFC's Vision India program, which aims to increase the national association's efficiency, improve youth and grass roots football participation through programs and activities and develop national competitions for clubs and players. Meanwhile, FIFA has continued to make inroads in centralizing the administration of Indian football through its two Goal Projects and in improving footballing infrastructure. In 2007, FIFA launched the $8 million ""Win in India"" project to build a range of football grounds across the country. Construction of three turf pitches in Bangalore, Imphal and Shillong is due for completion in June 2011, while five further pitches are scheduled to be built across Kolkata, Mumbai, Goa and Pune. A FIFA spokesman told CNN: ""FIFA is convinced of the huge potential of India in terms of football development. This is why FIFA devised the program Win in India, which is now being implemented. ""FIFA has been working with the AIFF with the two Goal projects, helping in building the association's headquarters in New Delhi, as well as two technical centers in Karnataka and Sikkim."" Untapped player potential . Infrastructure aside, India is increasingly seen as an area that could provide talent to the top clubs in Europe. In 2009, Britain's Liverpool FC joined forces with Indian educational institution Bharati Vidyapeeth and the English FA to launch the Abhijit Kadam Football Development Centre (AKFDC) in Pune. AKFDC is the first collaboration between an English Premier League club and an Indian college aimed at fostering Indian football excellence through a range of courses devised in partnership with leading UK educational institutes. Premier League giants Arsenal and Manchester United have targeted talented Indian youths for training in the UK, while Chelsea have expressed interest in establishing a football academy in India. A spokesperson for Chelsea told CNN: ""It is clear that the game is growing in popularity on the subcontinent. Chelsea's ""Search for an Asian Star"" demonstrates beyond doubt that there is a huge passion for football within the Asian community as well as a considerable talent base. ""May will see almost 400 young Asian players travel to our training ground battling it out to win a trial at our world famous academy. Already four previous winners have gone on to play at professional academies and we hope we have inspired many others to develop their game at a higher level.""","India's 83 million football fans are a testament to a sport rapidly on the rise across the subcontinent .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Do you know your ""futtock"" from your ""baggywrinkle?"" A sailor stands on the ""widow-maker"" -- or bowsprit of his yacht. Don't be concerned if you don't, as they are both relatively obscure terms used in sailing. It is a sport littered with odd words and phrases and MainSail has put together a list of 10 of the weirdest below. They are bound to raise a smile and will certainly make you more knowledgeable on the water -- who knows, you could even impress friends and colleagues with your mastery of obscure nautical terminology. Scuttlebutt The scuttlebutt is a cask on a ship containing the vessel's drinking water. It was named this as the container was traditionally a small barrel, the so-called ""butt,"" which had been ""scuttled"" -- had a hole made in it -- so water could be accessed. As sailors would often gather around the scuttlebutt to chat, the word has also taken on a slang meaning of rumor or gossip. Rollocks A commonly used spelling for ""rowlocks."" These are the spaces cut into the vessel or small clasps raised up from the side of smaller boats that are used to rest oars when the boat is under paddle. Are there any other nautical words you'd like to add? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. Poop deck A poop deck is a deck at the rear of a ship, generally formed by the roof of a cabin. If a wave washes over this deck from behind the vessel, it is said to be ""pooped."" Widow-maker This is a colloquial term for a boat's bowsprit -- the long pole, or ""spar,"" extending from the bow used by sailors to tend to sails. The treacherous bowsprit earned its name and reputation from of the number of sailors who have lost their lives falling from the it. Baggywrinkle This strange-sounding gem is simply a soft covering for ropes aboard yachts that prevent chafing of the sails. Where ropes and lines come into contact with sails there is serious potential for damage to the sail due to the abrasive nature of most rigging. Mainsheet The mainsheet is a rope or line attached to the boom that allows the sailor to control the speed of a boat by adjusting the main sail. Bilge The bilge is the lowest part of the interior of a ship. It marks the spot at the inside-bottom of the hull, below any floorboards, and it sits below the water-line. Futtock Futtocks are the curved timbers used to form the interior ribs on the hulls of wooden ships. Cat-head The cat-head is a large wooden beam that extends from vessels at a 45 degree angle and is used to assist in raising and lowering the anchor. Many cat-heads have had the faces of lions or other large cats carved into them -- however, it's not known if this gave the cat-head its name, or came as a result of the name. Escutcheon The place on the stern of a ship where the boat's name is written is known as the escutcheon.","MainSail lists ten of the strangest and most humorous nautical words .

"(CNN) -- Nikki Stern lost her husband in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and she doesn't understand why knives would be allowed in airplane cabins 12 years later. Stern doesn't think box cutters killed her husband Jim Potorti, who was working at the World Trade Center when airliners crashed into the towers. ""The planes flying into the buildings is what killed my husband,"" said Stern, an author and the first executive director of Families of September 11. But she doesn't think people need knives on airplanes. ""I am aware of the argument that anything can be made into a weapon, but knives make it easy,"" Stern said. The Transportation Security Administration's announcement last week that pocket knives and other previously prohibited items will be allowed in airline cabins starting in April has sparked an outcry among many concerned travelers, lawmakers and aviation professionals. The new rules won't ease screening for passengers, some say, while adding an unnecessary threat to the safety of airline crews and passengers. ""The rules are so enormously confusing for the passenger and so arbitrarily applied,"" said Stern. ""They're not really making it more convenient because you can bring a knife but you still have to take off your shoes -- unless you're a senior?"" Many travelers echo that sense of confusion. On Twitter, a user called Terrence poses this question: ""So u can bring a knife on the plane but u can't have too much toothpaste or shampoo?"" Under the new rules, knives with blades that are 2.36 inches (6 centimeters) or shorter and less than a 1/2 inch wide will be allowed in airline cabins as long as the blade is not fixed or does not lock into place. Razor blades and box cutters are still prohibited. The rules also allow passengers to carry two golf clubs, toy bats or other sports sticks -- such as ski poles, hockey sticks, lacrosse sticks and pool cues -- aboard in carry-on luggage. Airlines for America, the airline trade association, said Monday ""additional discussion is warranted"" before small knives are allowed on planes. Sen. Charles Schumer called on Sunday for the TSA to reverse the rule change. ""These items are dangerous, and have not become less so in the years since they were banned from planes,"" the New York Democrat said. Delta Air Lines' CEO Richard Anderson said in a letter to the TSA that the move would add little value in terms of passenger screening efficiency ""in relation to the additional risk for our cabin staff and customers."" Despite opposition, TSA chief John Pistole said the changes will bring the United States into alignment with international rules and are in keeping with a ""risk-based security"" approach that will allow screeners to focus on items such as liquid explosives and improvised bombs that pose a greater threat to aircraft. TSA spokesman David Castelveter reiterated to CNN Monday that the rules would go into effect on April 25, as scheduled. Pistole is expected to defend his decision Thursday when he attends a pre-scheduled hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee. A threat assessment determined that allowing small knives in cabins would not result in catastrophic damage to aircraft, the agency said. But after consulting with Federal Air Marshal Service leaders, the TSA opted to continue excluding knives that most closely resemble weapons, specifically knives with blades that lock in place, or have molded hand grips. Pistole also decided to keep box cutters and razor blades on the prohibited items list because of their ""emotional"" connection with the September 11, 2001, said Castelveter. That didn't matter to travelers Darius Vitonis and Karolina Gelvonauskyte, both 26, visiting Atlanta from Lithuania. ""A knife is a knife,"" said Vitonis. ""Why bring confusion?"" ""No knives, no confusion,"" said Gelvonauskyte. Risk-based approach . The TSA's moves toward a risk-based approach to security have the support of Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. ""TSA must continue to improve its risk-based screening and one of its highest priorities must be securing commercial aviation from the type of threats and weapons that could bring down an aircraft. Any modifications to our security system must enhance our ability to detect such threats. As I have stated, my priority is to make TSA more passenger-friendly and threat-focused."" And former TSA chief Kip Hawley supports the change. Sharp objects can no longer bring down aircraft, Hawley said, and the search for knives interferes with the search for objects that can threaten aircraft, he said. Some CNN.com readers agree. ""Small non-locking blades are not very practical killing weapons, as screwed up as the TSA is, I'm on their side on this one,"" wrote a reader with the handle MeBee. ""Stop harassing people about the little stuff and concentrate on the real stuff that can do serious harm."" Security expert Rafi Ron said the TSA should focus on risky people rather than risky objects. Opinion: Is the TSA serious? ""When you have someone like you or me who doesn't intend to attack a flight, whether we have a Swiss Army knife in our pocket or not doesn't make any difference,"" said Ron, president of Virginia-based New Age Security Solutions and former head of security of Ben-Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, Israel. ""If you have somebody like one of the terrorists (who was involved in the 9/11 attacks) or a terrorist who is still out there, I'm not sure we'd want him to have even a Swiss Army knife,"" Ron said. ""Risk is not measured by the item, whether it is a knife or gun. It is measured by the person holding it. A bad guy with a Swiss Army knife can still cause a lot of damage to the crew and passengers in the cabin before the aircraft can land."" Rep. Markey joins chorus of those against letting knives on planes . That potential for violence is part of what has flight attendants concerned. Former flight attendant Tiffany Hawk is ""stupefied"" by the move, ""especially since the process that turns checkpoints into maddening logjams -- removing shoes, liquids and computers -- remains unchanged,"" she wrote in an opinion column for CNN. And Veda Shook, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, said the move is ""completely unnecessary"" and ""makes no sense."" Rather than freeing up time, she predicted that security officers will get more bogged down testing and measuring the knives to see if they meet the criteria. The Flight Attendants Union Coalition, representing nearly 90,000 flight attendants, and the Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations (CAPA), which represents 22,000 airline pilots, also oppose the rule change. By Monday afternoon, more than 20,000 people had signed a petition to WhiteHouse.gov calling on the TSA to keep knives off of planes. Traveler Emma Siemasko, a writer and blogger in Boston, sees ""the flip-floppiness"" of the TSA's policies as the real problem. ""There are too many rules to follow and there also doesn't seem to be much rhyme or reason."" Many travelers see rules that haven't been eased as bigger hurdles to the air travel experience: ""I would prefer they get rid of the liquid restrictions. I'll leave my penknife at home,"" wrote a CNN reader. ""But trying to find 3 oz bottles of everything and stuff them all into a quart baggie is a royal pain."" Knives on a plane? Really?

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Brazilian police fired tear gas Thursday to hold back a small group trying to work its way through Sao Paulo to the Arena Corinthians stadium to protest the World Cup. At least one person was arrested, CNN's Shasta Darlington reported from the scene, 7 miles (about 11 kilometers) from the stadium. Darlington and producer Barbara Arvanitidis were slightly injured when one of the canisters hit them. Darlington suffered a minor cut on her arm, and Arvanitidis was hit on the wrist. Critics are furious at the Brazilian government for spending $11 billion on the World Cup instead of low-income housing, hospitals and schools. A patchwork of plastic tents has appeared on an empty piece of land less than 2.5 miles (about 4 kilometers) from the World Cup stadium. More than 3,000 families have joined the squatter settlement known as the ""People's Cup,"" hoping to use the global sporting event as a platform to pressure the government to provide low-income housing. Residents said rents began to soar when the stadium was being built. Rents in Sao Paulo have risen by double digits in recent years, far outpacing the increase in minimum wage, which is $360 a month in the city. In protests leading up to the games, the Homeless Workers Movement has become a major force in Sao Paulo, with marches of more than 10,000. Weeks ago, there were violent protests in the lead-up to the World Cup. Demonstrations were staged in 18 cities last month. The biggest and most violent was in Sao Paulo, where police shot tear gas and protesters threw rocks and smashed the windows of a car dealership and a bank. Taking advantage of the global attention focused on the country for the world soccer championship, other groups have staged protests to air their grievances -- from striking teachers and police officers demanding higher wages to homeless activists.

"(CNN) -- World record-holder Wilson Kipsang completed a Kenyan double at the London Marathon Sunday as home hope Mo Farah disappointed on his debut over the 42km distance. Kipsang broke the course record with a time of two hours four minutes and 27 seconds, moving clear of second-placed compatriot Stanley Biwott in the closing stages of the race in the British capital. Tsegaye Kebede, last year's winner, took third, just ahead of fellow Ethiopian Ayele Abshero. Behind them, Farah, the reigning Olympic and world 5,000 and 10,000 meters champion, finished in eighth place with a time of two hours eight minutes and 21 seconds. Cheered to the echo by hundreds of thousands of fans who had gathered around the course, Farah was never a serious factor in the race after choosing to sit off the ferocious early pace set by the leaders. The 31-year-old admitted he had made a misjudgment due to inexperience at the distance. ""I wish I had gone with the front group. I had no-one to pace me because the pacemaker was slightly ahead,"" he told BBC Sport. Farah, who is toying with the idea of moving up to the marathon for the 2016 Olympics in Rio, vowed to be back. ""I'm not going to finish it like this. I gave it my all but I'm disappointed I didn't go out there and give what the crowd deserve,"" he added. In the women's race, another track superstar, Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia, also found the step up to the marathon testing as she finished third behind Kenyan pair Edna Kiplagat and Florence Kiplagat. Dibaba lost ground to them after dropping a water bottle at a drinks station and was never able to get on terms. Two-time world champion Edna Kiplagat sprinted clear at the finish to win in two hours 20 minutes and 21 seconds with Dibaba coming home 14 seconds down after her mishap. Over 30,000 runners, many raising money for charity, were taking part in the 34th running of the iconic event, which finishes on The Mall in front of Buckingham Palace.","Kenya's Wilson Kipsang wins London Marathon .

"(CNN) -- Pete Sampras is one of the legends of men's tennis, holding the record of 286 weeks as world No. 1 -- a position he maintained for an unprecedented six years in a row. The American sat down for a chat with CNN's Open Court show host Pat Cash, who like Sampras is a former Wimbledon champion. Sampras was still a boy when Cash won his only grand slam crown in 1987, but went on to notch a record seven championships at the British grass-court event and 14 majors overall -- which was a record until Roger Federer beat it in 2009. Sampras, now 40, has been retired from top-level tennis for almost a decade, and has two sons with actress wife Bridgette Wilson. He talks about his post-playing days, his record-breaking achievements, the state of the men's game and why the U.S. can't expect to dominate tennis anymore. On life after tennis: . ""I've been into golf, trying to get into the gym to stay somewhat fit. I've got two boys now, they're active kids. ""Retirement is a work in progress. I try to figure out my day, and what I know about myself is that I need structure. I can't just wake up and watch TV and do nothing. I need a day off working out, seeing the wife, play a little golf, see my kids. ""I've worked hard my whole life, since I was a little kid. But now it's a point in my life now where I can just enjoy it, but at the same time I still need to work."" On his post-retirement exhibition clashes with Roger Federer in 2007 and 2008: . ""It was pretty intense. When we signed up to do it, the last thing I wanted to do was play horrible and embarrass myself. I wanted to be respectful. ""Roger was really good, and he's a great guy ... I felt pretty comfortable, I was only 35 at the time, so I was still playing pretty good tennis, but I think the most important thing is that I really got to know Roger. ""He's such a nice guy, good family man. He's quick and he's really good and he's got all the shots and he's a great player, but I just wanted to make sure I didn't make myself look like an idiot. I wanted to play well and I felt like I did that."" On the state of the men's game: . ""To have Roger and Rafa Nadal playing -- and Novak Djokovic has now been the dominant player and Murray's getting closer -- it's a great time for tennis, an interesting year. Is there a guy coming through who is going to to dethrone those guys? I don't think so. Berdych, Tsonga? Yeah, they have their moments up to that level, but I think it's a little bit like the '80s with McEnroe and Lendl -- those guys played each other all the time, and we're seeing that today. ""I love watching Roger and Rafa play. I mean the lefty and the righty, the grinder against Roger, who is classic ... Djokovic being a great athlete ... I'm a huge fan of all those guys."" On America's lack of successors to Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Andre Agassi, Jim Courier, Michael Chang and himself: . ""It was a freaky time, it really was, and for American fans and media to expect it every 10 years ... let's be realistic. It's unfair to Mardy Fish, Andy Roddick and John Isner. They are really good players but they're nowhere near Roger and Rafa and Djokovic. ""To get to where I was with Andre and Jim and Michael, it might take another 10, 20 years. I think the world has got a little bit stronger, a little bit better. Guys are pretty hungry out there ... the game has gotten bigger, more people are playing the sport around the world. ""Americans have been a little content, maybe a little soft. It's just not happening at the moment. It seems like Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, Tom Brady, they're like major stars in our country and it seems like tennis has died down a little bit. I don't see anything changing anytime soon. The American media and fans expect Wimbledon winners, guys being number one -- it's pretty hard to do."" On the dying art of serve and volley: . ""It's gone. I mean you (Cash), Bjorn Borg, Stefan Edberg, you were the guys that I grew up watching play, so I just developed this serve and volley game at a young age. You have to start young. I started at 13, 14 -- if you're 20 and don't serve and volley, it's too late. ""And seeing you play Wimbledon, seeing Boris (Becker) play Wimbledon, it impacted on me -- if I was to win Wimbledon, I needed to get into the net. I decided to serve and volley and do it as a young kid, and at first it was difficult. I love watching Roger, Nadal, Djokovic but it's sad to see Wimbledon today with everyone staying back. ""Technology might be an issue because with these big Babolat rackets, they don't need to volley, you just hit the crap out of the ball. Whereas we grew up with the wood racket, so you had to hit it properly. It'd be nice to have someone come up that serves and volleys. It's definitely a lost art, and it's unfortunate."" On the ATP Tour's 2011 rookie of the year Milos Raonic, widely tipped to be the next Sampras: . ""Huge serve, huge second serve. But again, he's not really looking to get in, he's looking to serve big and crack it and then get in. The feel isn't quite there with him, but he doesn't need to do it when you serve so big. ""It's a timing thing, it takes a certain rhythm, practice. (Players) like Milos or Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Tomas Berdych, they serve big, but they're not willing to get into the net on their serve. I'm a fan of all these guys, but serve and volley tennis, unfortunately, has pretty much gone."" On bowing out at the top by winning the 2002 U.S. Open, his final tournament: . ""I broke the (grand slam) record when I was 29 -- I went through the next two years trying to find motivation. I just felt week in week out I didn't have it in me anymore, I just wanted to win one more major. I switched coaches, didn't really work out very well with that. I went back to Paul Annacone over the summer, and I just knew I had the game, I just needed to put it together and play that last U.S. Open. ""It was raining a lot that first week, so I had to win five matches in seven days at 31 -- a lot of work at the U.S. Open. To beat Andre (Agassi) at the end was a great ending. Quite honestly, I wasn't planning on retiring, but once Wimbledon came and went for me, I knew I was done -- my heart wasn't in it. I didn't want to practice, I didn't want to play any tennis. ""But it was a great way to end it. It wasn't really my plan, and from being as low as I could be -- losing second round at Wimbledon against (world No. 145) George Bastel, I was like almost in tears -- to come through two months later..."" On being No. 1, beating Connors' record of five successive years at the top of the rankings, and passing Roy Emerson's mark of 12 grand slams in 2000 . ""The No. 1 was a big deal for me -- six years in a row. I played in Europe for about two months to do it. That was huge for me, that's a big record. To beat Roy Emerson at Wimbledon with my parents there, beating Patrick Rafter, a great Australian, it was great way to do it. It was 9 o'clock at night, it was a storybook ending, quite an emotional time for me. ""So yeah, it was all about being No. 1 and winning majors, that was my goal, and I created a certain lifestyle to really create that. I was very focused, very single-minded. I just needed to be a certain way as far as my personality, so I felt I wanted to win majors and break some records and be world No. 1 as long as I could."" On being a father: . ""Right now they are nine and six. They are great kids, I love them. I want them to listen a little better, I want them to do their homework and not give me a hard time and do what I say. I'm taking it in small steps, but I'm not sure they are going to be into tennis. I got them doing tennis lessons every week, and I have them doing golf lessons every weekend, just to try keep them active, get them out of the house. ""We live in a day and age of a lot of computers, Wiis, and iPods -- so much technology -- so I want to get them out of the house. I just want them to be good kids, respectful kids, be nice to people. If they play tennis great, if not, I'm okay with that.""","Pete Sampras: U.S. cannot expect to dominate men's tennis anymore .

"(CNN) -- This weekend, Casey Kasem's family will gather at a private memorial service to honor the legendary radio host, who died on Father's Day at age 82. ""The world will miss Casey Kasem, an incredible talent and humanitarian,"" his children Kerri, Mike, and Julie Kasem said in a statement. ""We will miss our dad."" Kasem dominated the radio world from 1970 until his retirement in 2009 and leaves a powerful legacy. Yet at the end of his life, Kasem's name dominated headlines for a different reason: a bitter legal battle as his family debated the best health care for the ailing radio host. A rift that dated back years between his wife, Jean, and children from his first marriage deepened as Kasem's health deteriorated. Kasem was incorrectly diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2007, a diagnosis that was later changed to a progressive brain disorder called Lewy body dementia. Lewy body dementia is the most misdiagnosed form of dementia, according to the Lewy Body Dementia Association. Like Alzheimer's, confusion and memory loss are present, but visual hallucinations, severe sleep disruptions, fluctuating alertness and problems with movement are also symptoms. As Kasem lived out his final days, the family feuded over the best care options for him. Kasem's children said they were complying with their father's wishes to die comfortably and peacefully surrounded by family and friends, while his wife claimed they were ceding care and prematurely ending Kasem's life. Casey Kasem's family feud . ""My husband's a fighter! He's an American treasure. He would have never, ever wanted this,"" Jean Kasem tearfully exclaimed to CNN shortly before Kasem's death. The family battle over Kasem's end-of-life care was magnified by the media. Yet the story of families facing difficult decisions at the end of a loved one's life is one that millions of Americans can relate to. ""If you take away the fact that he has a net worth of $80 million, he represents a case that is a very typical,"" said Ira Wiesner, an elder law attorney based in Sarasota, Florida. ""I think we're going to see more of these cases hit the limelight at all levels."" Baby boomers are turning 65 at the rate of 10,000 per day, according to the Pew Research Center, a trend that's expected to continue for the next 16 years. People 65 and older are expected to make up 20% of the total U.S. population by 2050, according to the National Center on Elder Abuse. ""We're in the midst of a longevity revolution,"" said Ellen Goodman, co-founder and director of The Conversation Project. ""We now live 30 years longer than we did 100 years ago. Sixty is not the new 50; 60 is the caregiver of the 85 year old."" Eighty-five-year-olds today are driving, playing tennis and going to book clubs. Yet extended life spans require resources, and the responsibility of caring for loved ones with dementia or diminishing physical capabilities can weigh on families -- emotionally and financially. Overwhelming burden, cost of Alzheimer's to triple . ""We have to make decisions about how we want to end our lives,"" Goodman said. ""Do it early. It's always too soon until it's too late. Don't wait for a diagnosis; don't wait for until someone is in the ER."" It's important for seniors to designate a health care agent, also known as a proxy or surrogate, to speak on their behalf when they become ill or cognitively impaired. While a spouse or child may seem like the obvious choice, sometimes a health care agent more removed from the situation is emotionally better suited for making tough choices. It's essential that the proxy have a strong backbone and be willing to fight for the elderly person's wishes. ""I see it all the time, the edginess that occurs when somebody starts becoming incapacitated,"" Wiesner said. ""Issues of power come to the forefront, internal struggles between family members rise to the top, and it all explodes."" Seniors should write down specific instructions about their end-of-life care and identify the designated health care agent in a document called a durable power of attorney for health care. The written record ultimately becomes a gift to family members, since it eliminates the guessing game. It's also important for you to be aware of your state's medical laws. Many states have a pecking order for designating a health care agent: spouse, children, parents, then siblings. However, some go by different rules; for instance, Wisconsin will not let anyone step in to make decisions if a health care agent isn't designated, while West Virginia allows the patient's tending physician to determine who will be the best decision-maker. ""I've never heard anybody say, 'I want to end my life with a feeding tube and on a respirator or ventilator,' but that's what happens to a lot of people if they haven't expressed their wishes, given the medical system,"" Goodman said. Dying: What no one wants to talk about . Beyond medicine, it's essential to also think about other care decisions, such as whether you would prefer hospice care or to be moved back home for your final days. The most imperative thing for families to remember, Goodman says, is that even if there are varying religious views amongst family members, the specific wishes of the ailing elderly individual must be respected. ""A lot of families can relate to the chaos and confusion. When you don't hear the voice of the person you love in your ear, you always doubt whether you've done the right thing,"" Goodman said. The Conversation Project seeks to eliminate the stigma surrounding conversations about death and encourage families to have early discussions about end-of-life decisions. A recent survey by The Conversation Project indicated that 90% of seniors thought it was important to plan their end-of-life decisions, but only 30% of those people actually had open discussions about facing death. ""Too many people are not dying in ways they choose; too many are experiencing hard deaths,"" Goodman said. ""The difference between a good death or a hard death is whether they had sat down at kitchen table, talked about values and talked about how they wanted to live at end of life."" ""Casey Kasem is a celebrity, but this is an everyday American story."" Opinion: Give patients end-of-life options . Common end-of-life medical terms . CNN's Jacque Wilson contributed to this story.","Millions of Americans face difficult decisions at the end of a loved one's life .

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki has fired Spanish coach Ricardo Sanchez after just two months and decided to return to working with her father Piotr. The Dane slipped to fourth in the WTA rankings after a quarterfinal exit at the recent Australian Open, where she once again failed to secure a first grand slam title. Troels Christensen, a journalist with the Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet, told CNN how Sanchez had struggled to penetrate the close bond Wozniacki enjoys with her Poland-born father. ""Caroline and Piotr are mentally very tight,"" Christensen said. ""It's very hard to break into the circle. He is not the first one has experienced that. ""It was more Piotr's idea than Caroline's and I don't think she ever got used to him. They had agreed that they should sit down after the Australian Open and discuss the situation."" Christensen said the tactical advice Sanchez gave Wozniacki during last month's Melbourne grand slam appeared to be ignored by the 21-year-old. ""He must have seen that his input did not come out on the court. When the Danish press confronted Caroline with his analysis, she would not comment,"" Christensen said. ""I sensed when I got to Melbourne that something was wrong because the Wozniacki team are usually in good spirits, but they were not this time."" Despite the split with Sanchez, Christensen stressed that there was still a high level of respect between the three. ""They like him very much and they're good friends. In my opinion they should have been more clear about who should do what and who is entitled to do what before they started working together."" Wozniacki's failure to capture a grand slam title during her spell at the top of the world rankings meant she faced constant questioning on the subject. Christensen said Wozniacki is also now facing criticism from a vocal minority of Danish tennis fans who find it hard to identify with her lifestyle. ""There is a part of the Danish population who are irritated by her and think that she is not very Danish, she's very Polish in her ways because of her father,"" he said. ""They say, 'She is living in Monaco, not paying her taxes blah blah blah...' But I think it's a minority, but they are very loud. If you see the forums and newspapers' websites, people are a little bit skeptical about her chances of winning a grand slam."" Wozniacki will look to return to winning ways at this month's WTA tournament in Qatar, where last year she lost in the final. This year's entry list includes new No. 1 and Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka.","Caroline Wozniacki fired coach Ricardo Sanchez just two months after hiring him .
