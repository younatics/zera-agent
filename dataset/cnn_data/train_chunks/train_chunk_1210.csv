"Nicky Thornley nearly lost his arm from a spider bite inflicted when he was walking his dog in Northumberland . A personal trainer nearly lost his arm and may have even been killed by a mystery spider bite inflicted when he was walking his dog. Nicky Thornley from Jesmond, Newcastle, had to undergo three operations and spent five days in hospital after being bitten in Ponteland, Northumberland. The 33-year-old was warned by doctors if he'd waited any longer to seek treatment, he may have lost his limb or even died. After numerous operations to suck the creature's venom out of his finger, experts are still at a loss at what may have caused the gruesome injury. Mr Thornley saw no cause for concern when his finger started to itch while out walking his dog a fortnight ago. He said: 'To begin with I thought I had been bitten by a fly and put some cream on it. 'I had an itch and I was scratching it but it kept getting worse until it swelled up to the size of a balloon. 'I was in agony.' Three days later, the personal trainer awoke in the middle of the night in excruciating pain, his left hand throbbing. 'I just knew in myself something was very wrong. I thought, I am going to have to go to casualty. I was in a lot of pain,' he added. Upon arrival at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, doctors decided to operate on the man's finger. Scroll down for video . 'The doctor asked me if I had been abroad, but I hadn’t. The only places I had been were Ponteland, Jesmond and Gosforth. 'It is a mystery. 'I was told if I had left it any longer to seek treatment the situation could have been much worse. I might even have lost a limb. The 33-year-old personal trainer thought nothing of his itchy finger before it swelled up and began throbbing . Mr Thornley urged others who are bitten to seek help as soon as possible to avoid long term damage. Pictured right, a false widow spider which were recorded in higher numbers in the UK this year . 'When I went to A&E I thought that I would just be given some different antibiotics. I couldn't believe it when I was told I would need an operation to get the venom out. Mr Thornley was left with a scar and several stitches but will make a full recovery . 'It was only after the third one that they were happy it had all gone. The poison was still in there after two operations.' Mr Thornley was left with stitches and an S-shaped scar on his finger but is expected to recover fully. He warned others suffering similar symptoms to have their injuries looked at as soon as possible to avoid long-term damage. 'It is important that these bites are treated quickly otherwise they can become extremely nasty. 'If I’d have ignored it, it would have been a different story. 'The infection was preventing circulation and I could have died or lost a limb.' Doctors took a sample of the venom in Mr Thornley's finger but have been unable to identify the species responsible for the bite. Earlier this year a 44-year-old woman had her finger amputated after being bitten by an unknown spider in County Durham. Another woman had to have venom drained from her foot after being bitten by a false widow at her home in Strood, Kent.","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"Despite years of research suggesting otherwise, a new study claims humans did not evolve to cooperate with one another as strongly as first thought. Previous theories claim that in nature, humans cooperate because it in everyone's interest to do so. But, given half the chance, people have a tendency to be selfish - especially if they can increase the amount they benefit from betraying or deceiving someone. Two University of Pennsylvania researchers studied human cooperation. Their study focused on a game theory called the Prisoner's Dilemma, in which people are more likely to benefit if they were selfish (stock image shown) instead of cooperating . The latest study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was carried out by scientists from the University of Pennsylvania. In a series of experiments twisting the classical game theory match-up known as the Prisoner's Dilemma, selfish strategies became more successful. In the classic game, if both players cooperate, they both receive an equal payoff. This game theory looks at how people might cooperate or betray one another for their own interests. In the classic example, two members of a criminal gang are arrested. Each are held separately to one another. There is not enough evidence to convict them of their main charge, but they are both given a year in prison on a lesser charge. However, the police give each separately the option of betraying the other and turning them in, or staying silent and cooperating. If both stay silent and don't testify agfainst the other, they will each serve their single year in prison. However, if one betrays the other, but the other chose to cooperate, then the one who betrayed will be set free and the other is given three years in prison. If they both betray each other, they both serve two years in prison. The theory goes that two rational people would choose to betray, as they are guaranteed not to get the worst sentence. However, previous studies have shown that humans show a bias towards cooperating. But if one cooperates and the other does not, the cooperating player receives the smallest possible payoff, and the defecting player the largest. If both players do not cooperate, they both receive a payoff, but it is less than what they would gain if both had cooperated. In general it pays to cooperate, but it can pay even more to be selfish. Last year, postdoctoral researcher Alexander Stewart and Proffesor Joshua Plotkin from the University of Pennsylvania published a mathematical explanation for why cooperation and generosity have evolved in nature. But their new research played out in a large, evolving population, found that adding more flexibility to the game can allow selfish strategies to be more successful. In the new investigation, the researchers added a  twist. Not only could players alter their strategy - whether or not they cooperate - but they could also vary the payoffs they received for cooperating. Initially, as in their earlier study, cooperative strategies found success. But with higher and higher payoffs at stake, the temptation to defect also rose. And they found that the population of players reached a tipping point, after which defection was the predominant strategy in the population. The work paints a dimmer but more realistic view of how cooperation and selfishness balance one another in nature. 'It's a somewhat depressing evolutionary outcome, but it makes intuitive sense,' said Proffesor Plotkin. 'We had a nice picture of how evolution can promote cooperation even among self-interested agents and indeed it sometimes can, but, when we allow mutations that change the nature of the game, there is a runaway evolutionary process, and suddenly defection becomes the more robust outcome.' Previous studies found people are more likely to cooperate (stock image shown) more than not, but the latest research revealed that by increasing the reward for betrayal, people became more selfish. This suggests humans are not naturally wired to cooperate with each other .","University of Pennsylvania researchers studied human cooperation .

"One Japanese company has discovered an ingenious way to combat the problem of food wastage... by converting udon noodles into electricity. In total, the company generates 180,000 kwH of electricity each year, enough to power about 50 households. Chiyoda Manufacturing Company work with local udon producers and restaurants in Takamatsu, Kagawa Prefecture to convert the methane released by the wheat noodles into energy. There are 800 udon noodle restaurants in the coastal city of Takamatsu. With the new tecnology the city's food waste is now converted to enough energy to power 50 households . In the  coastal city of Takamatsu, there are 800 restaurants all serving the region's speciality, Sanuki Udon. In a city of 400,000 inhabitants, that's one udon restaurant for every 500 inhabitants. At a local factory, Sanuki Mengy, udon noodles are produced and packaged, ready to be shipped all over Japan. Every day, a maximum of 100,000 portions of udon noodles are produced. However only noodles with the perfect length and size are sold. Everything that doesn't meet the rigid criteria gets discarded, explains Kagawa Masaaki, president of the company. 'We discard about 150 tonnes of udon noodles every year,' says Masaaki. 'And that is not just from this factory, but also includes seven udon restaurants that produce Sanuki-udon noodles in the Kagawa prefecture.' Every day, a maximum of 100,000 portions of udon noodles are produced . Approximately 150 tonnes of udon noodles are discarded every year due to imperfections . Until recently, the udon waste rotted away in landfills, releasing methane, a potent greenhouse gas. But with Chiyoda Manufacturing Company's technology, the gas is put to good use. At the company's plant, the dry udon noodles are first ground up to increase the surface area before being mixed with water. The mixture then undergoes a fermentation process and various stages of purification which turns 10 per cent of it into ethanol. Different temperature levels are used to separate water from ethanol. Ethanol is a highly combustible fuel which can be used for energy production and other purposes. The company uses the remaining 90 per cent to produce biogases such as methane, which is used to generate electricity. The process is still in testing phase and the engineers are working to optimise it. Ozaki Tetsuo, engineer and head of Technology and Development at Chiyoda Manufacturing, explained: 'No matter how hard we try, there will always be some residue. So we are working on reusing the residue and developing a process that produces no waste at all.' Dry udon noodles are first ground up to increase the surface area before being mixed with water. The mixture then undergoes a fermentation process which turns 10 per cent of it into ethanol . Currently, the company is working on turning the runoff liquid into a fertiliser for wheat and onion, which are ingredients and toppings, respectively, for a bowl of udon. Thus, the waste recycling scheme goes full circle. In exchange for receiving the waste noodles for free, the company does not charge anything for picking up the waste from the restaurants and factories. Eiji Iketsu, President of Chiyoda Manufacturing Company, emphasises the importance of recycling schemes like this. 'Biomass based recycling schemes are increasingly popular here in Japan. This is just the beginning. It is our task to promote and spread this technique further,' he says. Back at the restaurant, people are enjoying their daily bowl of udon. A customer has already heard of the udon recycling scheme and is impressed by it. But would he leave some of the udon in his bowl behind on purpose, knowing that it will be used to generate electricity? 'No. When I eat udon, it becomes my energy, so there is nothing wasted there.' It seems the schemes biggest challenge is convincing locals to stop eating all their noodles. Udon are thick, white noodles made from wheat flour and are typically served in a fish or miso broth.","Chiyoda Manufacturing Company changes methane from waste into energy .

"France’s state-run railway looks poised to take control of Britain’s flagship East Coast mainline after shares in the two rival British bidders plummeted amid market speculation of a Gallic take-over. The value of First Group fell by £150 million, while Stagecoach, which has submitted a joint bid with Virgin, saw £33 million wiped off its shares. Big money in the City was betting strongly that a bid by Channel Tunnel rail operator Eurostar International and sister company Keolis – both controlled by Socialist France’s state-owned rail firm SNCF – is set to win the contract for the route from London to Edinburgh. If confirmed later this week, the decision is set to provoke outrage among UK rail bosses and unions. Critics fear it is yet another example of the UK ‘selling off the family silver’ to foreign investors. France’s state-run railway looks set to take control of Britain’s flagship East Coast mainline, pictured, after shares in two rival British bidders plummeted . Rail unions say the sell-off is in any case ‘a national disgrace’ and that French, German and Dutch state-owned railways have already made huge inroads into the UK’s privatised franchises. The RMT union said this ‘proves once again that the Government are happy to have state control of our main inter-city routes as long as it’s not the British state.’ The RMT recently published research showing that 20 of the UK’s 27 private rail franchises, the equivalent of 74 per cent, are now owned by foreign state-owned or state-backed railways ‘with the vast majority being from France, Germany and the Netherlands’. Shares in two major British transport firms which mounted rival bids against the French both fell sharply yesterday. First Group bore the brunt of the hit, seeing its share price plummet 10 per cent or 11.6p to 108.2p, wiping nearly £150million off its value. Stagecoach shares were down 1.5per cent to 362.4p, knocking around £33million off the share price. A spokesman for First Group, which runs existing UK franchises including Great Western, ScotRail and Transpennine said it does not comment on ‘market rumours and speculation.’ Virgin Rail also declined to comment ahead of an official announcement. Channel Tunnel rail operator Eurostar International looks set to win the contract for the route from London to Edinburgh . But defeat would mark another bitter disappointment for First, which was passed over to continue running ScotRail franchise in favour of Dutch-owed Abellio, lost out for the Thameslink Great Northern service as well as the Essex Thameside operations. Ironically, the East Coast line is currently owned by the taxpayer and controlled by the Government via a specially established company called Directly Operated Railways (DOR) in Whitehall. Profits go back to the taxpayer rather than to shareholders. The state-run East Coast mainline has generated a bumper £1billion windfall for taxpayers over five years since 2009 - prompting unions to brand its sell off back to the private sector as ‘a national disgrace.’ East Coast paid a record £235m back to the Government in its final full year as a ‘nationalised’ company – up 12 per cent on the previous year. RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: ‘We are rapidly heading towards a situation where almost the entire train operation in Britain is in the hands of overseas companies sucking out profits to benefit their own domestic transport services.’ Germany’s state-owned Deutsche Bahn is already a big player. Mr Cash added: ‘It seems you can have state operation of railways in Britain as long as it isn’t by the British state for the benefit of the British people. There must be a full parliamentary inquiry into this appalling racket.’ The East Coast main line has been under the control of the Department for Transport since the previous private-sector operator National Express pulled out in 2009. Before that, in 2007, another private company GNER also ceased its East Coast operation after its parent company Sea Containers ran into financial difficulties. The Government hands over operation of the line in March next year. The Department for Transport says it has considered value for money, long-term benefits for communities across the route and improved services for passengers and local businesses ‘and not just the return to the taxpayer.’","A bid by Channel Tunnel operator Eurostar International looks set to win the contract for the London to Edinburgh route .

"For men who love to sniff out a bargain while keeping the woman in their life happy, this may seem like the perfect Christmas gift. A £4 Lidl perfume smells almost exactly the same as a £70 scent from Chanel, according to a money-saving expert. But for those considering smuggling the cut-price bottle into their other half's Christmas stocking, beware – the plain packaging could prove something of a giveaway. Bargain expert says Lidl's £4 Suddenly Madame Glamour (right) is virtually indistinguishable from Chanel's Coco Mademoiselle (left) Bargain expert Martin Lewis revealed Lidl's Suddenly Madame Glamour is virtually indistinguishable from Chanel's Coco Mademoiselle. But while the more expensive scent is endorsed by actress Keira Knightley and housed in a luxurious box, its budget alternative comes in a rather less inspiring plain bottle. The Chanel scent is endorsed by actress Keira Knightley and presented in a luxurious box . Mr Lewis said there were many other 'smell-alike' perfumes on the market that simply reeked of luxury but would not break the bank. At first sniff, for example, Next's £14 Just Pink is almost identical to the £50 Ralph Lauren Romance. In an interview with the Radio Times, Mr Lewis warned: 'When you buy perfumes and aftershaves, a lot of the cost goes into the branding and the marketing. 'However there are a number of 'smell-alikes' out there. We've done tests and most people can't tell the difference. It's important to be clear we're not talking about buying knock-off copies here.' Mr Lewis also urged families trying to cut down their spending this Christmas to avoid giving unnecessary gifts. 'Many people hate the ever-growing, creeping list of presents,' he said. 'We do tit-for-tat giving, and the end result is I buy you one, and you buy me one. We end up giving stuff that people will never use. 'Say to people, 'I won't buy one for you, don't buy one for me'. Keep your gifts for children and very close family.' Lidl and Next are not the only high street retailers to sell budget perfumes with a whiff of luxury. Superdrug launched a range in September last year with prices starting at £4. Simon Comins, its buying director, said: 'Fragrance doesn't have to cost the earth. 'Of course many people love the sense of luxury that comes with wearing a designer perfume, but a savvy shopper is happy to wear an amazing fragrance that doesn't come with the designer bottle and luxury price tag.'","Bargain expert says Lidl's Suddenly Madame Glamour smells like Chanel .

"Killed by racists? Alfred Wright, 28, whose . family have raised questions after his mutilated  body was found in an area of Texas notorious . for its racism . The brother of an American Idol . contestant whose mutilated body was found in brush in East Texas may have been the . victim of a racist murder, his family claim. Alfred . Wright from Jasper, Texas, the brother of American Idol contestant . Savion, was found dead last November with his eyes, several teeth, his left ear and his tongue missing. Nevertheless, authorities concluded that he died from a drugs overdose. A . small town near the Louisiana border, Jasper is infamous as the site of . the 1998 murder of James Byrd Jr, who was tied to the back of a pick up . by white supremacists and dragged for three miles along an asphalt . road. Now suspicions have . been raised that Mr Wright's death, like that of Mr Byrd's, was also a . racist murder, after a claim that he was carrying on an affair with the . relative of a white police officer. A local source told Radar: 'Alfred was dating the white relative of someone in law enforcement. 'You can’t do that in East Texas. If you’re a black man, you’ll get killed.They still have cross burnings in that area!' Further deepening the mystery surrounding Mr Wright's death, his wife claims that she found three charges he made at local hotels while she and their children were away in the month before he died. And a private investigator hired by Mr Wright's family claims that local police knew that he had been in some kind of relationship, the nature of which is unclear, with a woman related to the sheriff. '[They] knew about the rumours,' Chuck Foreman told Radar. 'That's what makes it interesting. [They] definitely knew.' The . body of Mr Wright, who was just 28 years old, was discovered by . volunteers last November, in an area of thick East Texas underbrush that . had been supposedly already scoured by Sabine County sheriff's . deputies. His family felt . forced to act themselves to track down their son after the initial . police search - which found some of his possessions and portions of his . clothing - was called off after just four days. Dressed . in just underwear, a pair of spotless tennis shoes, and with one sock . on his left foot, his body was badly disfigured - his eyes, left ear and . several teeth were missing, and his tongue had apparently been torn . out. According to some reports, his throat also appeared to have been slashed. Close: Alfred Wright (right) pictured with his brother Savion, a contestant in American Idol . Tribute: Savion was eliminated from the competition last week after singing a song dedicated to his brother . Mr Wright pictured with his wife Lauren: There . is a suggestion that he had been having an affair with the relative of a . policeman, and his wife said she found he had made payments at a hotel shortly before his death . Mr Wright's father Douglas was one of . the first to the scene where his son's body was discovered amid brambles . on that rainy November night. 'He was just, if I might say, he was neatly laid. He was neatly laid,' he told CNN. 'What . was weird about his sock,' the elder Mr Wright went on, was that it . 'was clean, and his sock was pulled up with his phone stuck in it as if . he was in a Sunday school class. Neat. His tennis shoes was very clean.' An . official post-mortem investigation concluded that Mr Wright had died . accidentally as a result of drug intoxication, and that his mutilations . were the result of animal and insect activity. But . Dr Lee Ann Grossberg, a forensic pathologist hired by Wright's family, . said her preliminary review made findings that were 'suspicious of . homicidal violence'. The questions Alfred Wright's have posed to the authorities include: . Dr . Grossberg said she needs more photos and documents from the . investigation to determine if tissue missing from Mr Wright's neck and . face might have been caused before his death. 'For . me, the most frustrating thing has been not knowing what happened,' said Lauren Wright, Alfred Wright's widow. 'We don't have closure.' Mr . Wright was last seen on November 7. He had been driving around, . visiting his physical therapy patients, when his truck broke down at . around dusk by grocery store in a rural area just south of Hemphill, . about 170 miles north-east of Houston. He called his wife in Jasper, who sent his parents to pick him up. When his parents arrived about an hour later, Mr Wright's truck was there but he had vanished. Wright's wristwatch and pieces of the scrubs he had been wearing were found in a nearby pasture a day later. The search was called off just after four days, with Sabine County Sheriff Thomas Maddox telling reporters all resources had been exhausted and he believed this was a missing person case. Mutilated: Mr Wright was found dead last November with body parts, including his eyes, several teeth and tongue missing, and stripped to his underwear. But authorities claim he died from a drugs overdose . The U.S. Department of Justice this . week took over the investigation into Mr Wright's death, which has been . headed by Texas Rangers since the Sabine County Sheriff's Office handed . it over in November. Tom . Vinger, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Public Safety, which . oversees the Texas Rangers, said his agency could not comment on details . of the case because of the ongoing investigation. Cade Bernsen, one of the attorneys for . the Wright family, said that he thought the initial search for their . son's remains had been 'incredibly ill-performed'. 'It's questionable how his body was not found when the sheriff said (they) ran dogs through there.' he added. A . toxicology report found drugs in Wright's body, including cocaine and . methamphetamine. The autopsy report did not narrow down when Wright . died. 'I don't feel (the drugs in his system) had anything to do with his demise,' Mrs Wright said. Though . Mr Wright had been facing a federal embezzlement charge in Tennessee, . his wife said she doesn't believe that had anything to do with his . disappearance. Much to live for: A toxicology report found . drugs in Wright's body, including cocaine and methamphetamine, but his . wife said she can't believe that the drugs had anything to do with his untimely death . Mr Bernsen said the Texas Rangers have refused to provide additional information that Grossberg needs to finish her report. And . while the attorney added that there is no evidence this was a hate . crime, Mrs Wright, who is white, said she is not ruling out the . possibility. 'We can't forget the history of the area because we're both from here,' she said. She described her husband as a hard-working, dedicated father. Eerie similarities: Mr Wright's death has awoken memories of the killing of James Byrd Jr, who was tied to a truck by white supremacists and dragged to his death along a rural road in the same area . Davilyn . Walston, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern . District of Texas, said her agency is reviewing the investigation but . declined further comment. J. Kevin Dutton, district attorney for Sabine and San Augustine counties, . said in a statement he 'welcomes the investigation by the Justice . Department as there are serious allegations being made that need to be . resolved.'] .

"Bees are being wiped out because the great British countryside is much less colourful than it once was, a study shows. Once abundant fields and hedgerows full of wildflowers have disappeared because of intensive farming and urban sprawl. Scientists warn this habitat loss is a bigger factor in their decline than climate change. It means strategies to reverse bee losses needs to target and preserve their favourite plants. Bees are being wiped out because the great British countryside is much less colourful than it once was, a study shows . In the UK it has been estimated we have lost 97 per cent of our flower-rich grassland since the 193Os. And bees and flowers rely on each other. Bumblebees help pollinate many wildflowers, allowing them to reproduce in return for food. Without this pollination many of these plants would not produce seeds, resulting in further declines in wildflowers which will have a knock on effect for other insects and animals higher up in the food chain. Dr Jeroen Scheper, of Wageningen University in The Netherlands, and colleagues said: 'Growing concern about bee declines and associated loss of pollination services has increased the urgency to identify the underlying causes. 'So far the identification of the key drivers of decline of bee populations has largely been based on speculation. 'We assessed the relative importance of a range of proposed factors responsible for wild bee decline and show loss of preferred host plant species is one of the main factors associated with the decline of bee populations in The Netherlands. Scientists warn this habitat loss is a bigger factor in their decline than climate change, pictured is a European Honey Bee . 'Interestingly species foraging on crop plant families have stable ir increasing populations.' The findings published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences mirror research in the UK showing bumblebees are under threat because changes in agricultural techniques has led to fewer wildflowers which until relatively recently was much more colourful. Technology and demand for increased food production meant traditional farming was abandoned in favour of increasing productivity but ultimately reducing the abundance of wildflowers. As bees rely entirely upon flowers for food, their populations began to rapidly decline in most places. Two species have become extinct in the UK since the start of the 21st century. Cullem's bumblebee (Bombus cullumanus) was last recorded in 1941 and the short-haired bumblebee (Bombus subterraneus) in 1988. Both are still found in Europe but the British populations may have been specially adapted to our climate and environment. Several other species could soon follow suit - in particular the Great yellow bumblebee and the Shrill carder bee which are now only present in small numbers. In the study the Dutch researcher Jeroen Scheper compared populations of 57 wild bee species with trends in host plants by analysing pollen on the bodies of specimens going back to before 195O. The other main factor associated with bee decline was body size with larger ones most vulnerable, possibly because of land use changes meaning they have fewer floral resources to satisfy their greater pollen requirements. Surprisingly diet breadth - the number of different host plants used by a species - was also of minor importance suggesting those that rely only on a few are not susceptible as long as these are not declining. Pesticides, loss of habitat and climate change have previously been blamed for the shrinking of honeybee populations. But the researchers said: 'These results indicate mitigation strategies for loss of wild bees will only be effective if they target the specific host plants of declining bee species.' It's well-known bumblebees are great pollinators and so have a key role in producing much of the food we eat. Through the pollination of many commercial crops such as tomatoes, peas, apples and strawberries, insects are estimated to contribute over £4OO million per annum to the UK economy. If the decline of bumblebee and other insect pollinator continue, the extremely high cost of pollinating these plants by other means could significantly increase the cost of fruit and vegetables.","Bees are being wiped out as the  countryside is less colourful, experts say .

"A US Navy admiral has been accused of making counterfeit $500 poker chips after developing a serious gambling habit. Vice-Admiral Timothy M. Giardina, who was fired last year as second in command of US nuclear forces, spent 1,000 hours at the poker tables during the 18 months leading up to his downfall when he was caught with three fake chips in an Iowa casino. Mr Giardina denies playing any role in the making of the chips, despite DNA evidence linking him to the process of turning a genuine $1 chip into a fake $500 one. Gambler: Navy Vice Admujral Tim Giardina was known as 'Navy Tim' at the local casino, and spent more than 1,000 hours - or 15 hours per week - there in the 18 months leading up to the fake chips incident . Mr Giardina has previously admitted that he played the fake chips at a poker table in the Horseshoe Casino in Council Bluffs, Iowa, in June 2013. He was caught with three fake chips, but claimed he had found them in the bathroom of the casino, and decided to play with them. As part of a Navy criminal investigation into the counterfeit chips, Mr Giardina was fired as No. 2 commander of U.S. nuclear, and downgraded from a three-star admiral to a two-star admiral. The three chips in question were altered with paint and stickers to make genuine $1 casino chips look like $500 chips. An Army lab found a 'major contributor' of Mr Giardina's DNA on the underside of the adhesive sticker that had been affixed by the counterfeiter. Mr Giardina claims he found the fake chips in the mensroom at the  Horseshoe Casino in Council Bluffs, Iowa . In a statement released in April this year, Mr Giardina said he deeply regretted having not immediately surrendered to security officers the four chips which he said he found in a toilet stall at the Horseshoe. He said it was an 'error of judgment' that he put three of the chips in play at a poker table, and said he was sorry that he subsequently lied in saying he had purchased them from a man in the bathroom. 'I should have either told the truth or remained silent instead of lying about the events when questioned' by an Iowa state investigator on June 18, 2013, he wrote. That was two days after he played the fake chips and casino officials determined they were counterfeits. He added, 'This lapse in judgment does not make me a thief and a criminal.' Mr Giardina also wrote that he does not have a gambling problem. However, a new document released under the freedom of information act paints a different picture. According to these documents, Mr Giardina was known as 'Navy Tim' at the Horseshoe, and spent more than 1,000 hours - or 15 hours per week - playing poker in the casino in the 18 months leading up to the fake chips incident, the Telegraph reports. At the time of the casino incident, Mr Giardina was deputy commander of U.S. Strategic Command, which has responsibility for the nation's entire nuclear weapons force and is based near Omaha, Nebraska. Mr Giardina denies playing any role in the making of the chips, despite DNA evidence linking him to the process of turning a genuine $1 chip into a fake $500 one . Mr Giardina wrote that in discussing his case with the commander of Strategic Command at the time, Air Force Gen. Robert Kehler, as well as Navy officers and law enforcement officials in Iowa, 'the common opinion is that I have a 'gambling problem' and that this gambling problem was my motive' in the counterfeiting. He added that Kehler, who has since retired from the military, felt Mr Giardina had an 'obvious gambling problem.' Mr Giardina wrote that he does not have a gambling problem and does not consider poker a form of gambling. 'Regardless of anyone's opinion on the matter, disapproval of the legal manner in which I spent portions of my off-duty time is not adequate grounds to allege criminal misconduct,' Giardina wrote. Mr Giardina had been at risk of being prosecuted by the Navy for counterfeiting the chips, but Gortney chose instead to give him what the military calls non-judicial punishment — in this case a letter of reprimand and the loss of $4,000 in salary. Navy officials have said no court martial was sought because the available DNA evidence against Giardina might not hold up in court. In his April 2014 statement to Gortney, Mr Giardina wrote that he suspects the chip counterfeiter left them in the bathroom stall 'for a reason,' possibly to observe casino security's reaction when the finder either turned them in or put them in play. 'I do not believe I was singled out to find them, but believe that I was a patsy for someone who wanted the chips to be found,' he wrote. Mr Giardina's gambling habits 'may be a symptom of wider malaise at the heat of America's nuclear deterrent,' the Telegraph writes. Earlier this month, US  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel pledged an additional $10 billion to correct deep problems of neglect and mismanagement within the nation's nuclear forces. Hagel ordered top-to-bottom changes in the nuclear arsenal's management, which he said had been allowed over the years to backslide, afflicted by broken and missing equipment, poor leadership and inadequate training and staffing. Hagel announced that the Defense Department will boost spending on the nuclear forces by about ten per cent a year for the next five years, a total increase of about $10 billion over the five years.","Vice-Admiral Timothy Giardina caught with fake chips in June 2013 .

"Wealthy buyers have snapped up almost all the luxury 220 apartments in a $250 million steel and glass development block in Sydney on the same day they went on sale. The homes including four penthouses, which will not be complete until December 2017, went on the market in Sydney, Jakarta and Singapore on Saturday. The Crown Group developer revealed that 95 per cent of the one, two and three-bedroom apartments were sold within four hours and that the 27th floor penthouses sold out within one hour. A total of $173.1 million in apartments at the 161 Clarence Street building in Sydney were purchased, with the prices of apartments sold starting from $826,650 for a one-bedroom suite. Scroll down for video . An artist impression of the Sydney by Crown apartment block, which is due to be complete by December 2017 . Residents at the luxury block can enjoy a rooftop entertainment area looking over Darling Harbour, an indoor swimming pool, fully equipped gym and the convenience of shops and restaurants on the ground level of the tower. Anyone wanting to snap up one – or a bunch – of the apartments with panoramic views had to pre-register and then sign contracts. Over 500 people turned out to the Sydney office for the launch in Sydney alone. The 27-storey building will be constructed in the heart of Sydney city centre. Prices of the apartments sold started from $826,650 for a one-bedroom suite . Residents will be able to enjoy panoramic views and an indoor swimming pool . Crown Group Chief Executive Officer Iwan Sunito said the success of the Sydney by Crown launch was reflective of a growing demand for high-end property in Sydney and a record result for the company. Sydney by Crown is the only new apartment building in the CBD to launch before the end of 2014. 'The launch of Sydney by Crown is the strongest launch day result in Crown Group's history,' Mr Sunito said. 'Sydney by Crown is set to become one of Sydney's architectural centrepieces, a globally recognised icon, designed in Sydney, for Sydneysiders. Sydney by Crown has captured the attention of the world. Sydney by Crown, influenced by Japanese design, is the only new apartment building in the CBD to launch before the end of 2014 . A total of $173.1 million in apartments at the 161 Clarence Street building were purchased on Saturday . 'We received thousands of enquiries from around the world prior to launch and today's result reflects the strong appetite for high-quality apartments built by developers with a good track record in Sydney,' he said. 'Many of our buyers on Saturday were past purchasers of Crown Group apartments, a testament to our reputation and quality of our developments,' Mr Sunito added. The Sydney-based architect who designed the Sydney by Crown tower, Koichi Takada, is also the man behind a plan for a new apartment block in Sydney's Green Square, 4km south of the city centre. As part of the 280 hectare Green Square redevelopment area, the architecture firm has proposed plans for 416 luxury apartments and 5,000sqm of retail and restaurant space. Koichi is said to mix the traditions of his Japanese homeland with 'flowing forms'. And the success of Sydney by Crown comes after the launch of Crown Group's Skye by Crown in North Sydney last year, when more than 110 apartments worth more than $100 million were sold within a week.","The 27-storey Sydney by Crown Tower will not be complete until 2017 .

"A woman whose seven-year-old son suffers from seizures has spoken out, saying his school district has been unwilling to help with finding a way for his service dog to come with him to school. Mother Ericha Flateau, of Franklin, Massachusetts, told WCVB that service dog Paris is essential around-the-clock for her son Austin. 'Dogs can smell a chemical change when, um, a seizure starts,' she told the affiliate station. Scroll down for video . Helping hand: Service dog Paris, seen next to 7-year-old Austin Flateau, can reportedly detect when the boy is about to have a seizure . Condition: Austin Flateau lives with two brain malformations, which can also influence his speech . Austin Flateau lives with two brain malformations that can influence his speech, the affiliate station reported. 'His scariest symptom from that is seizure disorder,' Ericha Flateau said of her son's condition to WCVB. Over $15,000 was raised to cover Paris' training by Austin's family  - which has said that his one-on-one aide has not been given permission by Franklin Public Schools to manage Paris, the news outlet reported. 'His school has said ""Okay, she can come, but we're not going to have any responsibilities for her,'"" Ericha Flateau also told WCVB. Because of this, she told the affiliate station her two options include stopping working and stepping in as Austin's dog handler or paying for a dog handler. Ericha Flateau has said she might have to relocate if a plan regarding the use of the service dog with the school district isn't possible . Resistance: Austin's mother Ericha Flateau (seen with her son and Paris) says the local school district has said it will not be responsible for the dog . Franklin Public Schools has said it 'fully provides and promotes access for all individuals with disabilities, including those that require that assistance of service animals' The Franklin School District directed the affiliate station to a law which says 'A public entity is not responsible for the care or supervision of a service animal.' Flateau told WCVB she might have to relocate if a plan regarding the use of the service dog with the school district isn't possible. In a Sunday 'Fox and Friends' appearance, she said 'So for a couple of weeks [Austin] was out of school because we were actually in Ohio training with his dog Paris, but he has not returned to school since we have been home, and the reason for that is because she provides a medical seizure alert. So they essentially need to be at each other's hips 24/7. 'Um, I cannot afford to hire a third-party dog handler, um, and I also can’t afford not to go to work myself,” she said. 'So [Paris] has been home with him since we returned home from training.' The school district, meanwhile, said it 'fully provides and promotes access for all individuals with disabilities, including those that require that assistance of service animals' in a statement sent to the television program.

"For those who struggled to unsee the horrific images of fur seals forcing themselves on female king penguins, a graphic artist has come up with something to replace them. Los Angeles-based graphic artist has imagined what the potential result of these unholy alliances would look like, and unsurprisingly, they're rather cute.

A US graphic artist has imagined what the babies of a seal and a penguin would look like . However, these cute images have a very sincere undertone, following last week's revelation that fur seals have been raping king penguins on a small island off the coast of South Africa. The disturbing behaviour of a group of fur seals on Marion Island, sub-Antarctic Indian Ocean, was revealed by a group of South African scientists last week. Astonishing footage captured by the group showed an enormous seal attacking a female king penguin and forcing itself on her. 'You are no child of mine': As cute as it might look, the king penguin does not look happy to have had a half seal-half penguin baby . 'My daddy did what?' A baby seal has been given a penguin's beak and eyes in this hybrid creation .

A baby peal: A baby penguin has been given the face of a seal pup in this photoshopped hybrid . The scientists said they have made four separate observations of individual Antarctic fur seals sexually assaulting adult king penguins as they tried to resist. After three of the incidents, the seals let the penguins go - but following one attack, the seal killed the penguin and ate it. 'Given the awful news stories of penguins being raped by fur seals, I felt it my hybridizing obligation to explore the hypothetical offspring of these assaults,' Ms DeRemer explains.

"Dozens of pit bull owners paraded with their dogs in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to mark their legal victory that overturned its decade-long ban on the breed. About 40 dogs and their owners on Sunday celebrated a Superior Court judge's November 18 ruling which overturned the sanction. Pawtucket Police Chief Paul Kelly said the city imposed the ban in 2004 to try to curtail the number of pit bull attacks on residents. Scroll down for video . Cause for celebration: Dozens of pit bull owners paraded with their dogs in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to celebrate their legal victory that overturned it decade-long ban on pit bills . At the time of the ban, Kelly said local drug dealers were using pit bulls to prevent police from house raids, posing a hazard to the officers. Supporters of the piece of breed-specific legislation said the incident rate dropped substantially after its enactment. However, in 2013 the state  barred cities from banning specific breeds. Then last Tuesday the news broke that pit bulls had been legalized in Pawtucket. Dog owners say authorities should 'punish the deed, not the breed.'

It ended with a free dog training session. Ann Clark, vice president of Pit Bulls for PTSD, told NBC News that pit bulls are a 'wonderful breed.' 'People blame the wrong end of the leash. It's all about how you raise them, how you care for them,' she continued.

"Desperate to make deals in the fourth quarter, stores are starting Black Friday sales early again this year and opening their doors on Thanksgiving itself. Some retailers went so far as to start slashing prices right after Halloween, with Amazon beating everyone to the chase by starting their Black Friday sale a week early on November 21. In fact, the daunting early-morning journey to wait in line outside big-box stores may not be worth it this year,  with a recent survey of ads showing shoppers could save more on Cyber Monday, the online sale that starts three days later. Early birds: Amazon started their Black Friday sale an entire week early. They will be freshening up their sale throughout the week with several new 'lightening deals' getting posted to the site as often as every 10 minutes . Something to watch a holiday movie on: The Samsung 32-inch TV on the right is currently selling for 38 per cent off at $247.99 . For the kids: Amazon has listed a set of Lincoln Logs for sale at $62.66 and a LeapFrog LeapBand at $24.99 . Savings: The Vince Camuto handbag on the left is 60 per cent off at $79.19. The Canon Rebel camera on the right is $200 dollars off, now listed at $549 . Tech steal: On the right, a Dell touchscreen laptop on sale for $659.19. Intel laptops are set to be 20 per cent off on the site . On your list?

Amazon will also be freshening up their sale throughout the week with new  'lightening deals' - sometimes as often as every 10 minutes. Those who subscribe to Amazon's prime service will get a 30 minute 'head start' on these deals. Offline, department store JCPenney will be offering the highest discounts on goods this Black Friday, according to a survey by WalletHub of 5,525 deals at 22 of America's biggest retailers.

The WalletHub survey also found that the steepest Black Friday discounts this year are on jewelry, with up to 58 per cent off some items . Walmart may not be the best for Black Friday shopping also since picketers are expected to gather outside 1,600 stores across the country to demand higher pay and full-time jobs. The retailer has been staggering it's seasonal sales ever since an employee was trampled to death at a Long Island, New York store on Black Friday morning 2008. When it comes to buying computers and phones, the ads show that Office Depot, Staples and Radio Shack are offering the highest discounts. Across all of the retailers, toys were the category with the most sales, making up 26 per cent of all Black Friday offers, which should spell good for little ones in the family.

Above, shoppers grapple for Black Friday advertisements outside a Kmart in Griffith, Indiana last year on November 22 . It's unclear how Amazon's already-started Black Friday deals stack up to the rest, since the retailer didn't provide all of their deals ahead of time for the WalletHub survey. 'Amazon did not provide all the requested info for all their Black Friday deals. As a result some deals could not be included in the calculations,. WalletHub's Richie Bernardo wrote. Other stores that didn't participate in the survey include Apple, Home Depot, Ikea and Lowe's.

In 2013, Black Friday discounts averaged at 40 per cent off, while Cyber Monday sales were on average 50 per cent reduced. Not to mention the advantage of knowing whether the TV you want is even in stock or not.

"Restaurants in Saudi Arabia have banned single women from entering because of their 'mentally unstable' behaviour such as using flirting, smoking and using mobile phones. Several restaurants have put up signs that say 'women are not allowed' in another blow for women's rights in the conservative Muslim kingdom. There is no law banning women from travelling alone in Saudi Arabia but deeply-held religious beliefs dictate that they should be accompanied by a male family member when out in public. Single women have been banned from some restaurants in Saudi Arabia for 'mentally unstable' behaviour such as flirting, smoking and using mobile phones (file picture) According to The Week, one restaurant owner said: 'We put up these signs because we have seen numerous incidents of flirting taking place inside the restaurant. 'We'll only remove these signs when we make sure such incidents never happen again on our premises because such type of behaviour negatively impacts our business.' Bloggers in the Middle Eastern state also described women who smoke and use mobile phones as 'mentally unstable'. One wrote: 'The best thing is to keep women away from restaurants unless they have a male custodian. 'That way the restaurant is not shut down because of the misbehaviour of an adolescent or mentally unstable woman.' Saudi Arabia is one of the worst nations in the world for women's rights, with women expected to be accompanied by a male guardian in public (file picture) The blogger added that one woman crossed the line when she came in alone and 'focused on her mobile'. Another online post said some women visiting restaurants had no respect. A man called Talal said: 'My brother has a restaurant and he says that even though there is a section for families, there are often instances of embarrassment. 'Several women would come in and would speak loudly without any respect for public behaviour. He says that it is difficult for him to get them to lower their voices.' Saudi Arabia has one of the worst record's for women's rights in the world. Women will be allowed to vote and run for office in local elections for the first time next year but are still not allowed to drive. There are no laws on the minimum age it is legal to marry at, with father's giving their daughters a way when they are just nine years old in some cases. Women can ride bicycles, but only in 'recreational areas' if they are wearing full Islamic body coverings and are accompanied by a male guardian. Khalid Al Fakhri, the head of Saudi Arabia's National Society for Human Rights, said: 'These signs are against the law and reflect the personal opinions of the restaurant owners.'","Restaurants in Saudi Arabia ban single women from entering premises .

"Russia was last night suspended from the elite G8 group of leading economies, who said they could not accept its breach of international law. David Cameron, Barack Obama and other world leaders said it was up to Vladimir Putin to 'change course' over Ukraine or his country will remain excluded indefinitely. Leaders of the remaining countries – Britain, the US, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Japan, who are calling themselves the G7 – agreed to meet again without Russia until it was ready to engage in 'meaningful discussion'. Scroll down for video . G7 leaders clockwise from left, EC president Herman Van Rompuy, Canadian PM Stephen Harper, French President Francois Hollande, British PM David Cameron, US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Japanese PM Shinzo Abe, Italian PM Matteo Renzi and EC president Jose Manuel Barroso . They made a joint statement following crisis talks on the sidelines of a summit about nuclear security, which was overshadowed by developments in Ukraine. Since the annexation of Crimea last week, Russian forces have stormed and seized control of three Ukrainian military bases and fuelled fears of further action. Mr Cameron said it was 'absolutely clear' that this summer's G8 summit, scheduled to be held in Sochi – the Russian resort which hosted the Winter Olympics – was cancelled. Instead, it will be held in Brussels in June, and Mr Putin will not be invited for the first time since Russia was admitted to the group in 1998. A G7 statement released last night said: 'This group came together because of shared beliefs and shared responsibilities. Russia's actions in recent weeks are not consistent with them.' The communique 'condemns Russia's illegal attempt to annex Crimea' as 'contravention of international law.' British Prime Minister David Cameron attends a meeting of G7 leaders . U.S. President Barack Obama hosted the meeting in The Hague, Netherlands . Foreign Secretary William Hague said: 'The President of the United States was very clear in the meeting that it will be hard to revive that (the G8) in the immediate future. 'It would need our values to be clear, our shared values to be clear again, and clearly those shared values are not shared by Russia in violating the independence and territorial integrity of a neighbouring nation.' But Russia's foreign minister, who was also in The Hague yesterday, played down the snub. Sergei Lavrov said: 'If our Western partners believe the format has exhausted itself, we don't cling to this format. We don't believe it will be a big problem if it doesn't convene'. A Dutch military police officer guards Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's Catshuis residence prior to a G7 meeting in The Hague . The move to isolate Russia diplomatically came as the US urged European countries to impose  tougher economic sanctions – even if it hurts the City or energy prices. Mr Obama said leaders were united on 'imposing a cost' on Mr Putin's regime amid concerns he has set his sights on further expansion. US security adviser Ben Rhodes said of the sanctions: 'We would like to see a steady ratcheting up of that pressure.' Britain and other European countries have imposed asset freezes and travel bans on a list of 33 Russian oligarchs and Putin loyalists. But they were urged to go further as Nato commander, General Philip Breedlove, warned that Russian troops on Ukraine's eastern border were 'very, very sizeable, and very, very ready' for action. Outnumbered Ukrainian forces were ordered to leave Crimea yesterday, and bade tearful farewells to loved ones left behind. Russian military experts said Mr Putin would decide in the next two weeks whether to launch 'a large-scale invasion of mainland Ukraine'. Analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said this could involve attacks on half a dozen Ukrainian cities. 'The troops are concentrated and ready for an offensive,' he said.","World leaders said it was up to Putin to 'change course'

"A man has been left without genitals and with three missing toes after a witch doctor told him that losing his body parts would make him rich. Chamangeni Zulu, from Malawi, has been hospitalised at Chipata General Hospital in Zambia, near the Malawi border, after he allowed the hyena to eat his manhood. Mr Zulu told the Times of Zambia yesterday that he was promised by a witch doctor that by sacrificing his body parts he would become rich. Mr Zulu, from Malawi, said he was told by a witch doctor that if he sacrificed some of his body parts he would become rich . 'I met some business persons who told me the best way to become rich was to sacrifice parts of my body,' he told the paper. At around 4am on Monday last week, the man went into the Zambian bush. Mr Zulu said: 'I was instructed to be naked and a hyena came to me and started eating my toes and eventually my manhood was eaten.' Mr Zulu said that the witch doctor did not make it clear that his body parts would be 'lost'. Yet despite the horrific ordeal, Mr Zulu admitted he was still hopeful of becoming rich. 'Even if I have lost some important parts of my body, I still want to get rich,' he said. The Malawi man has been living and working in Zambia for the past four months. Chipata Hospital described the man's condition as stable and said that he had been brought to the hospital by police officers. The man went into the Zambian bush while he allowed a hyena (not the animal pictured) to attack him. The animal first ate his toes before eating his genitals . In 2012, 50 miles from the same spot in the area of Chadiza, a man was attacked in the country after going out to the toilet in his garden. Isaac Mwale, 42 said that he saw a black animal which looked like a dog leap at him before it mauled his leg. After the attack, villagers appealed to the Zambia Wildlife Authority to cull the number of hyenas in the area. The brutal attack happened in Chapita, a city near the Malawi border in Zambia .","Chamangeni Zulu said was told that losing body parts would make him rich .

"Headmistress Alice Phillips said the rise of social media meant every action taken by a parent is now subject to 'global scrutiny' Facebook and Twitter are creating a generation of parents afraid to discipline their teenage children in case they are then embarrassed on social media, a leading headmistress warned yesterday. Teenagers are increasingly refusing to back down in rows with mothers and fathers as friends egg them on via social networking sites, according to Alice Phillips, president of the Girls' Schools Association. Parents are becoming 'less bold and intuitive' when disciplining adolescents amid fears that family disputes will be broadcast to hundreds of the youngsters' friends online, she warned. Whereas children might previously have reflected alone in their bedrooms and 'moved on', they were now more likely to 'continue the fight' in cahoots with their online allies. Mrs Phillips argued in a speech to the GSA annual conference in London that parenting is now more difficult than ever before because of money worries and the pressure of domestic disputes being put under 'global scrutiny'. Schools should consider giving parents classes to help them 'hold the line' after making decisions that are unpopular with their children, she added. Her warning comes days after a large Government study of 13-year-olds found they increasingly spend time alone at home instead of being out with friends. A portrait of today's 13-year-olds found that social networking sites were eclipsing personal contact with friends after school and at weekends. Nearly half of girls – 47 per cent – reported using social networking or instant messaging sites 'throughout the day' and 30 per cent of boys. Mrs Phillips, of St Catherine's School, a private girls' school near Guildford, Surrey, told the conference of her concern for parents. 'I find myself increasingly wanting to reach out to them as I believe that parenting has never been as difficult as it is today,' she said. 'Why? Because one's instincts are constantly challenged and spontaneous confidence dissolves. Parents are becoming less bold and intuitive in parenting adolescents. 'Today, social media means they are conscious that their every action is the subject of global scrutiny. 'Children, as grumpy as any of us were when given the answer No, retreat in the same way to their bedrooms but instead of reflecting for a while to blaring music, broadcast their parents' apparently unreasonable behaviour to all their Facebook friends, or Twitter followers, whose own parents are apparently also 'completely out of touch'. 'Where once they might have taken time out to come to their senses, apologise and 'move on', now they are more likely to continue the fight.' Children are choosing to share their anger with friends online instead of sulking in their bedrooms, which means that parents are constantly left questioning their decisions (stock image) Mrs Phillips also said she was constantly forced to use the phrase 'a mother's place is in the wrong' to reassure parents whose daughters were competing 'for the place of alpha females'. 'Nonetheless, it takes courage and a long time these days to stay out there 'in the wrong' until your teen gradually realises that you are in fact dependable, wise and 'in the right',' she said. Some parents 'even start to believe all that their distressed children say' and anxious mothers and fathers may then 'turn on' teachers instead of calling on them for help or support. Schools should consider offering 'structured and reassuring courses' on what parents should expect at each stage of their child's development. 'Can we supplement the routine formula of parents' evenings which have the aura of speed dating – without the excitement – with something more informal that facilitates dialogue between parents who may often feel isolated in making big decisions or holding the unpopular line?' Mrs Phillips said parents faced further worries over university fees and homes and jobs for their children. 'Is it any surprise that parents who are anxious to support their children feel they are not as empowered as once they were?'","Alice Phillips said social media had made parenting harder than ever .

"A 21-year-old student who was shot three times by a paranoid attorney at Florida State University last week has been left paralyzed from the waist down, his sister has revealed. Farhan 'Ronny' Ahmed was one of three victims who were wounded by gunman Myron May, 31, a FSU graduate and an attorney, in the Tallahassee-based campus's Strozier Library last Thursday. He was struck by three bullets, one of which severely damaged his spine, leaving the lower half of his body paralyzed, Farhana Ahmed told reporters at a news conference on Monday. 'Ronny was studying for his finals when he was shot three times,' she said. 'He immediately knew something was wrong because one of the first bullets struck his spine. Scroll down for video .

Above, a police officer  in Strozier Library, where Mr Ahmed was shot . 'It's left him paralyzed from the waist down. But despite his injuries, he's alive and we're so grateful that he's here with us.' Mr Ahmed, who was studying for his finals in biomedical engineering, was rushed to Tallahassee Memorial HealthCare with critical injuries following the shooting shortly before 12.30pm. But during the conference, Miss Ahmed, whose family is from Orlando, said: 'His condition has been updated from critical to serious, which we're really thankful for. She added that the entire community has supported her brother 'through this really hard time', with many locals having donated teddy bears and sent letters of encouragement.

And she praised police for their 'quick thinking' within minutes of the incident, saying: 'I know the first people on the scene were the police,' according to WCTV. 'If not for their quick response, probably a lot more students would have gotten hurt. Ronny himself was probably saved by the quickness of their actions,' she added.

He was treated and released at the scene, according to CBS Miami. In the seconds leading up to the shooting, May reloaded at least once and tried to enter the library, where at least 400 students were studying for midterm exams. However, he was blocked by lobby security barriers that permit only students and staff inside. When police arrived at the scene, officers fired off a barrage of bullets that killed him. FSU officials noted the security barriers were put in place in late 2008 - or after May had already left the school.

The student's friends have already started raising money on a YouCaring page to help fund his medical expenses. They have so far raised more than $63,000. Classes resumed a day after the shooting and the library reopened. But it could be weeks before the investigation is wrapped up, according to WSB-TV. Police are likely to question witnesses again, and a grand jury will review the actions of campus police and Tallahassee police, who killed May. Hospital: Mr Ahmed has been upgraded from critical to serious at Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare (above) Videos and a journal obtained by police indicate May, who went on to graduate from law school at Texas Tech, thought he was being watched and targeted by the government. He also complained to police and property managers in New Mexico that cameras were watching him in his apartment, it is said.

"A quarter of Britons would fall out with their friends if they discovered they were Ukip supporters, a poll has revealed. Despite a surge in support Ukip remains by the far the most toxic of the all the main political parties. Three times as many people said they would ‘find it harder to stay close with a good friend’ if they voted Ukip than if they supported the Tories. Scroll down for video . Just under one in four voters would fall out with their friends if they revealed that they were Ukip supporters . Just one in 14 Britons said they would struggle to stay friends with a Conservative supporter – compared to one in four who admitted they would not be able to remain close to a Ukip voter. Labour is the least ‘toxic’ of all the main Westminster parties – with just three per cent of the public admitting that they would stop being friends with someone who backed Ed Miliband. Five per cent of voters would stop being friends with Lib Dem supporters, according to YouGov. Pollsters asked 1,970 adults 'if a good friend became a supporter’ of Ukip would you ‘disagree AND find it harder to be friends with them'. Labour and Lib Dem supporters are the most prejudiced – with four in 10 of Mr Miliband’s backers admitting that they would fall out with their friends for backing Ukip. Some 42 per cent of Lib Dem supporters would ‘find it harder’ to be friends with anyone who backed Mr Farage. Ukip also provokes stronger feelings among youngsters, with more than a third of 18-24 olds admitting that they would fall out with a friend for voting for the Eurosceptic party. Just 16 per cent of over 60s, meanwhile, admitted that they would struggle to remain close to a Ukip backer. Supporting Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and David Cameron is less likely to end friendships than supporting Nigel Farage . Respondents were allowed to say whether they would ‘agree’ or ‘disagree’ with their friend, but also whether it would affect their friendship either positively or negatively. While most Labour voters would ‘disagree’ with their friend if they began supporting the Conservatives, only 14 per cent would find it harder to stay friends. Overall, only 3 per cent of voters would find it difficult to be friends with a Labour supporter, 3 per cent would find it difficult with a Green supporter, 5 per cent for a Lib Dem and 7 per cent for a Conservative.","Ukip remains by the far the most toxic of the all the main political parties .

"The husband of Melbourne's Jill Meagher, who was raped and murdered two years ago, is urging his Facebook followers to stop 'pick-up artist' Julian Blanc obtaining an Irish visa. Tom Meagher took to social media and asked people to sign a change.org petition to stop Ireland from being a 'haven' for Mr Blanc. 'Mr Blanc promotes sexual assault, and harassment as part of his shtick as a ""pick-up artist"",' Mr Meagher posted along with the petition's link. Scroll down for video . Tom Meagher (left), husband of Jill Meagher (right), has called on Facebook followers to sign a petition to bar 'pick-up artist' Julien Blanc from entering Ireland . 'He has had to leave Australia due to a campaign forcing him out and has recently been denied visas in Canada and the U.K..' Mr Meagher's wife, Jill, was raped and murdered in 2012 while walking home less than 500 metres from a bar in Brunswick, in Melbourne's inner city. Her disappearance sparked a widespread social media campaign to find her and her killer. Mr Blanc has caused controversy over his pick-up techniques which include choking women and then shushing them . Mr Meagher's appeal comes after Victoria's police commissioner Ken Lay condemned Mr Blanc in an address on family violence at state parliament. Mr Lay likened Mr Blanc's pick-up techniques, which include choking women and then shushing them, to family violence, SBS reported. 'Blanc’s strategies for attracting women are eerily similar to diagnostic charts for family violence,' he said. 'The attitude of some men is that women are property. So now, let me address those particular men. If you think manipulating women is clever, you’re wrong. And if you think shoving a woman’s face into your crotch is power, you are wrong.' Jill Meagher was raped and murdered in 2012 in Melbourne inner-city suburb of Brunswick . Mr Lay also had a message for Mr Blanc's followers, saying both the 'pick-up artist' and they were 'sexually insecure'. He took aim at The Game - a novel written by Neil Strauss - which documents the author's time learning about picking up women with a secret society of people led by a man only known as 'Mystery'. He said the popular book was written by a 'self-conscious fool'. Mr Blanc arrived in Australia last month to hold seminars to teach men how to pick up women, but was met with great opposition, eventually having his visa cancelled by the federal government. He got similar receptions in the U.K. and Canada, with people protesting against their respective governments letting the American into their countries.","Tom Meagher asked people to sign petition to stop Julien Blanc entering Ireland .

"Libyan soldiers involved in a British Army training programme beset by allegations of rape, drunkenness and fighting  have claimed asylum, the Government admitted today. Hundreds of Libyan cadets were invited to the UK to strengthen the country's besieged security forces, as western leaders scrambled to control the growing anarchy sweeping the north African state. But the programme was closed down earlier this month after the Libyan soldiers were ordered home in disgrace after a 'totally unacceptable' breakdown of discipline. Scroll down for video . On their way home: 300 Libyan troops training at  Bassingbourn Barracks in Cambridgeshire (pictured) have been sent back early following alleged sex attacks . Five cadets were placed in police custody facing sex charges after a series of violations described as 'beyond the pale' by the head of the Army General Sir Nicholas Carter. Now Deference Secretary Michael Fallon has admitted that a number of the cadets have refused to go home and have instead claimed asylum. He told MPs a 'very small handful' of Libyan soldiers involved in the training programme had asked to stay. Mr Fallon told the Commons that of the 328 total originally signed up to the scheme, around 100 left during the course of their training by agreement with the Libyan authorities. The remainder had now all been returned 'properly' to Libya, he added, apart from five who remain in custody and a 'very small handful' who have claimed asylum. He was replying to a question from shadow defence minister Kevan Jones who asked how many of the service personnel still remained on UK soil. Earlier this month, David Cameron insisted no Libyan soldiers involved in the programme should be granted asylum. The Prime Minister labelled the disciplinary issues at Bassingbourn Barracks  as 'completely unacceptable'. David Cameron hit out at the 'completely unacceptable' breakdown of discipline among Libyan soldiers in Cambridgeshire . General Sir Nicholas Carter told MPs the behaviour of the Libyan cadets was 'beyond the pale' Up to 2,000 soldiers had been due to undergo basic infantry and junior command training at the barracks as part of an agreement reached at last year's G8 summit. The training agreement was part of a pledge to support Libya's effort to improve security following the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi in 2011. Since then the country has been in a state of flux with two rival governments, disparate tribes and Islamist militia embroiled in conflict. Head of the army General Sir Nicholas Carter admitted the behaviour of Libyan soldiers who went on the rampage outside their barracks  was 'beyond the pale'. His remarks came after the Prime Minister demanded military top brass explain the 'unacceptable' breakdown of discipline  which saw hundreds of Libyan cadets sent home in disgrace amid allegations of rape, drunkenness, fighting and theft. Mr Cameron said the the Government programme to train up Libya's army would be scrapped and all the trainees based in Britain deported. Two thousand Libyan cadets – hand-picked by the British Army – were supposed to be given leadership skills in the UK to help their war-torn country. But the scheme has been beset by difficulties from the start - with trainees allowed to run amok outside their barracks in Cambridgeshire. Since the training course began in June, Libyan cadets hunted down and sexually assaulted three women in one night - while another two  trainees have been charged with raping a man in a park. General discipline collapsed, with one in ten refusing to obey orders - with one UK trainer reportedly headbutted and another apparently threatened by a Libyan mob.","300 Libyan soldiers based in thee UK are to be sent home a month early .

"Mindfulness is a mental state that can be achieved by focusing on an awareness on the present moment, while calmly acknowledging and accepting one's feelings. The practice was  reserved only for 'hippy' and 'bohemian' types, but thanks to stars like Miranda Kerr and Daisy Lowe, it has become synonymous with success, fortune and, quite frankly, all things cool. Many credit the simple form of meditation with helping them to manage daily life and even land a job - but can it help you lose weight? Well, two women certainly think so - and they've even created a diet based around the Buddhist practice. Scroll down for video . Making meditation mainstream: Miranda Kerr, left, and Arianna Huffington are both fans of mindfulness - and a new book even credits the practice with helping you lose weight . Patrizia Collard, a psychotherapist, mindfulness teacher and stress management consultant has teamed up with Helen Stephenson, a mindfulness-based cognitive therapist, to create The Mindfulness Diet. The duo claim their new book teaches readers how to tune into their bodies and eat the foods they really need to achieve their ideal weight. The book blurb reads: 'Mindfulness is the new attitude to living. 'Taking an attitude of mindful awareness to eating will not only help you appreciate every mouthful, but reward you with a whole new way to eat that banishes any former food issues. 'There is no dieting, calorie-counting or fasting, by simply changing your approach to feeding yourself, you can tune in to your body wisdom and begin to eat less of what you don’t need, while filling up on nourishing foods that help you reach the weight you’ll be happy with for life.' Chapters include myths and risks of extreme diets, tips on how to recognise your eating habits and understand your real food needs, plus mindfulness meditations, 70 recipes and mindful eating plans. Promoting: Patrizia Collard, a psychotherapist, mindfulness teacher and stress management consultant has teamed up with Helen Stephenson, a mindfulness-based cognitive therapist, to create The Mindfulness Diet, right . Patrizia said: 'By not being mindful with our ""true hunger"", we tend to eat more, when having less could be what is needed. 'By becoming mindful we develop understanding, and in this process we become more forgiving and kinder to ourselves.' They promise their approach will help readers 'release themselves from the grip of shame and anger' and 'replace it with understanding'. They claim mindfulness helps people accept the fact that they cannot change the basic frame of their body but can still find their ideal weight and have a healthy appreciation of their body. Be mindful: All too often we just grab a sandwich in front of our computer for lunch or eat in front of the TV at night. Sometimes we don't even notice what we have eaten, say nutritionists . It can also apparently helps you learn what an ideal portion size is. The pair instruct readers to carry out basic meditation practices like the body scan, which involves closing your eyes and focusing on different areas of the body to engage in a friendly relationship with our physique. Other practises include analysing your food when preparing, cooking and eating it. The book advises users to pay special attention to the ingredients' colour, smell and texture, which heightens the eating experience. Recipes in the £7.99 book include layered nutty bars and home baked beans for breakfast, roasted peppers with quinoa or falafel pitta pockets for lunch and salmon and bulgar wheat pilaf for dinner. As well as writing the book, which goes on sale in January, Patrizia and Helen are developing mindful eating weekend courses that will run in the UK. So how did mindfulness become so hip and the relaxation method of choice for countless celebrities? Miranda Kerr is undoubtedly the postergirl for positive living - she has even penned two self-help books, Treasure Yourself and Empower Yourself, packed with uplifting affirmations, while Daisy Lowe says the practice helps her get through the day. And it's not just supermodels and fashionistas at it. Arianna Huffington, who established the hugely successful Huffington Post, credits daily mindfulness and meditation for changing her life. Ministers are even considering introducing lessons in mindfulness. Schools Minister David Laws said evidence suggested the sessions could help boost pupils’ attitudes and motivation. But can it be applied to weight loss? Shona Wilkinson, Head Nutritionist at NutriCentre.com, said: 'The mindfulness diet is all about being aware of what you are eating. I love the approach but I think to call it a diet is incorrect. 'Being mindful of what you eat is a great practice to follow. All too often we just grab a sandwich in front of our computer for lunch or eat in front of the TV at night. Sometimes we don’t even notice what we have eaten.' Inspired by ancient Buddhist meditation, mindfulness courses were developed in the late 1970s by US doctors to combat stress. The therapies aim to help people live more ‘in the moment’ and spend less time going over past stresses and worrying about future problems. Techniques include moving the focus of attention around the body and observing sensations that arise – the so-called ‘body scan’. Others involve concentrating on breathing or completing yoga-style movements and observing sensations in moments of movement and stillness. Mindfulness is said to help people recognise and overcome negative thoughts while noticing small pleasures around them. Although some regard it with scepticism, studies appear to show a clinical benefit for treating a range of mental health problems. Thousands of mindfulness sessions are prescribed to NHS patients every year to help treat anxiety and depression. Celebrity adherents of the now secular practice include Hollywood actresses Goldie Hawn and Meg Ryan. She continued: 'Before you even eat, take time to think about whether you are actually hungry or not. 'Quite often you aren’t hungry but just eating because the food is there. 'When you think about why you are eating, you may find out that there are emotional or physical triggers rather than just pure hunger. 'When you do eat, savour every mouthful and take time to eat. Notice the colours and flavours. Give yourself time to really enjoy your food. This will make you aware of what you are eating and also make you eat a bit slower which will help your digestive system cope. 'Eating slowly also gives your body time to release a hormone called cholecystokinin (CCK). 'This hormone tells the brain that you are full. It takes time to be released though (usually around 20 minutes) so eating slowly gives the body time to release this hormone therefore resulting you in finishing eating when you are full – not when your plate is empty. 'Time yourself eating your lunch - I bet it doesn’t take 20 minutes! 'Overall, this is a practice we would encourage but wouldn’t call it a diet.'","Miranda Kerr, Daisy Lowe and Arianna Huffington swear by 'mindfulness'

"The Big Apple offers some of the best bargains for Britons looking to save on their Christmas shopping, according to a survey. And those looking for trips to festive markets in Europe should head for Prague, another poll suggests. Both surveys are from Post Office Travel Money which found that top fashion items can be as much as 73 per cent cheaper in New York than in London. Best bargains: Shoppers in New York this Christmas will find presents are up to 73% cheaper . Price comparison: How London prices fare against New York . Hollister men's designer jeans, for example, cost £59 in London but can be as little as £16 in New York. While there is a 62 per cent saving on New York True Religion super skinny jeans (£107) compared with a pair purchased in London (£280). Items such as skin creams, shirts, hoodies, cardigans, dolls and bras are also far less pricey in New York than in London. The guide also sounds a word of caution. While fashion items are invariably cheaper in New York, prices for perfumes are generally higher. Brits will find their cash goes further when buying Christmas gifts in New York rather than London (pictured) The new My Burberry Eau de Parfum (50ml) costs two per cent more in New York than in London (over £66 compared with £65). However, researchers did find that Marc Jacobs new Daisy Dream Eau de Toilette (100ml) costs 24 per cent less in New York (£53) than in London (£70). Post Office Travel Money also looked at the costs involved in a two-night trip to 10 European Christmas market destinations. Festive spirit: How prices compare for a festive break in 10 Christmas market towns in Europe . 1. Budapest, Hungary: 28 November-31 December, Vörösmarty Square . 2.

Tallinn, Estonia: 22 November-8 January, Town Hall Square . 9. Berlin, Germany: 24 November-31 December, Gendarmenmarkt . 10. Stockholm, Sweden: 22 November–23 December, Old Town . Costs included in-resort expenditure such as meals and drinks. Prague proved the least expensive, with the total costs coming to £531. The most expensive of the 10 destinations surveyed was Brussels with costs of £810. Other market towns analysed include: Budapest, Riga, LIlle, Brussels, Prague, Vienna, Copenhagen, Tallinn, Berlin, Stockholm. Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'There are great savings to be made in New York provided that shoppers have done their homework in advance and don’t assume that everything will be cheaper. 'Although most items are cheaper, the savings vary and we did find examples of popular Christmas gifts that were more expensive in New York - so it will pay to check carefully before splashing the cash to avoid costly mistakes. 'Sterling has risen quite significantly in value against European currencies this year, which means that city break holidaymakers will have more cash to spend. 'However, it is still important for them to check prices and factor in all the costs they will incur on a Christmas Markets trip. 'Holiday homework will show that short breaks to eastern European cities like Prague and Riga are hard to beat for value.'","Survey reveals items can be 73% cheaper in the US compared to London .

But the deal itself will not give the Dublin-based airline an advantage over its chief rival, easyJet, which has been offering hotel reservations through Booking.com since 2012. Ryanair's Kenny Jacobs and Booking.com's Nick Monaghan launch the partnership at London's Rubens Hotel . Holidaymakers now have the option to book accommodation through Booking.com on Ryanair's website . Kenny Jacobs, the chief marketing officer tasked with overseeing Ryanair’s image makeover, admitted Booking.com’s partnerships with Ryanair and easyJet are ‘very similar’. But he insists Ryanair has an edge because it has a larger flight network than its low-cost rival. He told MailOnline Travel: ‘What sets us apart is that we have more destinations. It will be the choice of places you can use Booking.com once you’ve gotten there on Ryanair.’ EasyJet has already partnered with Booking.com, but Mr Jacobs says Ryanair has an edge over its rival . Mr Jacobs added: ‘We’ve got ambitions to be more than just an airline. One of those things is giving our customers a better accommodation option because they have asked us for that and I think Booking.com is the best one that we could get.’ Booking.com has partnerships with more than 80 airlines around the world, including three in the UK. Ryanair’s deal with the Amsterdam-based company, considered the largest hotel booking website in the world, is its latest effort to win over customers as part of its ‘Always Getting Better’ programme. The controversial airline launched the charm offensive to revamp its image – and boost revenue – after years of complaints about its surcharges and poor customer service. Ryanair passengers who are waiting for in-flight wifi will 'probably' have to wait until after 2015 . Ryanair claims the partnership with Booking.com will offer customers the ‘best price guaranteed’ with over 550,000 hotels and accommodation to choose from. Now in its second year, the ‘Always Getting Better’ programme has seen the launch of a redesigned website, an app with mobile boarding passes, business seating and a softened stance on baggage charges and booking conditions. Mr Jacobs said the programme will continue to focus on all things ‘digital and data’ in the coming year, although passengers who want in-flight wifi will ‘probably’ have to wait until after 2015.","Deal allows Ryanair customer to book hotel rooms through Booking.com .

"Tragedy: Martin Ball, 28, died in his sleep after he took morphine-based drug OxyNorm from a friend's medicine cabinet to treat his back pain . A father-of-one suffering from chronic back pain  poisoned himself by overdosing on a terminally-ill man's super-strength painkillers after an all-night drinking session. Martin Ball, 28, died in his sleep after he took morphine-based drug OxyNorm from a friend's medicine cabinet and began swigging from the bottle, an inquest heard. The plasterer, whose heartbroken partner described him as the 'life and soul' of the party, drank  pints of cider, assorted spirits and Jagerbombs before going back to a friend's house after a night out. He complained about his back pain and went to a medicine cabinet where he drank a significant quantity of a bottle of 'end of life' drug OxyNorm - prescribed to his friend's late grandfather. Not knowing how dangerous it was when mixed with alcohol, Mr Ball, known to friends as 'Marve', fell asleep on the sofa and never woke up. Friends were unconcerned because he was snoring initially, but when they tried to wake him later that morning he was unresponsive. An ambulance was called and he was rushed Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester where he was pronounced dead. The 250ml bottle of OxyNorm - a Class A drug derived from morphine - had been used in November 2011 to treat the grandfather of Mr Ball's friend Terri Blanchard in the last months of his life as he received round-the-clock care from the family. Miss Blanchard told the Bolton inquest: 'At one point in the evening I saw that he had a bottle of medicine in his hand. It was something that was my grandad's. 'I went to bed and Martin was on the couch snoring loudly and I left him there because I thought he was asleep. Before he lay down he was still drinking and being merry. I was woken by shouting downstairs and went down to find him in an unresponsive state. 'I just remember the medicine bottle being on the side and I grabbed it and gave it to the paramedics. There wasn't much in it. I didn't think keeping the medicine would cause any harm to anybody. I just left it there and never thought to move it.' Popular: Heartbroken said Mr Ball, usually the 'life and soul' of the party, took a fatal dose of painkillers after he drank pints of cider, assorted spirits and some Jagerbombs . Emergency: Paramedics rushed him to the Royal Bolton Hospital but he could not be saved . Mr Ball's best friend Christopher Young said: 'He had been complaining about backache. He had been talking about it a lot that night. He hadn't really mentioned any pain before that. 'I saw him with the bottle. I didn't know where he got it from. I saw him drink it. I don't know how much I had. Marve seemed alright. He didn't complain about anything. We stayed at the house until about 6am then decided that everybody would get taxis home. I had fallen asleep. 'I tried to wake him up but he wouldn't. Then I noticed he had turned blue so I tried to resuscitate him. Before he went to sleep he was alright. I tried to do CPR and then the ambulance came. Four people had a drink of that medicine. I should have said to the police but I was upset and I apologise for not saying that.' Shock: Friends said he had been drinking and having fun despite his back pain but fell asleep and never woke up . Initially, Miss Blanchard was treated as a suspect and interviewed under caution because of OxyNorm's categorisation as a Class A drug. Pathologist Dr Emil Salmo concluded that Mr Hall died from oxycodone toxicity exacerbated by a high level of alcohol. He was found with 0.31mg of the drug in a litre of blood, with the therapeutic level usually registering at 0.03mg and the range associated with fatalities from 0.1mg. He was also almost three times the legal drink-drive limit, with 214 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood. The legal limit is 80mg. Recording a conclusion of death by misadventure, coroner Rachael Griffin said: 'He was a young man who was very popular and a good, fun character. He also enjoyed spending many times with his young son. 'I have heard that at one point in the evening he had a medicine bottle. I am satisfied that because of his back pain he was feeling unwell and went looking for medication to relieve the pain as he would normally do. 'That bottle was OxyNorm, a form of oxyxcodone, a strong painkiller prescribed to Miss Blanchard's grandfather. I am satisfied he drunk it of his own volition. I believe he took the medicine to ease the pain he was suffering as he had done in the past but sadly he took it without realising the dangers and possibly tragic consequences when taking medication prescribed to others. 'It is tragic and catastrophic what happened that night.' Following the hearing, his mother Moya Ball, 61, a company director, said there should be more accountability with medication with a need for dangerous substances to be recalled. 'If he had known how strong it was he wouldn't have taken it,' she said. 'I think bottles like that need to be recalled by the people responsible. 'Terri would have never kept if she had known. It's not her fault. If you have made a prescription for something you should have a responsibility to bring it back. The pharmacist would know it's a Class A drug and they should keep control. He didn't think for one second he was in jeopardy and taking that medication would put him in jeopardy. That man has been dead for three year, why has nobody gone back and asked where the medication was? 'He had no idea it was lethal. If he hadn't taken it he would still be alive. He would have woken up with a hangover and that would have been it.' His partner, Jodie Jones, said: 'He was bubbly, loud, good fun, lovely to be around and very caring. He was the life and soul.'","Martin Ball, 28, consumed large amount of 'end of life' painkiller OxyNorm .

"Theresa May views Downing Street as ‘incompetent’ and has a ‘vision’ for the future of the Conservative Party, an incendiary report claims today. The Home Secretary, who recently overtook London Mayor Boris Johnson as the activists’ favourite to succeed David Cameron if the Tories lose the General Election, is alleged to have ‘given up’ on his Number Ten operation. In a wide-ranging profile to be published in Spectator Life magazine on Thursday, a friend of Mrs May is quoted saying: ‘There was a time early on when she would want to please David [Cameron], but slowly she has seen just how incompetent that operation is. In a profile to be published in Spectator Life magazine on Thursday (pictured), a friend of Mrs May claims the home secretary has 'slowly' come to see 'just how incompetent' David Cameron's No 10 operation is . ‘How the PM will say he will do one thing, only to be drawn in another direction. She’s given up on him.’ Mrs May, hailed as ‘Britain’s Angela Merkel’ by her allies, would not countenance any sort of leadership challenge to the Prime Minister, and has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to him. However, she is understood to regard Mr Johnson as a ‘faintly ridiculous’ figure and is determined to prevent him becoming leader in the event of the Tories losing the next election. This year she became Britain’s longest-serving home secretary in more than 50 years. Now two of Mrs May’s closest confidants, chief aide Nick Timothy and former spin doctor Fiona Cunningham, have spoken publicly for the first time about what makes the country’s most powerful woman politician tick. Mrs May pictured with BBC presenter Kirsty Young when she appeared on Desert Island Discs on Sunday . Mr Timothy, who said he was speaking as a long-term friend of Mrs May rather than a Home Office official, refused to accept that Mrs May was risk-averse – and hailed her vision for the future of the Conservative Party. ‘Are you kidding? She went out on a limb on Abu Qatada and never relented, despite various setbacks. Read her speeches. They go way beyond being a mere technocrat, they have a vision of what the future should be about and what politics and the party should be about,’ he said. Miss Cunningham, who resigned earlier this year after clashing with the then Education Secretary Michael Gove, also rejected the idea that Mrs May was over-cautious. Mrs May also appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday where she spoke about immigration . ‘I think she is a massive risk-taker – huge,’ she said. ‘When she decided not to extradite [computer hacker] Gary McKinnon, she knew the wrath from the States and by God, you know, the tornado that came out of Washington was immense. Recalling Mrs May’s decision to defy US demands for Mr McKinnon, who suffers from Asperger’s, after years of controversy in 2012, she added: ‘The call came at about quarter to six in the morning. Theresa simply said, “I’m not going to extradite him,” and I leapt out of bed with excitement. Miss Cunningham, now a policy analyst at the Centre for Social Justice think tank, added: ‘In my time as a special adviser, I never heard her criticise David Cameron.’ Mr Timothy rejected criticism from some colleagues that Mrs May is a ‘territorial micromanager’. Liberal Democrat Norman Baker resigned from the Home Office this month, complaining that working with her was like ‘walking through mud’. ‘She wants to know what’s going on and wants to have a handle on things,’ Mr Timothy added. Today Mrs May delivered a speech at the Royal United Services Institute in central London and said Britain faces a bigger threat to its security from terrorism than at any time before or since the September 11 attacks . Katie Perrior, of PR agency iNHouse Communications, who was Mrs May’s spin doctor in opposition, said the Home Secretary delights in the public fascination in her fashionable clothes and shoes. Miss Perrior said: ‘She wears the clothes to show she is not the person you think she is. Her dress sense shows that risk-taking side. They are hidden signals. Her two fingers, a bit of control she has over her life.’ A Home Office spokesman said of Mrs May’s alleged view of Downing Street: ‘This quote from an unnamed source bears absolutely no relation to the Home Secretary’s view.’","Wide-ranging profile on home secretary will be published on Thursday .

"A University dropout who got a grade D in his GCSE English exam has become only the second Briton to win the world Scrabble championship. Craig Beevers, who said he has barely ever read a book, won the title with the word 'talaq', a Muslim form of divorce. The word netted him 42 points and gave him an unassailable lead in his final game at the ExCeL Centre in London. Craig Beevers (right) beat American Chris Lipe to become the second Briton to win the world Scrabble championship . Mr Beevers, 33, from Guisborough, near Middlesbrough, is the first Briton to win the world title since 1993. He competed against 100 players from 25 nations over five days to win the title and £3,000 in prize money. The former Sheffield University mathematics undergraduate, who has been playing Scrabble since he was six, said: 'I am absolutely thrilled to have won – it was a closely fought championship.' Other words he used included 'ventrous', meaning adventurous, scoring 65; 'gleet', meaning inflammation of the urethra, scoring 24; and 'diorite', meaning igneous rock, scoring 69. Mr Beevers, who has committed up to 100,000 words to memory, had previously said: 'Finding words is a very mathematical skill. Most scrabble players don't learn what the words actually mean. 'They try to learn whether it's a verb or a noun - whether it can take an S or a D. I feel like I've only really scratched the surface of what I'm capable of.'

"Suicide? Gregory McFadden, 61, bought a helicopter tour for two but showed up alone . The California man has jumped out of a helicopter and plummeted 500 feet to his death had a chronic health problem that prevented him from sleeping and he couldn't get the surgery to fix it, his brother has revealed. Gregory McFadden, 61, landed in the water a few feet off upscale Newport Beach in Orange County, California, in broad daylight Tuesday afternoon. He was pulled from the surf by lifeguards, who performed CPR on him on the crowded beach. However, he was unconscious and died after being taken to the hospital. His brother Bradley McFadden told the San Gabriel Valley Tribune that his brother suffered for years from a medical condition for which he couldn't get treatment. 'He said he was choking so bad, he couldn’t sleep... It was very painful. He was losing sleep. And he couldn’t get an operation,' Mr McFadden said. The condition was a problem with a valve that resulted in a form of acid reflux that caused food to continually come back up as it was digesting. McFadden, who was on Social Security and disability, had been trying for years to get an operation to fix the valve, but the procure was continually delayed or canceled. Mr McFadden believes his brother likely lost hope and decided to take his own life. Scene: 61-year-old Gregory McFadden jumped from a helicopter near the end of Balboa Pier, here at Newport Beach, California . The pilot of the helicopter said McFadden, the only passenger aboard the aircraft, suddenly opened the door and jumped out. The . chopper was operated by Cardinal Air Services, which offers aerial . tours of Orange County. It is owned by Chuck Street, a longtime pilot . and on-air traffic reporter. Mr Street said his son Corbin was flying the helicopter at the time and struggled with McFadden before he plunged to his death. 'It’s the last thing I ever thought would happen to my son,' Mr Street told the Los Angeles Times. Mr Street revealed the McFadden, from West Covina, paid $310 to reserve an afternoon helicopter beach tour for two. But, when he showed up at the airport Tuesday, he was by himself. McFadden splashed down near Balboa Pier and a busboy at a restaurant at the end of the pier watched him fall from the white Robinson R44 craft, according to Ruby's Diner general manager David Saighani. Suicide? Authorities are investigating what seems likely to be a suicide. The man was pulled from the chilly Pacific and given CPR. He died from his critical injuries after he was taken to the hospital . Police in Huntington Beach were apparently the first to be alerted of the fall, which was reported by the private helicopter company according to a police release. 'The only passenger on board opened the door and jumped out into the water,' FAA spokesman Ian Gregor told KTLA. Huntington Beach authorities worked together with Newport Beach lifeguards and Orange County sheriffs to find the man and pull him ashore. 'Lifeguards brought the man to shore and initiated lifesaving efforts,' police spokesperson Jennifer Manzella said. McFadden was taken to the hospital in critical condition. 'There’s probably more to it than what it seems to be,' said Sergeant Mike Robertson, of the Orange County Sheriff's Department.","Gregory McFadden, 61, jumped from a private helicopter above the Newport Beach shoreline around 1pm Tuesday .

"Nathan Hageman (above), who became a millionaire after winning the ITV show in 2011, was jailed after sending his victim 400 messages within 48 hours . A man who became the first person to win £1million on TV quiz show Red or Black has been jailed after bombarding a woman with more than 400 threatening text messages within just 48 hours. Nathan Hageman, who became a millionaire in 2011 after winning the ITV show - which was fronted by Ant and Dec - was jailed after sending his victim abusive messages at the rate of one text every seven minutes. The 34-year-old was jailed at Reading Magistrates' Court for four months after the woman, who is in her 30s, contacted police to report the harassment. It is not the first time the former bricklayer has been hauled before the courts, as he had previously been jailed for attacking his former girlfriend. In 2006, just five years prior to winning the show, Hageman was jailed for five years for attacking ex-partner Amy Edwards. At the time, a spokesman for Reading Crown Court said: 'On November 7, 2006, Nathan Hageman pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated burglary and one count of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 'On December 8, 2006, he received a sentence of five years imprisonment for aggravated burglary and two years' imprisonment for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm to run concurrently. 'The victim of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm named in the indictment was Amy Edwards.' Officers swooped on Hageman last week, just 48 hours after he flew into a rage and launched his cruel campaign of text message abuse. He was jailed on Thursday after admitting harassment and will serve at least two months behind bars before being eligible for parole. The 34-year-old became the first person to win £1million on ITV quiz show Red or Black in 2011 (pictured) Hageman was sentenced to four months in prison when he appeared at Reading Magistrates' Court (above) Eight million people watched Hageman, who served two-and-a-half years of his five-year sentence for the attack on Ms Edwards, become the first winner of Simon Cowell's game show by correctly predicting red on the spin of a giant roulette wheel. Shortly after his win he revealed how he had already blown £65,000 of his fortune on cars including a supercharged Range Rover and a BMW, a 10-day all-inclusive holiday in Cuba and an Armani watch. Having been the first contestant to win the £1m prize, Hageman's spending included: . However, in the wake of his win, his former fiancée Jane Makepeace revealed how he threw her out of his penthouse, handing her just £60 for her cab fare. At the time, she said: 'I thought the money would make Nathan a better person because he wouldn't have to struggle to get by, but it has just made him worse than ever.' ITV's Red or Black was the brainchild of Simon Cowell and was hosted by popular duo Ant and Dec. Participants had to choose red or black on the spin of a roulette wheel, with those who chose incorrectly being eliminated from the show. It was the most expensive game show in television history, with a £15 million budget, and aired for a year between September 2011 and 2012 before being axed.","Nathan Hageman sent 400 abusive text messages within 48 hours to victim .

"Bitter: Michaela Brookes was one of around 100 people who were sent an abusive rejection email by Owston Park Lodge . Applicants for work at a pub in Yorkshire would have been forgiven for thinking the owners had been drinking a bit too much of their own stock after they were sent rude rejection emails telling them 'you're no good'. The message was sent out to more than 100 people who applied for jobs in the restaurant at Owston Park Lodge in Doncaster. It read: ‘Unfortunately, you are not good enough for the position at this time, try harder next time. ‘I am sorry for the disappointing news. But what did you expect, your (sic) no good.’ Among those to receive the email was job-seeker Michaela Brookes, who woke to find the message on her phone. The . 23-year-old said: ‘I was absolutely gobsmacked. I have had knock-backs . for jobs before, but I couldn't believe what I was reading. It seemed so . cruel - I couldn't believe someone could say something like that.’ Another . angry applicant, Danielle Jarvis, said that when she received the email . she thought it was extremely rude and unprofessional. She . said: ‘I am not the only person to have this email sent to me. I have . seen on the Owston Park Lodge Facebook page several other people . complaining about this.' However, the owners of the pub were 'horrified' by the emails. Paul and Tracy Snow believe their computer system was hacked. Mrs Snow, who runs Owston Park Lodge in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, with her husband, said: ‘We want to put people's minds at rest that this appears to be a malicious prank and we are deeply sorry for any offence the emails may have caused. ‘The police are investigating as we think our system has been hacked and these messages sent out. It has been upsetting and stressful for everyone involved.’ The problem first came to light on Monday, when angry applicants began calling the pub and demanding answers about the emails. Horrified: Paul and Tracy Snow claim that their computer system was hacked and have apologised for the abusive rejection email . Mrs Snow said: ‘It was the first I knew of it. The calls were coming through in a torrent and people were very upset.’ The pub has since posted an apology on its website and the owners are trying to track down anyone who may have received the email, which was signed off with the couple's full names. The couple contacted South Yorkshire Police who have confirmed an investigation had been launched.","Over 100 jobseekers received the message, sent by a pub in Doncaster .

"A rare collection of cartoons which attempted to boost the morale of troops in the First World War have emerged for sale 100 years after the fighting broke out. The humorous sketches sympathised with low-ranking soldiers while teasing the British high command, and became a hit with soldiers on the front line as well as those back home. They were the handiwork of Bruce Bairnsfather, a soldier who had been hospitalised during the Second Battle of Ypres in Belgium in 1915. Morale: A rare collection of cartoons to boost the morale of First World War troops have emerged for sale. They send up the shock many soldiers received at the rise of mechanised warfare, with a sword reduced to a toasting fork (left) and a grenade-juggling soldier who causes 'considerable anxiety to his platoon' (right) Popular: The cartoons had a heavy influence on public life. They dealt with queries about raspberry jam (left) and made light of the dreadful conditions in the trenches . While recovering from shellshock and hearing loss at the headquarters of the 34th Division on Salisbury Plain, he invented a curmudgeonly British private called Old Bill, who sported a trademark walrus moustache and balaclava. Mr Bairnsfather expanded on the character and soon his light-hearted cartoons rose to prominence after they were published in The Bystander magazine. The cartoonist went on to produce several special editions including Bullets and Billets and Fragments from France, which typically featured Old Bill in a host of less-than-ideal situations. In one, called The New Submarine Danger, he and another soldier are stood in the trenches with water up to their chests when Old Bill's colleague says: 'They’ll be torpedoin’ us if we stick ‘ere much longer, Bill.' Another sketch from 1918 shows Old Bill sitting on the Kaiser’s throne. The caption simply reads: 'Ullo!' After the war Mr Bairnsfather . continued drawing Old Bill, who has been cited as one of more than a . dozen possible origins of the nickname for police. One of Mr Bairnsfather's favourite characters was Old Bill, pictured exhausted and sitting on the Kaiser's throne (left). The cartoons poked gentle fun at soldiers having to improvise, with one dressing as a tree (right). Mr Bairnsfather created his characters while recovering from shellshock sustained in the Second Battle of Ypres . Humour: One cartoon reworked the phrase 'this bloody war' and used it to describe conditions on the front line, where soldiers remained through freezing, soggy winters . Grim: The cartoons tapped into a well of humour that was sometimes incredibly dark, with soldiers facing the constant threat of death from above or below . In the Second World War he was the official cartoonist of the American forces in Europe, creating sketches from his home in Shropshire, and he continued drawing until his death from bladder cancer in 1959. Now a rare, limited first edition of Bullets and Billets signed by Bairnsfather is tipped to fetch £400, with the complete Fragments from France set expected to sell for £150, during an auction next Wednesday in Blandford, Dorset. The are being sold by a collector of First World War memorabilia from Dorset. Patrick Bogue, from auctioneers Onslows, said: 'Humour was an incredibly important part of the First World War. In the army it was generally aimed at generals and high ranking officers and helped boost morale. 'Cartoons began appearing in The Bystander magazine by Bruce Bairnsfather, who had been hospitalised with shell shock in 1915. 'Bairnsfather had been posted to a . division headquarters on Salisbury Plain where he started drawing funny . cartoons about life in the trenches for The Bystander. Huge moustache: Facial hair was the height of fashion (and compulsory for officers) during the First World War, but clearly it prompted sniggering from some quarters . Rare: The cartoons were collected into several special editions during the war called Fragments from France, which proved a hit with those at home and abroad . Death is but a moment away: The cartoons were created by Bruce Bairnsfather (left), who knew first-hand the horrors of battle after fighting in Belgium in 1915 . 'His cartoons revolved around the character of Old Bill, a typical squaddie with a pipe and a walrus moustache. They were incredibly popular with soldiers who would eagerly await the next volume. 'They were so successful in cheering up troops that Bairnsfather was appointed by the War Office to draw similar cartoons for other forces. 'These original cartoons are very rare indeed.'","Sketches were by Bruce Bairnsfather, a soldier who was hospitalised in Second Battle of Ypres, Belgium, in 1915 .

"Nevada drivers could soon be sharing the road with vehicles that don't need them. The state's Department of Motor Vehicles have announced that they have issued Google with the nation's first licence to test self-driving cars on public streets. The department said, after conducting demonstrations on the Las Vegas Strip and in Carson City, that the car is as safe - or perhaps safer - than a human. For one thing, the engineers programed the car to create a ‘virtual buffer zone’ around obstacles, making it more aware than some drivers about their surroundings. Scroll down for video . All the (road) rage: Nevada's DMV issued Google a licence allowing the world's first driverless car to drive on public streets . Motorised view: This is what a driverless car sees now that Google's Prius is allowed to roam the streets . Nevada DMV Director Bruce Breslow said: 'It gets honked at more often because it's being safe.' Self-driving vehicle technology works like auto-pilot to guide a car - in this case a modified Prius - with little or no intervention from a human operator. Laser radar mounted on the roof and in the grill detects pedestrians, cyclists and other vehicles, creating a virtual buffer zone around the obstacles that the car then avoids. Some readers envision the robotic car dropping off its operator at the front of the mall and hunting for a parking spot on its own, but Mr Breslow said this was not quite the case, as Nevada's regulations require two people in the test cars at all times. One person is behind the wheel, while . the other person monitors a computer screen that shows the car's . planned route and keeps tabs on roadway hazards and traffic lights. If there's a glitch, the human driver can override the autonomous auto with a tap on the brake or a hand on the steering wheel. A user, who is legally blind, sat behind the wheel during a recent test drive and showed off to the passengers that no hands were needed To date, Google's cars have gone about 700,000 miles (1.1 million km) in self-driving mode . Last summer, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval took the car for a spin in and around the state's quiet capital city. But Las Vegas Boulevard, where costumed superheroes routinely take the crosswalks and massive billboards angle for the attention of starry-eyed tourists, was perhaps best suited to test the car's main purpose. 'They're designed to avoid distracted . driving,' Mr Breslow said. 'When you're on the Strip and there's a huge . truck with a three scantily clad women on the side, the car only sees a . box.' So far, Google's . applied to license three test vehicles. Mr Breslow said the cars will . display red plates and an infinity symbol to represent their status as . vehicles of the future. Once they're ready for the market - something Mr Breslow guesses could come in three to five years - the plates will be green. Food run: Steve programmed the car to drive in for a quick bite to eat at a drive-thru .","DMV gives Google first license to test self-driving Prius on public streets .

"A Chinese man has had a new nose grown on his forehead. The man, who has only been named as Xiaolian, had the treatment to create a replacement for his original nose which was infected and deformed. Xiaolian, 22, had a new nose grown on his forehead after his original one was irreparably damaged in a traffic accident. The new nose was sculpted from cartilage taken from his ribs . The procedure was carried out at a hospital in Fuzhou, Fujian province. The 22-year-old damaged his nose in a traffic accident in August 2012 but failed to seek treatment. As a result, an infection corroded the cartilage leaving the surgeons unable to repair it. They were left with no choice but to grow him a new nose and then to transplant it in place of his damaged one. Doctors say that they will soon be able to carry out a transplant operation to replace the damaged nose with the newly grown one . The nose was created by placing a skin tissue expander onto Xiaolian’s forehead. This was cut into the shape of a nose and was supported by cartilage taken from the man’s ribs. Surgeons say that the nose has developed well and that the transplant surgery will be carried out soon.","Xiaolian, 22, damaged his nose in a traffic accident in August 2012 .

The private facebook group, which has since been removed, is composed of grown women around the country who grab photos of toddlers from other mothers' facebook pages without approval and post them online for criticizing. The group was originally designed to trade and sell children's clothing but took a nasty turn. Scroll Down For Video . Ellen Veach's 2-year-old  daughter (right) was cruelly compared to a cartoon character (left) One mother, Melissa Anetucci, of Palm Beach, Fla. has made it her mission to fight against the self-proclaimed 'mean girls group' and to expose their wildly inappropriate behavior. She began posting the mother's comments online in order to exploit their cruel remarks. Anetucci told Wesh.com, 'The things that these mothers said were the most horrific things that I have ever seen, being a mom and knowing that they are moms.' Another mother, Ellen Veach, of Pheonix, Ariz. told Fox News she was terrified to discover that a photo of her 2-year-old daughter was taken from her facebook and pictured next to a cartoon character. Ellen Veach (right) spoke to a Fox correspondent (top left) about the horrific discovery that her child's photo was being circulated online . Veach says she didn't realize that friends of friends could access her photos on facebook. It was a friend who notified her her daughter's photo was circulating online. 'So I'm posting pictures of my son's first day in kindergarten or Ivy's new outfit or something just naively posting it up there so my friends can see, not realizing there's a group that takes these pictures and targets these children and makes fun of them. Like that's just something I wouldn't even think a mother or grown woman would do,' Veach told Fox. One 'mean girl' wrote, 'Before I address this...It...I want to point out that it makes my heart happy that you have a Mean Girls tab in your computer. Good stuff. Now, # 1 is this a he or a she...You absolutely can not fix ugly. This is a God given example of such.' This Facebook comment was one of the many harsh remarks by the grown-up 'Mean Girls' The comments go on and on in the private 'toddler bashing' facebook group which has since been deleted . The comments themselves are 'hideous' and most of the mothers in the group have deleted their facebook pages in shame . Another facebook comment read, 'An ugly baby thread. I have died and gone to heaven...why can't you guys live near me so we can do this over cocktails?' Another commented of a child, 'It's hideous.' The parents of the children who were being bullied commented on the group's page and asked the women to stop their lewd behavior, but they were none too kind. 'It's hideous,' read the harsh comment under this unassuming child's photo . Angry mothers had some 'words' to say against the mean mothers ridiculing photos of other people's children . One overwhelmed mother wrote, 'This is MY DAUGHTER that is being made fun of because she is delayed…so funny, huh? Sick (expletive).'The photo was of her daughter in the intensive care unit. One of the 'Mean Girls' responded, 'THIS IS FACEBOOK, NOT THE SALEM WITCH HUNT....THIS IS A FREE COUNTRY AND I WAS LAUGHING BECAUSE IT WAS FUNNY....THANKS FOR YOUR COMMENTS, NEXT.' Some of the 'Mean Girls' acknowledged that what they were saying was unjust. 'I'm probably going to hell for saying that,' one mother said after criticizing a photo of an innocent and unaware child. 'We think out children are beautiful and miracles and have somebody even though you know it's not true to have somebody say something negative or derogatory about your child.. it hurts,' said Veach. Some of the 'Mean Girls,' many of whom are mothers themselves, defend their behavior by saying that they have a right to free speech. Most of the mothers in the secret facebook group have deleted their accounts. Veach reported the facebook group and facebook told Fox that they adhere to anti-harassment policies. Anetucci says she will not stop going after the 'toddler bashing' ladies group and she makes it her goal to expose their identities. 'We have zero tolerance. You are bullying babies,' she said. 'You're not even bullying your peers. You're bullying babies. No,' said Anetucci. The facebook page has since been deleted, but the damage caused by the bullying still resonates with many .","Melissa Anetucci has made it her mission to expose the identity of the mean mothers in the now deleted facebook group .

"Garry Hancock (pictured with the packet of mushrooms) complained to Walsh Mushrooms after his wife found a cigarette in the packet . A father-of-four was left disgusted after his wife discovered a cigarette inside a packet of mushrooms. Garry Hanock, 36, said his wife Alexandra, 36, had been preparing dinner for their four sons when she spotted the unsmoked cigarette in the packet of mushrooms. When Mr Hancock, from Peasedown St John, near Bath, Somerset, complained to the company who supplied the mushrooms he received a cheque for 92p reimbursing him and an offer of a factory visit. He said: 'Whether the cigarette was put in the mushrooms on purpose by some disgruntled member of staff or whether it was an accident we’ll never know but packets should be checked much more carefully before they end up on the shelves. 'I was shocked with the response of the company who supplied the mushrooms. 'They sent me a cheque for 92p which was how much the mushrooms cost and invited me to visit the factory where the mushrooms are packed. 'I have to say I rang them up and suggested they would be better off inviting someone from the Food Standards Agency to look around instead of me.' Mr Hancock, a printer, bought the packet of British mushrooms from a Co-operative shop in Radstock, Somerset, on January 14. The mushrooms were supplied to the store from Walsh Mushrooms in Evesham, Worcestershire. Brian Cartwright, sales and marketing director, said it was the first such incident in the 35 years the company has been in business. He said: 'The packet was harvested in Northern Ireland at one of our growers. The mushrooms were supplied to the Co-operative store by Walsh Mushrooms in Evesham, Worcestershire . 'We have very strict rules and regulations about taking anything into the work place, let alone cigarettes. 'We have followed that through with the site and the site operator has had all his people together and let them know this has been found and reminded them that people could lose their jobs if they break the rules about bringing items into the work place. 'If anyone was found to have done this they would be prosecuted. 'We are very disappointed that he (Mr Hancock) has turned down our offers.'","Garry Hancock said his wife discovered cigarette in packet of mushrooms .

"Around 2,000 people a year die from skin cancer each year in Australia. Now an enterprising trio of young designers have created an outfit made from 50+ sun protection fabric, aimed at keeping the sun’s harmful rays away from the skin. The students at WA’s Central Institute of Technology were tasked with creating an outfit that ‘incorporates sun protection with youth fashion’ by the Sunsmart team at Cancer Council WA. Fashion students in WA have designed this grey jumpsuit as an outfit that will appeal to young people . Cassandra Pittard, Silvia Dzemail and Lauren Willems stand behind a model in their outfit . ‘Living in Australia means we’re at high risk of developing skin cancer, but you don’t have to compromise fashion to protect yourself,’ Sunsmart said. Cassandra Pittard, Silvia Dzemail and Lauren Willems designed the winning grey jumpsuit. The only bit of skin that it shows are the forearms and lower legs, thanks to three-quarter length sleeves and cropped trousers. The simple design features a breast pocket and stitching around the two pockets on the waist. The grey material, modelled here by Pascale Giorgi, boasts inbuilt sun protection . The design is now on sale in a local store, Ruck Rover General Store in Northbridge, WA . ‘Young people are often fashion and image conscious, and unfortunately this can come at the cost of sun protection,’ SunSmart Campaign Coordinator Carolyn Minto said. ‘The project encourages the designers of tomorrow to show that fashion and sun protection can go hand in hand. ‘Melanoma is the most common cancer in young people, and this project is a way of improving attitudes towards sun protection in this group,’ she said. The only bit of skin that it shows are the forearms and lower legs . Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world . This is the fourth SunSmart fashion garment produced out of the partnership. The design is now on sale in a local store, Ruck Rover General Store in Northbridge, WA. Australia has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the world, with two in three Australians diagnosed with skin cancer by the age of 70. The disease costs the health system around $512.3 million annually, as reported in 2010,  the highest cost of all cancers.","Fashion students at WA's Central Institute of Technology created the outfit .

In the eastern Atlantic, the pieces of a tropical depression are seen starting to gather near the islands of Cape Verde. By the next day, tropical storm Humberto would form. The natural-colour images were acquired by the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) satellite.

Cyclone tracks overlapped the most in the western Pacific and Bay of Bengal. The frequency of track overlaps is much lower in the Western Hemisphere . The resulting image revealed the world’s worst hit areas. The frequency of storm overlaps was shown to be much lower in the Western Hemisphere than in the Eastern Hemisphere. They also produced a second map showing storm intensity. In contrast to the first image of frequency, the Northwestern Atlantic showed a much greater spread of strong storms, whereas in the Pacific the strongest cyclones seem to group near the Philippines.

"Police and security services have thwarted 40 terrorists plots in Britain since the July 7 attacks nine years ago, Theresa May revealed today. The foiled atrocities including 'marauding' 'Mumbai-style' gun attacks streets, an attempt to blow up the London Stock Exchange and airplanes, and murder troops and a British ambassador. Unveiling a raft of new counter-terror measures, the Home Secretary warned the threat to Britain is 'greater than it ever has been' and stressed the terrorists 'only have to be lucky once'. Scroll down for video . Home Secretary Theresa May warned the threat to Britain is 'greater than it ever has been' and stressed the terrorists 'only have to be lucky once' Mrs May said a new bill designed to tighten up protections against terror in the UK  would help to prevent radicalisation . The new Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill - designed to tighten up protections in the UK - will be rushed in the Houses of Commons on Wednesday. Mrs May said it would help to prevent radicalisation, strengthen the TPIMs regime for controlling the movements of terror suspects and give greater powers to 'disrupt and control the movements of people who go abroad to fight'. British companies will be banned from funding ransom payments and it will be made easier to track extremists on the internet. Mrs May stressed the new laws are not a 'knee-jerk response to a sudden perceived threat'. Instead she stressed that since taking office she has been briefed on hundreds of terror suspects 'intent on attacking Britain, the British people and our interests overseas'. The Security Service believe that since the 7/7 attacks in 2005 – in which 52 people were killed by four bombers on London transport - around 40 terrorist plots have been disrupted, she said. Mrs May added: 'There have been attempts to conduct marauding 'Mumbai-style' gun attacks on our streets, blow up the London Stock Exchange, bring down airliners, assassinate a British ambassador and murder serving members of our armed forces. 'Almost all of these attacks have been prevented by the first-class men and women of our security and intelligence services, the police, and our allies overseas. 'But as the IRA once boasted, the terrorists 'only have to be lucky once.' In a speech to RUSI in central London, Mrs May announced the new Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill will be rushed in the Houses of Commons on Wednesday . Key measures announced by Home Secretary Theresa May include: . Last year, Drummer Lee Rigby was murdered in broad daylight by Islamist extremists in London, while Mohammed Saleem, an 82-year old British Muslim from Birmingham, was murdered by a Ukrainian far right extremist who then tried to bomb mosques in Walsall, Wolverhampton and Tipton, Mrs May added. 'The terrorists who committed these cowardly acts are now where they belong, behind bars serving life sentences. 'But since the attacks they carried out, the threat we face from terrorism has grown more serious.' Yesterday, Scotland Yard commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe disclosed that 'four or five' plots have been foiled this year. Up and down the country, officers will be briefing more than 6,000 people at 80 venues including schools, universities, airports, shopping centres, cinemas and farms in a bid to engage the public and businesses in preventing attacks. The terror threat level in the UK was raised from substantial to severe a few months ago against a backdrop of increasing concerns over hundreds of aspiring British jihadis travelling to Iraq and Syria to learn terrorist 'tradecraft'. Since April 2010, 753 people have been arrested for terrorism-related offences, 212 have been charged and 148 have been successfully prosecuted, she said. A total of 138 people are behind bars serving sentences for terrorism-related offences, Mrs May added, while 13 people, including hook-handed radical cleric Abu Hamza, have been extradited. The Counter-Terrorism Internet Referral Unit has removed 65,000 items from the internet that 'encouraged or glorified acts of terrorism', the Home Secretary said. Since the July 7 attacks in 2005, around 40 terror plots have been disrupted, Mrs May revealed . Pakistani gunman  Ajmal Kasab brought terror to Mumbai in 2008 as part of a group of almost 30 attackers which rampaged through the streets of India's financial capital for three days, killing 166 people . Scotland Yard's Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley warned the terror threat will last for years . The extremist threat to Britain will continue even if the violence in Syria and Iraq subsides, according to a senior police chief. Scotland Yard's Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley stressed that the terror threat comes from many parts of the world. Asked if the current terror climate would continue for at least five years, Mr Rowley said: 'We have seen a step change that will sustain for many years. 'Even if the awfulness that's happening in Syria and Iraq was miraculously to get sorted in the next year or so - and that looks a very optimistic 'if' - there are other countries across parts of Africa and elsewhere in the world which are in parlous states and the potential for this type of terrorism to reach back into Europe to continue in other theatres is equally great. 'Whether it continues in that theatre or whether it moves into other places I think there's a high prospect of it continuing in this nature for several years.' Mrs May conceded that it is not possible to 'entirely eliminate the threat from terrorism', but it was necessary to act to 'reduce the risk presented by our enemies'. She went on: 'We are engaged in a struggle that is fought on many fronts and in many forms. It is a struggle that will go on for many years. 'And the threat we face right now is perhaps greater than it ever has been and we must have the powers we need to defend ourselves.' Under the new laws, schools, prisons and councils are to be required by law to put in place measures to stop would-be extremists from being drawn into terrorism. A statutory duty will be placed on named organisations - such as colleges, universities, the police and probation providers - to help deter radicalisation and, where organisations fail, ministers will be able to issue court-enforced directions to them. Over the weekend it emerged that police are to be handed powers in the new bill to force internet firms to hand over details that could help identify suspected terrorists and paedophiles. The Counter-Terrorism Bill will oblige internet service providers (ISPs) to retain information linking Internet Protocol (IP) addresses to individual users. Shami Chakrabarti, director of human rights group Liberty, said: 'Yet again politicians resort to high talk and rushed legislation in an attempt to look tough in the face of terrorism. 'So youngsters will have their passports seized at borders and others will be prevented coming home. 'Even our universities must read from ministers' scripts on radicalisation. Another chilling recipe for injustice and resentment by closing down the open society you seek to promote.' Labour leader Ed Miliband said his party would work with the Government to ensure the security services and police had the necessary powers. Speaking on a visit to the Crossrail construction site in central London, Mr Miliband said: 'We share the Government's desire and ambition to make sure we keep people safe and deal with people returning from Syria or going to Syria. 'That's why we are going to be scrutinising Theresa May's proposals. We want to work with the Government and we will be looking closely at them.' He added: 'I think we should always be looking at what more needs to be done to protect the security of our citizens. 'We have said, for example, in relation to Tpims - the control order the Government has put in place - that we should have a relocation power because that was important, that was part of the previous control order regime. 'We want to do everything we can to keep our citizens safe.'","Theresa May warns threat to Britain is 'greater than it has ever been'

"Elderly residents at a sheltered housing block have been banned from drinking alcohol in communal areas following complaints by tenants about rowdy and 'intimidating' behaviour. Residents in their 80s and 90s were said to be so frightened by the actions of two tenants that staff called in 24-hour security to keep the peace over Christmas. Now the guards have gone but residents can no longer drink in shared areas following a row that began in the communal room as some of the pensioners put up their Christmas tree in early December. Alchohol is banned from communal areas at Birch Grove sheltered housing in Jarrow, South Tyneside . A spokesman for South Tyneside Homes, which runs the housing complex, said the complaints centered on two residents at the Birch Grove sheltered housing complex in Jarrow, South Tyneside. He said: 'The consumption of alcohol is still banned in communal areas at Birch Grove.' But he said that the security guard who was brought in last December to deter anyone at the accommodation from misbehaving had been stood down earlier this month. One carer who helps a pensioner at the block said residents blamed a couple of 'problem tenants' whose antisocial behaviour was upsetting the peaceful majority of retirees. An insider at the accommodation block, who did not want to be named, said: 'It is appalling to need a security guard for people in their 80s and 90s, just to protect them from other residents. 'And the cost must have been enormous. To have someone there 24 hours a day, it must be thousands of pounds. 'It was the only sheltered housing block in the borough with this measure in place.' South Tyneside Homes, which runs Birch Grove, above, says they are looking into the residents' complaints . The 33-flat block caters for over-60s in independent flats, with a communal sitting room and kitchen. Another source said: 'They brought in the security guard 24 hours a day at first. Then he was scaled down to be there between 4pm and midnight in case anything happened, and now he has gone. 'But people are still fearful.  No one wants to use the communal areas because they are scared they will be subjected to abuse and intimidation. 'There are no group activities. With these dark winter nights, everyone is in by 5pm, but then it's lockdown. Everyone just goes to their own rooms all night. 'Some people are in their 80s and 90s and are not strong enough to stand up for themselves. 'And there were no New Year's Eve parties for Birch Grove because booze has been banned in communal areas. 'Residents couldn't have a drink to celebrate the festive season. 'People in other sheltered blocks were up until 1am celebrating, but at Birch Grove they were all in bed by 9.30pm.' A number of Birch Grove residents complained to South Tyneside Homes, which manages the block. John Musson, director of housing for South Tyneside Homes, said: 'We do not tolerate antisocial behaviour in any form and always encourage our tenants to report any cases of abusive, threatening or intimidating behaviour to us so that we can take appropriate action. 'We are investigating allegations of antisocial behaviour at Birch Grove Housing Plus Scheme in Jarrow following a number of complaints from tenants. 'We are working closely with tenants and their families and have agreed to put a number of temporary measures in place to provide reassurance while we resolve this matter.'","Trouble began at Birch Grove, South Tyneside with row over Christmas tree .

"Sticky fingers led to a sticky situation early on Wednesday morning when a Southwest Florida man got stuck in a chimney as he was allegedly trying to break into another man's home. Unlike Santa Claus, 25 year-old Richard Tyler Brandon was allegedly trying to break into Mike Whitley's home via the chimney to collect enough money for booze, not to grab a helping of milk and cookies. Scroll Down for Video . Santa: Alleged burglar Richard Tyler Brandon got caught halfway down the chimney . Santa's Helper: Derek Grenfell found police officers to help his friend break free . Empty stocking: Brandon's sooty foot dangles from the chimney in Mike Whitley's home . Brandon ended up getting stuck halfway down the chimney and needed police assistance to free himself from the narrow chamber. Brandon and friends were drinking at Pelican Larry's Raw Bar and Grill in Naples, FL when they realized they were out of cash. Brandon's friend Derek Grenfell, 26, told the police that he warned his friend not to go down the chimney and told him, 'Dude, you're not Santa Claus, what are you doing.' Grenfell and Brandon ran out of cash for booze at Pelican Larry's bar in Naples, FL so they attempted to burglar an unoccupied home . Mike Whitley's Florida home (pictured here) had an unwelcome visit from 'Santa' early Wednesday morning . The Naples Daily News reports that Grenfell found police officers at a gas station nearby to where Brandon required help. They called for more police officers and firefighters to help Brandon break free. When they arrived at Mike Whitley's home, which was unoccupied at the time, they saw a dirty and bare foot sticking out of the chimney. It took officers two hours to get Brandon out of the chimney using a harness. Richard Brandon was convicted on two counts of burglary and remained in jail until Thursday morning . Derek Grenfell acted as Brandon's accomplice but says he warned him not to climb down the chimney . 'There is a chance he could have died. The space he was jammed into was really tight. He couldn't move,' said Naples detective Robert Young. Brandon had difficulty breathing and complained of leg and back pain. He was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. Both Brandon and his friend Grenfell were taken to Collier County Jail. They both remained in jail on Thursday morning. Brandon was charged on two counts of burglary charges and Grenfell was charged with two counts of burglary accessory. Richard Brandon is lucky to be alive after getting stuck in a chimney and injuring himself . Derek Grenfell saved his friends life by seeking help, even though both men were engaging in illegal activity . Homeowner Mike Whitley maintained a sense of humor about the situation. He was away at his other home in Kentucky during the incident and was contacted early on Wednesday morning. The company that provides security at Whitley's home told him there was a man stuck in his chimney. Mike Whitley thought that the call was a joke at first. He later said it was,'a reverse kind of Santa.' The Bradenton Herald reports that Mike Whitley and his wife Faye were planning on returning home to Naples in the next few days. They wondered what would have happened had no one called for help. 'I think if we'd have come back Sunday, he'd still be yelling,' Whitley said. 'By Tuesday, no. Maybe an aroma.' An employee at Pelican Larry's said she had not heard about the incident. Her manager refused to comment because they were in the middle of dinner service.","'Dude, you're not Santa Claus, what are you doing,' said Richard Tyler Brandon's friend as he warned him not to go down the chimney .

"Unjustly regarded as ‘devil worshippers’ on account of their unusual beliefs, the Yazidi have for centuries been one of the most persecuted minorities of the Middle East. Islamic extremists regard them as infidels, worthy only of being killed. They are an ethnic Kurdish people who tend to have fairer complexions than many in the Middle East. They regard wearing blue as sacrilege, they never eat cabbage or lettuce because it creates wind and their men often have long beards and wear their hair in plaits – which make them resemble the cartoon characters of ancient Gaul, Asterix and Obelix. Scroll down for video . Horror: Yazidis in the barren hills near Sinjar with bodies of children said to have been killed by fanatics . Executions: IS fighters have been posting graphic images of mass killings - with Yazidis among the victims . They adhere to a 4,000-year-old faith passed down and adapted through the generations by word of mouth, and composed of elements of several religions. Their reverence for fire and light derives from the ancient faith called Zoroastrianism, the religion of Persia long before Islam arrived. They combine such Christian practices as baptism with Jewish or Islamic circumcision. Like Buddhists they believe in perpetual reincarnation. But it is the central tenet of their religion that has led others to brand them devil worshippers. They believe in one God who illuminated seven angels with his light. The greatest of the seven is the Peacock Angel, known as Malak Taus, who is dressed in blue (which is why the Yazidi refuse to wear the colour). His other name is Shaytan, Arabic for the devil or Satan. The Yazidi believe that God left the Earth in the care of the seven angels and told them to obey Adam. The Peacock Angel refused, stating that Adam was created from the soil, and God’s light could never be at the mercy of the soil. He was cast out for his disobedience, but was quickly reconciled with God who respected his argument – which proved he was, in fact, the most loyal angel of all. This is why the idea that he was akin to Lucifer is so misleading. Tragically, the Yazidi are also victims of another misunderstanding, over their name. Sunni extremists believe it derives from a deeply unpopular seventh century caliph – or leader – Yazid ibn Muawiya. Tradition: Yazidi boys plait their hair, and older men wear long beards. Their culture also prohibits cabbage . Keeping the flame alight: Yazidi men are pictured above keeping the oil burning for one of their saints . In fact, it comes from the Persian word for angel or deity, ‘Ized’. Their name simply means ‘worshippers of God’. Yet no such theological distinction interests Islamic State fighters in a Middle East where minor divergences between Sunni and Shia Muslims are a matter of life and death, and the region’s 12million Christians are diminishing by the day. In such a murderous atmosphere, ‘Satan worshippers’ are inevitably the targets of genocidal fanatics. Even to ordinary Iraqis, they are seen as bogeymen to frighten children with. The Yazidi once lived in a wide area across Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Georgia and Armenia. But successive waves of persecution - they claim to have survived 72 genocides - by the Ottoman Turkish rulers of what is now Iraq, by Saddam Hussein and now by Islamic militants, have reduced the number of Yazidi from millions to an estimated 700,000. In recent years, some 70,000 have fled to Europe, where 40,000 live in western Germany. This is not surprising. Since the Yazidi welcomed the US invasion of Iraq after 2003 and admire Israel, they attracted the malevolence of Al Qaeda and other jihadists before the Islamic State came on the scene; in 2007 massive truck bombs killed 500. What makes the Yazidi still more vulnerable is the insular nature of their community. No one can convert to their religion, you have to be born into it. They also practice endogamy – that is, they only marry members of the same faith. They believe that when someone dies, their soul passes into a new member of the community and that purification of the soul is only possible through continual rebirth. The worst possible fate, therefore, is to be expelled from the community because the soul can never then be purified or saved. Equally, anyone who voluntarily leaves the religion risks death. In 2007, it was reported that Du’a Khalil Aswad, a Yazidi woman, was stoned to death for converting to Islam and marrying a Muslim man. Feared, villified and slaughtered for centuries, it is in many ways remarkable such a strong community of Yazidis still exists at all. But now, with the Islamic State’s determination to wipe them out, they perhaps face their greatest test of all.","Yazidi people are unjustly known as devil-worshippers by Muslim extremists .
They worship a fallen angel - who was later reconciled with God .
He is sometimes confused with the Islamic and Christian Satan .

"This horrifying picture was taken of a deer that wandered into a New Jersey garden. This deer with an arrow shot cleanly through its head was spotted and photographed by resident Susan Darrah. She says she was shocked to see the deer at her home in Boonton with a dart wedged through its muzzle. 'Shocked': Susan Darrah said she took this photo of a deer impaled by an arrow in her New Jersey back yard . 'Want to know what sucks? THIS!' She posted on her Facebook page, 'Tried to capture him to no avail... he can eat, run and there's no blood, less chance of infection. I just feel so bad for him.' The animal wasn't bleeding and didn't appear to be frightened, she claimed. Ms Darrah immediately contacted animal control and they turned up the same day but were unable to catch the animal. She said the deer was a regular visitor to her back garden. Deer are attracted to her large property thanks to a big pear tree and its location next to the Split Rock Reservoir. 'I know a lot of hunters and I know that was nothing done intentionally,' Ms Darrah told her local paper. 'I'm sure if any hunter saw him, they would have been kind of enough to put him down.' Bow hunting for deer is legal in all 50 states, but ethical hunters aim for the body . Ms Darrah spoke to a Fish and Wildlife representative and followed their advice to put out a supply of corn for the deer, which appeared to be travelling in a herd with four others. Bow hunting is legal in all 50 states . Anywhere there's rifle season also has a bow season - but it usually starts a few weeks earlier . Less deer are harvested each year than by rifle hunters, mainly due to difficulty . Ethical bow hunters aim for the body, not the head . Source: Justin Zarr, BowHunting.com . The state Division of Fish and Wildlife sent out a crew to the area looking for the deer, and spokesman Bob Considine said the department would tranquilize the animal in the hopes of removing the arrow. Ms Darrah said they told her to call them as soon as the deer reappeared in her back garden and they would try to catch it. Her efforts to help the animal were applauded by her friends on Facebook after she posted the image, taken from her back fence, and many of them expressed their sadness at deer's plight. She posted on her Facebook page: 'I've been on ""deer watch"" since just before 5am. I have NJ Fish and Wildlife alerted. 'I am also sure this was not done intentionally. Any hunters I know would have looked for this deer knowing they missed a clean shot. In addition to that, all the hunters I know, hunt for food.'

"David Ames is alleged to have collected millions of pounds for ambitious building projects in the Caribbean and Brazil . A businessman accused of taking £300 million of British investors’ money – and failing  to build thousands of luxury properties – could be forced to stop trading this week. Former bankrupt David Ames is alleged to have collected millions of pounds for ambitious building projects in the Caribbean and Brazil, but less than 300 properties have so far been built. Legal papers will be lodged at the High Court in Birmingham on Tuesday to freeze the assets of Harlequin Property and its directors in an attempt to claw back money for worried investors. It is understood that Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs’ pensions regulator is also poised to act if a judge’s ruling is made on Friday. A Mail on Sunday investigation has discovered that Harlequin Property – which has paid tennis star Pat Cash to feature in its promotional material – last month failed to make interest payments to investors who took out loans for deposits. Now hundreds of financial advisers, who convinced investors to cash in their pensions, have been given just two days by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to confirm if any of their clients have SIPP investments in the Essex-based firm, and a further three days to provide all details. SIPPs are a personal pension plan allowing individuals to cash in their pension to invest in schemes such as property abroad. A source close to the investigation said: ‘This is a frightening situation for hundreds of investors, who could lose everything.’ An FSA spokesman said: ‘We are trying to establish the levels of pensions held with Harlequin.’ Harlequin Property is not regulated by the FSA so there would be no protection to UK investors should the scheme collapse. Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed the Serious Fraud Office had been asked to investigate the company amid fears that it had mis-sold investments. Mr Ames, 61, who runs the company with wife Carol, also 61, and son Daniel, 35, from a business park in Basildon, Essex, last week issued a strongly worded denial concerning ‘grossly misleading’ claims of fraud.

An artist's impression of the luxury Merricks Resort in Barbados . In a letter sent to investors and agents last Monday, Mr Ames claimed allegations of fraud investigations were ‘politically motivated’. Harlequin Property investor groups have been organising meetings across the country and plan to launch a series of lawsuits for breach of contract. Gareth Fatchett of Regulatory Legal Solicitors, which represents a group of investors, said: ‘We have uncovered evidence which makes us very concerned at the financial wellbeing of potentially thousands of investors. ‘Investors were promised totally unrealistic returns on their investments. Now the excuses are running out for Harlequin Property as to why they have not been  able to build these resorts, not to mention what has happened to the money invested.’ A spokesman for Harlequin Property said: ‘Harlequin is aware there was an administrative error in relation to some payments – and we are instructed that these are in the process of being addressed and rectified. ‘Those affected have been contacted.’","Former bankrupt David Ames could be forced to stop trading this week .

"David Cameron at the EU budget summit. It has been revealed that more than 3,300 eurocrats are paid more than the Prime Minister . AT least 3,000 Brussels bureaucrats earn more than David Cameron, it emerged yesterday. Official figures show that at least 3,325 EU officials – 7 per cent of the total workforce – take home more than the Prime Minister’s salary of £142,000. The totals do not include the 27 EU commissioners – politicians appointed from each of the member states – who earn up to £219,000 each, plus allowances. And on top of the huge pay packets, Eurocrats benefit from a range of perks including educational allowances for  children and 18 days off a year for public holidays. The Prime Minister criticised the startlingly generous pay and perks of EU staff at last week’s Brussels summit, convened to draw up a seven-year budget deal. He said the EU’s administration budget of 56billion euros should be cut by 10billion, but EU bosses instead wanted to increase it to 63billion. He also called for a cut in employees’ generous pensions. The meeting collapsed after the 27 member states failed to come to agreement. The pay figures were obtained by a German MEP, Inge Graessle, who campaigns for Brussels spending cuts. She said: ‘The whole of the EU is being prescribed hard medicine by the commission, but the EU institutions themselves will have none of it.’ President Jose Manuel Barroso (left) and Herman Van Rompuy (right) are paid £240,000 a year plus allowances .

Pawel Swidlicki, of the Open Europe think tank, said: ‘These figures show that there is ample scope for savings within the EU’s staffing expenditure.’ A Whitehall source said: ‘The Prime Minister’s point is that if any organisation is serious about getting a grip on spending, it looks at its own overheads first.’ A spokesman for the European Commission said: ‘The majority of us are highly qualified professionals such as lawyers or economists and most of us are also  expatriates, so of course the average  salary is high.’","EU officials work a basic 37 and a half .

So the teen armed herself with a bow and arrow and confronted Watson, who apologized to the teenager but refused to leave - and instead asked for a glass of water, deputies said. 'I was like, 'What do I do? Who is this lady? This isn't anybody that my parents have mentioned or I've seen,' Reed told the broadcaster. 'I panicked a little and got the bow out of my closet,' Reed said. 'She was like, 'Are you going to shoot me with that?' I'm like, 'Get out of my house right now.' Stopped: A teenage girl at the house grabbed a bow and arrow and confronted the trespasser before calling her mother, who in turn alerted authorities. Watson was later arrested (file picture) But the teen went back to her bedroom and reported the incident to authorities. Before they arrived, Watson poured herself a glass of Pepsi and went into the master bedroom, deputies said. When officers arrived, Watson apologized and talked about picking flowers and drinking alcoholic beverages, according to a police report. Watson was taken to the Volusia County Jail on misdemeanor trespassing charges.","Mariah Reed initially let Marcia Watson into the home, thinking it was her mother .

"Mocked: Professor Richard Dawkins was mercilessly mocked on the internet after he complained that 'Bin laden has won' because airport staff confiscated his jar of honey . Atheist Professor Richard Dawkins was mercilessly mocked on the internet yesterday after he complained that Bin laden has won... because airport staff confiscated his jar of honey. The respected evolutionary biologist took to Twitter to declare: ‘Bin Laden has won, in airports of the world every day.’ He added: ‘I had a little jar of honey, now thrown away by rule-bound dundridges. STUPID waste.’ The outspoken atheist, who came to prominence with his 1976 book The Selfish Gene, uses his self-coined word ‘dundridges’ to describe petty jobsworths. The term, which Professor Dawkins has used in his writings, was inspired by the character J. Dundridge in the 1975 novel, Blott On The Landscape. The Oxford University academic was treated to a flood of sarcastic replies to his Twitter posting. One Twitter user wrote: ‘I’m not sure that Bin Laden’s number one target was your honey jar, but yeah, he kinda won.’ Another added: ‘You truly are the real victim of terrorism.’ And one advised: ‘You could have just read the rules properly and not kept it in your hand luggage...’ Professor Dawkins hit back: ‘Of course I know the airport security rules. My point is those rules are stupid advertising displays of dundridge zeal. Bin Laden has won.’ He added: ‘Are you carpers really too thick to see the difference between a matter of general principle and a petty concern with a single jar of honey?’ Some of Professor Dawkin’s 844,000 followers had more sympathy. One wrote: ‘You are quite right. After the awful violence and bloodshed, the winning tactic of the terrorist is to instil lasting fear.’ International airports around the world stop passengers taking containers containing more than 100ml of liquid in their hand baggage. Rules: International airports around the world stop passengers taking containers containing more than 100ml of liquid in their hand baggage . The rules frequently catch out passengers carrying semi-solid foods such as pate, foie gras or honey, which are often bought by tourists as gifts. The security measures were imposed in 2006 after British police said they had foiled a plot to bring down as many as 10 planes with explosive liquids. Professor Dawkins’ outburst comes after he sparked anger in August with a tweet that critics claimed was ‘anti-Muslim’. On that occasion he posted: ‘All the world’s Muslims have fewer Nobel Prizes than Trinity College, Cambridge. They did great things in the Middle Ages, though.’ And last month he found himself at the centre of a row over an interview he gave to the Times Magazine in which he appeared to suggest he was the victim of ‘mild paedophilia’ at school and that current cases of historical child sex abuse had been overblown. ‘I am very conscious that you can’t condemn people of an earlier era by the standards of ours’, he said.","Professor wrote on Twitter 'Bin Laden has won' after honey confiscated .

Iran denies the charge, saying it is only interested peaceful nuclear programs like producing power. The country's nuclear programme has been left frozen but intact, without any of the cuts sought by the US. British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the sides were giving themselves until March to agree on a text 'that sets out in layman's language what we have agreed to do.' The five permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany  have been locked in talks with Iran for months (From left, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, former EU Foreign Policy Chief Catherine Ashton, British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier) Experts then will be given another four months to 'translate that into precise definitions of what will happen on the ground,' he told reporters. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry focused on praise, in an apparent attempt to maintain a relatively cordial atmosphere at the negotiating table. Mr Kerry, who arrived Thursday and met repeatedly with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohamad Javad Zarif, said Zarif 'worked diligently and approached these negotiations in good faith.' 'We're serious': Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened the use of force against Iran several times since 2009, and even sought authorization from his cabinet in 2011 . 'We have made real and substantial progress and we have seen new ideas surface,' he said. 'Today we are closer to a deal that will make the whole world, especially our allies in Israel and the Gulf, safer. We would be fools to walk away.' Mr Hammond spoke of 'significant progress,' while German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said only differences about 'technical details' remained. But the length of the extension suggested that both sides felt time was needed to overcome the disputes on how much Iran needed to restrict nuclear activities. 'All the people involved here feel that there really is a chance to find out a way to each other and we are going to take that chance,' Mr Steinmeier said. Members of the new Republican-controlled U.S. Congress that will be sworn in in January have already threatened to impose additional sanctions on Iran. It may well have enough votes to overturn an expected veto of such legislation by President Barack Obama. New sanctions could very well derail the talks, as Iran has signaled they would be a deal breaker, and Kerry appealed to Congress to 'support ... this extension.' In Tehran, hardliners fearful that their country could give away more than it gets under any final deal could increase pressure on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to break off talks. The talks extension, however, appears to have the approval of Khamenei, who is the ultimate arbiter in his country. Protests: An Iranian student holds a placard to show a support for Iran's nuclear program in a gathering in front of the headquarters of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization in Tehran, Iran, yesterday . Both sides are haggling over how many - and what kind - of centrifuges Iran should be allowed to have. The machines can enrich uranium from low, reactor-fuel level, up to grades used to build the core of a nuclear weapon, and their output grows according to how modern they are. Washington wants deeper and more lasting cuts in the program than Tehran is willing to give. Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu has threatened the use of force against Iran several times since 2009 and three years ago even asked his cabinet to authorise such a strike. Iran's nuclear effort has expanded significantly since.

"Fifty years ago, bride and groom Tommy and Evelyn Johnston raised a glass of their favourite tipple to celebrate their romantic union. The waiter's recommendation started a love affair between the couple and the sweet sparkling wine, one which they have enjoyed throughout their happy marriage. To help them celebrate their golden anniversary, the maker of Barossa Pearl has made them a special edition bottle - and are now considering bringing the 1960s favourite back to shelves around Australia. Scroll down to videos . Tommy and Evelyn tried Barossa Pearl on their wedding day in 1964 (pictured left) and then got to crack open another bottle 50 years later on their golden anniversary (pictured right) In 1964, Scottish couple Tommy and Evelyn Johnston (pictured middle) got married and on that day a waiter suggested they try Barossa Pearl, a sweet sparkling wine, to drink for the evening which then became the drink of their wedding toast . The couple, who married in Australia but moved back to their native Scotland after a few years in the 1960s, were stunned when their son Steven managed to pull off the surprise. 'Growing up, my folks would tell me stories of coming to Australia,' he said. 'My parents got married after six weeks, my dad came to Australia and invited my mother, so she bit the bullet and went to Australia and in two weeks they got married. 'They have managed to stay together for 50 years, it says a lot for their relationship.' As well as falling in love with each other, they fell in love with Barossa Pearl, which was made by winemakers Jacobs Creek until 1983. 'They loved it,' said Steven, who still lives in Perth. 'They told me they drank it for years to come all the time.

Amazingly he got a letter back and Jacobs Creek agreed to prepare a one-of-a-kind, handmade bottle in time for him to fly to Scotland and surprise his parents. 'I got it in July, they sent it to Perth and then I flew it over to Scotland,' he said. 'It was nice because it (the bottle) came with a letter saying it was a one-off bottle and the original recipe, bottled with the same bottle as in the 70s.

"BT is in talks to buy back mobile firm O2 in a £10billion deal that would give it an unprecedented share of the telecoms market. The former state-owned monopoly already offers TV services and is the largest provider of landlines and home internet in the UK. Now it wants to add the mobile phone business in order to offer consumers a single package of all four services – known in the industry as ‘quad-play’. BT has raised its £2billion move into sports TV – including a weekly chat show starring Clare Balding – by raising the price of line rental by 6.5 per cent last year to £15.99 a month – or £191.88 a year . BT confirmed yesterday it was also in talks with EE, which is Britain’s biggest mobile provider with 27million customers. However, experts warned that any such deal could lead to price rises for some households as BT seeks to fund discounts in other parts of the business. O2’s owner, Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica, yesterday confirmed talks were going on, although BT said discussions are at a ‘highly preliminary stage’. O2, which has more than 24million users, was owned by BT under the Cellnet brand before it was sold a decade ago. Any buyout is likely to require clearance by European competition watchdogs. If it goes ahead, it is likely BT would then try to sell other products from across its business to mobile customers – increasing its size even further. Imran Choudhary, senior analyst at research group Kantar Worldpanel, said: ‘Acquiring one of the largest networks in the country would give it instant access to an established customer base, allowing it to tap into and cross-sell its internet, TV and landline packages.’ BT is likely to face a hefty bill in the spring when the next auction for the rights to show Premier League matches takes place . Some analysts have claimed that the move could see prices for consumers drop. James Barford, of Enders Analysis, said those who signed up for so-called quad play services in France and Spain were offered ‘deep discounts’. But there are also fears that existing BT customers could see prices rise as the firm raises the cash to pay for discounts in other areas. The company already offers phone lines to ten million homes and has almost a third of all home broadband customers in the UK, while more than a million households also pay to take TV from the group. But it has funded its £2billion move into sports TV – including a weekly chat show starring Clare Balding – by raising the price of line rental by 6.5 per cent last year to £15.99 a month – or £191.88 a year. It is also likely to face a hefty bill in the spring when the next auction for the rights to show Premier League matches takes place. Ernest Doku, of price comparison site uSwitch, warned that the creation of a large player in the market could have a ‘significant impact’. He said: ‘There are so many different bundles available that it can be hard to compare providers, and subsequently know if you are getting a good deal. ‘It will be down to them to ensure packages are clear, transparent and competitively priced for customers if quad play is to succeed.’ BT has faced criticism over its dominance of the physical network of cables that runs across the country. Openreach – the national grid of phone and internet lines – is owned and run by BT but has been criticised for its pricing. EE – which was formed from Orange and T-Mobile – is jointly owned by France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, which want to sell the business. Future market leader? A takeover frenzy among telecoms and mobile companies has been sparked after it emerged that BT is in talks to buy either O2 or EE .","BT in talks with Telefonica to buy back mobile firm O2 in a £10billion deal .

"Two black teenagers accused of killing a World War II veteran have been placed in protective custody after neo-Nazis put a $10,000 bounty on them. Kenan Adams-Kinard and Demetruis Glenn, from Spokane, Washington, allegedly beat Delbert Belton, 88, who fought in the Battle of Okinawa, to death during a robbery. The white supremacist prison gang the Aryan Brotherhood are believed to have offered a reward to anyone who could kill the 16-year-olds while they await trial. Demetrius Glenn, left, and Kenan Adams Kinard, right, are believed to have been targeted by white supremacist gang the Aryan Brotherhood who put $10,000 bounty on them .

Sergeant Tom Hill, of Spokane Police, told Spokane County Superior Court that he had information about the bounty. District . Court Judge Debra Hayes said she allowed them to stay out of adult . prison to avoid possible 'tragic results' if they had been moved through . an open courtyard, the newspaper said. Both teens deny murder and their trial is scheduled for March 17. They are being held in the Spokane County Jail. The pair are accused of beating Belton to death with flashlights outside an Eagles Lodge on August 22 and they could face life in prison if convicted. The elderly man was found dead and wedged between the two front seats of his car. Adams-Kinard's attorney objected to him being placed in adult prison .

The . letter indicated Adams-Kinard had called Belton and arranged to buy . crack cocaine. However, police have said there was no evidence that . Belton was a drug dealer. Glenn, . who turned himself in, was being held in lieu of $2 million bail. Adams-Kinard, who is suspected of hiding . from police after the slaying, is jailed on $3 million bail. Adams-Kinard . and Demetrius Glenn both have previous convictions for assault and were . caught on security cameras at the time of the killing.

'I . took his wallet and another ounce of crack from his pockets,' the . letter said, according to the court document.

"Israeli spy: Movie tycoon Arnon Milchan, who owns New Regency Films, has given details about his clandestine deals to acquire weapons for Israel in the 70s in a TV interview . A major Hollywood producer is planning to spill the beans about his double life as an arms dealer and Israeli intelligence operative in the late 1970s. Arnon Milchan, the Israeli producer of smash hits including Fight Club and Pretty Woman, is opening up for the first time ever in an Israeli TV show on Monday to speak about his involvement in clandestine deals to acquire arms for Israel and his work to promote the country's alleged nuclear program. Russell Crowe, Robert De Niro, Ben . Affleck and other major Hollywood players are also featured in the . controversial report to be aired on Israel’s Channel 2. The film tycoon spoke to Israeli investigative journalist Ilana Dayan for the season premiere of her current affairs show, Uvda. In . the interview he tells her how he tried to engage Hollywood colleagues . in his work for Israel's Defense Ministry, according to Haaretz. He claims he managed to convince other Hollywood bigwigs, including the late director Sydney Pollack, to get involved. Scroll down for video... 'I knew': Robert De Niro sits next to his friend, Arnon Milchan, in the interview for the show. He says he asked Milchan in the 70s if he was a spy and Milchan admitted it . 'Worked for the Israelis': Film director Sydney Pollack, who died of cancer in 2008, was convinced by Milchan to get involved in spying . Pollack, . who died in 2008, acquired arms and other military equipment for Israel . in the 1970s, reveals Milchan in the TV report. Pollack . knew of the details of the deals, says Milchan, who adds that he . ‘didn't want to scare him because he's American… He could have said . ""no"". He said ""no"" many times, but he also said ""yes"" many times’. Milchan also says he used at least . one big-name actor's star quality to lure US scientist Arthur Biehl – an . expert on nuclear weapons and a co-developer of the hydrogen bomb – to a . meeting. Milchan . invited Biehl to the actor's home under the pretence the actor was . seeking scientific advice for a project he was working on. Caught on camera: Israeli investigative journalist, Ilana Dayan, spoke to Milchan about his clandestine activities for her new show, Uvda, which airs on Monday . Milchan expected Biehl to cooperate because, ‘Anyone who lives in California is a star-f*****… They hear ""star""…they come running,’ he said. But he says life wasn’t always so easy, according to Haaretz. ‘In Hollywood they don’t like working with an arms dealer, ideologically, with someone who lives off selling machine guns and killing. ‘Instead of someone talking to me about a script, I had to spend half an hour explaining that I'm not an arms dealer,’ says Milchan. 'Accepted it': De Niro says Milchan told him he was an Israeli and that 'of course' he would spy for his country. The actor says he did not judge him for it . De Niro was asked if he knew what was going on at the time, and he said he did. 'I . did ask him once, we spoke about something, he told me that he was an . Israeli and that he of course would do these things for his country. 'I remember at some point, I had . asked Arnon about that, being friends I was curious, but not in an . accusatory way, I just wanted to know. 'He gave me that answer and I accepted it,' said De Niro. Closed down: Jonathan Pollard sits in the back of a US government vehicle in 1985 after being accused of spying. The incident closed down Israel's Bureau of Scientific Relations, which Milchan was also involved with . Secret life: The book titled Confidential: The Life of Secret Agent Turned Hollywood Tycoon Arnon Milchan, reveals his double life . ‘If people knew how many times I risked . my life, back and forth, again and again, for my country. And suddenly, . [I have to] defend myself – ""I'm not an arms dealer, I don't sell guns, I . don't sell rockets"". I should have been aware of that, of what I'll go . through, and said, ""F*** you"". You know what, I did it for my country . and I'm proud of it.’ This isn’t the first time Milchan's role in Israeli arms dealings and intelligence has surfaced. Two years ago, a book titled . Confidential: The Life of Secret Agent Turned Hollywood Tycoon Arnon . Milchan, was published by authors Meir Doron and Joseph Gelman. The book alleged that Milchan was an . operative for Israel's Bureau of Scientific Relations, which gathered . information for Israel's alleged nuclear program. The bureau was closed after Jonathan Pollard was arrested for spying on behalf of Israel in 1986. Milchan is still making movies, and his company, New Regency films, is working on four films slated for release in 2013-14. One of those is Noah, a Darren Aronofsky-directed take on the Biblical flood story starring Russell Crowe, Emma Watson and Anthony Hopkins.","Movie tycoon Arnon Milchan, who owns New Regency Films and produced Fight club and Pretty Woman, opened up in a tv interview about his clandestine deals to acquire weapons for Israel in the 70s .

"A businessman who lost £15,000 building his own private toll road has revealed how he only did it because his wife had moaned to him about traffic problems. Mike Watts, 63, spent £325,000 on the toll road to bypass roadworks when a crucial route in Kelston, Somerset, was closed by a landslip, leaving locals with a 14-mile diversion. His road closed last week after Bath and North East Somerset council invested £660,000 to finish repairs on the A431 five weeks early, meaning Mr Watts and wife Wendy Race, 52, will not make a profit. Scroll down for video . Mike Watts, 63, (pictured) who lost £15,000 building his own private toll road has revealed how he only did it because his wife Wendy had nagged him about traffic problems . Mr Watts came up with the idea of the toll road after he and Ms Race grew frustrated at having to undertake the lengthy detour to reach the stalls they run in the centre of Bath when the A431 closed for repairs . Mr Watts says he faced constant opposition from the local authority over the project, which he claims was down to officials' embarrassment that he was able to tackle the problem of the road closure - caused when cracks appeared in February. He came up with the idea after he and Ms Race grew frustrated at having to undertake the lengthy detour to reach the stalls they run inside the Bath Guildhall Market. 'It all became a much more expensive project than we'd anticipated but we weren't put off because my wife was getting pretty annoyed,' he told The Times. Mr Watts spent £325,000 on the toll road to bypass roadworks when a crucial route in Kelston, Somerset, was closed by a landslip, leaving locals with a 14-mile diversion . 'Every morning I'd have to drive the car with her. She'd be shouting in my left ear that she doesn't want to go to work any more.' The A431 Kelston Road was closed in February after a landslip caused huge cracks to appear in the road. Friend and neighbouring farmer, John Dinham, was already allowing cars to use a track through his field, and Mr Watts agreed to rent the land from him until Christmas and build a road over it, hiring three workmen to help build the road in just ten days. The toll road needed to take over 150,000 paying customers to move into profit, which the couple thought was easily possible by Christmas as more than 25,000 cars passed through its toll booths in the first month . Motorists were charged £2 per journey to use the 365 metres long and seven metres wide bypass made from rolled chippings. Mr Watts and Ms Race also put up a toll booth and paid attendants to collect the money, as well as shelling out for public liability insurance and CCTV, at a cost of around £150,000 .

Mr Watts and Ms Race also put up a toll booth and paid attendants to collect the money, as well as shelling out for public liability insurance and CCTV, at a cost of around £150,000. They had also spent £150,000 to build the road, but Mr Watts says the council bombarded him with red tape and forced him to spend £25,000 gaining retrospective planning permission for the project. The couple spent £150,000 to build the road, but Mr Watts says the council bombarded him with red tape and forced him to spend £25,000 gaining retrospective planning permission for the project . Mr Watts also claims officials had sent him a £3,500 bill for business rates despite the toll road not being official . But in September the council suddenly found a further £660,000 to complete the roadworks early and open the main road, meaning the toll road will be shut and the couple will just break even. Mr Watts also claims officials had sent him a £3,500 bill for business rates despite the toll road not being official, and the couple have accused Bath and North East Somerset Council of deliberately trying to bankrupt them. In an open letter to the council, Ms Race said: 'The Kelston Toll Road is and always was a community initiative to help with the dreadful situation we found ourselves in when the A431 closed way back in early February. 'We thought, stupidly with hindsight, that the council would be supportive. After all, we didn't want them to cough up any dosh for it – we wanted it to pay for itself. 'But we did hope and pray that they would see the practical benefit of the temporary road for ourselves and the thousands of people living this side of a closed road, and the other thousands of people that used that road to get to and from work every day.' An aerial view of Mr Watts's alternative route through a field alongside the A431 at Kelston, Somerset . Ms Race added: 'We applied for retrospective planning permission because it was the right thing to do but I wish we never had. It has cost us a further £25,000 so far. Most recently they have dug up an archaeologist from somewhere. 'We have used our home as a guarantee for the costs of the temporary road, which was a decision we came to with our eyes wide open, but it seems to have fired B&NES up to do whatever they possibly can to escalate our costs, so that we do actually lose our home. They have even found another £660,000 to throw at the A431 to ""speed up works"".' Bath and North East Somerset Council has denied trying to block the couple, saying last week that the extra cash was necessary to speed up the works. It said in a statement: 'The council has made a considerable effort to work with Mr Watts and various officers and members have met with him several times. 'The Council has provided expertise, advice and our ground investigation results free of charge. 'This road is open to the public and therefore, in the public interest, must comply with the normal safety standards for public roads. 'Councillors made an emergency decision to approve an extra £660,000 (for the A431 repairs) following further investigation works at the site, which discovered that below the land which had already moved, there was another layer of 'soft' rock, which was also at risk of sliding. 'The additional funding was needed for the necessary revised scheme which required two rows of deep piling to ensure that future land-slips are prevented.'","Mike Watts, 63, spent £325,000 on the toll road to bypass roadworks .

"Earlier this year, global warming was blamed for the ‘irreversible retreat’ of west Antarctic glaciers. But now scientists claim that warming of the planet is in fact behind a paradoxical growth in South Pole sea ice. The comments come as Antarctica’s sea ice set a record this week, reaching 815,448 square miles (1,312,000 square km) of ice above its normal range. Antarctic ice maps for September 2009 until September 2012 reveal an increase in the level of sea ice . Scientists believe the shift is caused by water melting from beneath the Antarctic ice shelves and re-freezing back on the surface. ‘The primary reason for this is the nature of the circulation of the Southern Ocean — water heated in high southern latitudes is carried equatorward, to be replaced by colder waters upwelling from below, which inhibits ice loss,’ Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Centre, told Harold Ambler at Talking About the Weather. However, as reported in a separate blog post by Mr Ambler, Nasa scientist Walt Meier said that growing Antarctic sea ice coverage is less significant a measure than declining Arctic sea ice coverage when assessing climate change. Earlier this year, global warming was blamed for the 'irreversible retreat' of west Antarctic glaciers. But now scientists claim that warming of the planet is in fact behind a paradoxical expansion in South Pole sea ice . Despite ice coverage increasing in some areas, Nasa claims that in a few hundred years the irreversible melt that has already started from the Amundsen Sea sector of the West Antarctica ice sheet, pictured, has now 'passed the point of no return' and could eventually add four to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.7 metres) to current sea levels . On the left here is the elevation of the region, while on the right the various glaciers that will be affected by the melting of the Amundsen Sea region. Nasa scientist Walt Meier said that growing Antarctic sea ice coverage is less significant a measure than declining Arctic sea ice coverage when assessing climate change . Last year, team from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute found that the fresh water melting from the Antarctic ice sheets had a relatively low density compared to the denser salty seawater. This means that the water accumulates and freezes in the top layer of the ocean during the summer months, as reported in the Daily Caller. Surrounded by North America, Greenland and Eurasia, the Arctic ice cap floats on the ocean, not land. It has lost a large amount of its older, thicker sea ice over the last 30 years, making it more vulnerable to the warming trend. Last year, a team from the Royal Netherland's Meteorological Institute found that the fresh water melting from the Antarctic ice sheets had a relatively low density compared to the denser salty seawater. This means that it accumulates in the top layer of the ocean during the summer months . The Antarctic, however, is a continent circled by open waters that lets sea ice expand during the winter but also offers less shelter during the melt season. The Dutch report found that despite the increase in surface ice expansion each winter, the total mass of ice around Antarctica is continuing to shrink because of the underwater ice melt. In May, Nasa scientists told reporters that vast glaciers in West Antarctica seem to be locked in an irreversible thaw linked to global warming that may push up sea levels for centuries. In a few hundred years they say the irreversible melt that has already started could eventually add four to 12 feet (1.2 to 3.7 metres) to current sea levels. The . Antarctic ice sheet is more unstable than first thought with a new . study suggesting melting began 5,000 years earlier than previously . believed. The . study in May revealed that shrinking of the vast ice sheet accelerated during . eight distinct periods between 20,000 and 9,000 years ago causing a . rapid sea level rise. During . one period 14,600 years ago, melting glaciers released so many icebergs . into the ocean that sea level rose 6.5ft (2 metres) in just 100 years. The . results provide the first clear evidence for dramatic melting in . Antarctic's and reflect predictions for the region's future. It . also follows recent news that destabilisation of part of the West . Antarctic ice sheet has already begun and could be 'unstoppable.' The study was conducted by an international team including researchers from Germany, Canada, Hawaii, Lapland and Australia. Periods of rapid increase in iceberg-rafted debris suggest that more icebergs were being released by the Antarctic ice sheet. The . researchers discovered increased amounts of debris during eight . separate episodes beginning as early as 20,000 years ago, and continuing . until 9,000 years ago. Up until now, melting of Antarctic ice sheet wasn't thought to have started until 14,000 years ago.","Claim was made by Mark Serreze, .

"An attorney who got his client sentenced to death and then dressed up in court as Thomas Jefferson to defend himself against accusations of 'incompetence' has had his right to practice law withdrawn by the Kansas Supreme Court. Dennis Hawver was adjudged to have shown ‘inexplicable incompetence’ as a defense attorney for Phillip Cheatham during his original 2005 murder trial, according to Friday's unanimous decision to disbar him. After ruling that Hawver had failed to properly represent his client earlier this year, the court reversed Cheatham’s conviction and ordered a new trial. Scroll down for video .

Hawver argued that the First Amendment protected his actions with his clients, before banging the lectern with his hand and saying 'I'm incompetent' During the original trial, Hawver had told prospective jurors that his client Cheatham was 'a professional drug dealer' and a 'shooter of people'. He also failed to present evidence that might have proven that Cheatham was not in Topeka at the time of murder for which he was charged. 'I had no idea that cellphones had GPS capabilities at that time,' said Hawver, reports Topeka Capital-Journal. In the original 2005 murder trail, Hawver had told jurors in his closing argument that they should execute the killer. Cheatham was then sentenced to death before his conviction was overturned.

"It's not uncommon to see a pretty bird flit by when you are enjoying a walk or a picnic - even if you live in a built-up area. But if your knowledge of flying fauna isn't up to Bill Oddie's standards, it can be difficult to work out which creature you have spotted. But now an app, developed by computer scientists, can identify a bird from a single photo.

The free iPhone app claims to be an electronic field guide featuring 500 of the most common North American bird species. It lets users identify bird species by uploading photos and there is also a website, which includes 50,000 images as well as bird calls for each species.

Birdsnap app was developed by computer scientists. It uses computer vision and machine learning techniques to identify species of birds from photos. 'Electronic field guide' features 500 of the most common North American species. It is designed for iPhones and is free from the App Store. Users can upload photos and the app will identify birds in them. They can also use a website to browse through the species in different ways and listen to different bird calls. In the future the app could offer a Shazam-like feature to recognise bird song. The technology could also be added to binoculars to identify and tag species within the field of view. The app and . website were developed with the University of Maryland and made their . debut at the EEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition . in Columbus, Ohio. ‘Our . goal is to use computer vision and artificial intelligence to create a . digital field guide that will help people learn to recognise birds,’ Professor Belhumeur said. He has previously launched Leafsnap - a similar electronic field guide for trees. ‘We've been able to take an incredible collection of data - thousands of photos of birds - and use technology to organise the data in a useful and fun way.’ He and fellow computer scientist David Jacobs of the University of Maryland, realised that many of the techniques they have developed for face recognition, in work spanning more than a decade, could also be applied to automatic species identification. Face recognition algorithms rely on methods that find correspondences between comparable parts of different faces, so that, for example, a nose is compared to a nose and an eye to an eye. Birdsnap works the same way by detecting the parts of a bird so that it can examine the visual similarity of its comparable parts. Each species is labelled through the location of 17 parts. It automatically discovers visually similar species and makes visual suggestions for how they can be distinguished. Catalogue of calls and clucks: A website (pictured) includes 50,000 images plus bird calls for each species. Beginners and experts can sort through species alphabetically, by their relationship in the Tree of Life, and by the frequency with which they are sighted at a particular place and season . ‘Categorisation is one of the fundamental problems of computer vision,’ said Thomas Berg, a Columbia Engineering computer science PhD candidate. ‘Recently, there's been a lot of progress in fine-grained visual categorisation, the recognition of - and distinguishing between - categories that look very similar. ‘What's really exciting about Birdsnap is that not only does it do well at identifying species, but it can also identify which parts of the bird the algorithm uses to identify each species. ‘Birdsnap then automatically annotates images of the bird to show these distinctive parts - birders call them “field marks” - so the user can learn what to look for.’ The team is also using the fact that smartphone cameras embed the date and location in their images to improve classification accuracy. They have designed a system that can pinpoint which birds are arriving, departing, or migrating. The scientists hope to add the ability to recognise bird songs in the future as well as creating ‘smart’ binoculars that use this artificial intelligence technology to identify and tag species within the field of view.

"A group of 20-year-old hoons have been forced to scrub tyre marks off the road after business owners caught them doing burnouts in front of their shop. The young men were caught red-handed  when the general manager of Territory Marine in Yarrawonga, east of Darwin, heard them screeching up the street late on Friday night. Fed up with the destruction hoons regularly cause in the area, the business owner and his colleague set out after the five men. The five young men caught doing burnouts in Yarrawonga, east of Darwin, on Friday night were forced by a business owner to scrub the road . 'They came and did a couple of burnouts that night all around the area. It happens regularly because we're in an industrial area,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We just had enough, it's made a really mess of the street. We've spent a lot of money making this area look nice.' The owner asked several people in the area if they knew anything about the hoons whereabouts and they were led directly to a nearby shed. 'People pointed us in the right direction... one of the guys was parked outside the shed and you could still smell the rubber,' he said. While he didn't want to elaborate on exactly what was said, the owner told the young men he didn't appreciate the burnouts and told them to come back at 9am ready to clean. 'I knew they would show up and at 9am they did,' he said. 'We made them come back and spend 2.5 hours cleaning in the sun on their knees with kerosene and scrub pads. 'After 2.5 hours, they apologised again and we made them pay for the cleaning stuff.' The owner said he's never tried a direct approach like before, but will do it again in a heartbeat. 'I'm pretty confident these guys won't be back. They've learnt their lesson,' he said.

"A man has died after drinking a massive overdose of liquid crystal meth after mistaking it for a health drink. Romano Dias, 55, had been given a bottle of what appeared to be a fruit-based drink by his daughter Katee, who had found it in a package delivered to her home. After downing about half a glass of the liquid he immediately began to feel ill and died shortly afterwards. Police say that finding the drug in the . UK is very unusual, but crystal meth has been brought to the public's . attention by the multi award-winning TV show Breaking Bad. An image from Breaking Bad: Romano Dias, 55, drank about half a glass of the £34,000 liquid after it was delivered to his daughter's house . Mr Dias’s partner Debra Dulson said in a statement that he had opened the bottle and found a cork under the cap. She said he took a mouthful of the drink and had said that it tasted 'awful' before complaining that his throat was burning. He then said: 'I am in trouble here. I am dying, I am dead.' Analysis of the bottle, which had been labelled as a health drink, showed it contained £34,000 of pure methamphetamine. An illegal crystal meth laboratory. The picture shows the liquid form of the drug, which killed Mr Dias . The drug, commonly known as crystal meth, is an extremely strong amphetemine that is normally smoked, snorted or injected. An . inquest heard that the package had been delivered to Katee Dias’s home . in London. It showed the correct address but the wrong name. She took the parcel in, thinking someone would collect it and kept it for six months before opening the package and finding the bottle. Much later she passed it on to her father. Detective Inspector Ian Simmons told Huntington Coroners Court: 'The £34,000 is a significant amount. 'I would say it is highly likely it was destined for a dealer. 'It is unique, this is not an event that happens in Cambridgeshire or elsewhere.' He said that crystal meth was a drug police 'rarely encounter' in Cambridgeshire. DI Simmons said Mr Dias of Impington, . Cambridgeshire and his family had not been connected with the drug in . any way, adding: 'This was a completely unaccountable and unforseen . chain of events.' He said it was his professional opinion that the bottle had been part of a plan to bring Class A drugs into the UK. The package had been delivered up to three years ago and the wrappings had been destroyed, limiting the police investigation. Coroner William Morris said: 'This is a dreadful case.' He . said he had been considering a verdict of unlawful killing, but there . had been no evidence that whoever put the drug in the bottle intended . any harm to Mr Dias or anyone else. Mr Morris concluded that Mr Dias’ death had been accidental. Walter White and Jessie Pinkman, played by Bryan Cranston (left) and Aaron Paul (right) 'cook' crystal meth in the award-winning TV series Breaking Bad . Crystal meth, which is the street name for methamphetamine, is not widely available in the UK. But the drug, which was used by one million Americans in 2011, came into the public consciousness with the TV show Breaking Bad. Starring Aaron Paul and Bryan Cranston, Breaking Bad tells the story of Walter White, a mild-mannered science teacher who uses his knowledge of chemistry to create a crystal meth empire following a cancer diagnosis. Aaron Paul (left) and Bryan Cranston (right) star in Breaking Bad. The show has brought crystal meth into the public consciouness . The drug is generally odourless and looks like a white crystalline powder, although some forms have strong ammonia smell, because of solvents used to make it . Taking the substance, in any of its forms, increases arousal in nervous system and pumps up levels of norepinephrine and dopamine . At low doses crystal meth boosts alertness and blocks hunger and fatigue. Higher doses of the drug causes exhilaration and euphoria and very high doses cause agitation and paranoia. Side effects include anxiety, emotional swings, and paranoia and there is a risk of fever, convulsions, and falling into a coma. Death can result from burst blood vessels in the brain (triggered by spikes in blood pressure) or heart failure . The high from the drug tends to last 4-12 hours with users continuing to take the drug for days - sometimes addicts stay awake for days, eat very little and experience a heightened state of arousal.","Romano Dias, 55, was given bottle of what appeared to be a fruit-based drink by his daughter .

"Police officers are the second-biggest killers in the state of Utah, outpacing gang members and drug-dealers, a new report found. Law enforcement in the state killed have 45 people since October 2010, second only to domestic violence, according to the Salt Lake Tribune. The death count - 15 per cent of all homicides in that time - puts them ahead of gang and drug-related violence and child abuse. In 2014 alone, 13 people have been killed by officers. Killings: Police in Utah are responsible for 45 deaths since 2010, a new report found. Pictured are Utah Highway patrol training with grenade launchers near Camp Williams . Of the 45 cases where an officer killer somebody, only one made it to court. Officers in West Valley City shot dead Danielle Willard after catching her buying drugs. The district attorney pressed charged, but they were thrown out by a judge. The other 44 deaths were not deemed worthy of criminal charges by local prosecutors. The Tribune's study - based on news reports, public documents and official crime statistics - has sparked calls for reform in officer training and a potential changes to rules about when police use deadly force. Justice professor Robert Wadman, of Weber State University, told the Tribune: 'Sometimes the line between ""is it legal?"" and ""is it necessary?"" becomes difficult to distinguish. Necessary? Questions have been raised over how officers are using their right to deadly force. Pictured above is a SWAT team responding to a gunman in 1999 . 'In the judgment of the officer: ""Is my life in jeopardy? Yes."" At that point in time, they’re legally grounded in using deadly force. But the question is, is it necessary? That’s something that needs to be firmly addressed, for example, in training.' However, a spokesman for Utah's police union said the deaths are a result of deadly situations officers are put in, and that it is criminals' responsibility not to make officers shoot them.

"The Cheney family's public infighting over the issue of same-sex marriage heated up Sunday as Mary Cheney and her wife Heather Poe took to Facebook to air their grievances with Mary's Senate candidate sister Liz Cheney. Dick Cheney's daughter Liz Cheney is trying to unseat an incumbent Republican Senator in Wyoming and drew ire from her family after after reaffirming her opposition to same-sex marriage on Fox New Sunday. 'I was watching my sister-in-law on Fox News Sunday (yes Liz, in fifteen states and the District of Columbia you are my sister-in-law),' Poe wrote after the interview. 'And was very disappointed to hear her say 'I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage.' Not backing down: Liz Cheney reasserted her stance against gay marriage in November despite having a legally-married lesbian sister . Liz Cheney's comment came after she addressed accusations that she is a 'flip-flopper' on the issue since she supports giving the choice to the states rather than an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. That bit of hedging was not enough for Poe. 'I can't help but wonder how Liz would feel if as she moved from state to state, she discovered that her family was protected in one but not the other,' Poe wrote. Poe said that her sister-in-law 'didn't hesitate' to congratulate she and Mary on their marriage and called Liz's comments 'offensive to say the least.' Cheney in-fighting? Heather Poe took to Facebook to address comments her Senate candidate sister-in-law, Dick Cheney's daughter Liz, made opposing same-sex marriage . No happy: Mary Cheney (right) and her wife Heather Poe have publicly shamed Liz Cheney for campaign message against gay marriage as she seeks a Senate seat in ultra-conservative Wyoming . 'I always thought freedom meant freedom for EVERYONE,' Poe wrote. It wasn't long before Mary Cheney picked up the story and gave her thoughts on Facebook. 'Couldn't have said it better myself,' Mary Cheney wrote after sharing her wife's post. 'Liz - this isn't just an issue on which we disagree - you're just wrong - and on the wrong side of history.' This isn't the first time Cheney has made her feelings about her sister known publicly. In September, Cheney called her candidate sister's stance on gay married 'dead wrong' in a Facebook post. 'For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage. Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families - regardless of how they look or how they are made - all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other.' Liz Cheney addressed the longstanding argument with her sister on Fox News, calling it an issue 'on which we disagree'. Cheney's strong stance on the issue of . gay marriage may have to do with her fight to win the senate race in . ultra-conservative Wyoming. ‘I am not pro-gay marriage,’ Cheney previously said in a statement released by her campaign. Cheney announced her run for senate against incumbent Republican Senator Mike Enzi earlier this year. ‘I . believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states,’ the . statement continued, ‘and by the people in the states, not by judges and . not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.’ 'You're just wrong': Mary Cheney publicly affirmed her wife's remarks against Liz Cheney as part of a rare glimpse at the usually tight, clanish Cheney family's disagreements . Sisters at war: The Wyoming candidate for senate Liz Cheney, left, announced her staunch opposition to gay marriage angering her gay married sister, Mary Cheney, right . Daughter: Ms Cheney, the eldest daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, left, had begun telling associates of her decision over the weekend, CNN reported late Sunday . Push back? Liz Cheney claims her opponent Mike Enzi is conducting a push poll campaign that asks voters 'Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?' This stance is also a slight departure for the candidate in regards to her high profile family. Since as far back as 2004, Dick Cheney has maintained a pro-gay marriage stance. ‘Lynne and I have a gay daughter, so it’s an issue our family is very familiar with,’ Cheney told an audience that included his daughter while stumping in Iowa in 2004. ‘With the respect to the question of relationships, my general view is freedom means freedom for everyone. People ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to.’","'This is just an issue on which we disagree': Liz Cheney said today that she 'believes in the traditional definition of marriage'

"A never-before-seen videotape from a . county jail reveals how an inmate, being held on a minor charge, was . ignored by guards shortly before he died from a food allergy. Michael Saffioti, 22, turned himself into the Snohomish County Jail in Washington state over a marijuana possession charge on July 2 last year and was dead less than 24 hours later. Saffioti died from a severe allergic reaction despite being reassured by prison guards that his breakfast was suitable for his allergies. The footage, obtained by KIRO7, shows Mr Saffioti questioning the breakfast tray that he has been given at the jail on the morning of July 3. Scroll down for video for the prison . A medic tries to resuscitate 22-year-old Michael Saffioti after he was found unconscious in his cell on July 3 last year. He had explained to guards he had severe daily allergies beforehand . Tragic: Michael Saffioti, 22, who suffered from severe food allergies and asthma, died from an allergic reaction while spending the night in prison for a misdemeanour offense . The 22-year-old had been in the jail before, so authorities had a record of his extreme dairy allergies. Cheryl Snow, the attorney for Saffioti's mother, Rose told KIRO7: 'We know that he asked questions and made inquiries and he was assured the oatmeal in the food was safe for eating.' The attorney said she was forced to file a complaint to see the video after authorities originally claimed that it did not exist. The tape shows that within minutes, Michael Saffioti asks to use his inhaler and, according to the lawsuit, asks to see a nurse. He is returned to his cell where he allegedly presses the call button but is ignored. The 22-year-old is found unconscious 35 minutes later and dragged out for nurses to perform CPR. He is rushed to hospital but pronounced dead. An . autopsy report from the Snohomish County medical examiner revealed that . Michael Saffioti died from bronchial asthma triggered by the . consumption of dairy. His mother Rose Saffioti, has brought a $10million wrongful death suit against the county. The 22-year-old, who turned himself into the jail over a minor marijuana possession charge, is seen on camera asking a guard if the breakfast tray is safe for him to eat because of his sever dairy allergies . When the 22-year-old turned himself . in to police last July, Mrs Saffioti assured him it was the right thing . to do, and that he would be out the next day. Mrs Saffioti told The Herald last year that despite reassurances that the prison staff would take his medical needs into consideration, her son was scared. ‘He said, “Mom, I have a bad feeling that they are not going to take me seriously.”’ The mother, from Mukiteo, Washington, . said that her son brought along a bag of medications needed to control . his allergies and asthma, and he had expected to be placed in the jail's . medical unit. Instead, he was placed in the general population. Mrs Saffioti received a call the next morning to inform her that her son was dead. She said that she has spoken with other inmates who were there. Many of them knew her son, and called him ‘Bubble Boy’ because of his debilitating allergy to dairy. Mrs Saffioti believes the cause might have been what he was served for breakfast on July 3 – oatmeal with milk, and that her son’s death could have been prevented. Outraged: His mother, Rose Saffioti, pictured, is now suing the county for her son's wrongful death .","Michael Saffioti, 22, turned himself in to police on July 2 last year for misdemeanour marijuana charge .

"A young auditor from Texas sent her entire team an 'I quit' email full of hashtags that accused her coworkers of being fake. In a long email sent on Monday last week, Glory told her PricewaterhouseCoopers colleagues auditing is 'for people who truly don't have any other options'. The message, titled Farewell and QUEEN BEY ALL DAY! singled out individual employees for criticism and ended with a rant about how Beyonce trumps Britney Spears. Scroll down for video . 'I quit': Auditor Glory resigned from her job in a ranting email that quickly went viral . At first her resignation sounded regular, with Glory writing: 'After careful consideration I will be ending my employment with PwC,' according to Gawker. But as the letter, and quantity of hashtags continued, the auditor criticized her colleagues for faking an interest in a job that involves 'filling out useless workpapers that won't really benefit anybody'. 'After asking dozens upon dozens of . auditors what they think of their jobs and getting responses that . include ""I love my job!"" or ""I wouldn't trade it for the world,"" I . realized just how fake auditors can be,' Glory wrote. In the letter that she wrote from her bed, she went on to offer some pointers to her colleagues, including 'get a real career that has meaning', and calling for an end to coach and partner meetings that she described, in a series of hashtags as: '#thatishissoawkward #icantdeal #soforced . #fakeconvosforfakeauditors #noidontwanttogazeintoyoureyesatatablefortwo . #waytoointimateformytaste'. A week after resigning, Glory said she . had no regrets. In an interview with Noir CPA she said: 'I'm not going . to sit here and worry about potential negative effects in my life.' In her letter, the young professional who had a background in finance, including two internships, hit back at those who arrived early and stayed late when partners were in town, and treated them like royalty. 'The reality is, THEY'RE NOT! They are average Joe's like you and I, only their pockets are a little bigger,' she said. The email then became more personal, as Glory singled out colleagues for individual criticism, berating them for going on about how stressed they are, talking about their home lives and giving Glory 'the side eye'. The first team member, whose name was redacted from copies of the email that quickly went viral, was singled out for 'constantly trying to throw me under the bus'. 'Everyday we suffer from hearing this ish . as well as listening to your countless stories about your girlfriend,' Glory wrote. 'You're such a gossiper that sometimes I think you're more feminine then . you appear. Who does that? You're a grown man, get your life!' For good measure she threw in a handful of hashtags for the male employee, including: '#yourlifesucksandyouclearlyknowit' and  '#someoneneedstheirvagwaxed #ohwaityoudonthaveone'.] . Daily grind: The New York offices of PriceWaterhouseCoopers. The day-to-day reality of being an auditor at one of their offices sparked a spectacular resignation email from Glory . Another coworker was berated for . giving her the 'side eye', with Glory writing to her: 'I think those . eyeballs need some readjusting. Girl, stop!' With the last colleague to come in for criticism, Glory wrote: 'Where do I start? You hate yourself and your job, let's be honest.' She added: 'Your cat doesn't care about you so stop caring about it. Stories about your nasty cat are unbearable.' The rant ended with a list of ten reasons why Beyonce is a better performer than Britney Spears, before signing off with: 'Beyonce wins and now that I'm I'm out of here, I win too!!! #doingtheharlemshakeasitype'. Since writing the letter, Glory said she has had some positive responses from people thanking her for 'giving them a voice'. But the email also attracted negative and, in some cases, racist responses as commentators accused Glory of being a 'diversity hire'. 'I was definitely very shocked by how many racist people there still are,' she said, adding that claims she had been a 'diversity hire' were absurd. The accounting graduate doesn't believe the letter will affect future employment, and said: 'I sent the email and didn't look back.'

"His actions have touched many across the world and revitalised the Catholic church . But for Pope Francis, comforting this stricken man after today's weekly audience in St Peter's Square was another simple act of compassion. In scenes strikingly similar to his encounter with the disfigured Vinicio Riva two weeks before, the pontiff first spoke with the worshipper and then put his arms around him, blessing him. The man's identity is not known, nor are the details of what caused such terrible damage to his face. Pope Francis may have been sneaking out of the Vatican at night to give money to the poor on the streets of Rome. Here he is pictured after his weekly Papal audience in St. Peter's Square blessing a severely disfigured man . Together in prayer: The Pope and the disabled man shared a private moment where Francis I gestured up to the sky . Personal connection: Pope Francis  leant in to hug and kiss the man and give him his blessing at the end of his audience in the Vatican today . However, his delight at spending a few moments in the presence of the leader of the Catholic church can be imagined. Francis, formerly Jorge Bergoglio, only took office eight months ago but his his iconoclastic style has already had a huge impact on the faithful. He has made personal calls to distraught worshippers, invited the homeless to dine at St Peter's Square and washed the feet of young offenders. However, it was a meeting with Mr Riva, who is covered in growths caused by the incurable condition neorofibromatosis, which moved many to tears. Bringer of joy: Pope Francis has made a habit of dedicating time to greet and bless sick or disabled people at the end of the general audience . The Pope, once again in St Peter's . Square for his general audience, put his hands on the 53-year-old . Italian man, kissed, hugged and prayed with him. Speaking earlier this week, Mr Riva said the pontiff's hug was 'like paradise', adding: 'He didn't even think about whether or not to hug me. 'I'm . not contagious, but he didn't know that. But he just did it: he . caressed me all over my face, and as he did I felt only love.' Mr Riva . recollected: 'He came down from the altar to see the sick people. He . embraced me without saying a word. I felt as though my heart was leaving . my body. 'He was completely silent but sometimes you can say more when you say nothing.' 'First, . I kissed his hand while with the other hand he caressed my head and . wounds. Then he drew me to him in a strong embrace, kissing my face. Act of kindness: Pope Francis (left) comforted Vinicio Riva, a 52-year-old Italian who had travelled to Rome for a audience in Saint Peter's Square in November . Painful: Vinicio Riva with a picture of his late mother Rosaria, who suffered from the same condition he does . This weekend the Pope offered 'boxes of mercy' to pilgrims in St Peter's square. Some 20,000 boxes, designed to look like a packet of painkillers, were illustrated with a human heart and contained a rosary. Addressing the crowd in ST Peter's Square the Pontiff said: 'I now want to suggest a medicine. ""What"" you ask, ""the pope is now a pharmacist?""' The instruction leaflet, available in several languages read: 'Can be used once a day, but in case of emergency can be taken as much as the soul needs. 'My . head was against his chest his arms were wrapped around me. It lasted . just over a minute, but to me it seemed like an eternity.' Earlier this year, Francis tweeted . to his 3.2million followers: ’The Pope must serve all people, especially . the poor, the weak, the vulnerable.’ The so-called 'Pope Francis Effect' has been credited with a 20 per cent rise in Catholic congregations in Britain, and similar boosts around the world. New . and lapsed Catholics are surging back to the confession box 'by the . hundreds or thousands', according to the Italian Centre for Studies of . New Religions. In Italy half of priests have noted a marked rise in support for the church. The . Italian opinion poll Opinioni reported this week that more than four in . five Italians have a 'positive' or 'extremely positive' opinion of the . Pope. Spain, which had been . experiencing a decades-long slump, has also seen attendance figures . begin to climb since the pontiff's appointment. Catholic leaders in France, the USA and Latin America have also reported growth in the numbers of churchgoing Catholics. And . Latin America - already the biggest single source of Catholic pilgrims . to Italy - saw numbers of pilgrims to the centre of the faith rise by 20 . per cent from the same period last year .","Pope Francis paused during his weekly audience to greet disfigured man .

"Glamorous Russian spy Anna Chapman has been deployed in the propaganda war for respect of Vladimir Putin's forces and the annexation of Crimea, MailOnline can reveal. The 32-year-old foreign intelligence agent donned military uniform and was allowed to go on manoeuvres in make-up with a top tank division that Ukraine has claimed was spotted helping the rebels in Crimea. In a revealing programme for Russian channel Ren TV, she went behind the scenes with the army, which is facing Western accusations of secret military involvement in Ukraine, in a report evidently aimed at boosting respect for Putin's military machine. Scroll down for video . Tank girl! Chapman atop a T80 of the Kantemirovskaya division - which Ukraine said was recently spotted entering the disputed territories in support of rebels . Goosestep: Chapman leads the march in the propaganda war in support of Putin's ambitions in Crimea . Knife through the heart: Chapman showed off the techniques she had been taught at the base . Proud: Chapman brandished a Kalashnikov, pointing out how it was the most reliable rifle ever made . During the documentary, she rode in a T80 tank, honed her spying skills by brandishing a Kalashnikov, and showed viewers how to kill with a knife during a visit to the base of a famous division. 'It's almost 6 am and 3,000 handsome men are still sleeping,' she whispered. 'I am very lucky to be at the heart of my motherland's army. It's a very special day for me.' Chapman added breathlessly: 'I'm so excited about getting the uniform. Is it the famous uniform designed by Valentin Yudashkin (a well-known Russian fashion designer)? Will it suit me? I will have to wear this for the entire day. 'I was fighting to keep my make-up on. Eventually, they let me wear it - although this is hugely untypical. If I was a soldier in the regular army I would not have the right to put on lipstick.' But she is surprised at the modern facilities of the Kantemirovskaya division, which she said was named personally by Stalin after the scene of a bloody Second World War battle close to the River Don. This month Ukraine claims that the division's tanks were deployed in rebel-held Lugansk region in defiance of international law. 'You know, I'm amazed they have hot water here. Until five minutes ago, I was sure all of our soldiers wash their face with cold water,' she said after inspecting the soldiers' living conditions in their barracks. Killer shot: Chapman said she had to fight to be able to wear make-up during the filming of the documentary . Symbolism: Chapman crowed about how three countries have put the Kalashnikov on their flag . Secrets: Chapman breathlessly talked of the sense of danger as she was deployed with the tanks division on tactical training - making comparisons to her time as a spy in the United States . Special: 'I am very lucky to be at the heart of my motherland's army. It's a very special day for me,' she said . The barracks were 'not a hotel, but still quite cosy', she said. Flame-haired Chapman has made a fortune in Moscow since being unmasked by the FBI in 2010 as part of an undercover espionage network inside America. She and other 'illegal spies' were sent back home in a Cold War-style spy swap. After her exposure as a Russian agent she was also stripped of her British passport, but since returning to Moscow she has carved out a lucrative new career as a TV presenter and owner of a fashion brand soon to open its second outlet in Moscow. During the broadcast - first aired in March at the height of the tensions with Ukraine but only unearthed today - she also told viewers she was surprised to learn that 'a Russian private gets almost 4,500 calories a day. This is twice more than a woman should eat to keep fit. 'By the way, it is more than in German, French or American army, where the daily intake shouldn't exceed 3,600 calories. Our soldiers are better fed. 'I'm starving. However, in the American army they fight obesity. The Kantemirovskaya division fighters don't have this problem. Everyone here looks as is they were hand-picked.' She trumpets the high quality food available to soldiers after the budget for the army was significantly boosted by Putin. 'As the saying goes, you can postpone a war but never a lunch,' she said. 'To be honest, after everything I heard about the army, I was expecting to see barley porridge and not so much choice: two different sorts of soup, cutlets or goulash.' She was 'all but dizzy from the multitude of salads. They even have olives.' Approvingly, she added: 'Hold on - a choice between three courses, a salad bar, it's not a canteen, it's a restaurant. I have forgotten I'm in the army.' Chapman - who had been deployed by Russian foreign intelligence in the US - was sent on 'tactical training' with the tank division, part of the former Red Army, she revealed. Does my bum look big in this? Chapman donned thick winter military uniform for the tour of Russian bases . Well fed: The former spy boasted of the food choices the Russian soldiers had - and sniped at how the US army is having to fight obesity among its servicemen . Modern: Chapman goes on at length about the state-of-the-art facilities that Russian troops now enjoy . Dear Leader: The programme pointed out the huge boost in funding Putin had given to Russia's armed forces . Cold war: The 32-year-old was pleasantly surprised to discover that the barracks had hot running water . 'Right now we're on the way to our destination. I don't know where is it, I'm a soldier and comply with my orders. 'This is so-called tactical training. It's very much like real life. I can almost feel the danger. 'A spy's code of ethics resembles that of the Japanese samurai. Who wins the battle is not who shoots first, but the one to hits the target. An enemy's bullet decides whether you fail weapons training.' She is shown proudly with Russia's trademark Kalashnikov gun. 'I've got so used to the Kalashnikov gun so much that I don't really want to leave it,' she cooed. 'By the way, the gun is one of the most reliable in all history. 'Did you know that Kalashnikov gun is depicted on the national emblems of three countries? What recognition.' Chapman also headed the panel of judges in the Miss Crimea 2014 beauty contest in September, an event used to highlight Russian patriotism. Its website boasted: 'It is a unique beauty contest taking place in the Russian Federation, in Crimea. Hosting the event (here) affirms the fact that Crimea is part of Russia.' Chapman used the event to select models for her 'patriotic brand' of fashion clothes which seeks specifically Russian suppliers. She will open her second Moscow outlet next month. 'Our company is more successful than a lot of their competitors who have been operating in the market for the past 10 to 20 years,' she said. 'We have the understanding of the market and offer a competitive product.' While little is known of her private life, divorced Anna - once married to an ex-English public schoolboy - recently told viewers she would like a young lover but this was frowned upon in her homeland. 'I don't know any man who has a woman at least five years old than him. It is not accepted here. I myself would like a younger man, but it is not accepted in our country,' she explained. Recently, a man who claimed to have met Chapman at a fashion show in New York shortly before she was arrested, said: 'A close friend organised the show, so he made me sit at the best corner table there. I figured she might have thought I was a VIP, so before long, she was next to me chatting me up. Another front: Chapman was also the lead judge on the Miss Crimea 2014 beauty contest in September . Propaganda: The event was a celebration of Russian patriotism, pushing how Crimea IS part of the federation . Model spy: Since she was thrown out of the US, Chapman has grown rich on being a TV presenter, model and she has also launched her own line of clothing . 'Even though I don't usually go for the Eastern European girls, I found her to be irresistible. 'She was dressed impeccably, oozing charm and sex from every skin pore, confident but very feminine, a great conversationalist. 'No wonder they hired her as a spy. I was hooked in two seconds. 'The people of New York liked her so much, the New York Post wrote: 'Don't send her back to Russia!'","Former spy, 32, visited Russian unit said to be spotted in Ukraine .

"A 26-year-old guy who grew a hipster beard while travelling overseas has revealed how his bushranger facial hair landed him an international modelling contract and over 50,000 Instagram followers. Less than two years after he left his job as a barman and a painter in Sydney’s northern beaches, Chris Perceval from Manly is now getting paid to pose in designer clothes. The heavily-tattooed 6ft 2inch model, who has been turned away from bars and jobs in Sydney because of his distinctive look, told Daily Mail Australia he started growing the beard while living in Croatia for two months in 2013 after a friend told him he’d make a good model. ‘I was then working in a bar in Shoreditch [London] when another model started speaking to me and said “you’ve got this look, you might as well capitalise on it”,’ Chris said. Scroll down for video . Heavily-tattooed 6ft 2inch model Chris Perceval was signed up a top modelling agency last year . While he lived in Sydney he was once turned down for a job because of the tattoos on his knuckles . Before arriving in London Chris had been training to be a cage fighter and he decided to ‘knuckle down’ and get back into shape before he visited a modelling agency. When he did walk through their doors he was ‘signed within a day’. Chris’s biggest fan, his proud father Peter, argued that despite all the new found attention his son has always been a looker. ‘When you see photos without the beard you will see how good looking he is,’ Peter said. ‘I am so proud he’s been able to achieve all this in this very short period of time…. He’s purposefully put this stuff together to achieve what he’s achieved so I can’t knock it,’ he explained. ‘I think it’s a little bit strange, as do a lot of people who know him quite well, but that’s how he’s done it. I’m so proud of him and how his work ethic has changed and he’s really working hard to be successful.’ Asked where Chris gets his looks from, Peter joked: ‘His mother is very tall and I’m extremely good looking.’ Perceval from Manly in Sydney is now getting paid to pose in designer clothes and has 50,000 followers on Instagram . Chris’s biggest fan, his proud father Peter (left), said his son is even better looking without a beard (right) Chris added: ‘He doesn’t like the beard, some people do, some people don’t.' ‘It’s just a trend. I’m happy to have been at the start of the trend it is a bit saturated now,’ he confessed. Chris is considering shaving off his trademark beard once the look is no longer fashionable in Sydney. He will then go back to London to do more work there. ‘I came back to Sydney because I thought it doesn’t really have anyone that looks like me in the market but since I’ve been out here it’s become really popular.’ Chris said although his first few modelling shoots overseas were ‘intense’ he’s ‘always been pretty good at posing’. And he’s been promised that if he shaves off the beard he won’t be dropped by his agencies. ‘My agents are happy for me to cut it off… It would be awkward if they told me not to cut it,’ he laughed. Chris Perceval is now used to mixing with fellow models and famous types such as Russell Brand (right) Chris is considering shaving off his trademark beard once the look is no longer fashionable . Chris got a '21' tattoo on his face because he was born on the 21st of the month . Chris, seen modelling on the front page of a magazine, has been promised that if he shaves off the beard he won’t be dropped by his agencies . Chris shares selfies with his thousands of fans every day and goes to the gym once or twice a day . He one day hopes to model for Calvin Klein and also has aspirations to be an actor . Despite the work and freebies his beard has bought him, there are some downsides to sporting the statement look. ‘You wake up with it everywhere across your face. It can get too floppy or you can’t get the moustache right sometimes. It’s itchy and you’re like “get it off”,’ Chris said. ‘I style it and brush it every day… I guess I’m attached to it now,’ he laughed. Chris plans to return to London in February and hopes to break into acting as well as one day modelling for brands such as Calvin Klein, Fendi and Diesel.

"Daniel Hegglin applied for a High Court injunction after claiming to be the victim of 'extreme internet trolling' but has now settled the case with Google . Google has settle a High Court dispute with a wealthy businessman who said he was a victim of 'extreme internet trolling'. Daniel Hegglin, 53, a former Morgan Stanley banker, had applied for an injunction at the High Court to make the search engine take steps to ensure that abusive material posted about him did not appear in search results. But a lawyer for Mr Hegglin today told a High Court judge that the case had been settled. The abuse, which first surfaced in 2011, included false allegations that he is a murderer, paedophile and Ku Kux Klan member. They appeared on more than 4,000 websites - around half of which are understood to be hosted on Google - and it is believed the material continues to be posted daily. Today, Hugh Tomlinson QC told Mr Justice Jay at a High Court hearing in London that Google had made 'significant efforts' to remove the abusive material. He said: 'This case was brought against Google in order to seek extra assistance to combat a campaign of anonymous and extreme Internet trolling on over 4,000 websites. 'Whilst I am not in a position to disclose the details, I am pleased to report that the parties have now settled the matter. 'The settlement includes significant efforts on Google's part to remove the abusive material from Google hosted websites and from its search results.' Mr Hegglin will now concentrate his energies on bringing the person responsible for this campaign of harassment to justice.' A lawyer representing Google said Mr Hegglin's case was exceptional. 'Google has considerable sympathy for Mr Hegglin in what is an exceptional case of internet trolling in terms of its prominence and volume,' Antony White QC told the judge. 'Google provides search services to millions of people and cannot be responsible for policing internet content. 'It will however continue to apply its procedures that have been developed to assist with the removal of content which breaches applicable local laws.' Mr Hegglin is a Swiss national and currently lives in Hong Kong but built his career over two decades at Morgan Stanley in London. He is married to a British woman and spends 40 days a year in the UK attending to his multiple business interests, which include a non-executive directorship at Puricore plc. The father-of-four claimed that the abuse was damaging his business life and upsetting his family. Google had argued that it already has a system in place to remove individual web addresses (URLs) and that it would be wrong for the court to order it to block the abuse as it appears. The court heard the abusive material appeared on more than 4,000 websites - around half of which are understood to be hosted on Google . It also denied that it should be ordered to remove any material from Google.com, which it claims is the US version of the search website. The company claimed any keyword-based block would have 'disproportionate consequences' by removing innocent search results. Google, whose corporate motto is 'Don't be evil', set aside a budget of £1.68m to fight the case in contrast to Mr Hegglin's budget of just over £600,000. In a hearing shortly before trial, Mr Justice Edis slashed Google's budget on the grounds that it was disproportionate. The five-day trial was set to test whether Google should do more to combat serious cases of 'trolling' and whether European data protection law applies to Google.com as well as local variants like Google.co.uk. Today, Hugh Tomlinson QC told Mr Justice Jay at the High Court in London, pictured, that Google had made 'significant efforts' to remove the abusive material . It follows the recent 'right to be forgotten' decision of the European Court of Justice requiring Google to delete 'inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant' results on request. One example of the trolling campaign is an abusive and unfounded posting containing allegations that he is a paedophile and describing him as a 'Jack the Ripper bastard criminal'.","Daniel Hegglin filed for an injunction to remove abuse from search results .

"Unimpressed: The Rev Sally Hitchiner (pictured), senior chaplain at Brunel University, said spirituality seemed to be taking a back seat in the new format . Broadcasting services from parishes and cathedrals across the country, for more than 50 years Songs of Praise has been much loved as the BBC’s flagship religious programme. But after a relaunch as a magazine-style programme earlier this month in a move to attract a wider audience, loyal viewers have been left feeling it is becoming little more than ‘the One Show with added hymns’. And even the clergy has hit out at the new format, with the Reverend Sally Hitchiner leading calls to bring ‘actual worship’ back into the programme, claiming it no longer felt ‘authentic’ and that spirituality seemed to be taking a backseat. Rev Hitchiner, senior chaplain at Brunel University in West London, tweeted: ‘Thinking of starting a campaign to get #SongsOfPraise to bring back actual worship eg bible reading & prayers...Thora would agree with me!’ She was referring to actress Dame Thora Hird, a committed Christian who presented Songs of Praise spin-off Praise Be! This followed her appearance on Points of View, on which she echoed the concerns of many viewers who remain unimpressed with the new style of the weekly programme. She was one of three clergy to appear on the show, alongside Rev Yemi Adedeji, an Anglican Priest and Pentecostal Pastor, and Fr Alexander Lucie-Smith, a Catholic Parish Priest, who agreed spirituality seemed to take a backseat in the new format. After watching the first new-style episode, Rev Hitchiner said: ‘I think there is a question as to whether or not this is inspiring us to worship or whether it’s just a whole load of nice people doing something in their community - and Songs of Praise should be about worship. ‘I did enjoy it, I think it didn’t feel authentic enough for me though, they need to go further, risk more, to have genuine Christian faith represented because it’s a lifeline for many older people.’ Songs of Praise: The programme (above, in 2005), which has been running for more than 50 years, was relaunched this month as a magazine-style show in a move to attract a wider, non-Anglican audience . These sentiments were echoed by Rev Adedeji, who said: ‘In terms of representation of denomination, expression of type of worship, this has done a great job. But in terms of spirituality you might reconsider that.’ The relaunch took place earlier this month and saw the traditional format of a single Anglican service being recorded dropped in favour of each show featuring a world of locations and denominations, as well as news segments on faith around the world – for example, the first episode included a report on the persecution of Christians in Syria. Aaqil Ahmed, the BBC’s head of religion, has previously explained the move is designed to widen the show’s audience. He said the average Songs of Praise viewer is in their mid-70s - with viewers in their 50s, who would usually ‘replenish’ the older audience, lacking the religious ‘interest and knowledge’ that would attract them to Songs of Praise. Discussion: Rev Hitchiner (centre) was one of three clergy on Points of View, with Rev Yemi Adedeji (left), an Anglican Priest and Pentecostal Pastor, and Fr Alexander Lucie-Smith (right), a Catholic Parish Priest . He said this was in contrast to the congregations at Pentecostal and Catholic churches which are growing due to immigration - and therefore offered a new audience. However, many of the show’s long-term viewers have been left unhappy by the shift. Viewer Joey Knock said that while he liked the inclusion of religious current affairs in the new format, ‘I’m also a bit worried it will turn into the One Show with added hymns’. One contacted Points of View and said: ‘You have spoilt our Sundays. Good job our parents weren’t here to see what you have done to Songs of Praise’, while another added: ‘Does the BBC not realise that for a lot of people this is the only religious experience they can enjoy?’ In response to the concerns, Mr Ahmed told Points of View: ‘Songs of Praise has been going for 54 years and in those 54 years it’s evolved many, many times. At the helm: Songs of Praise presenters Pam Rhodes (left), Aled Jones (centre) and Diane-Louise Jordan . ‘This is just one of many evolutions we’ve seen in the show. Traditional Anglican worship will still be part of it as it always has been. So in that sense I would reassure all our viewers and say give it a chance. ‘With the changes in how Christianity is evolving in this country, with the various different denominations, people coming from abroad, the growth in evangelical Christianity, Alpha, etc, all these things, we felt it was really relevant to get as much of that in one episode each week as possible and make it more accessible to more people on a weekly basis’. Some viewers also jumped in to defend the change, with one telling Points of View: ‘When I heard there were going to be changes I was a little bit concerned because I do so enjoy it but it was wonderful’, and another adding that it was now ‘a better representation of modern Christianity, the different styles of worship and praise’.","Relaunched as magazine-style show for wider, non-Anglican audience .

"A United Methodist pastor was convicted Monday of breaking church law by officiating his own son's same-sex wedding and could be defrocked after a high-profile trial that has rekindled debate over the denomination's policy on same-sex marriage. The Methodist church put the Reverend Frank Schaefer on trial in southeastern Pennsylvania, accusing him of breaking his pastoral vows by presiding over the 2007 ceremony in Massachusetts. The 13-member jury convicted Schaefer on two charges: that he officiated a same-sex wedding and that he showed 'disobedience to the order and discipline of the United Methodist Church.' On trial: Reverend Frank Schaefer returns to the retreat house where a jury of pastors is hearing charges against him for officiating over his son's marriage to another man . The jury will reconvene Tuesday morning for the penalty phase, during which Schaefer faces punishment ranging from a reprimand to losing his ministerial credentials. 'Obviously, I'm very saddened. What we're hoping for tomorrow is a light sentence,' said Schaefer's son, Tim Schaefer, 29, whose wedding led to the charges. Testifying in his own defense, the 51-year-old pastor said he decided to break church rules out of love for his son. He said he might have lost what he called his 'ritual purity' by disobeying the Methodist Book of Discipline, but that he felt he was obeying God's command to minister to everyone. 'I love the United Methodist Church. I've been a minister for almost 20 years and there are so many good things about the United Methodist Church except for that one rule,' said Schaefer, of Lebanon. Schaefer's attorney, the Reverend Robert Coombe, told the jury that Schaefer had simply extended God's love to his son. 'It's important to him to practice in his family what he preached to his congregation,' Coombe said. 'He did this wedding as an act of love and not as an act of rebellion.' Schaefer pleaded not guilty at the beginning of the high-profile trial, which is rekindling debate over the denomination's policy on gay marriage. Innocent: Supporters of Reverend Frank Schaefer sing hymns outside as church officials and members of the jury pool arrive at Camp Innabah Rec Center for the start of Schaefer's trial on Monday . Punished: Schaefer could be defrocked if a jury comprised of fellow Methodist clergy convicts him of breaking his pastoral vows by officiating in 2007, his son's same-sex marriage . The church's lawyer, the Reverend Christopher Fisher, told the jury that Schaefer clearly violated the Book of Discipline. He said the complainant, Jon Boger - a member of Schaefer's congregation - was dismayed and shocked when he learned this year about the ceremony. Fisher used his closing argument to condemn homosexuality as immoral, and said Schaefer had no right to break a Methodist law that bans pastors from performing same-sex marriages just because he disagreed with church teaching. Fisher told jurors they were duty-bound to convict. 'You'll give an account for that at the last day, as we all will,' he told the jury, to audible gasps from spectators. Dozens of Schaefer's supporters stood in silent protest as Fisher spoke, then linked hands and sang 'We Shall Overcome' after the jury left to begin deliberating. Boger, the church's sole witness, testified earlier Monday that he felt betrayed when he found out that Schaefer, who had baptized his children and buried his grandparents, had presided over a gay wedding. A father's love: Reverend Frank Schaefer (right) and his son Tim, whose same-sex wedding he officiated at . 'When pastors take the law of the church in their own hand... it undermines their own credibility as a leader and also undermines the integrity of the church as a whole,' Boger said. He said he understood Schafer's motivation. 'It's his son. He loves his son. In a way I felt bad for him,' Boger said. 'But he's also shown no remorse or repentance, nor has he apologized to anyone.' When Schaefer chose to hide the marriage from the congregation, Boger said, 'It was a lie and a broken covenant.' Preaching love: Rich Kirk from joins other supporters of Reverend Frank Schaefer singing hymns as they gather outside Camp Innabah Rec Center on Monday . Deciders: Church officials and members of the jury pool arrive at Camp Innabah Rec Center for start of Reverend Frank Schaefer trial . But Schaefer testified he had informed his church superiors of his part in the marriage. He said he kept it from his conservative church's congregation because it would be divisive. 'I did not want to make this a protest about the doctrine of the church. I wasn't trying to be an advocate,' Schaefer said. 'I just wanted this to be a beautiful family affair, and it was that.' Schaefer faced no discipline until April - less than a month before the church's six-year statute of limitations was set to expire - when Boger filed a complaint. The nation's largest mainline Protestant denomination accepts gay and lesbian members, but it rejects the practice of homosexuality as 'incompatible with Christian teaching.' Schaefer's son Tim Schaefer came out to his parents at age 17, revealing he had contemplated suicide over his struggle with sexual identity and the church's stance on homosexuality. Law or love: Tim Schaefer (right), asked his father Frank Schaefer (left) to marry him and his partner . 'He had heard messages that were hateful from the church, from the culture around him, that told him you're not normal, you're not valid, you're a freak,' Schaefer testified. The pastor said he and his wife told their son he was a 'beloved child of God.' Years later, Tim Schaefer asked his father to marry him. 'To say no to his request would have negated all the affirmations I gave him over the years,' he said. The trial was being held at a Methodist retreat about 60 miles east of his church. Schaefer could have avoided a trial if he had agreed to never again perform a same-gender wedding, but he declined because three of his four children are gay. Supporters of Schaefer held signs and sang hymns outside the trial wearing rainbow stoles, holding signs and singing hymns. 'I'm in support of the church becoming a new church that welcomes everyone,' Bunnie Bryant, 64, told the Lebanon Daily News. She was holding a sign that said: 'Law or love? Jesus chose love.'She added, 'I question the church's law trumping a father's love.'","In 2007, Reverend Frank Schaefer officiated at the wedding of his son and his male partner .

"A desperate man was told by a 999 call handler that it wasn’t possible to ‘magic an ambulance’ as he watched his fiancee dying in front of him. Colin Gash, 53, pleaded with emergency services over three separate calls – all the while Violet Alliston was crying out as she coughed up blood. Despite 57-year-old Miss Alliston’s condition deteriorating rapidly, Mr Gash was also told: ‘We don’t have ambulances waiting on street corners.' Anger: Colin Gash is suing the NHS after a 999 call handler told him the service couldn't 'magic an ambulance'. He was calling in a distressed state as his partner Violet Alliston (right) lay dying . And a call handler wrongly deemed the family home to be a threatening environment because they could hear Miss Alliston’s two distressed sons who have learning difficulties. Three ambulances were redirected from attending the family home, and when a fourth finally turned up after 40 minutes, it was too late to save her. Her family later found out that she had unknowingly been suffering from cervical cancer. Mr Gash said: ‘The way we were treated was just diabolical. It was like we were just a number, not human beings. ‘Because of what happened we didn’t even get the chance to say goodbye to her.’ He has now launched a clinical negligence case against the North East Ambulance Service. Mr Gash said he was left in disbelief as the tragedy unfolded in June when the operator said that an ambulance could not be sent because raised voices could be heard in the house. It was in fact the sound of Miss Alliston’s two sons, Shaun, 34, and Dean, 32, who were shouting due to their inability to summon any help. Death: Ms Alliston was in her home in Bishop Auckland when she was struck with severe pain . At one stage an ambulance was only five minutes from the house in Bishop Auckland, Durham, but a call handler told Mr Gash that she ‘couldn’t magic [it] to come straight away’. An investigation found that the first ambulance dispatched to the scene had been stood down, while another was rerouted to a higher priority case. A third was redirected for refuelling, with a St John Ambulance eventually arriving at the family home. An investigation by the trust found that the call handler wrongly deciphered the frustration at the scene as aggression and also failed to confirm Miss Alliston’s level of consciousness. Interim chief executive Roger French wrote in the report that the call handler 'responded inappropriately' and 'showed a lack of empathy' to the family. He added: 'The patient was clearly critically ill and they displayed this fear by shouting and swearing. The patient's son was calmed when advised that an ambulance was travelling. 'The call handler made a decision to categorise the call as unsuitable for a rapid response paramedic, believing the scene to be potentially unsafe for a lone worker. 'This resulted in the rapid response paramedic being instructed to leave the scene shortly after arrival.' The report added the 999 call handler also failed to confirm whether Ms Alliston was conscious, even after being given information which suggested she could have passed out. 'The call handler failed to confirm what the main concern was and chose to triage the abdominal pain regardless,' the report said. Bolton-based Asons Solicitors are now representing Mr Gash in a claim against the NHS. Mr French wrote: 'It was agreed that the call handler failed to achieve a satisfactory level of performance and had not carried out their duties to the standards required. 'As a result the call handler has been referred to be dealt with under the Trust's Capability Policy with the aim to improve the level of service provided.' He added procedures had been 'reinforced' throughout the department and the investigation had been shared with the North of England Commissioning Support Unit. County Durham coroner Andrew Tweddle has cancelled an inquest because Ms Alliston's death was due to natural causes. In a statement, Yvonne Ormston, chief executive of North East Ambulance Service, said: ‘The Trust identified concerns with the quality of the 999 call and launched an internal investigation. ‘A number of errors were identified and for that the Trust would like to again apologise unreservedly to the family, as well as offering reassurances that lessons have been learnt.’ But Mr Gash, who had planned to marry his partner last month, said: ‘You would expect somebody doing that kind of job to be experienced and to their job properly. 9.38am - First 999 call .

She told MailOnline: 'We've had many complaints about the North East Ambulance Service in recent months and I'm very sorry to hear about what happened to Ms Alliston. 'It's clear to me that there is a serious problem in the management of the North East Ambulance Service from the number of complaints I've been getting. 'This case is particularly bad but long waits are a big problem. Another problem is the unhelpfulness of call handlers on the telephone. 'Obviously there is a resource problem.

"In the era of social networking sites, it has become common practice to tailor our photos so we come across in a certain way. But now there's a whole new audience that 'selfie' fans need to take into consideration. Big brands have started using state-of-the-art computer software to scan the swathes of photos posted on sites such as Instagram for clues about their prospective customers. Companies such as Coca-Cola  are using a new image recognition software to track their logos - as well as 2,500 other 'details' - in the 1.8billion photos that flood social networking sites each day. Scroll down for video . A new image recognition software scans billions of photos posted online to allow brands to see how, where and when their products are being used by customers and how it links to other brands . The software even gives brands the power to see if the customer is happy with the product - by reading and analysing the facial expressions of those in the photos. The program, created by Ditto Labs in Massachusetts, also 'reads' the background, the person's clothing and even the location of the photo in a bid to glean as much information as possible as the customer and how they view the product or brand. The wealth of information is then used to set up a profile which spells out exactly how that customer should be targeted by advertisers. The pioneering software is a dream for marketing firms, allowing them to carry out extensive research while barely lifting a finger. But liberty rights campaigners have warned the process goes 'far beyond' what most users should expect and that companies should seek  permission before passing on the information to third parties. Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, a campaign group set up to challenge policies which it believes threatens privacy, told MailOnline: 'Social media companies are well within their rights to scan photos for marketing purposes, which will certainly come as a surprise to many users. 'We are all very used to receiving targeted adverts based on the information we provide about ourselves online, whether that be via our emails or status updates, but scanning our photos for logos and certain backdrops will go far beyond what many would expect companies to do with the photos we post. The website shows how the Ditto software scans photos of a range of brands so companies can garner information about prospective customers . 'If companies want to use our data in this way, explicit permission should be sought. It is also only right that users ask for complete transparency about what data will be collected, analysed and who it will be sold on to.' The program - which computer scientists began creating more than a decade ago - is already being used by brands owned by Procter & Gamble, which handles hair care company Pantene and Oral-B. Other brands  include Adidas, which, through the program, discovered that 13 per cent of its 'Adidas population' are also interested in Justin Bieber. Ditto - which also has companies such as Colgate and Cadbury's within its portfolio - has also already worked with Budweiser, helping it find that beer drinking generally peaks at 11pm. According to Ditto, the software 'unlocks brand data hidden inside the millions of photos uploaded each day' in a bid to 'discover photos with brands and make those photos actionable for marketers'. The proprietary logo detection engine within the software is trained to scan for up to 2,500 details in each photo - ranging from brand logos to fabric patterns. The software also uses geocoding information - which uses longitude and latitude statistics - to find where the image has been taken. The program then uses an interface to access information about who posts images with the logo, by analysing faces in the image and their 'corresponding facial mood score (FMS)'. The software works across a range of social media platforms, including Instagram, Twitter and Tumblr. David Rose, chief executive, told The Times that the primary use of the software was 'listening', adding: 'So they know how the product packaging should be changed or who they should be aligning with for sponsorship. 'Say that you're Manchester United. How does Man U make a good case for bringing in new sponsorship? They can look at photos of people in Man U branded clothing and see what other brands appear.' According to the site, the software 'unlocks brand data hidden inside the millions of photos uploaded each day'. It claims to identify brands in every photo to 'make those photos actionable for marketers'. The website explains that the company's 'proprietary computer vision' is trained to scan for 2,500 details in each photo, ranging from brand logos to fabric patterns. The software can also detect where the photo is taken by using geocoding information. The geocoding uses longitude and latitude statistics to locate the exact position of the camera. The company describes how the software can also 'access information about who posts images with your logo' by tracking 'faces in the image and their corresponding facial mood score (FMS)'. Earlier this year, a team of Google researchers developed an advanced image classification and detection program called GoogLeNet . The programme can locate and distinguish between a range of object sizes within a single image. It can also determine an object within, or on top of, an object, within the photo.

"Ridiculous: Manitoba mother of two Kristen Bartkiw was shocked when she received a $10 fine from her kids' daycare because they're lunch didn't have any Ritz crackers . A Manitoba mom was slapped with a $10 fine because the lunches she packed for her kids’ lunches didn’t have any Ritz crackers. Kristen Bartkiw sent her children Natalie and Logan to daycare with lunches of leftover roast beef, potatoes, carrots, milk, and oranges. The daycare providers evidently didn’t think the wholesome lunch fit the nutritional bill because Bartkiw was subsequently charged for the Ritz crackers that the lunches had to be ‘supplemented’ with. According to Metro News, Manitoba . laws require that daycares provide children with a nutritious meal as . prescribed by the Canadian Food Guide. That means one milk, one meat, one grain, two fruits. But the daycare workers seemed to believe the lunches Bartkiw sent with her kids lacked a grain. They . have certain legislation that they have in place where you have to . follow these food groups, but it doesn’t matter how processed the foods . are or if they’re junk food,’ the 33-year-old Rossburn, Manitoba mom . told Metro News. ‘So Ritz crackers count as a grain.’ Bartkiw . was angry, not just because she fined after sending her kids off with . what seemed like a well-rounded, home cooked meal, but also because she . was actually sitting on the board of the daycare when she was fined. Unbalanced: She got the note, right, because Manitoba law requires that children at daycare be provided with a 'balanced' lunch of one milk, i meat, one grain, and two fruits/vegetables. For each missing item, parents are charged $5 per child . ‘I . phoned the daycare worker and said “you know, potatoes, surely I can . get away with this,” and they didn’t actually end up charging me the . $10,’ she said. The incident actually happened late in 2012, but has only now gained wide media exposure. Now Bartkiw can look back and laugh. At . the time, though, it felt anything but funny and seemed to point to a . major disconnect between what is healthy for kids to eat and legislation . that encourages eating nutritious foods. 'They have certain legislation that they have in place where you have to follow these food groups, but it doesn¿t matter how processed the foods are or if they¿re junk food¿so Ritz crackers count as a grain,' Bartkiw said . 'But it was just the principle of the thing, that it was not considered a healthy lunch that I found ridiculous,' said the mom and teacher who always believed she knew what's best for her kids . ‘You could send microwave Kraft Dinner everyday and that would count as a grain under the guide,’ Bartkiw said. ‘I would encourage parents to not just blindly follow the Canada Food Guide, but really think about eating more real food and not packaged food.’ According to Weighty Matters blog, which first reported her story, Bartkiw says the Canadian province has moved to a hot lunch program in daycares in order to remedy the problem of parents sending less than ‘balanced’ lunches with their kids. She says she likes the new policy much better. 'You could send microwave Kraft Dinner everyday and that would count as a grain': Bartkiw complains that the food guide rules in Manitoba are too easily misconstrued.","Manitoba Canada mom Kristen Bartkiw got a note when her kids came home from school that said her kids' lunches weren't balanced as per Canada Food Guide rules .

"Reform: Campaign groups have urged Home Secretary Theresa May to modify the controversial Public Order Act . Theresa May is being urged to reform a controversial law which bans ‘insulting words or behaviour’ amid mounting evidence that it is strangling free speech. Campaigners say the Public Order Act is being abused by over-zealous police and prosecutors to arrest Christian street preachers, critics of Scientology, gay rights campaigners and even students making jokes. Currently, Section 5 of the 1986 Act outlaws ‘insulting words or behaviour’, but what constitutes ‘insulting’ is unclear and has resulted in a string of controversial arrests. Human rights campaigners, MPs, faith groups and secular organisations have joined forces to have the ‘insulting words or behaviour’ phrase removed from the legislation, arguing that it restricts freedom of speech and penalises campaigners, protesters and even preachers. Former shadow home secretary David Davis, a leading campaigner for civil liberties, said reform was ‘vital to protecting freedom of expression in Britain today’. ‘There is a growing list of examples where the law against using “insulting” language has led to heavy-handed action by police and prosecutors. It is not only distressing for the individuals concerned, it constitutes a threat to Britain’s tradition of free speech,’ he said. ‘Of course nobody likes to be insulted, particularly in public, but nor does anyone have a right not to be insulted. Freedom of speech includes the right to criticise, to ridicule and to offend. It is not the job of the police and the courts to prevent us from having our feelings hurt. ‘The solution is simple: The law needs to change. The word “insulting” should be removed from section 5 of the Public Order Act. This would provide proportionate protection to individuals’ right to free speech, while continuing to protect people from threatening or abusive speech.’ A poll by ComRes, commissioned by campaigners, found 62 per cent of MPs believe it should not be the business of Government to outlaw ‘insults’. Only 17 per cent of MPs believe removing the ‘insult’ clause would undermine the ability of the police to protect the public. In an unlikely alliance, the Christian Institute is joining forces with the National Secular Society to back the campaign, because both organisations are committed to free speech and open debate. Simon Calvert of the Christian Institute said: ‘Britain’s historic civil liberties were often hammered out amid controversy over freedom to preach without state interference. Christians know first hand why free speech is precious and this is why the Christian Institute is pleased to join people across the political and philosophical spectrum to help bring about this simple but important change.’ Madness: An Oxford University Student was locked up after he asked a policeman: 'Do you realise your horse is gay?' Keith Porteous Wood of the National Secular Society said: ‘Secularists, in defending free expression, must ensure that the law is fair to everybody and argue equally for the right of religious and non-religious people to freely criticise and exchange opinions without fear of the law, unless they are inciting violence. Free speech is not free if it is available only to some and not others.’ Others backing the campaign include Big Brother Watch, the Freedom Association and the Peter Tatchell Foundation. Mr Tatchell, a prominent gay rights advocate, said Section 5 was a ‘menace to free speech and the right to protest’. He added: ‘The open exchange of ideas – including unpalatable, even offensive, ideas – is a hallmark of a free and democratic society.’ In October, Home Secretary Mrs May launched a consultation on the Public Order Act, including whether the word ‘insulting’ in Section 5 strikes the right balance between freedom of expression and the right not to be harassed, alarmed or distressed. The consultation closed four months ago, but the Government has yet to set out its views.","Campaigners say Public Order Act is unclear and has resulted in string of controversial arrests .

"Reigning Miss Teen USA has told of the terrifying moment she opened an email that featured naked photographs of herself secretly taken via webcam from a hacker at her school. Cassidy Wolf's interview with Anderson Cooper comes as an international crackdown by the FBI and police in 19 countries has brought more than 90 arrests in what authorities say is a serious strike against 'creepware'. The sweep, a two-year operation, was coordinated so suspects didn't have time to destroy evidence and included the arrest of  Swedish hacker Alex Yucel, a co-creator of Blackshades, the cheap and accessible software used  to hijack computers remotely. Wolf, 19, had been watched for one year by former classmate Jared Abrahams, who had installed Blackshades malware on her laptop and was jailed in March for hacking 100-150 women. 'I didn't realize this could happen': Cassidy Wolf, 19, speaks with Anderson Cooper about her 'sextortion' ordeal on Monday night, after her computer was hacked and a boy from her school secretly watched her via webcam for one year . Bail posted: Jared James Abrahams appears Thursday outside of Santa Ana, CA., court after posting $50,000 bail for his release - screen grab courtesy of NBC Los Angeles . Wolf was sent an email containing a series of photos of herself changing, with Abrahams demanding better-quality photos, video and a five-minute sex show on Skype or he would make the images public, threatening to ruin her beauty pageant chances. 'It was traumatizing,' Wolf told CNN. 'It's your bedroom. That's your most private, intimate space and that's where you should feel the most safe.' Wolf attended school with Abrahams, 19 - who will spend 18 months in jail - in California. Wolf previously told The Today Show that she 'never had . any interactions with him. I went to a very big high school but I knew . of him, I knew of his name, I saw him in the hallways.' She . found herself, 'relieved, glad that they were able to find who the . person is, but on the other hand it was someone I went to high school . with. He he is young, my age, and I just think it's sad that he chose to . do this and has now put himself in this big dilemma.' Wolf said that she has 'mixed emotions' surrounding Abrahams's arrest and feels badly for him. 'I . don’t think he realized the consequences [to the things] that he's . done. He terrorized me and many other girls for so long.' Abrahams, who reportedly confessed to . FBI officials, has now been released on $50,000 bail and remains under . house arrest under the condition that he not use the Internet. His . arrest follows a raid of the Abrahams's home in June when FBI agents . seized computers, cell phones and hacking software, according to court . records. The newly crown Miss Teen USA came forward in August with details of the shocking cyber ordeal. The college freshman said she was speaking out . against so-called 'sextortion' in order to spread the word and teach . other young women to be careful. 'I was terrified,' she said in an August interview with Today. Sextortion: Wolf says the stalker used an anonymous email address and demanded sexual favors or else he'd release nude photos of her to the press . Shock: Cassidy Wolf, from California, was crowned as Miss Teen USA 2013 in the Bahamas . 'I started screaming (when I first got the email), bawling my eyes out. I was on the phone with my . mom, and I felt helpless because I wasn't sure what to do, so it was a . very terrifying moment.' Through an anonymous email address, the cyber stalker attempted to extort Wolf for sexual favors, hence the term 'sextortion.' 'You . would never think somebody would be watching you in your room and this . guy had been,' Wolf said. 'The thought of that just gave me nightmares.' These . were the first details the beauty queen has released on her experience . since she revealed she was the victim of cyber crime just after she was . crowned. But the incident actually occurred four months before Wolf won her current title. 'It happened to me when I was a normal girl and it can happen to anybody,' she said. 'The message is to tell somebody.' Wolf immediately called her mom, who reported the incident to police. The FBI quickly took over the case. The Temecula, California native now travels the country to tell her story and warn other teenagers about cyber-crime. 'The longer it goes on, the worse it will get, so if you can get the word out,' she urged. 'Talk to the authorities.' Beauty queen: Months ahead of the pageant, 19-year-old Wolf (left) was the victim of the cyber-crime . 'I wasn't aware that somebody was . watching me [on my webcam],' she said. 'The light [on the camera] . didn't even go on, so I had no idea.' She would not provide further details of the nature of the photographs, citing the ongoing federal investigation, but told Fox that they captured things you would do 'in the privacy of your own room'. She added the stranger tried to extort her, saying that the photos would then not be leaked. 'You just need to be so extremely careful with what you do online nowadays because you never know what people can be doing to you online,' she told Fox. After she was named Miss California, Miss Wolf traveled to schools near her home in Temecula to talk with students about how to protect themselves from cyber-crimes. During her one-year reign, she hopes to spread her story as a warning to others. 'This next year I'm just so excited to be able to share my story . and raise awareness in young teens about what can happen,' she said. Warning: She now visits local schools to warn others of her story and to give tips in online safety . She said that people can protect themselves by changing their passwords frequently and deleting browsing history regularly. She also suggested putting a sticker over the webcam when it's not being used. Wolf, an avid dancer since the age of two, plans on continuing this work even when she begins classes at the New York Film Academy this year. She said she was 'shocked and overwhelmed' to win the pageant in August after just two years of competing in contests.","The computer of Miss Teen USA Cassidy Wolf was hacked for one year .

"The ask.fm page of a 13-year-old, believed to be  Islamic State terrorist Khaled Sharrouf's daughter, paints a picture of a teen stuck in a war zone, who loves actress Sandra Bullock and the colour pink . A social media page belonging to the teenager daughter of the notorious Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf has given a rare glimpse into their life in Syria with ISIS. The ask.fm page of a 13-year-old girl, who is understood to be Sharrouf's daughter, paints a picture of a family-orientated and religious teenager who loves the actress Sandra Bullock and the colour pink,The Australian reports. Khaled Sharrouf is the known member of terrorist group Islamic State who infamously shared a photograph of his son holding up a decapitated head. He fled Australia for Syria using his brother's passport in December. His Muslim convert wife, Tara Nettleton, and their five children – three boys and two girls – followed Sharrouf by travelling through Malaysia at the beginning of the year. Ten months ago, a 13-year-old who is believed to be Sharrouf's eldest daughter, wrote on her ask.fm profile: 'The best holiday I have eva [sic] had was the one when I travelled to Malaysia for three weeks', before adding in another post, that the 'most fun place' she had ever been to was 'Desa water park in Malaysia'. Another chilling post, that is believed to have been written before the teenager's move to the Middle East, sees the 13-year-old answer the question: 'How would you describe your country in three words?' with: 'beautiful, safe and wonderful'. The theme of safety was repeated when she was asked what the 'most important thing her country had given to the world' was, answering: 'a safe place to live in and no worries'. While images of Sharrouf's sons holding firearms have been brandished on social media in the past, little has been heard of his two daughters . A Twitter page linked to the 13-year-old's ask.fm account posted an image of five men holding weapons and the Islamic State flag on May 3. While images of Sharrouf's sons holding firearms have been brandished on social media in the past, little has been heard of his daughters - the youngest of which loves spending time with her cousins and playing basketball, The Australian reports. According to The Australian, a few months after Sharrouf's children are believed to have arrived in Syria, his daughters spent a lot of time posting pictures and messages on social media. His eldest daughter was reported to have 'liked' an image of a dead fighter that had been shared by Sharrouf, as well as a photo of the World Trade Centre on fire that he had captioned 'September 11 is the best day of my life'. Khaled Sharrouf's seven-year-old son (left) was pictured holding up a severed head in a photo on Twitter posted by Sharrouf. Sharrouf (right) has also posted photos of himself holding up severed heads . On her own social media post about needing love, the Islamic State fighter himself is reported to have commented 'Sorry.. I'm just a terrorist. I can't love anybody', The Australian reports. Other posts on the 13-year-old's ask.fm profile attest to her love for her family. 'My family makes me happy and hanging out with friends makes me happy,' she wrote in a post.","The ask.fm page of 13-year-old girl, believed to be Khaled Sharrouf's daughter, describes a religious teenager who loves the actress Sandra Bullock and the colour pink .

A man has been shot dead by police in southeast Queensland in the third police shooting in the region in a week . It's alleged the officers were confronted by an armed man and police discharged firearms . The man, believed to be aged in his 30s, suffered a cardiac arrest and was declared dead at the scene. The Queensland Police ethical standards command will investigate the shooting. Monday's shooting comes after a man was shot dead on the Sunshine Coast on Sunday. A first-year constable and a 10-year veteran senior constable were called to the Tewantin home after residents reported a domestic disturbance. The Queensland Police Union said officers were immediately confronted by a violent man, who allegedly came at them with an unspecified weapon as they arrived in their patrol car. The officer shot the 51-year-old man in the chest. Acting Superintendent John Bosnjak told a media conference on Sunday evening that the man shot dead was not from Queensland. 'It's a traumatic time for the family and police, you don't come to work to be involved in matters like this.' he said.

"American Airlines has rolled out a new pilot program designed to ease passenger congestion in the aisles - and collect more profits - as flights prepare for takeoff. Under the trial at just a few airports in the U.S., you can get onto the plane and in your seat ahead of other passengers regardless of where your row is - as long as you travel light. Travel expert John Discala says that after first class passengers are asked to board, the plane is then open to those who are flying without a carry-on bag. No bag, no problem: Under the trial at just a few U.S. airports, passengers can get onto the plane ahead of others regardless of their row - as long as they travel without a carry-on . Tale of the tweet: John Discala was the first to report the trial after he witnessed it firsthand at an adjacent gate . Discala, the host of The Travel Channel's Hot Spots 2012, first reported on the change after he happened to witness the program in action as he waited for a flight at an adjacent gate. Taking to Twitter on March 16, Discala posted: 'I wonder if @AmericanAir is testing out a new boarding procedure. They just invited those without carry-on's to board 2nd.' Less congestion: Allowing passengers without carry-ons to board first may lead to less passengers lined up for the overhead bins . American tweeted back: 'We know that the . WAS airports were trying a new boarding system, John, but we hadn't . heard that FLL (Fort Lauderdale) was too. Enjoy your flight!' Discala said that passengers on the Chicago-bound flight were allowed to board first if they had laptop bags or purses, as long as it wasn't a carry-on to stash in the overhead bin. He says that if put into normal practice, the benefits could be two-fold. He told ABC News that the unconventional boarding could speed up the process of getting customers on the plane. Secondly, he said, it may coax customers into skipping the line by checking their bag - and paying the accompanying fee to boost the airline's profits. The airline told ABC News: American Airlines said, 'We test many different concepts in an effort to continually improve the customer experience. 'With this in mind, we're conducting a test for a boarding process whereby customers who do not have any baggage to stow in the overhead compartment will be boarded in a separate group. The air carrier added: 'This is a limited test and results are still being analyzed. Given that it's a limited test, the airports and flights chosen may change at any time.'","Pilot program used at just a handful of U.S. airports .

"Killed: Paul Thrower, 46, pictured, died after two 18-year-olds hacked at him with a 4ft axe and stabbed him 10 times at a block of flats in Hayes, Middlesex . Three teenagers killed a man with an axe after he became angry at them for spitting and swearing at his girlfriend. Paul Thrower died after two 18-year-olds hacked at him with a 4ft axe and stabbed him 10 times at a block of flats in Hayes, Middlesex, in scenes reminiscent of Hollywood horror film The Shining. Zakariya Subeir and Kiro Halliburton claimed they acted in self defence when Mr Thrower came at them in a rage, smashing through a reinforced glass partition they were hiding behind. Following a trial at the Old Bailey Halliburton, who delivered the fatal knife wound on 20 February, was found guilty of the murder. Subeir and an accomplice, Mahdi Osman, also 18, were found not guilty of murder but convicted of manslaughter. A 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was cleared of involvement in the killing. The court heard how the victim had been drinking and became very angry when his girlfriend, Geraldine Roberts, told him the youths swore, spat and threw a drink at her earlier that day. When Mr Thrower confronted them, Subeir and Halliburton shut themselves into a bin chute on a first-floor communal balcony of a block of flats in St Dunstan's Close. As the 46-year-old hammered on the glass partition with his fist, the 17-year-old found an axe in a shed. Osman passed it up to Subeir, who had managed to get on to the roof of the adjoining porch. Osman told the court that he only handed over the weapon to help his friends barricade themselves into the balcony - not to attack Mr Thrower. Convicted: 18-year-old Halliburton (centre), who delivered the fatal knife wound, was found guilty of  murder. Zakariya Subeir (left) and Mahdi Osman (right), also 18, were convicted of manslaughter . Murder weapon: A 17-year-old, who was cleared of his involvement in the killing, found the axe (above). Osman passed it up to Subeir, who struck Mr Thrower twice on the head and once on the shoulder . But when Mr Thrower smashed the reinforced glass and began to crawl through the gap, Subeir hit him twice on the head and once on the shoulder with the axe. Halliburton stabbed him repeatedly in the back with a knife. Halliburton said he delivered the fatal stab to the chest after Mr Thrower grabbed the axe from Subeir, who then ran off. He told jurors that Mr Thrower had the axe in one hand and him in the other and he did not know what else to do. The victim emerged from the bin chute covered in blood, staggering, holding the axe before he collapsed and died from a stab to the heart. As the defendants ran away, Ms Roberts chased after them. She was one of a number of residents who had called 999 to alert police, who arrived within minutes. The defendants said that they fled the scene because they thought they would not be believed. Halliburton shaved off his plaits and fled to Leeds in Yorkshire. When he was apprehended, he gave a false name. Fleeing the scene: CCTV footage taken from the block of flats shows Halliburton running away after the crime. He shaved off his distinctive plaits and fled to Leeds and gave a false name when he was aprehended . On the run: One of the teenagers flees the block of flats after the attack. Subeir flew to Somalia, via Dubai, but came back about three weeks later and was arrested on the plane at Heathrow airport . The red-handled lock knife he used to kill Mr Thrower has never been recovered. Subeir flew to Somalia, via Dubai, but came back about three weeks later and was arrested on the plane at Heathrow airport. The 17-year-old and Osman went to ground and were arrested five days after the attack. All the defendants apart from Halliburton had been involved in an incident earlier that evening at a nearby pub. They were asked to leave and  a landlord said one of them threatened to 'shank or jook' him - street slang for stabbing - while they were standing outside. Brutal: This blurred image shows Mahdi Osman at the block of flats, carrying the axe used to hack at Mr Thrower. He went to ground after the attack in February and was arrested five days later . Residents of St Dunstan’s Close had complained about anti-social behaviour from groups of youths in the years leading up to the murder. The court heard that Halliburton had two previous convictions of possessing a knife or bladed weapon in 2012. Subeir, of Uxbridge, Halliburton and Osman, both of Hayes, and the 17-year-old had all denied murder. Judge John Bevan adjourned sentencing until Friday December 19 so that pre-sentence reports can be prepared. He said all the defendants were 'very young' and Halliburton would inevitably be detained while the other two were likely to face a determinate sentence.","Paul Thrower died after two 18-year-olds hacked at him with 4ft axe .

"David Cameron today insisted every country in the Commonwealth has agreed that if the royal baby is a girl she will become Queen. The Prime Minister said news the Duchess of Cambridge has gone into labour is ‘a very exciting occasion’ and the whole country ‘is hoping for the best’. And he said a 300-year law change will be enacted to ensure a first-born daughter will become monarch even if she has younger brothers. Promise: David Cameron insisted that all 16 Commonwealth countries had agreed to change the law to ensure a baby girl will become Queen . Keeping watch: British police officers guard the entrance of St. Mary's Hospital exclusive Lindo Wing where the Duchess of Cambridge has been admitted in the early stages of labour . The historic change was approved by the Queen just four months ago to ensure it was on the statute book ahead of the birth. The leaders of all 16 Commonwealth agreed to change gender discrimination laws before she was born. But yesterday it emerged just three outside Britain – St Kitts and Nevis, St Vincent and the Grenadines and Canada - have changed their laws to enact the change. It was suggested that a first-born daughter would only become Queen in countries which have changed the law, while a younger brother would in theory become king in those who had not. But today Mr Cameron insisted the deal he reached in October 2011 was binding. He told BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour: ‘I can’t claim any role in this one, except for as Prime Minister I have one small thing, well it’s a big thing actually which is to get all of the heads of the realms over which our Queen is Queen to agree that whatever the sex of the baby that Will and Kate have, if it’s a girl it will be our Queen. ‘Changing the succession is I think a big achievement, very important for our country and for all those realms over which our monarch governs. ‘And something we will find out quite soon whether it’s going to kick into action or not. ‘Everyone has agreed they’ve agreed that even if the legislation hasn’t gone through their parliament it will retrospectively apply to the child, so it’s pretty much a done deal.’ Guarantee: The law change means Prince William and Kate Middleton's baby is certain to be monarch, whether it is a boy or a girl . Change: The Queen gave the new law Royal Assent in April, to ensure it was passed before the birth. It means the change pushed Prince Harry to fourth in line to the throne . The law change means Prince Harry will be pushed into fourth place in the line of succession to the throne. Mr Cameron led the call for the law to be over-turned to ensure the princess would not be leap-frogged if a younger brother was born later. It had been feared there could be a constitutional crisis if the royal couple had a baby girl before the law was changed. But the Queen approved the historic change by giving royal assent to the Succession to the Crown Act in April. Under the ancient rules of male primogeniture, first born royal daughters in direct line to the throne were over taken by younger male siblings. But the law was criticised and widely viewed as outdated and discriminatory. The scrapped law of male primogeniture only allowed Elizabeth II to become Queen because she did not have any brothers. But the major constitutional change was accelerated after the Duke and Duchess’s wedding in April 2011. In October that year Mr Cameron announced that the 16 Commonwealth countries where the Queen is head of state had agreed to give female royals the same rights of succession as their brothers. It meant amending some of Britain’s key constitutional documents, including the Bill of Rights and Coronation Oath Act of 1688, the 1701 Act of Settlement and the 1706 Act of Union with Scotland. The change in rules is not retrospective, so the Princess Royal will not jump ahead of her younger brothers the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex. To take full effect it has to be legislated for in all of the Commonwealth nations of the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada, Belize, St Christopher and Nevis, St Lucia, the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, St Vincent and the Grenadines and Papua New Guinea. Had the rule been in force before, British history would have been very different. Part of the family: The royal baby will join future balcony line-ups in the months and years to come . Constitutional experts say that in 1509 Margaret Tudor would have taken the throne instead of Henry VIII, and as a result Elizabeth I would never have been Queen. It would also have meant Queen Victoria would have been succeeded by her daughter, Princess Victoria, the Princess Royal, in 1901, and not King Edward VII. When she died just a few months later, her son Kaiser Wilhelm II would have ascended the throne – something which could have prevented the First World War. It is said the Queen of England now would have been the completely unknown Princess Marie Cecile of Prussia. Most European monarchies have already established an equal law of succession - it is in force in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Now only Spain, Liechtenstein and Monaco are left with the old system.","Commonwealth countries all agreed changes to line of succession rules .
But only three outside Britain have passed new laws to enact it .

"A family of four wait to meet Father Christmas by an unlit brazier in a gloomy tee-pee with a muddy floor. This is just one of the pictures which emerged last night of the disastrous winter wonderland attraction that has sparked thousands of complaints. Changing Rooms star Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen, who created the so-called Magical Journey, dubbed the fiasco ‘Elfgate’. Breaking his silence, he admitted it was ‘time for sleeves to be rolled up’. Scroll down for video . Dismal: A family in a muddy tent at the Magical Journey attraction at The Belfry in Sutton Coldfield . Organisers of The Magical Journey knew their winter wonderland, designed with TV presenter Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen would not be ready in time for opening but hoped visitors 'wouldn't see the small details' The attraction closed on Sunday after only a day, as visitors complained children were left in tears by a sweary Father Christmas, elves who ‘sat around smoking’ and ‘tacky’ decorations. Mr Llewelyn-Bowen wrote on Twitter: ‘Sorry for Radio Silence, just got back from a charity weekend in Scotland to find Elfgate @TMagicalJourney. Time for sleeves to be rolled up!’ But angry parents said his light-hearted message was unsatisfactory and demanded an official apology from the designer for ‘spoiling the magic’ for their children. Many have demanded refunds for pre-booked tickets to the experience, at Belfry Golf Club in Warwickshire, which is due to re-open tomorrow. The attraction was forced to close after hundreds of customers expressed their outrage on social media . Mr Llewelyn-Bowen has today vowed to take action at the park, saying it was time for 'sleeves to be rolled up' Event director Paul Dolan (pictured) admitted the event should not have opened on Saturday as planned, but organisers had hoped guests would not spot any unfinished details . Photographs taken at the attraction show piles of rubbish and bored families queuing. It emerged the unlit firepit seen in a picture of a tent had been designed for children to burn their letters to Santa. Another photo reveals an elf wearing a waterproof jacket telling ‘a story that no one could hear’ – apparently to kill time on the walk to Santa’s grotto. A four-year-old girl, Leraya Towers from Leicester, is seen holding a baby’s rattle that she was given as an unwrapped gift. Families forked out upwards of £50 for tickets to the opening day, but thousands took to social media to complain of being kept waiting in queues for up to 40 minutes, as elves sang songs they ‘didn’t know the words to’. Others raised health and safety fears after spotting elves pushing a ‘faulty Father Christmas Express train’ up a hill. Parents claimed some of the Santas swore, were ‘grumpy’ or ‘far too skinny to be believable’. Yesterday, Ellie Williams claimed on Twitter that elves had introduced her children to five different Father Christmases. The attraction was closed yesterday as organisers said they needed to make improvements to the experience . Children walk past an elf at the Magical Journey attraction. Work on the site was hit by torrential rain . Sam Hinch wrote on Facebook: ‘My boys seven and three were bored waiting in tents with chav elves. Dark rooms with elves talking to children for too long. No atmosphere, songs or Christmas spirit. Builders walking around with cigarettes and tools drilling whilst we are standing there! ‘My boys received unwrapped rubbish presents, a Frisbee and a wood giraffe for babies?’ Mr Llewelyn-Bowen, who is the face of the attraction and launched it to the media last Thursday, had boasted it would be ‘magnificent’. It was also billed by organisers as ‘the most amazing Christmas experience that planet Earth has ever seen’. But last night, a statement on behalf of the designer attempted to distance him from any criticism. ‘Laurence’s involvement has been purely creative with nothing to do with production or management of the event and we very much hope that the efforts being made will make the experience much closer to his original ravishing vision,’ it said. Parent Chris Paintin wrote on Twitter that Mr Llewelyn-Bowen had seemed ‘happy to be at the forefront before’. The experience costs £15 for an adult and £22.50 for a child at peak times. Refunds are being given to those who visited Magical Journey on Saturday or had tickets for the days it is closed. Others who have tickets for future dates are also demanding their money back. Event director Paul Dolan apologised that the attraction had ‘let some visitors down’. Organisers said the attraction should have delayed its opening because it was not ready . Parents reported that the winter express train, to Santa's grotto, broke down during the first day it was open . Organisers said the Magical Journey would be closed for three days and heavy rain had affected preparations . The Magical Journey remained closed today following complaints about smoking elves and poor decorations . Customers were told of the closure via the Magical Journey's Facebook page, which was hit by a deluge of complaints from parents seeking refunds . At its media launch on Thursday, interior designer Mr Llewelyn-Bowen boasted that a visit to Santa would 'never be the same again', although he had also spoken of weather problems affecting the site . Parents claimed long queues and broken down rides at the attraction had ruined their children's Christmas .

"There was once a saying: 'If you want to know the time, ask a policeman'. But not in Manchester, apparently. New figures have revealed Greater Manchester Police has spent £16,000 of public money on calls to the speaking clock and directory enquiries. The force has notched up the substantial bill since April 2010, which included more than 35,000 calls to either high cost 118 or 123 numbers up to October last year. New figures revealed Greater Manchester Police has spent £16,000 of public money on calls to the speaking clock and directory enquiries . GMP . refused to comment on the exact nature of the calls to the speaking . clock but did explain that calls to 118 numbers were required to obtain . contact details. Chief Officer Lynne Potts, said: . 'Prior to widespread access to the internet and in common with . organisations and the general public officers and staff had to use . directory enquiries to obtain contact details. 'This practice is now extremely rare . and the force only spent £595 on calls to this number in the 10-month . period to October 31 last year.' A single call to the speaking clock costs 31p. More than £8,000 was spent on calls to 118 numbers in the 2010/11 financial year. In 2011/12 it spent £1,978. Between April and October 2012, it spent £595 on the calls. Last year it was revealed the Metropolitan Police had spent more than £35,000 on 110,000 calls to the Speaking Clock in the previous two years . Calls to the speaking clock totalled £2,872 in 2010/11, £2,535 in 2011/12 and down to £442 for the 2012 period. The Tax Payers' Alliance (TPA) said it beggared belief the money was being spent on calls while there was real pressure on budgets. TPA political director Matthew Sinclair, said: 'It beggars belief that GMP has racked up a bill for thousands just for calls to directory enquiries and the speaking clock. 'Taxpayers will be aghast that their cash has been spent like that when there is real pressure on budgets and there are plenty of other ways of checking phone numbers or the time. 'GMP - like any organisation funded by taxpayers - must ensure that money is spent carefully and not needlessly squandered.' Last year it was revealed the Metropolitan Police had spent more than £35,000 on 110,000 calls to the Speaking Clock in the previous two years. The force also spent £200,000 calling directory enquiries, figures release under the Freedom of Information Act showed. Scotland Yard said officers and staff, many without internet access, needed to know exact times and contact details. The speaking clock was introduced in Britain in 1936. It takes its time from the National Physics Laboratory which broadcasts the atomic clock’s time from Rugby, accurate to one second in one million years.","Greater Manchester Police made  35,000 calls to either 118 or 123 numbers between 2010-12 .

"A 911 dispatcher is under investigation after security footage proved she was using her cell phone during an emergency call while the victim lay dying. The call center operator, Shauna Justice, was training a new staff member in Volusia County, Florida, when the call came through on September 4. Bob Hill, 58, had suffered a heart attack while playing a game of racquetball with friends. In video footage of the incident - obtained by Click Orlando - Justice is seen using her cell phone while her subordinate entered the wrong location. See video below . 'What is your emergency?': Shauna Justice (left) is seen in this video footage scrolling through a personal cell phone while the trainee she is supervising (right) sends paramedics to the wrong address . 911 dispatcher Shauna Justice is said to be 'very remorseful' about using her cell phone on duty. She now faces a five day suspension . The trainee accidentally sent the ambulance to a different recreational center following a miscommunication with the person reporting the emergency. Fifteen minutes passed before paramedics arrived at the scene. Deceased: Bob Hill, 58, died of a heart attack while waiting for paramedics to arrive . Mr Hill died in that time. In the 911 call, the caller clearly states the cross streets of his location, but said the wrong name of the center. He misidentified Nova Community Center, which is in Ormond beach, as the 'Ormond Rec Center'. Instead of sending paramedics to the cross streets, the trainee dispatcher looked up 'Ormond Rec Center' and sent units to 176 Division Avenue. The dispatcher is heard guiding the caller through CPR, but almost 10 minutes passes before he realizes his mistake. An internal review said Justice failed to properly supervise. It is believed that, had Justice not been looking at her phone, the proper address would have been identified. Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson said Justice was 'remorseful' about the incident. Mishap: Emergency crews were sent to the wrong recreational center. Supervisor Shauna Justice was on her cell phone when a trainee entered the address. It took 15 minutes to get to the correct location . 'She admitted her mistake,' he said. 'We messed up. 'She was very remorseful about what happened, very caring about it. 'She admitted to what her mistake was.' Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson said 911 dispatcher Shauna Justice was 'remorseful' and had 'admitted her mistake' It's unclear whether the mistake contributed to Hill's death. Johnson, however, still said it was a 'serious mistake' that 'could have been avoided'. Justice is now facing a five day suspension.

"Doctors can now diagnose extremely rare genetic conditions simply using a family photo. This is thanks to computer software that can diagnose rare genetic diseases from snaps in just a few hours. The software, developed at the Universities of Edinburgh and Oxford, scans ordinary photographs of patients’ faces using facial recognition technology - similar to that used by Facebook. Many genetic conditions are associated with changes in facial appearance.  Image above shows the typical distinct facial features of people with the following conditions (top L-R): Angelman syndrome, Apert, Cornelia de Lange, Down's syndrome (bottom L-R) Fragile X, Progeria, Treacher Collins, Williams-Beuren syndrome . This builds a description of the structure of the face by identifying corners of eyes, the nose, the mouth and other features. Many genetic conditions such as Down’s syndrome and Angelman syndrome are associated with changes in facial appearance. These . occur because of the large number of genes that are involved in the . development of the face and skull as a baby grows in the womb. Scanning photos of different individuals who have the same genetic condition can identify distinctive facial traits that are associated with that particular disorder. The approach works even in very rare disorders that affect only a few people in the world. While genetic disorders are each individually rare, collectively these conditions are thought to affect one person in 17. Of these, a third may have symptoms that greatly reduce quality of life. However, most people fail to receive a genetic diagnosis. Genetic disorders are each individually rare, but collectively these conditions affect one person in 17. (Image shows a DNA molecule) Lead researcher Dr Christoffer Nellåker, of the MRC Functional Genomics Unit at the University of Oxford, said: ‘A diagnosis of a rare genetic disorder . can be a very important step. 'It can provide parents with some certainty . and help with genetic counselling on risks for other children or how . likely a condition is to be passed on.' He added: 'A diagnosis can also . improve estimates of how the disease might progress, or show which . symptoms are caused by the genetic disorder and which are caused by . other clinical issues that can be treated.’ The team who developed the app say doctors should one day be able to take a smartphone picture of a patient and run the computer analysis to quickly find out which genetic disorder the person might have. This will be particularly helpful in countries without easy access to genetic tests. The programme itself was developed by software engineers at Oxford University. Experts from the Medical Research Council Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine at Edinburgh then provided guidance on the clinical images used to develop the software. Professor David FitzPatrick, of the Institute, said: 'Thousands of babies are born each year in the UK with errors in their genetic makeup which mean that they do not develop normally. 'Getting to a firm diagnosis as quickly as possible is very important but the extremely large number of possible disorders makes this very challenging. 'This technology will help doctors to pick up extremely rare disorders and may be able to identify new conditions. 'It brings hope to those families living without a diagnosis and the prospect of information and tailored support to help them face the future.'The findings are reported in the journal eLife. ANGELMAN . This affects the nervous system, causing severe physical and intellectual disability, with symptoms becoming noticeable from early childhood. Many children with Angelman syndrome will have an abnormally small head by the age of two. Some will also have the following features: a flattened skull at the back; a tendency to stick out the tongue; a prominent chin; a wide mouth and wide-spaced teeth. APERT . Apert syndrome is a genetic disorder where some of the skull bones fuse prematurely. This in turn affects the shape of the head and face. The head is unable to grow normally, which leads to a sunken appearance in the middle of the face, bulging and wide-set eyes, a beaked nose, and an underdeveloped upper jaw leading to crowded teeth and other dental problems. Shallow eye sockets can cause vision problems. CORNELIA DE LANGE . This is a a developmental disorder that causes, among other things, slow growth before and after birth and distinctive facial features. The facial differences include arched eyebrows that often grow together in the middle; long eyelashes; low-set ears; small, widely spaced teeth; a small, upturned nose. DOWN'S SYNDROME . This genetic condition typically causes some level of learning disability and a range of physical features including: a small nose and flat nasal bridge; a small mouth; eyes that slant upwards and outwards. FRAGILE X . Fragile X is the most common known cause of inherited learning disability, affecting one in 4,000 boys and one in 6,000 girls. Physical features may include large ears and a long face. PROGERIA . An extremely rare genetic disease of childhood characterized by dramatic, premature aging. Those with it develop a distinctive appearance: baldness; aged-looking skin; a pinched nose; a small face and jaw relative to head size. TREACHER COLLINS . This affects the development of bones and other tissues of the face. Most people with it have underdeveloped facial bones - cheek bones in particular - and a very small chin and jaw. WILLIAMS-BEUREN . A development disorder that often causes learning problems and anxiety. Distinctive facial features include a broad forehead, short nose with a broad tip, full cheeks, wide mouth with full lip.","Many genetic conditions such as Down's syndrome, Fragile X and Progeria are associated a distinct facial appearance .

Part of the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, St Mary's is described as having 'modern, consultant-led world-class care'. The hospital also has a special care section, The Winnicott Baby Unit. In 2006, William visited the refurbished NHS neonatal unit at St Mary's, cradling two tiny premature babies - one weighing just 5lb. At the forefront of specialist care for premature babies, the Winnicott looks after some of the most critically ill newborns in the UK. It can look after up to 18 babies at a time in intensive care, high dependency or special care. Around 350 premature or sick newborn babies are cared for each year by the multidisciplinary team. The Lindo Wing was re-opened in June 2012 after extensive refurbishment. Prince William was born at 9.03pm on June 21, 1982, weighing 7lb 1.5oz in the same wing. He made his public debut with his parents outside the hospital, wrapped in a white blanket and carefully carried by his mother Diana, Princess of Wales. New father Prince Charles beamed proudly at their side. Harry was born in the same exclusive wing just over two years later.

The news that what had been dubbed by . bored journalists ‘the Great Kate Wait’ was finally over was announced . in a brief statement from Kensington Palace at 7.30am after rumours she . had been spotted began circulating. The statement read: 'Her Royal . Highness The Duchess of Cambridge has been admitted this morning to St . Mary’s Hospital, Paddington, London, in the early stages of labour. 'The Duchess travelled by car from Kensington Palace to the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital with The Duke of Cambridge.' There was a strong police presence around the hospital and two police officers guarded the entrance to the private wing. Carly Gargett, 31, an event manager . from Sydney, Australia, who lives in London, said: 'I have been doing . live Facebook updates to all my friends back in Australia. 'They were texting me this morning saying ‘What’s going on?’ because I’d missed it happening so early. 'So I came down to the site on my way to work. 'I am a real royalist. 'I was at the Coronation Festival last week and was hoping she would go into labour then.' Calling Doctors Farthing and Setchell: The Royal delivery duo . The Queen’s current surgeon-gynaecologist Marcus Setchell, and Alan Farthing, the surgeon-gynaecologist to the royal household, are both playing key roles throughout Kate's pregnancy. Mr Setchell will take the lead for Kate's delivery, assisted by Mr Farthing. Consultant Mr Farthing, 47, is the former fiance of murdered television presenter Jill Dando and took up his role in the royal household in 2008. This is the first royal pregnancy since his appointment. Mr Setchell, 69, treated Kate for her severe morning sickness last December. Expert care: The delivery of the royal couple's first-born has been placed in the expert hands of surgeon-gynaecologists Alan Farthing, left, and Marcus Setchell, right . Mr Setchell has been a royal surgeon-gynaecologist for 18 years and cared for Sophie, Countess of Wessex, delivering her two babies, Lady Louise Windsor, now nine, and Viscount Severn, four. The Countess collapsed and was close to death when Lady Louise was born prematurely in 2003, after the placenta ruptured the lining of the womb. Mr Setchell also led the medical care following her ectopic pregnancy in 2001. He performed the Duchess of Cornwall’s hysterectomy in 2007 at the King Edward VII Hospital, where the Duchess of Cambridge was treated for her morning sickness. In recognition of his work, the father-of-four was awarded a personal honour by the Queen in 2004 when he was made a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order. When Mr Farthing took on his role for the royal household in 2008, he became one of the youngest doctors to treat the royal family. He was reported to have met the Duchess last year after her wedding to Prince William. Mr Farthing qualified as a doctor in 1986. He became a member of  the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in 1991, and a fellow in 2003. In 1997, he became a consultant gynaecologist at St Mary’s Hospital and an honorary senior lecturer at Imperial College, London. He is a specialist in gynaecological cancer care and an internationally recognised expert in keyhole surgery. Mr Farthing went on to open his own private Harley Street practice and works as a consultant at two teaching hospitals in London, Queen Charlotte’s in Shepherd’s Bush and St Mary’s. Prince William and his brother Harry were delivered by Mr Setchell’s predecessor, the late Sir George Pinker, who delivered nine royal babies between 1973 and 1990. Mr Farthing was engaged to Crimewatch presenter Miss Dando when she was murdered in 1999, five months before they were due to marry. The couple met at a dinner party in 1997 and announced their engagement in 1999. Miss Dando was shot dead on  her doorstep in April that year  and her murder remains unsolved.","Kate to give birth at Lindo Wing at St Mary's in Paddington, west London .

"After a relaxing break at the Duchess' family home in sleepy Berkshire, the Royal couple's pace of life picked up considerably this morning after the Duchess went into labour. The Duke of Cambridge and his wife drove from their home in Kensington Palace without a police escort and Kate was tended to by doctors at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London about 6am this morning. The Duke of Cambridge was at his wife's side in hospital today after she went into labour, three days after the couple returned to London from their countryside retreat. Her last official engagement came last month when she joined other members of the Royal Family at the Trooping the Colour ceremony. Together: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were in hospital in Paddington, central London hospital when Kate went into labour. The announcement was made this evening that their baby boy was born at 4.24 today . Hospital: Kate gave birth to a boy in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington . Since then, she has been relaxing with . William and her parents, in an attempt to escape the oppressive heat of . the city during the recent period of unusually high temperatures. The Duke, who has temporarily been off duty from his role as an RAF rescue pilot, will take two weeks of paternity leave after the birth. Kate went into labour shortly before 6am today, and was rushed to the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where William was born in 1982. The birth of the Royal baby boy, who will one day become the monarch, was via a traditional easel set up outside Buckingham Palace. The couple were apparently seen leaving the Middletons' £4.8million Georgian home in a Range Rover on Friday afternoon, with William at the wheel. Their car was also accompanied by a police escort and several plain-clothed Scotland Yard bodyguards, with an armed response unit posted outside the house. Event: The couple at the Trooping the Colour ceremony last month, Kate's last public engagement . Home: The couple rushed from Kensington Palace, pictured, where they live at about 6am this morning . The Duchess plans to return to her parents' home at some point in the next few weeks in order to recuperate from the birth. The 31-year-old, who is very close to her parents Michael and Carole, was said to be 'feeling remarkably well' during her stay at their house in the village of Bucklebury. Kate had a troubled start to her pregnancy, but the later months seemed to be much easier. After she was diagnosed with a condition similar to severe morning sickness, the Duchess was forced to reveal that she was pregnant earlier than she would have liked. She kept a low profile for several months, but during her middle trimester carried out a number of public engagements during which she appeared happy and healthy. Family: Kate's sister Pippa and brother James were at the Coronation Festival earlier this month along with their parents, but the Duchess did not attend . In total, Kate carried out 19 days of engagements during the six and a half months following the announcement of her pregnancy in December 2012. Her last solo event came on June 13 when she named a new cruise liner, the Royal Princess. Two days later, she stood on the balcony of Buckingham Palace alongside her husband and several of his relatives to watch the Trooping the Colour ceremony. On June 22, the Duchess opted not to attend the wedding of William's close friend Thomas van Straubenzee due to the risk she might go into labour. Another high-profile event which she missed was the Coronation Festival at Buckingham Palace on July 11, which was attended by her parents, her sister Pippa and her brother James, as well as numerous members of the Royal Family. She has since been able to enjoy a full month of rest, thanks to the arrival of her baby roughly on schedule. Anticipation: News crews and fans of the Royal Family have been gathered outside the hospital for weeks . News: The birth was officially announced on an easel set up outside Buckingham Palace . The calm of the past few weeks stands in stark contrast to the difficulties Kate experienced at the beginning of her pregnancy. The news that she would give birth was announced on December 3 last year, when she was admitted to hospital with symptoms of severe morning sickness. St James's Palace chose to reveal her pregnancy rather than risk it leaking out - even though she was only two months pregnant, while most expectant mothers wait until their 12-week scan to share the news. Doctors said she was suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, which can cause dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine. Soon after Kate's admission to hospital, prank callers from an Australian radio station tricked a nurse into revealing sensitive information about her condition. Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who put through the prank call, committed suicide later the same week, which apparently left the Duke and Duchess deeply saddened. Illness: William and Kate leaving hospital in December after she was treated for severe morning sickness . Inspection: The Duchess met a number of Scouts at Windsor castle during an event in late April . Kate made her first public appearance since the announcement two weeks after she left hospital, when she presented the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year award to cyclist Bradley Wiggins. She and William spent Christmas with the Middletons in Bucklebury and did not attend church in Sandringham with the other Royals. With her health on the mend, Kate flew with her husband for a 'babymoon' on the Caribbean island of Mustique, staying in a £19,000-a-week luxury villa. However, the couple were disappointed when a number of foreign gossip magazines ran paparazzi photographs of her in a bikini displaying a slight bump. In January and February, Kate carried out just one public engagement in each month, but in March she under took five days of public royal visits. William and Kate also travelled to Switzerland for a friend's wedding in the ski resort of Arosa. During a visit to Grimsby, Kate seemed to let slip that she was expecting a daughter - however, at a St Patrick's Day parade she told a soldier they did not know the sex, but that she would like a boy and William a girl. Greeting: Kate talks to school children in Windchester after visiting a local hospice in late April . Solo: Kate's final appearance on her own came in Southampton last month when she named a cruise liner . In March, William and Kate visited the headquarters of Child Bereavement UK, exchanging hugs with bereaved parents and also meeting TV cook Mary Berry. The Duchess also joined the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at Baker Street underground station to mark the 150th anniversary of the Tube. She was given a 'Baby on board' badge. In snowy conditions, she visited a Scout camp in the Lake District to join other volunteers who were being trained. During a two-day visit to Scotland in April, Kate disclosed she had taken up knitting ahead of the birth. 'I've been trying to knit and I'm really bad. I should be asking for tips,' she admitted. She also joined William and the Prince of Wales for a visit to Dumfries House in Ayrshire, where Kate was given a 'Princess Catherine' doll by a bystander and expressed shock at the size of its hair. As her pregnancy progressed, Kate was also working behind the scenes, choosing three more charities to patronise - SportsAid, the Natural History Museum and Place2Be, a mental health charity for schoolchildren. Precedent: The Prince and Princess of Wales holding William outside St Mary's in 1982 . It was not until late April when she was six months pregnant that her bump became truly noticeable as she carried out the National Review of Queen's Scouts at Windsor Castle. Dressed in a £1,065 blue patterned silk Erdem dress by Sophia Visconti, Kate visited Willows Primary School on the deprived Wythenshawe estate in Greater Manchester in late April, when she also attended an evening reception at the National Portrait Gallery in honour of The Art Room charity. At the Warner Bros Studios in Leavesden, Hertfordshire, where the Harry Potter films were made, she duelled with William after being given her own wand. On April 29, the Duchess spent part of her second wedding anniversary celebrating Children's Hospice Week with a visit to Naomi House Children's Hospice in Hampshire, while William, an RAF search and rescue pilot, was on duty in north Wales. The couple enjoyed a trip to Oxfordshire in May to attend the wedding of close friends William van Cutsem and Rosie Ruck Keene. Kate joined the Queen for a garden party at Buckingham Palace and on June 4 gathered with the rest of the Windsors for a service marking the 60th anniversary of the Queen's Coronation at Westminster Abbey, before her final pair of engagements later that month.","Royal couple drove to St Mary's Hospital shortly before 6am today .

"The fugitive ex-cop who is wanted for three murders called the father of one of his alleged victims to taunt him about his daughter's death, it was revealed today. Christopher Jordan Dorner, 33, is suspected of shooting Monica Quan and her fiance Keith Lawrence in their car in Irvine, California, last Sunday as 'punishment' against her father Randall Quan, a former Los Angeles police captain. Dorner wrote online that he blames Quan for his 2009 firing from the LAPD. Quan represented Dorner at the review board hearings that led to his dismissal. The LAPD urged Dorner to turn himself in and on Sunday offered a $1million reward for information leading to his arrest. Scroll down for video . Big reward: Business leaders, police unions and governments across Southern California have offered a $1million reward for the capture of Christopher Dorner . Determined: Los Angeles police chief Charlie Beck, right, said raising the $1million reward for information about Christopher Dorner was 'remarkably easy' because the community is terrified . Police Chief Charlie Beck said on Sunday that the $1 million bounty is likely be the largest reward ever offered in Southern California. He said raising the money was 'remarkably easy' because of the threat Dorner poses to law enforcement officers and their families in the region. The money came from police unions, local businesses, community groups and local government across Southern California. 'We will not tolerate this reign . of terror that has robbed us of our security,' Los Angeles Mayor Antonio . Villaraigosa vowed at a press conference Sunday afternoon. Murdered: Monica Quan, right, and her fiance Keith Lawrence, were shot to death in the car outside their home in Irvine last Sunday . Taunted: Randall Quan was an LAPD captain who retired to become a lawyer. He represented Dorner at the police board hearing where he was stripped of his badge . Yesterday, police searching for Dorner suggested they may use drones in the hunt. Riverside Police Chief Sergio Diaz said they are 'using all the tools at our disposal' when asked whether drones were being deployed, according to The Express. It is believed thermal imaging cameras on the drones could prove crucial in the search. Custom and Border Patrol spokesman Ralph DeSio added: 'This agency has been at the forefront of domestic use of drones by law enforcement', according to The Express. It . was also revealed on Sunday that Dorner received flight training when . he served in the U.S. Navy and could attempt to steal an airplane to . escape authorities. The . former U.S. Navy Reserve lieutenant is believed to be on the loose after . he evaded a massive manhunt that had tracked him to Big Bear, . California. Police on Sunday dramatically scaled down their search of the mountains in the mountain resort since they found his abandoned burned-out truck there on Friday. Some 125 heavily-armed officers scoured the area this weekend. That number has now been scaled back to just 25. Earlier in the afternoon, police and detectives were spotted at the home of Dormer's mother in La Palma, California after they obtained a warrant to search the property. A host of law enforcement: police, detectives and US Marshals obtained a warrant to search t he home of Dormer's mother in La Palma, California . The strange proclamations from Dormer have elicited little concrete information as to his whereabouts . ABC News reports that Dorner cruelly taunted Mr Quan last Thursday - four days after he allegedly murdered his daughter and 11 hours after he allegedly shot three police officers - one of them fatally. A man claiming to be Dorner reportedly called the grieving Mr Quan and told him he 'should have done a better job of protecting his daughter.' In the manifesto that Dorner posted on his Facebook page, he listed Quan and dozens of other people, all of them involved in his firing, as targets. He promises to murder the families of the officers and to kill anyone who tried to stop him. 'I never had the opportunity to have a family of my own... so I am terminating yours,' he wrote. Scaled back: Officers have reduced their presence in Big Bear Lake, California - Dorner's last known location - have reduced their presence from 125 officers to just 25 on Sunday . Chief Beck revealed Sunday that '50 LAPD . families' are under armed guard and surveillance because they were . mentioned as potential targets. 'They are not only targets, but likely likely victims,' he warned at a press conference. Dorner has already possibly tried to attack one of the names on his list. On Thursday, his truck was spotted in the area of one of the potential targets on the list. Two LAPD officers guarding the home chased after Dorner and engaged him in a firefight. Dorner responded by unleashing such a punishing flurry of bullets that the officers' squad car was no longer drivable. One of the officers was grazed in the head by a shot. Just minutes later, he allegedly pulled up to a Riverside police car that was stopped at a red light and opened fire. A 34-year-old police trainer with 11-years on the force was killed. A 27-year-old trainee was gravely wounded and remains in intensive care after undergoing surgery. Their names are not being released to protect their families.","Christopher Dorner allegedly called Randall Quan after killing his daughter Monica and told him he should have 'protected her better'

"A woman who swindled £50,000 in benefits by claiming she was a single mother was caught after she sent joint Christmas cards with her live-in boyfriend. Kelly Young, 36, of Waterfoot, Lancashire, insisted that company director Paul Carter, 54, was just the landlord of her £300,000 home. But investigators were tipped off that Carter was actually her partner after she sent out Christmas cards last year signed: ‘From Kelly, Paul and the kids.’ Young claimed income support, housing benefit and council tax payments and said she was a single mum . Burnley Crown Court heard Young was receiving income support, housing benefit and council tax payments on the grounds that she was a single mum with four children. Video surveillance then confirmed he was living with her at the property, which he also owned. On Friday prosecutor Tina Landale, for the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP), said the total overpayment to Young was £48,908.85. Of this £30,000 was in income support, around £14,500 in housing benefit and £4,000 in council tax benefit. The claim began legitimately in 2002, when she made a claim for herself on the basis she was a single mother-of-three, with no partner living with her and no income except child benefit. Young later began living with Mr Carter but she did not notify the DWP that her landlord was now her partner and suspicions were aroused after neighbours received Christmas cards with both their names on. Young was interviewed in December 2012 and initially denied she was in a relationship with Mr Carter. Burnley Crown Court (pictured) heard the total overpayment to Young was £48,908.85 . She said he was her landlord, let her use his car and helped out with repairs at the house. Amanda Johnson, defending, said: 'The defendant is remorseful for her behaviour, albeit over a prolonged period. 'She has stopped receiving benefits. The only benefit she currently receives is child benefit.' Miss Johnson said Young worked 20 hours a week in an off-licence to provide for herself and her children. She added: 'Her relationship with Mr Carter is perhaps an unusual one. 'He does provide some degree of support, both financially and emotionally to her, but she is the full-time carer to her children, in effect with him coming and going. 'She has learned a very harsh lesson. She is trying to put her life in some kind of order and bring up the children as best she can. 'She is someone who might benefit from assistance'. The court heard she and Mr Carter were still coming to terms with the tragedy of losing their 21-month-old son Paul after he drowned in a bath. An inquest last summer - which cleared the toddler's parents of any blame - heard Paul was found face down in the water. Young was given an eight-month suspended sentence after admitting three offences of dishonestly failing to notify a change in circumstances for benefits. Judge Barry Searle told her for the sake of her children he would not send the now pregnant Young to prison.","Kelly Young claimed company director Paul Carter was her landlord .

"It was already going to be one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Now experts are predicting this week ‘Black Friday’ will hit the record books as customers flock to the internet to buy Christmas gifts. British shoppers are expected to spend £363million online alone, an 11 per cent increase on 2012, according to the Centre for Retail Research. Black Friday is named after the day of frenzied shopping in the US after Thanksgiving when retailers traditionally started making a profit, or went into ‘the black’. British shoppers are expected to spend £363million online alone, an 11 per cent increase on 2012 . The concept was introduced to Britain by online sites like Amazon in 2010, but gained momentum last year when Walmart-owned Asda slashed its prices on electrical goods, leading to scuffles in stores. Some stores are now expecting the day to outstrip next week’s Cyber Monday as the biggest online shopping event of the year. Customers in Britain will spend more than £1million every three minutes on average on Friday – which is payday for the majority of workers – according to a report by Visa Europe. This year the supermarket has trebled the number of deals – including a £6,500 quad bike reduced to £3,5000 - and will draft in ‘thousands’ of additional staff for the day, including extra security to cope with crowds. Ayaz Alam, senior director general merchandise, said: ‘Last year we were the first major retailer to bring Black Friday to the UK. ‘This year, we’ve stepped it up a gear again and we’ll be bringing an even bigger and better sale to the UK than ever before.’ While Amazon started its Black Friday deals yesterday and will stagger 3,000 offers throughout the week in a bid to beat its rivals, many British retailers are keeping their deals secret until the day to avoid being undercut by competitors. High street brands including Boots, Argos, Tesco, Superdrug and Currys PC World are taking part with sales both online and in store. John Lewis said it ‘fully expected’ to break its record online sales figure for a single day set on Black Friday last year with offers on around 100 products. It is opening all its stores from 8am – at least an hour early – and some will close later, with its flagship Oxford Street shop open until 10pm. Online director Mark Lewis said: ‘Now that customers are aware of the date and expecting it, we anticipate that this year’s Black Friday will be bigger still.’ Sainsbury’s will take part for the first time this year, with 485 stores offering discounts on mainly electrical items from as early as 1am in its 24-hour shops. Director of retail and operations Roger Burnley said: ‘It’s a competitive market, so it felt right to be part of the mix this year and kick off the busiest trading time of the year with a popular sales event.’ Some shopping centres will host their own events, with Manchester’s Arndale Centre cutting prices by up to 80 per cent for the day. Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, said: ‘Last year we only had three or four major retailers that were pushing Black Friday but now many more have jumped on the bandwagon. 'I think it will go terrifically and that will link into Cyber Monday when we are also expecting good sales.’","British shoppers are expected to spend £363million shopping online .

The 28-year-old took time out from his role as chairman and CEO of Facebook to relax with his 27-year-old wife on the Hawaiian island, a popular tourist spot for surfing and windsurfing. The couple chatted easily with other beach-goers before taking to the waves, where Priscilla proved herself to be an accomplished surfer. The Zuckerbergs married in May with a ceremony in the billionaire's backyard in Palo Alto, California. It was a joint celebration to mark Chan's graduation from medical school. They honeymooned in Italy where they were pictured taking in the beauty of Rome's Sistine Chapel and tucking into pasta in low-key restaurants. The couple have been dating since 2003 after meeting in line for the bathroom at a frat party at Harvard University.

"An Alabama grand jury has indicted a former teacher and cheerleading coach on eight counts of rape and sodomy of a boy under the age of sixteen. Sixth-grade teacher Jennifer Collins McNeill, 39, was arrested last year and charged with six counts of rape and two counts of sodomy of a juvenile male - some of the alleged encounters took place on school grounds. McNeill who was also a cheerleading coach, is accused of having an inappropriate relationship with the sixteen year-old student between April 2012 and June 2013. The boy did not attend the school where she taught. Scroll down for video... Accused: Jennifer Collins McNeill is alleged to have had a sexual affair with a boy aged between 12 and 16 from April 2012 to June 2013 . Sheriff Kevin Davis says his office . began investigating allegations that McNeill was having sex with a . student after they got a call from the Department of Human Resources. 'A . very good investigation has been done. In my opinion, some very strong . evidence has been collected throughout that investigation,' Sheriff . Davis said. The married teacher's arrest stunned school chiefs who later resigned from her posting at the school. 'That we're all shocked and disappointment doesn't describe it,' said Chilton County Schools Superintendent Dave Hayden. Chilton County Chief Deputy District Attorney C.J. Robinson confirmed on Monday, 'It's embarrassing for the schools system, and it's not fun for anybody involved, but it's something that we have to face now and, based on her choices, here we go,' McNeill's attorney says any comment about her client and the charges pending would be premature at this point. Scene: McNeill worked at Thorsby High School where she primarily taught six graders and was also a sponsor for the cheerleading team. Warrants filed in court show that McNeill is charged with having had sexual intercourse with a juvenile male less than 16 years of age, but older than 12, between April 10, 2012 and June 28 of 2013. The juvenile does not go to school at Thorsby, but is a student in the county. Sheriff Davis told WTOX parents had to be able to trust teachers. He said: 'I dropped off my 12-year-old this morning for the first day of school like other parents across this county and the state for that matter. 'I take a certain amount of responsibility for those kids through school resource officers and us trying to keep them protected through that side, but we also entrust, as parents, a lot of trust to teachers and principals and administrators of the school system.' McNeill was charged with six counts of second degree rape and two counts of second degree sodomy. hat McNeill’s arraignment is scheduled for March 10 in front of Chilton County Judge Sibley Reynolds. She is currently out on bail.","Grand jury indicted former teacher and cheerleading coach for rape and sodomy of a minor .

"A teenage girl has been accused of recruiting her girlfriends to have sex with a 62-year-old  businessman for money. Chelsey Elizabeth Taylor, 17, pushed her friends into prostitution, according to police and prosecutors in Webster, Texas. The League City high school student solicited her 'easily manipulated' friends to provide sex for Michael Wayne McIntosh at his home in Friendswood this past summer, according to Galveston County prosecutor Adam Poole. Chelsey Elizabeth Taylor (left) allegedly solicited her 'easily manipulated' friends to provide sex for Michael Wayne McIntosh (right) at his home in Friendswood, Texas . Webster police detective David Nettles says the student would drive the girls to McIntosh's home and receive a percentage of more than $3,600 paid to the girls. The girls would call the 62-year-old 'Money Mike' and according to court documents, Taylor brought younger girls to have sex with him because she hated him and believed the girls would 'take one for the team'. Police say the friends were as young as 14 when they were allegedly brought to the house for sex. McIntosh's neighbor, Lindsay Diekman, told ABC: 'I mean, they're young, real skinny girls -- different girls all the time.' The alleged teen madam is charged with compelling prostitution. She's free on $40,000 bond. McIntosh is charged with three counts of sexual assault on a child and is free on $120,000 bond. Police have so far identified eight victims with more potentially still to come forward.","Chelsey Elizabeth Taylor, 17, charged with compelling prostitution in Texas .

"A father and his seven-month-old daughter have been found dead in their Michigan home after he failed to return the little girl to her mother amid a divorce battle. The bodies of Daryne Gailey, who had learning disabilities and suffered seizures, and his daughter Charley Lillian Hendrick were found in the Oakland County house by authorities carrying out a welfare check on Sunday morning. Charley, who was found in her crib, died from blunt force trauma to the head and her death was ruled a homicide. But authorities have not given a cause of death for her dad, who had a deep laceration from a boxcutter to his neck when he was discovered in the home's bathroom. Killed: The bodies of Daryne Gailey (right), who had learning disabilities, and his daughter Charley Lillian Hendrick (left) were found at his Michigan home on Sunday. Only her death has been ruled a homicide so far . Gailey's mother, 65-year-old Sylvia Majewska, was found on a couch inside the home with cuts to her body and was taken to hospital, where she remains, the Detroit Free Press reported. Since the deaths, it has emerged that Gailey had filed for divorce only six months after his August 2013 wedding to Charley's mother, Amanda Gailey. The divorce was finalized just three weeks ago. And more recently, Majewska had filed for a protection order on her son's behalf against his ex, although it was lifted in July, the Free Press reported. It is not clear why it was lifted. In the protection order, Majewska claimed that Amanda Gailey had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had kicked him in the groin and thrown a cell phone at him, according to court records. Battle: Gailey was looking after the girl following his divorce from his wife Amanda, left. His mother, Sylvia Majewska, right, who was also found hurt, had previously filed a protection order against Amanda . Happier times: The couple were married for just six months before Majewska sought to get their marriage annulled earlier this year, saying that her son did not have the cognitive abilities to marry . Gailey has denied the allegations. Majewska, who was her son's guardian due to his learning disabilities, sought to get her son's marriage annulled in January, saying he did not have the understanding to marry. The following month, the baby was born and Amanda Gailey was given full and legal custody of the baby girl. Daryne Gailey was allowed to see his daughter every other Friday with his mother present. The bodies were found on Sunday morning after Gailey failed to return the baby girl to her mother following the weekend visit. Authorities went to check on him and they discovered the bodies. A box cutter has been removed from the home as evidence, the Oakland County Sheriff's Office said. Killed: Authorities have not yet ruled the cause of Gailey's death, although he was found with a cut to his neck from a boxcutter. The medical examiner found little Charley died of blunt force trauma to the head . Sheriff's Sergeant Dale Brown said there didn't appear to be signs of forced entry into the home and no one has been charged in the incident. Deputies said it appeared to be a domestic incident, but would not provide further details, WXYZ reported. Gailey had worked as a clerk at a Kroger grocery store in Lake Orion for 15 years, employees said. They told the Free Press that he 'had a big heart'.","Daryne Gailey was found with a laceration to his neck from a boxcutter while his baby daughter, Charley, was killed by blunt force trauma to the head .

Pictured is NGC 6334 is a cloud of gas and dust that appears to be forming massive stars.

'The photographs are all real, but you will not see these images with either the naked eye. 'Our eyes do not have the sensitivity needed to capture the detail and colour. 'In order to see these very faint space objects and this level of detail, it is necessary to use specialised equipment.' In order to capture these images, Mr Hancock attached his camera to a telescope, which is then connected to an equatorial mount along with other equipment.

"Inspired: Jack Kerouac totally changed his style of writing after reading a 16,000-word, amphetamine-fuelled letter by his friend Neal Cassady. That letter is set to go up for auction in California next month . It has been called the letter that launched a literary genre. Neal Cassady wrote 16,000 amphetamine-fuelled, stream-of-consciousness words in a missive to Jack Kerouac in 1950. On reading them, Kerouac scrapped an early draft of his latest novel and, in a three-week writing binge, revised it into a style inspired by Cassady. That novel was On The Road, and its style became known as Beat literature. The letter, Kerouac said shortly before his death, would have transformed his counterculture muse Cassady into a towering literary figure, if only it hadn't been lost. Turns out it wasn't. It was just misplaced, for 60-some years. At least, so says Joe Maddalena, boss of Profiles in History, a southern California action house putting the letter up for sale next month. The letter is being offered as part of a collection including papers by E.E. Cummings, Kenneth Rexroth, Robert Penn Warren and other prominent literary figures. But Mr Maddalena believes the item bidders will want most is Cassady's 18-page, single-spaced screed describing a drunken, sexually charged, sometimes comical visit to his hometown of Denver. 'It's the seminal piece of literature of the Beat Generation, and there are so many rumours and speculation of what happened to it,' he told the Associated Press. Kerouac told The Paris Review in 1968 that poet Allen Ginsberg loaned the letter to a friend who lived on a houseboat in Northern California. Kerouac believed the friend then dropped it overboard. 'It was my property, a letter to me, so Allen shouldn't have been so careless with it, nor the guy on the houseboat,' he said. As for the quality of the letter, Kerouac described it this way: 'It was the greatest piece of writing I ever saw, better'n anybody in America, or at least enough to make Melville, Twain, Dreiser, Wolfe, I dunno who, spin in their graves.' It turns out Ginsberg apparently was trying to get it published when he mailed the letter to Golden Goose Press in San Francisco. There it remained, unopened, until the small publishing house folded. When it did, its owner planned to throw the letter in the trash, along with every other unopened submission he still had in his files. That was when the operator of a small, independent music label who shared an office with publisher Richard Emerson came to the rescue. He took every manuscript, letter and receipt in the Golden Goose Archives home with him. Up for sale: This image provided by the Profiles in History auction house shows the cover of an auction catalog, featuring several pages of what has become known as The Joan Anderson Letter, some 16,000 Benzedrine-fueled, stream-of-consciousness words written by Cassady to Kerouac in 1950 . Beatniks: Left to right, William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg. Kerouac blamed Ginsberg for losing the letter, believing the poet had loaned it to a man living on a houseboat who dropped it in the water . 'My father didn't know who Allen Ginsberg was, he didn't know Cassady, he wasn't part of the Beat scene, but he loved poetry,' said Los Angeles performance artist Jean Spinosa, who found the letter as she was cleaning out her late father's house two years ago. 'He didn't understand how anyone would want to throw someone's words out.' Although she knew who Kerouac and Cassady were, Ms Spinosa had never heard of The Joan Anderson Letter, the name Kerouac gave it for Cassady's description of a woman he'd had a brief romance with. On The Road: Kerouac's 1957 masterpiece, which he totally transformed in draft stage after reading Cassady's account of a drunken visit to Denver . 'It's invaluable,' historian and Kerouac biographer Dennis McNally said. 'It inspired Kerouac greatly in the direction he wanted to travel, which was this spontaneous style of writing contained in a letter that had just boiled out of Neal Cassady's brain.' It was a style he'd put to use in the novels On The Road and Visions of Cody, which featured Cassady, thinly disguised under the names Dean Moriarty and Cody Pomeroy, as their protagonists. He'd continue to use it in such books as The Subterraneans, The Dharma Bums and Lonesome Traveler, cementing his reputation as the father of the Beat Generation. Cassady would gain some small measure of fame as Kerouac's muse and, later, as the sidekick who drove novelist Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters bus across the country. Meanwhile, about a third of The Joan Anderson Letter, copied by someone before it disappeared, became well-known to students of Kerouac. When Ms Spinosa discovered she had the whole thing, she took it to Mr Maddalena, a prominent dealer in historical documents and pop-culture artifacts, to authenticate it. He's reluctant to estimate what it might sell for. Although the original manuscript of On The Road fetched $2.4million in 2001, everyone knew that existed. It's much harder to estimate the value, he said, of something no one knew was still around. For her part, Ms Spinosa says she's just happy her father rescued the letter from the trash. She's hoping whoever buys it will give the public a chance to see it. 'The letter is so good, and you see why these guys loved him,' she says of Cassady's fellow Beats. 'The writing, it just breathes off the page.'","Speed-fuelled 16,000-word letter written by Kerouac's muse Neal Cassady .

"The first words of a hiker who was forced to eat his beloved dog to stay alive in the wilderness were: 'I want to get a new dog.' Marco . Lavoie, killed and ate his beloved pet after a bear destroyed his canoe . and food supply - leaving him 500 miles outside Montreal for three . months. The German Shepherd saved his life, chasing off a . bear, just three days before Lavoie killed it with a rock, according . to Canadian news agency QMI. Lavoie was stranded alone for three months in a remote area of Canada and was found close to death by rescuers last Wednesday. Companion: Lavoie was forced to eat his loyal German Shepherd after killing it with a rock. Experts say he likely would not have survived otherwise . After the bear attack, he sprained his ankle so he was unable to hunt or find any other source of food. Lavoie . was rescued by helicopter on Wednesday. He had lost 90 pounds and was . suffering from hypothermia. He is now in a critical condition in a . hospital in Northern Quebec. And today a spokesperson for Sûreté . du Québec told MailOnline the first thing Lavoie told officers was that . he wanted to get a new dog. Richard Carbanneu said: 'He is very . ill and he can barely talk, but when our officers spoke to him in . hospital the only thing he said was, ""I want to get a new dog."" 'I . suppose he must feel very guilty about eating his pet, it is obvious he . loved him very much and did not want to do what he did.' Mr Carbanneu joined survivalists in saying that Lavoie's decision to  sacrifice his dearest companion likely saved his life. Raided: A black bear in a national forest destroyed food supplies and a canoe before the dog chased it away . 'He . was alone in the wilderness with no food for weeks. He had badly hurt . his ankle as well, so he could not hunt for food. I suppose he thought he . had no choice,' he said. The 44-year-old hiker was in the midst of a lengthy solo climbing trip into the the forbidding Nottaway River wilderness when disaster struck. Lavoie left his friends and family at home and took only his beloved German Shepherd for company. In the midst of the long hike, a bear attacked him - destroying his canoe and the food supplied he brought with him. 'He is an experienced hiker, but he ran into serious trouble,' Mr Carbanneu said. Lavoie has been able to say only a few words to rescuers - and it could be some time before authorities get a full picture of what happened in the wilderness. 'He . will be in hospital for around two weeks and I don't think he will be . able to talk much before then. Hopefully when he is well enough he will . be able to give is a better idea of what happened,' Mr Carbanneu said. Andre Diamond, a Waswanipi Cree who lives on an island at the mouth of the river, told the Toronto Sun he had warned Mr Lavoie to stay away. 'He . said it didn't scare him, but it's not a river to travel alone,' Mr . Diamond said. 'Other adventurers have gone there over 20, 30 years and . never came back.'

"Shadow education spokesman Tristram Hunt (pictured) is set to attack the 'Berlin Wall' between the fee-paying and state education system today . The headmaster of Tristram Hunt’s former school yesterday accused Labour’s education spokesman of ‘offensive bigotry’ after he threatened to strip private schools of tax breaks worth £700million. Mark Beard, head of £17,835-a-year University College School in Hampstead, North London, said the policy by one of his old boys was ‘tasteless’. He spoke out after Mr Hunt railed against a ‘Berlin Wall’ between private and state education which had created a ‘corrosive divide of privilege’. In a speech, Mr Hunt unveiled plans to make private schools forge stronger links with state schools or face losing the tax relief. Their efforts must include competing with state schools at football and other sports instead of running ‘exclusive private-only competitions’, he said. But his plan to put private schools under a legal duty to co-operate with the state system triggered a backlash among head teachers in both sectors. Critics accused Labour of declaring a new class war after failing nearly a decade ago to threaten the charitable status of private schools. The party was also accused of ‘rank hypocrisy’ as it emerged that one in four members of the Shadow Cabinet went to private schools, including Mr Hunt, Harriet Harman and Ed Balls. Mr Beard, whose school was attended by Mr Hunt in the late 1980s, said Labour was ignoring a wealth of partnerships that already operate between private and state schools. He said the party appeared to be attempting to ‘rely on independent schools to solve the issues for the 93 per cent of children who are educated in the state sector’. He added: ‘Isn’t it time for Labour to come up with some new, helpful initiatives rather than espousing what some might deem an offensive bigotry?’ Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, accused Mr Hunt of promoting a ‘1980s view of education’. He said: ‘Does Dr Hunt think that when Mr Chips from the independent school drifts in to teach a bit of history at the local state school because his head has told him to under instruction from Dr Hunt that this is going to transform the relationship between state and private school? It’s patronising nonsense.’ Mr Hunt attended the fee-paying University College School in North London in the 1980s, but came under fire from current headteacher Mark Beard . The plans also drew criticism from a union representing thousands of head teachers and senior staff in state secondary schools, which warned against setting up ‘more legislative hoops for schools to jump through’. Some 2,570 fee-paying schools can claim an 80 per cent cut in business rates because they are charities, and in 2013 they saved £165million in this way. But Mr Hunt insisted that many private schools provide only token benefits to their communities, such as entry to art exhibitions for three hours a day or allowing occasional use of a football field. Under Labour’s blueprint, private schools will be required to pass a partnership test to keep their business rate relief, which is estimated to be worth £700million over the course of the next Parliament. As well joint sports tournaments, this could include sharing teachers, running courses to help state pupils get into leading universities and sponsoring state academies. Speaking at a state school in East London, Mr Hunt said the taxpayer was expected to subsidise ‘the education of a privileged few’. He added: ‘It baffles me that we can have private schools loaning a sports pitch to the local comprehensive once or twice a year yet completely refusing to play them at football, opening up their halls and amphitheatres yet unwilling to engage in a debating competition.’ But critics said tournaments such as the annual English schools’ rugby competition were open to state and independent schools. Private school leaders said 90 per cent of fee-paying schools were ‘involved in meaningful and effective partnerships with state schools’. Mr Lenon added: ‘Independent schools generate £4.7billion in tax and save the taxpayer £4billion, equivalent to building 460 schools, by educating children out of the state school sector.’ Peter Kent, president of the Association of School and College Leaders, and head of Lawrence Sheriff grammar school in Rugby, said partnerships only worked when they were ‘entered into willingly’. ‘More can be done to encourage schools to work together, but forcing collaboration through regulation will not work,’ he added. Mr Hunt will also say the 'corrosive divide of privilege' is harming children's prospects (file picture, posed) ‘In much of the country, state and independent schools have a healthy working relationship.’ Tory critics said the policy was an attempt to appeal to core voters following the resignation of Emily Thornberry as Shadow Attorney General over a tweet that was seen as patronising working people. Dominic Raab, a Tory member of the Commons education select committee, said: ‘This rank hypocrisy from Labour is a pathetic attempt to regain some socialist street cred after the resignation of Emily Thornberry. ‘It won’t bother the big public schools the likes of Tristram Hunt, Harriet Harman and Ed Balls went to. But it will hurt small independent schools charging more modest fees to aspirational middle-class families. Ed Miliband is reviving class warfare, not social mobility.’ But Mr Hunt insisted just 3 per cent of private schools sponsored an academy, while 5 per cent loaned teaching staff to state schools and a third shared facilities. ‘The only possible answer to whether they earn their £700million subsidy is a resounding and unequivocal “No”,’ he said. ‘Over the last few years we have seen the limitations of asking private schools politely. So the next government will say, “Step up and play your part. Earn your keep. Because the time you could expect something for nothing is over”.’ A spokesman for Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ‘This Government has done more than any other to encourage the state and independent sectors to work more closely together.’ Tristram Hunt’s former school has forged links with three state secondaries and several primaries. University College School is associated with Westminster Academy because the heads of each are governors at the other. Benefits to pupils at Westminster Academy include help in applying to university, as well as Latin lessons and help with maths and Spanish. Pupils at UCL Academy in London share University College School’s facilities, such as its swimming pool, while the London Academy of Excellence benefits from advice and support from senior teachers at UCS in subjects such as science and history. Rugby class: England star Lawrence Dallaglio with pupils from UCS . UCS headmaster Mark Beard said: ‘If Mr Hunt wanted to tastelessly quantify the value of public benefit that UCS generates each year then he would find that it far outstrips the value of tax relief that UCS receives through its charitable status. And UCS is not alone in this regard.’ The Independent Schools Council said 91.6 per cent of members were involved in partnership activities with the state sector. Among other shared activities, state schools have been playing rugby against independents for 26 years in the Daily Mail Cup, now the NatWest Schools Cup. The ISC said some independents sponsor state-funded academies while others offer GCSE or A-level revision classes, lend teachers or hold university entrance master-classes. Most schools already share their facilities and are ‘glad to do so’, it said. State secondaries involved include Labour leader Ed Miliband’s old school – Haverstock, in Camden, North London. The physics department at fee-paying girls’ South Hampstead High has mentored A-level physics teachers at Haverstock.","Shadow minister Tristram Hunt  unveils 'class war' plans in speech today .

"A husband-to-be went to extreme lengths to make sure his fiancee had the most romantic proposal ever. Penrith's Tim Blacketer set up a 'scavenger hunt' day for Katie Crowther-Wilkinson, which included pampering, lunch with her friends and a hired limousine. The 25-year-old, who had just finished his masters in radiation therapy, spent four to six weeks planning the perfect day for his girlfriend of five years. Katie Crowther-Wilkinson was treated to a scavenger hunt, with the clues guiding her through a spectacular day of pampering, lunch with friends and a limousine before the big surprise . Katie Crowther-Wilkinson's perfect day all led up to the incredible moment when her boyfriend, Tim Blacketer, proposed to her . 'Kate's not someone who likes to be the centre of attention,' Mr Blacketer told Daily Mail Australia. 'I knew we weren't going to have a big wedding and I just wanted to show her how much she meant to me and give her a day she would never forget.' On Saturday, Ms Crowther-Wilkinson was treated to getting her nails and make-up done, shopping, breakfast and lunch with friends, and then a limousine to Wendy’s Secret Garden in Lavender Bay. At each location, the exercise physiologist was given a clue, riddle or compliment to lead her to the next destination. Penrith's Tim Blacketer proposed to his girlfriend of five years with a day-long pampering session which included a limousine ride . To kick off the day, Ms Crowther-Wilkinson was woken up friends to go to a hair appointment at 8am then breakfast. She was then taken to a Parramatta shopping centre where she had her nails done and did some shopping. After that she had lunch with more of her friends and was whisked away to get her make-up done. At the end of the day, Ms Crowther-Wilkinson was treated to a limousine ride. When she arrived at her final destination, she finally figured out why she had been treated to such an elaborately planned day. 'When she did get to the garden she did break down and I had my mates standing behind me, with signs that read: ""Will you marry me?"" Mr Blacketer said. 'Once she saw that all my close family and friends starting crying. It was a big crying fest.' The couple are now having their dream home built in Oran Park and are looking at having their wedding at the end of next year.

"A Maine motorist is lucky to be alive after a moose smashed into the windshield and completely through to the back seat on Sunday. Mark Forino, 34, miraculously escaped with only minor scrapes after he was unable to swerve away from the massive beast while driving in Ashland Sunday night. The Presque Isle man narrowly escaped being struck by the moose and is traveled into the 2006 Toyota Sienna's passenger compartment. Mangled: Maine man Mark Forino was unable to avoid striking a moose in the road in Ashland on Sunday night . Unblieveable: The massive beast smashed through the windshield of his Toyota minivan and all the way through to the back seat . Relieved family: Even more shocking than the horrific crash was the fact that Forino, a father of two who was alone in the vehicle, escaped with just some scrapes and glass in his eyes . The father of two needed his eyes flushed of glass at the scene from the shattered windshield before being released to his no doubt relieved family. Forino posted photos of his smashed car to Facebook Monday morning. His friends and family were understandably horrified by what they saw. One Facebook friend, astounded by the gutted white family vehicle, summed things up nicely: . 'Holy s*** Mark. Thank god your family wasn't with you,' said Jenette Talbot. Another friend wondered, 'Do you get to keep the kill?' Completely smashed: Forino posted the shocking aftermath to his Facebook on Monday morning . Hair-raising: The accident occurred Sunday night in the town of Ashland. At right, an unrelated Facebook photo of Forino reveals how he likely felt after the moose barely missed him on its path toward the back seat . The answer to his question, at least in the state of Maine, is a definite yes. Authorities there give motorists unlucky enough to hit a moose--and lucky enough to survive the impact--first dibs on the very large and, to some, very delicious carcass. Tim Cotton of the Bangor Police Department told boston.com in October: . 'When a car hits a game animal, the person that hits the animal gets first dibs, . 'Some people don’t have stomach for wild game, so a lot of police departments keep a list of people who would like to pick up the animal. 'If the driver refuses the road kill, police use the list to attempt to contact someone willing to come get the animal.' Blood from the animal can clearly be made out in the front passenger seat. Per Maine state law, Forino will have first dibs on the animal's carcass -- if he refuses, state police have a list of people they know will be interested .","Mark Forino, 34, of Presque Isle, was lucky to be alive after the massive beast totaled his Toyota Sienna on Sunday evening .

"Acquitted: Teacher Peter Wilson, pictured at an earlier hearing, has spoken of the trauma of having social workers present at the birth of his child after unfounded allegations were made against him . A teacher cleared of sexually assaulting six pupils yesterday told of the agony of being ordered to live away from his wife and baby son. Peter Wilson suffered the indignity of social workers attending the birth of his first child and making him swear he would not live with his family for the eight months it took to resolve the allegations. Yesterday a jury took just 20 minutes to acquit him of all the charges, brought after girls at his primary school accused him of kissing them and touching their bottoms. The 35-year-old said the allegations were ‘probably malicious’ – he had merely been trying to encourage the pupils with a clasp of the shoulder, a hug or a pat on the back. He remains suspended from his job while the council carries out its own investigation. His 29-year-old wife Clare, a teacher at the same school, has also been barred because of her relationship to him. After the case, Mr Wilson spoke of their ‘horrible ordeal’ and told of his delight at having his reputation restored. ‘The past 18 months or so have been the most stressful of my life and my wife’s,’ he said. Anguish: Mr Wilson, pictured with a woman believed to be his wife Clare and a supporter, leave court after an earlier hearing . ‘My greatest distress was that as a result of these unfounded allegations, social services were present at the birth of our first child and I was required to sign an agreement to say that I could not live in the same house as my wife and newborn baby.’ Mr Wilson was suspended from the school in Blackpool – which cannot be named for legal reasons – after two pupils reported him to a teacher. Other children gave similar accounts of him rubbing his hand down their backs or leaning close to them cheek to cheek before patting them on the bottom. Cleared: It took a jury just 20 minutes to acquit Mr Wilson at Preston Crown Court (pictured) Mr Wilson was charged by police and released on bail on condition he had no unsupervised contact with under-16s. The jury at Preston Crown Court heard he had been considered a well-liked and well-respected member of staff until his suspension. Giving evidence, Mr Wilson broke down in the witness box as he denied gaining sexual gratification and insisted any touching was part of his job. His barrister, Mark George QC, had told the jury: ‘Nowadays, it seems as if encouragement, a clasp of the shoulders, or a pat on the shoulders, or pat on the arm can be misunderstood and lead to someone like Mr Wilson becoming the subject of suspicion and a case of this sort.’ The teacher told police four of his accusers were lacking confidence and self-esteem and needed praise. The jury yesterday cleared him of 11 counts of indecent assault relating to five girls. Earlier in the trial the jury was ordered by the judge to find him not guilty on three further counts in relation to another girl. Mr Wilson, of Thornton Cleveleys, Blackpool, cried in the dock as he was cleared. He was supported in the public gallery by members of his family. Last night Blackpool council said both Mr Wilson and his wife would remain suspended ‘ahead of an internal investigation following the conclusion of the court case’. A spokesman for Lancashire County Council’s social services department said the authority could not comment on individual cases.","New father separated from wife and child for eight months .

"This clip captures the incredible moment a car smashes into the central reservation on the A14 and drives on with parts hanging off. It starts with the white vehicle swerving across lanes and spin around in a circle after crashing into the central reservation. The car then hurtles into the hard shoulder, but almost immediately, the driver carries on weaving dangerously in and out of traffic.

"Exiles from Cuba's communist revolution are fighting for the right to seize billions of dollars of Cuban money held in frozen U.S. bank accounts. Gustavo Villoldo, 78, and the families of fellow Cuban Aldo Vera and Bobby Fuller, an American, each won separate lawsuits in Florida seeking billions of dollars in damages from the Cuban government. The fight now, though, is less with Cuba than it is with the banks where the U.S. Treasury froze Cuban government assets that the families now want to seize. Cuban exile Gustavo Villoldo, 78, in an interview in his lawyer's office in Miami. He and the families of two men allegedly killed by Cuba are moving closer to collecting billions of dollars linked to the Cuban regime . The banks are resisting turning the money over, insisting the U.S. families have yet to prove they should be allowed to seize it. Mr Villoldo has been an avowed enemy of the Cuban government since the day in 1959 that, he says, agents of the communist regime blackmailed his father into committing suicide. His anti-Castro missions have included co-piloting a B-26 bomber during the ill-fated 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion as well as infiltrating Cuba for the CIA numerous times. He even helped with tracking down Fidel Castro lieutenant Ernesto 'Che' Guevara in Bolivia in 1967, where the revolutionary was secretly murdered. That was Mr Villoldo's revenge. The basis of his lawsuit, which won him $2.8billion in damages from Cuba, was that Guevara had ordered his father to take his own life or his sons would be killed. Earlier this year, Manhattan U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein ruled that the Florida decisions must be honoured as attorneys for Mr Villoldo and the others try to get at accounts with ties to Cuba held by the 19 banks, including Bank of America, Barclays Bank, Citibank, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase. 'The judgments granted by the Florida circuit court in favor of the plaintiffs and against Cuba are entitled to full faith and credit,' Judge Hellerstein wrote in an August 22 order. At stake is as much as $3.5 billion; the families have agreed to share any proceeds they get out of the New York accounts. Che Guevara and Fidel Castro: Mr Villoldo was granted damages of $2.8billion by a judge in Florida after claiming his father committed suicide after Cuban revolutionaries threatened to kill his sons and wife . Mr Villoldo's attorney, Andrew Hall, who previously represented Watergate figure John Erlichman and families of sailors killed in the USS Cole terror attack, said the Hellerstein ruling was a watershed moment in the case. The exact contents of the accounts and the account holders are sealed by court order, and the legal question now involves whether the money truly belongs to Cuba. 'That's the battle: Is this Cuba's money or is this someone else's money?' Mr Hall said. 'This is the green light that opens the door for us.' In a nutshell, the money was halted by the Treasury Department as it passed back and forth electronically through the New York banks between entities in Cuba and banks in other countries overseas. Based on the rulings so far, Hall estimated more than $20million could be paid out by the banks within the next six months. Another $20million to $40million, he said, could be obtained depending on upcoming legal decisions on precisely when an electronic funds transfer, or EFT, should be considered Cuban property that could be seized. In October, the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that EFTs were subject to seizure only if Cuba itself, or a state-owned entity, transmitted the funds directly to the bank. Lawyers on all sides are still sorting out that decision's impact. An attorney for several big banks, James Kerr, suggested that no money be turned over to Villoldo and the other families right away.","Gustavo Villoldo was awarded billions in damages by a U.S. judge .

"Building on disused industrial sites and empty housing plots could dramatically ease pressure on the countryside, a study has found. There is space for more than one million homes on derelict land, vacant plots and disused ground, according to the Campaign to Protect Rural England. And 400,000 of them would be able to be built without delay, because the sites already have planning permission. There is space for more than one million homes on derelict land, vacant plots and disused ground, according to the Campaign to Protect Rural England . Campaigners say that using these 'brownfield' sites would solve Britain's housing crisis and help preserve our countyside. Rural groups have become increasingly unhappy at the ease with which 'predatory developers' are concreting over our most beautiful countryside for housing developments. Two of the most respected rural institutions – the National Trust and Country Life magazine – have issued warnings in recent weeks that some of Britain's most picturesque countryside is being desecrated as a result of the Government' s weakened planning laws. And yesterday the Daily Mail revealed that one land agent – Gladman Developments – is so confident it jump legal hurdles that it has offered 'no win, no fee' deals to farmers to secure planning permission for housing developments on their land. Country Life magazine said in an editorial last week that rural communities have been 'stripped of their natural defences' by the Government's planning policies, which have opened the floodgates to a wave of greenfield planning applications. The policies have also been denounced by Sir Simon Jenkins, the chairman of the National Trust, in a Daily Mail article earlier this month. Separate research conducted by the National Trust last year found that half of councils are planning to build on green belt land over the next five years. Planning Minister Brandon Lewis (pictured) said he welcomed the report . The Government insists it needs to build 200,000 homes a year in England to meet the demands of a growing population. But the CPRE argues that if brownfield sites were used for housing, there would be no need to even consider concreting over open fields. The report, called From Wasted Space to Living Spaces, also makes a series of recommendations that would make brownfield land more attractive to developers. Paul Miner, CPRE planning campaign manager, said: 'This research demonstrates the huge existing capacity for housing on brownfield land. 'At a time when there is great pressure on our green spaces, utilising this land through a brownfield-first policy would protect our countryside and regenerate urban areas. 'We want this new, authoritative evidence to lead to a sustained focus on suitable brownfield land. We can and must do more to get these sites redeveloped, whether it be reviving the national land use database or implementing strong local plans to deal with multiple landowners on difficult sites.' The report, based on an investigation of council records conducted by the University of the West of England, found at least 976,000 new homes could be built on identified brownfield sites. The true figure could be much higher, because the researchers only identified land already derelict or with planning permission - it does not include underused land such as car parks. There is already planning permission for enough land to accommodate more than 400,000 houses - and space for another 550,000 on derelict land. Nearly half of this vacant space is located in the south east, the east of England and London - the areas under the greatest stress. The CPRE called for the Government to change its planning policy to prioritise previously developed sites over rural sites. It wants the Homes and Communities Agency to be given greater powers and funding to redevelop large and difficult sites. And it called for far more a proactive approach in actively searching for and identifying brownfield land. Developers have claimed that brownfield sites are often too difficult and expensive to bring back into use. The Government has promised to change that by reducing red tape and easing planning regulations. Sir Simon Jenkins, the chairman of the National Trust, denounced the policies where rural communities have been 'stripped of their natural defences' by the Government's planning rules . They have said they will make it easier to convert warehouses and industrial premises into homes, which they hope will lead to more housing on the edges of towns, reducing the need for building in open countryside. The reforms would regenerate high streets by making it easier to change disused shops into restaurants and leisure facilities. Planning Minister Brandon Lewis said last night: 'We welcome this report, which illustrates the scope for building new homes and protecting the countryside at the same time. 'This Government wants to see the maximum amount of brownfield land being used to build new homes, whilst also maintaining protections for our beautiful countryside. 'That is why our planning reforms encourage councils to use brownfield land for new buildings, free up disused public sector land for redevelopment and why we' ve invested £235 million into bringing 80,000 long term empty homes back into use since 2010. 'We are proud to be building more homes to support hard working families and help first time buyers onto the property ladder.'","Campaigners say using brownfield sites would solve housing crisis .

"The world's most sophisticated cyber spying tool has been stealing information from government, businesses and individuals for six years. The malware, called 'Regin', is probably run by a western intelligence agency and has mostly affected computers in Russia, Saudi Arabia and Ireland. Once installed on a computer, it can steal passwords, capture screenshots, listen in on phone conversations and restore deleted files. Scroll down for video . 'Extraordinary threat': The world's most sophisticated cyber spying tool has been stealing information from government, businesses and individuals for six years. The largest number of infections discovered - 28 per cent - was in Russia, and Saudi Arabia was second with 24 per cent . Symantec, who found the malware, describes it as the most 'extraordinary' piece of hacking software developed, and was probably 'months or years in the making'. They claim it is more advanced than Stuxnet, which was developed by US and Israel government hackers in 2010 to target the Iranian nuclear programme. 'We are starting to get glimpses into the secret war that is occurring at a nation-level in intelligence,' Professor Tim Watson, director of the Cyber Security Centre at Warwick University told MailOnline. He said individuals should not be concerned about their private details, as Regin was designed to steal secrets at a state level. Cyber espionage: No one yet knows how Regin infected systems but it had been deployed against internet service providers and telecoms companies worldwide. Private individuals and small businesses account for around half of the affected organisations . So far, infection from Regin have been found between 2008 and 2011, after which the malware disappeared before a new version surfaced in 2013. No one yet knows how Regin infected systems but it had been deployed against internet service providers and telecoms companies worldwide. The largest number of infections discovered - 28 per cent - was in Russia, and Saudi Arabia was second with 24 percent. Regin  has been active since 2008 and may have been created by a Western government. It has been used to attack individuals and small businesses as well as private companies, government entities and research institutes. Telecoms companies have also been infected, allowing hackers to gain access to phone calls. It is highly sophisticated and may have taken months or even years to complete. Computers can be infected with the software through means including fake internet sites and instant messenger programs. It is unusually low-key, meaning that it can be used on a target for several years before being noticed. A report released by Symnatec claims Ireland has been the site of 9 per cent of confirmed infections and Russia, Saudi Arabia and Mexico have also been heavily affected. The report describes the purpose of Regin as 'intelligence gathering' and says: 'It is used for the collection of data and continuous monitoring of targeted organisations or individuals.' Other countries where the malware was found included Mexico, Ireland, India, Afghanistan, Iran, Belgium, Austria and Pakistan. There were no reported infections in the United States. Symantec said it believes the targets of these infections were customers of these companies rather than the companies themselves. Telecom companies were also infected, apparently to gain access to calls being routed through their infrastructure, the report noted. Regin appeared to allow the attackers to capture screenshots, take control of the mouse's point-and-click functions, steal passwords, monitor traffic and recover deleted files. Symantec said some targets may have been tricked into visiting spoofed versions of well-known websites to allow the malware to be installed, and in one case it originated from Yahoo Instant Messenger. 'Regin's developers put considerable effort into making it highly inconspicuous,' Symantec said. 'Its low key nature means it can potentially be used in espionage campaigns lasting several years. 'Even when its presence is detected, it is very difficult to ascertain what it is doing. Symantec was only able to analyse the payloads after it decrypted sample files.' Professor Watson said it is was difficult to draw conclusions about the purpose of Regin or its origin. 'The targets are what you expect from a western nation,' he told MailOnline. 'So it seems reasonable that it came from them. 'That said, there is a fine tradition of false flagging in intelligence, where you make something look like it came from somewhere else, by targeting countries that throw people off the scent.' Where did it come from? Regin is highly sophisticated and may have taken months or even years to complete. Computers can be infected with the software through means including fake internet sites and instant messenger programs . The researchers said many components of Regin are still probably undiscovered and that there could be new versions of this tool which have not yet been detected. The news comes amid heightened concerns on cyber espionage. Last month, separate teams of security researchers said the Russian and Chinese governments are likely behind widespread cyber espionage that has hit targets in the US and elsewhere. One team of researchers led by the security firm Novetta Solutions said it identified a hacker group believed to act 'on behalf of a Chinese government intelligence apparatus.' A separate report by the security firm FireEye said a long-running effort to hack into US defence contractors, Eastern European governments and European security organisations is 'likely sponsored by the Russian government.' However, Professor Watson said he is not concerned about Regin. 'When we had the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, it was the intelligence that both sides were getting that stopped us from having a global nuclear war. 'Intelligence sometimes defends us all.'","Regin may have been created by Western state to spy on governments .

"The Mediterranean has become 'another Somalia', Italy's naval chief has warned, as criminal gangs importing migrants to Europe by the thousand wreak havoc on the high seas. Admiral Giuseppe De Giorgi, head of the Italian Navy, said that the influx of migrants had grown 'exponentially' in the last few months to reach 'Biblical proportions'. It comes as the UN today said that an estimated 6,000 Syrian and Eritrean migrants, including women and newborn babies, have been rescued by Italy's navy in four days, while thousands more asylum seekers keen to reach Europe have gathered in Libya. Italy has been forced to step up military efforts to match the surge in trafficking operations, he said, but was fighting a losing battle. Desperate: A boat packed with African migrants approach the coastline of Lampedusa, Italy, the gateway for illegal migrants entering Europe . 'Like Somalia': Admiral Giuseppe De Giorgi (left), head of the Italian Navy, made the comments after Italy's interior minister, Angelino . Alfano (right), warned that more than half a million migrants are ready to set . sail from North Africa . The emergency comes as Italy's interior minister, Angelino Alfano, warned that more than half a million migrants are ready to set sail from North Africa. Since October last year almost 19,000 migrants have landed on the Italian coastline, roughly a ten-fold increase on the year before. British experts believe one in five continue on to the UK. Italy's southernmost island, Lampedusa, 70 miles off Tunisia, is the gateway for illegal migrants entering Europe. More than 40,000 people made the crossing to Italy last year, often in crowded and unseaworthy boats. Sent back: Migrants, who were arrested after an attempt to reach Europe, wait yesterday before being transferred to police facilities in Tripoli, Libya . Flushed out: Chronic famine and ongoing civil conflict has driven almost a million Somali refugees from their homeland in one of the worst humanitarian crises the world has seen . Admiral De Giorgi said the number of migrants entering Italy by boat surged by 300 per cent in 2013. Following a tragic shipwreck off the island of Lampedusa that killed some 300 migrants, the military's search and rescue operation was stepped up. The Italians were forced to up their numbers to 900 Navy seamen engaged to combat the trafficking, he said. 'But we know there are 600,000 or 700,000 waiting in camps. Even though 350 people died –it makes no difference to the influx.' Tragic: Following a tragic shipwreck off the island of Lampedusa that killed some 300 migrants, the military's search and rescue operation was stepped up . Arrested: More than sixty traffickers have been arrested since last October, and face up to 13 years prison each . Conversely the improved rescue operation, following the accident, 'has created a boom,' in landings, he said, with up to six boats a day calling for rescue, often hundreds of miles from shore. He said: 'The Mediterranean used to be a peaceful lake. Now it is another Somalia.' In one incident the Italian Navy stalked a 'mother ship' carrying Egyptian traffickers for four hours using submarines, before successfully capturing it in a daring chase across the high seas. He said: 'We were following the mother ship with a submarine. The traffickers herded all the migrants into a dinghy, gave them a satellite phone and pointed them in the right direction for land. 'It then turned and headed back towards Egypt at full speed. One of our frigates gave chase firing warning shots, but they would not stop. 'Eventually the frigate fired on the rudders to disable the ship and we were able to capture her and the traffickers on board.' More than sixty traffickers have been arrested since last October, and face up to 13 years prison each. Under EU rules migrants are obliged to remain in the country where they first seek asylum. But most want to head to northern Europe were there are more job opportunities and generous benefits.","Adm. Giuseppe De Giorgi says migrants into Europe grown 'exponentially'

"In the rough and tumble of football more than a century and a half ago, the 40 players involved in each game were allowed to push over their opponents and even punch the ball to score. Now a group of four schools will tomorrow play a tournament by the 1858 rules at the world’s oldest football ground - Sandygate Road of non-league team Hallam FC in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. The unusual games will be played as closely to the historic Sheffield Rules as possible under modern health and safety laws, and will be officiated by former Premier League referee Uriah Rennie, 53. Early days: This is a 1857 photograph of Sheffield Football Club, the world's oldest football team. A group of four schools in South Yorkshire will tomorrow play a tournament by the rules written around the same time . Host stadium: A group of four schools will tomorrow play a tournament by the 1858 rules at the world's oldest football ground - Sandygate Road of non-league team Hallam FC in Sheffield, South Yorkshire . It is believed to be the first time . that the rules - which prohibit scoring directly from free kicks - will . be used in a match since the Football Association was founded in 1863, . reported The Independent. The . handwritten rulebook - auctioned off by the world’s oldest football . club Sheffield FC for almost £900,000 in 2011 - features 11 rules that . include players having to wear red or blue flannel caps. Back . then players competed in 20-a-side matches which could last from one to . three hours, and could catch the ball provided it had not touched the . ground or been thrown from the touchline. The . game, which was originally derived from rugby, was very different to . the 21st century sport but formed the basis of the Football Association . rulebook which was published five years later in 1863. The Sheffield Rules were put together . with help from earlier regulations - in particular those used by Cambridge . University and other public schools, who were the first people to play . the game. In charge: The unusual games will be played as closely to the historic Sheffield Rules as possible under modern health and safety laws, and will be officiated by former Premier League referee Uriah Rennie (pictured) Modern game: It's debatable how well the top footballers of today such as Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard (pictured right playing for England against Brazil earlier this month) would have fared with the old rules . It was the Sheffield FC set which were influential in the rapid development of football over the next four decades, and the majority of modern football clubs were founded between 1858 and 1900. 'It's been a real eye-opener learning the original rules to referee this competition' Uriah Rennie, referee . Historian Michael Wood told The Independent he wanted to use the experience of the matches tomorrow to understand why football evolved so fast after the original rules were put in place. He said: ‘We are always told that football is the great sport of the industrial age. I would love to learn why the game developed so rapidly into the major spectator sport we know today.’ The teams in tomorrow’s tournament will play an adapted version of the rules, with 30-minute games of eight or 12-a-side - and will not be allowed to deliberately push their opponents. Rennie will be wearing Victorian clothing - including a top hat - to officiate the games, and told The Independent it has ‘been a real eye-opener learning the original rules to referee this competition’. Sheffield FC still exist and currently play in the Northern Premier League Division One South. Hallam FC are also an active non-league side and play in the Northern Counties East League Division One.

"Bus drivers in Seattle were forced to wear diapers or carry a jar with them on their route because access to toilets was so bad, a report has claimed. Drivers' restrooms were not open all hour buses run and some routes did not have toilets within walking distance of bus stops, forcing drivers to wet themselves or urinate in a bottle. King County Metro Transit had to replace 60 urine-soaked driver's seats in a year and have been fined for not providing facilities for their workers. Bus drivers in Seattle were forced to wear diapers or carry a jar with them on their route because access to toilets was so bad (file picture) At times, drivers who went to search for toilets were subsequently punished for running late, according to a report from the Department of Labor and Industries. King County Metro Transit also failed to ensure Othello Station, Rainier Valley, had running water, paper towels and soap for six years, the Seattle Times reported. Drivers may have put passengers at risk by holding it in and losing their composure at the wheel because of the lack of bathroom facilities and could have also damaged their kidneys. Speaking to transport magazine Crosscut, Metro operator Hal Poor said: 'We’ve had drivers wear Depends diapers [a brand of adult diaper]. We’ve had operators carry a jar for urination. 'We’ve got pregnant women who are still driving. You know what kind of pressure that puts on your bladder. We have gentlemen 60 or older. They can’t hold it anymore.' Drivers get a five-minute break between runs and are supposed to have 15-minute break every five hours - but Mr Poor in reality breaks of this length are few and far between. Drivers' restrooms were not open all hour buses run and some routes did not have toilets within walking distance of bus stops, forcing drivers to wet themselves or urinate in a bottle (file picture) 'How guaranteed is the 15-minute break if you want to stay on schedule and you’re 12 minutes late?' he asked. 'It’s on paper, but if you get caught in traffic, it doesn’t mean you’re getting it.' King County Metro Transit was ordered to pay a $3,500 fine by December 22 and come up with a plan to tackle the problem. Kevin Desmond, Metro’s general manager, said the fine was a wake-up call. He said: 'I would not characterize this as a program failure or a management failure. We learn as people help us see issues we’re challenged with.'","Bus drivers forced to wear diapers and urinate in jars on their routes .

"Fraser, pictured at the funeral of his former gangland boss Charlie Richardson in 2012, is currently in an induced coma in Kings Hospital in south London . Family and friends of notorious gangster 'Mad' Frankie Fraser, who is in a coma and being kept alive by a life support machine, have gathered to say their goodbyes. The 90-year-old criminal, who has spent almost half his life in prison, is in a critical condition at Kings Hospital in south London after reportedly undergoing surgery on Friday. He was induced into a coma in the intensive care unit following complications during an operation and a bedside vigil was held last night. A family source told The Mirror: 'Doctors fear that because of his age his body is struggling to cope with the operation. It does not look good at all. 'He is a tough old sod and we know he will fight as hard as he ever has. We all hope he comes through this.' It is believed he had gone into hospital for a hip operation but doctors spotted he had a fractured left leg two weeks later, according to media reports. The injury is thought to be a recurring one suffered during the 1969 Parkhurst Prison riots on the Isle of Wight, when he spent six weeks in the prison hospital. Another friend, speaking to The Sun, said: 'Frankie's one tough b****** - but this looks like it might be the end. Everyone fears the worst.' His ex-partner Marilyn Wiseby, who is the daughter of Great Train Robber Tommy Wiseby, told the paper: 'It's a terrible shock. Frank is the most honest man I have known.' A source also confirmed that his son Francis, 58, had gone to the hospital last night to be with his father. Fraser is one of the last surviving ‘celebrity criminals’ after he joined turf wars between London gangs in the sixties. He was a member of the Richardson gang or the 'torture gang', led by brothers Charlie and Eddie Richardson, and  were widely feared in London’s underworld. Prior to that he was a bodyguard to notorious gangland leader Billy Hill, where he took part in bank robberies and and carried out razor blade attacks - which earned him £50 a time. He has spent 42 years – almost half his life – in prison for 26 offences. The former gangland leader, who was infamous for pulling out rivals' teeth with a pair of pliers, was handed an Asbo last year after flying into a rage with a fellow pensioner at his care home. Staff called police after things got heated between Fraser and the 87-year-old man, who has dementia, after he found him sitting in his favourite seat. Scroll down for video .

Fraser, pictured left in his police mug shot in the 1960s and right in 1956 before he was jailed for seven years . Fraser was jailed for 10 years in 1967 for his part in the Richardson gang, where he tortured people by pulling out their teeth with pliers if they were disloyal . He was admitted to sheltered accommodation in Bermondsey, south east London, just a few miles from haunts during his criminal career, when living along became 'too much for him', his family said. Speaking about the incident last year his son, David, explained: ‘They were always rowing and it ended up with the police being called. 'The other man had dementia and was not all there. All he did was bark back at him. ‘He said it was about rowing as they were all screaming and shouting at each other. 'My dad ended up with an Asbo, but he was not the only person to get one. He laughed about it. Fraser dated Marilyn Wiseby, daughter of the Great Train Robber, Tommy Wiseby, for a number of years . In the 1960s, Fraser joined turf wars with the Richardson gang brothers, Eddie (left) and Charlie (right) Fraser also worked for notorious gang leader Billy Hill (pictured) who paid him £50 to carry out razor attacks . Fraser, left, pictured with the notorious Richardson brother - Eddie and Charlie, during their reign in the 1960s . The Richardson brothers - Charlie and Eddie - who formed the self-named gang, which also became known as the torture gang - in the 1960s. The gang were fierce rivals to the notorious Kray twins . 'They said it was effectively a warning. It didn’t make much difference to him and he carried on as he normally did. It was a really funny turnout.' His son added: ‘There are no problems now and the other people in the home are very protective of him. 'He’s quite popular among them because he likes to treat them if he gets a few quid. They all know about his background, because they are all from the same area. He has spent 42 years in prison for 26 offences. His first offence was stealing a pack of cigarettes when he was 13. Here he is pictured greeting Reggie Kray at the funeral of his older brother Charles Junior in 2000 . Even as a pensioner the gangster was unable to keep out of trouble and last year was given an Asbo after he got into an argument with an 87-year-old man for sitting in his favourite armchair at their care home . 'Mad' Frankie Fraser, 90, is in a critical condition in hospital after complications during surgery . Born Francis Fraser, in Lambeth, south London, he committed his first crime at the age of 13, when he stole a packet of cigarettes and was sent to an approved school. What officers didn't know then was that his crime spree would continue over a career spanning seven decades, and his offences only worsened. It was during the Second World War that he was branded 'Mad' Frankie, after he feigned a mental illness to avoid being called up to the front line. He then became involved in serious crime - and the  war provided a perfect backdrop with the blackout, rationing and a shortage of police officers. At 17 he was sent to Borstal for breaking and entering a hosiery shop in Waterloo and was then given a 15-month prison sentence for shopbreaking. After the war he was involved in a smash-and-grab raid on a jeweller's and was given a two year prison sentence. In the 1950s he worked for underworld boss Billy Hill and carried out razor attacks on victims for £50 each. He later joined the notorious Richardson gang, formed by brothers Eddie and Charlie, and began carrying out more criminal activities. They set up a fruit machine enterprise, which they would sell to pub landlords, to cover up their crimes. In 1966 he was charged with the murder of Richard Hart, who was shot at a club in Catford, but the charges were dropped when a witness changed their testimony. The following year he was involved in a torture trial the Old Bailey, where members of the gang were charged with electrocuting, whipping and burning those disloyal to them. Fraser himself was charged with pulling out people's teeth with pliers and sentenced to 10 years in prison. During his time behind bars he was involved in violence and was a major instigator in the Parkhurst Prison riots in 1969. Each incident added more time to his sentence. His last jail term ended in 1989, but in 2011 he was handed an Asbo after getting into an argument with a fellow pensioner at the sheltered accommodation he stays at in Bermondsey.","Frankie Fraser, 90, is in a critical condition in Kings Hospital in London .

"Brett Fuller, a NSW taxi driver, saved the life of 18-year-old Alexis Felstein who was the victim of an alleged random stabbing attack . Police have praised the actions of a taxi driver who risked his own life to save an 18-year-old woman from an alleged vicious attack. Alexis Felstein was randomly attacked by a 22-year-old man at Lismore in northern New South Wales in the early hours of Saturday morning according to police, when a passing taxi driver stopped to intervene. Brett Fuller noticed Ms Felstein, who he told the Northern Star was 'covered in blood' and 'screaming', when he pulled over and took her into his cab. 'I thought I was going to die, there was so much blood,' Ms Felstein said of her ordeal. Mr Fuller immediately contacted police and advised them of the alleged attacker's car registration details before rushing Ms Felstein to the closest hospital. The teenage victim had sustained multiple wounds to her head, arm and upper body during the alleged stabbing and was taken in for emergency surgery. She was later moved to Gold Coast University Hospital for microsurgery on her arm. Cameron Lindsay, the crime manager for the Richmond Local Area Command, told the Northern Star that Mr Fuller's actions saved Ms Felstein's life. Ms Felstein had sustained multiple wounds to her head and upper body during the alleged stabbing and was taken in for emergency surgery. She was later moved to Gold Coast University Hospital in Robina (pictured) for microsurgery . 'To approach this person and also take care of the victim in his taxis, that allowed the police to commandeer the taxi and take the taxi and the victim to hospital. Without that quick action and taking that victim to hospital, she would have died,' Mr Lindsay said. However Mr Fuller has deflected all praise, instead turning the attention to Ms Felstein who he called 'the bravest girl in the world'. Mr Lindsay also applauded Mr Fuller's quick thinking. The cab driver's actions of recording the alleged attacker's registration details led police to arrest the 22-year-old driver of a white Daihatsu Charade on the same night that Ms Felstein was allegedly attacked.

"Privacy campaigner: Max Mosley . Labour has turned down a £1million offer from ex-Formula 1 boss Max Mosley to fund a campaign linking David Cameron to the phone hacking scandal. The multi-millionaire, who won damages from the now-defunct News of the World over claims he organised a Nazi-themed orgy, is now a privacy campaigner. He hoped to bankroll an attack on the Prime Minister by highlighting his ties with Andy Coulson – who was editor of the Sunday tabloid and later hired as the Conservative leader’s spin doctor. His ‘anti-Cameron’ election drive was to focus on marginal constituencies with the aim of swinging winnable seats to Labour. Using formal donation channels, it is claimed the ‘substantial’ offer to Labour was made a year ago. But Mr Mosley, 74, told a newspaper yesterday: ‘I have not heard back from them.’ It is not clear if there were any serious discussions by Labour over whether to take the sum, which would have given a huge boost to its coffers during a general election campaign. Yesterday a party source confirmed it had been rejected, saying: ‘We don’t take money with strings attached’. Coulson, who became Mr Cameron’s PR chief in 2007 and was brought into No 10 as director of communications in 2010, has just been released from prison after serving five months for conspiring to hack phone messages. Although Mr Cameron insists he took ‘full responsibility’ for hiring Coulson, Labour leader Ed Miliband has accused the Prime Minister of bringing a criminal ‘into the heart of Downing Street’. Echoing the comments yesterday, Mr Mosley told The Independent: ‘I feel strongly that David Cameron should no longer remain in office as Prime Minister. He took a criminal into Downing Street.’ Mr Mosley was president of the FIA – the international governing body for Formula 1 and other motor sports – when the News of the World published videos and photos of him taking part in a sado-masochistic orgy in 2008 in which German was spoken and uniforms were worn. He successfully sued for breach of privacy and won £60,000 in damages after the judge ruled there was no evidence to justify calling it a Nazi orgy. Coulson (right) who became Mr Cameron’s PR chief in 2007 and was brought into No 10 as director of communications in 2010, has just been released from prison after serving five months for conspiring to hack phone messages . Mr Mosley has since campaigned to change European and UK privacy laws and privately underwrote some of the legal cases brought by victims of phone hacking. He has argued in the European Court of Human Rights that ‘prior notification’ should be given to the subjects of newspaper reports to allow them to organise injunctions. Some of the Sunday tabloid’s photographs are still online, and last year Mr Mosley won a case in France to stop Google providing links to stories about his sexual past. Labour last night said it does not comment on individual donations.However, the offer comes at a time when Labour is struggling to match Tory election funding, with insiders estimating the party has raised less than half of what may be needed to fund a strong campaign. Mr Mosley said he understood his offer might be viewed with some concern following the row over a £1million donation by F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone to Labour in 2007. It was later linked to the Blair government’s announcement that grand prix races would be exempt from a tobacco advertising ban. Coulson faces a further trial in Scotland next year on perjury charges related to his 2010 account of phone hacking during the trial of former MSP Tommy Sheridan.","Magnate hoped to bankroll   attack by highlighting ties with Andy Coulson .

"Labour last night unveiled plans to save £250million by scrapping police commissioners and quadrupling the cost of gun licenses. Yvette Cooper said the money, which would be saved from the Home Office budget, would help protect frontline policing in the first of Labour's reviews of Whitehall's departments to see where money can be saved. Plans for the Home Office include plans to make savings of at least £172million a year by reforming police procurement through mandatory joint purchasing of equipment by police forces. Labour wants to reform police procurement by making forces purchase equipment jointly . Elected Police and Crime Commissioners will be scrapped, saving £50million next year - in order to save the 1,100 police officers set to be axed according to Home Office plans for 2015/16. And the cost of a gun license will be put up from £50 to almost £200. The implementation of full-cost recovery for gun licensing will raise £17.2million a year. Another £9million will come from increased fees for police driver offender retraining. Yvette Cooper, the Shadow Home Secretary, said: 'Under the Tories' policies and spending plans, another 1,100 police officers are due to be cut next year alone, with the police warning that many more officers and vital public duties are at risk. 'This first stage of Labour's Zero-Based Review of the Home Office shows how Labour plans can make savings to help get the deficit down and prevent 1,100 officers being cut next year. 'The police are already struggling to cope with growing crimes such as violent crime, child sex exploitation, online child abuse and online fraud, and prosecutions are falling as they can't get cases to trial.' Labour's policing report has highlighted several instances of poor management in Home Office police spending. This includes deep disparities in the cost of equipment purchased by individual forces – for example the price paid for high-visibility jackets varying fivefold between £20 and £100. Yvette Cooper said: 'Under the Tories' policies and spending plans, another 1,100 police officers are due to be cut next year alone, with the police warning that many more officers and vital public duties are at risk' In a separate announcement yesterday, Ed Miliband called for new regulations to help crack down on 'rogue' job agencies. The Labour leader said he wanted to see a system of licensing for recruitment agencies, saying some of them break minimum wage laws and exploit workers by undercutting the pay of permanent staff. He also called for a 'national mission' to create 400,000 extra engineers by 2020. Labour has been carrying out so-called 'zero-based reviews' of each government department, to see where money can be saved. Chris Leslie, Labour's Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: 'The next Labour government will finish the job of balancing the books but we will do so in a fairer way by making different choices from the Tories.' Last night a Conservative spokesman said: 'Nobody will believe a word Labour say on the deficit – they've opposed every step we've taken to cut it, and the independent IFS say Labour's policy means £28billion more borrowing and more debt. 'And because Ed Miliband forgot even to mention the deficit in what he called his job interview for being Prime Minister, it's clear that he's just not up to it.'","Labour says scrapping police commissioners would save £50million .

"An Arkansas mother is pushing for a 'child abuse registry' to be implemented in her home state to protect other families from the 'monster nanny' who terrorized her child and may now be free to harm others.

Because Raylee, now three, wasn't physically injured in the attack, Melissa was able to plead guilty to the least serious felony permitted by the law, a class D 'endangering the welfare of a minor' charge. Since she pleaded guilty and it was her first-time offence, Melissa's record can be expunged altogether after her four-year probation is up in 2017, under Arkansas' Act 346. And since there is no publicly accessible online registry for child abusers in the U.S. - only one for sex offenders - Melissa could work as a nanny again for another family without that family knowing about her past. Victim: In the face of the evidence, Melissa pleaded guilty to 'endangering the welfare of a minor,' did 90 days in prison and after three years of probation, can have her record expunged. Pictured, Raylee as a toddler . Cruel: Whitney set up a nanny-cam - a device which looks like an alarm clock but conceals a hidden camera - and captured Melissa carrying Raylee around 'like a rag doll' as she cried (pictured) Aggressive: Melissa then violently shakes little Raylee from side to side as she screams in distress . Busted: Melissa, who was a former high school classmate of Whitney and had undergone background checks before being hired, also spanked Ralyee in the footage (pictured) Whitney hired Melissa, who happened to be a former high school classmate, in October 2012 after posting the job to her Facebook account. The cautious mom, relieved that this was an acquaintance and not a complete stranger, ran a background check on Melissa, got a reference and set up a trial session with her and Raylee. At first, things seemed to go well and Melissa was hired, but things soon took a turn for the worse when Raylee began acting strangely. According to Whitney, her daughter starting screaming and crying as soon as Melissa would arrive to look after her - something her doctor suspected was separation anxiety. Melissa would also claim that Raylee was taking four-hour naps, something that set off immediate alarm bells for Whitney, since her daughter never napped for much more than an hour. Spotted: At the end of the first day of surveillance, Melissa  discovered the nanny-cam (pictured) and turned the camera lens to face the wall . Brazen: Raylee was rushed to the hospital and underwent a series of testing, but fortunately was given the all-clear. Pictured, Melissa inspects the nanny-cam . Suspicious, Whitney set up a nanny-cam - a device which looks like an alarm clock but conceals a hidden camera. At the end of the first day of surveillance, Melissa  discovered the nanny-cam and turned the camera lens to face the wall. 'My heart leapt in my throat,' Whitney said when she noticed it had been flipped round. Upon watching the footage, the frantic mother witnessed Melissa leaving Raylee in her bouncer for two hours, spanking her and then aggressively shaking her 'like a rag doll.' Raylee was rushed to hospital and underwent a series of testing, including an MRI, but fortunately was given the all-clear. Fortunate: The police offer who attended the scene told Whitney: 'I think if you hadn't caught this when you did, you would have come to no baby anymore.' Pictured, Raylee now with her dad (center) and mom (right) Action plan: Whitney states, 'In 2015, we’re going to send out a bill asking that [Arkansas] implements the child abuse registry so that parents can check before they leave their children with a [carer]' Cuddles: According to her parents, Raylee (pictured) is now a 'happy and healthy' three-year-old . The police offer who attended the scene told Whitney: 'I think if you hadn't caught this when you did, you would have come to no baby anymore.' Melissa was arrested when she brazenly turned up to work two days later, and later pleaded guilty to endangering Raylee's welfare. Nanny-cam: A device similar to the one Whitney used to record the incriminating footage . She has now completed her jail sentence and is still on probation. When ABC confronted her outside her Springdale apartment, she stormed into her home and then called the reporter. 'This is Melissa Medema and you came to my residence this morning,' she said. 'First of all, I do not appreciate that. Do not come back to my residence, do not contact me.' Raylee is now a 'happy and healthy' three-year-old, and Whitney has been working with Arkansas lawmakers, Representative Greg Leding and Senator Jon Woods, to push new legislation. 'In 2015, we’re going to send out a bill asking that they actually implement the child abuse registry,' Whitney says. 'Arkansas will be the first state to have one, if it passes. She added: 'I want all of the states to adopt it. What I want is for anybody who has been criminally convicted of child abuse, or any crime against a child, that they be listed on that registry so that parents can check before they leave their children with a babysitter, a nanny, a neighbor.'","Nanny Melissa Medema was caught on a hidden camera spanking and shaking one-year-old Raylee Matney 'like a rag doll' in 2012 .
She pleaded guilty to endangering the welfare of a minor in 2014 and was sentenced to 90 days in jail and three years probation .

"One in five trainee teachers cannot do simple sums or pass basic spelling and grammar tests. One in ten have failed their final-year numeracy and literacy tests twice in a row, while dozens have needed an astonishing ten attempts. One clearly innumerate trainee was allowed 37 resits to get through the maths paper. Astonishing: One in ten trainee teachers have failed their final-year numeracy and literacy tests twice in a row, while dozens have needed ten attempts (picture posed by model) Critics said yesterday those who take multiple resits should not be teaching and will have a detrimental impact on their pupils. From next year, Education Secretary Michael Gove is limiting the number of retakes to just two. Trainees have to pass basic skills tests in literacy, numeracy and ICT (information and communication technology) before they qualify for the classroom. The pass mark is a modest 60 per cent. The latest figures from the Training and Development Agency for Schools reveal that in 2009/10, a fifth of trainees failed both the numeracy and literacy tests first time round. Some 6,957 failed literacy and numeracy on the second attempt, while 1,508 failed either discipline on their fifth attempt. Changes: Education Secretary Michael Gove, pictured here with children at Cuckoo Hall Primary School in Edmonton in 2010, is from next year limiting the number of re-takes to two . More disturbing still are the vast number of resits some trainees have been granted before passing. One took 37 tries to pass numeracy and 57 would-be teachers passed only on their 19th attempt. Standards have fallen during the last five years. Of the 32,717 trainees who passed their numeracy test in the academic year 2003/4, 83.6 per cent did so first time. And of the 33,412 trainees who passed their literacy test, 86.4 per cent did so at the first attempt. Last year the figure was 80 per cent for both. Under Mr Gove’s plans, woefully poor trainees will no longer be allowed in the classroom. His policy would have weeded out 1,963 for poor literacy and 2,939 for poor numeracy last year. But critics say his crackdown does not go far enough. Passing the numeracy test has been a requirement of Qualified Teacher Status since 2000. Passing tests in literacy and  ICT were made compulsory the following year. Students sit the online tests in the final year of teacher training. They were originally allowed just four or five attempts to pass. But Labour scrapped the rule in 2001 to allow unlimited resits. Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: ‘It’s shocking we have allowed people to become teachers who don’t  fully grasp our language or  handle numbers and who we have let slip through the net on the  37th attempt. ‘The nature of tests is that ...  people will be able to fluke them, which means they pass but have no proper understanding of the subject – much like with driving  tests. Three attempts will reduce  this possibility, but it does not go  far enough.’ * Teachers organised activities for . three classes of 24 pupils and four classes of 28 pupils.

"Challenging: Education Secretary Michael Gove today told MPs new GCSE exams would be more ambitious and more rigorous. Michael Gove today declared an end to . the 'cram and forget' style of learning as he unveiled new GCSE exams to . help young British teenagers compete with the best in the world. The Education Secretary unveiled the . biggest schools shake-up in a generation, putting a new emphasis on . tougher testing for 16-year-olds, with less coursework and more focus on . exams at the end of two-year courses. Teenagers will have to study more Dickens, poetry, algebra, genetics and ecology to acheive the best grades to bring an end to ‘discredited’ qualifications. Mr Gove told the Commons the new exams will be 'more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous'. He added: 'Young people in this country deserve an education system that can compete with the best in the world, a system which sets – and achieves – high expectations. 'Today’s reforms are essential to achieve this goal. 'By making GCSEs more demanding, more fulfilling, and more stretching we can give our young people the broad, deep and balanced education which will equip them to win in the global race.' Pupils in England will start studying in September 2015 for new GCSEs in English language, English literature, maths, biology, chemistry, physics, combined science, geography and history. They are due sit the first exams in the summer of 2017. In English literature, pupils will be asked to study at least one play by Shakespeare, Romantic poetry, a 19th century novel, poetry from the 1850s onwards, and fiction or drama since the First World War, according to documents published by the Department for Education. The new maths GCSE features advanced algebra, statistics, ratio, probability and geometry, while those students who choose to take geography will undertake two different types of fieldwork which will be assessed in an exam. And in history, pupils will have to complete an in-depth study based on one of three periods - Medieval (500-1500), Early Modern (1450-1750) or Modern (1700 to present day). The new GCSE history course also contains no controlled assessment - coursework completed in the classroom - with exams based on extended essays and short answers. New science GCSEs contain practical experiments and extended work on topics such as genetics, ecology, energy and space. Mr Gove said the changes mean 'more extended writing in subjects like English and history; more testing of advanced problem-solving skills in mathematics and science; more testing of mathematics in science GCSEs, to improve progression to A Levels. 'More challenging mechanics problems in physics; a stronger focus on evolution and genetics in biology; and a greater focus on foreign language composition, so that pupils require deeper language skills. 'This higher level of demand will equip our children to go onto higher education or a good apprenticeship - and we can raise the bar knowing that we have the best generation of teachers ever in our schools to help students achieve more than ever before.' Grade inflation: The government claims increases in GCSE pass rates show the exams have been getting easier and reform is needed . The government believes a return to . traditional academic subjects and the slashing of coursework and resits . will ‘restore rigour’ to the education system. Education . minister Liz Truss claimed rising results every summer had disguised . the fact that exams were getting easier in a 'race to the bottom' by . exam boards. She said: 'We . cannot carry on with a system that isn’t delivering, where there has . been rampant grade inflation and where international league tables tell . us we have stagnated compared with the rest of the world. 'For . too long we have pretended that students’ results are getting better, . whereas actually all that has been happening is that exams have been . getting easier and there has been a race to the bottom between exam . boards. We need to stop that happening now,' she told BBC Breakfast. Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg raised concerns about results depending on end-of-year exams . But shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said he was worried the assessment of pupils at GCSE would become more unreliable if the Government moved towards focusing on end-of-course exams. He said: ''Moving towards linear assessment will reduce the reliability of GCSE - less coursework means less assessment time which leads inevitably to lower reliability. 'This is about as cast iron a rule in assessment as there is'.' Christine Blower, from the National Union of Teachers, expressed . concern with the proposals and felt they were being 'rushed'. She said: 'We think this is slightly rushed and demeans the achievements of students who have taken GCSEs in the past' She . also refuted suggestions that exams are getting easier. 'Just because . more children are successful does not mean that exams are getting . easier,' she said. Exams watchdog Ofqual is to consult on a new grading scale based on numbers one to eight, with eight the top grade. There will be fewer awards, to reflect the harder content, and greater differentiation among more able candidates. Education Department sources said coursework and ‘controlled assessment’– a kind of supervised coursework, which now accounts for 25 per cent of the final mark – had been ‘very badly abused’ and would be almost entirely replaced with written exams. A small number of subjects such as science, will still involve practicals.  ‘In what is considered a “pass”, now widely thought of as a C, there will be an increase in demand to reflect that of high-performing jurisdictions like Shanghai and Finland,’ said a source. Stringent: Language exams will be tougher with more English to foreign language exercises . Mr Gove’s allies insist Labour will not be able to stop the new exams if they win power in May 2015. A new curriculum will be in place from September 2014 and exam boards will prepare for the new papers years ahead. Ofqual is also unlikely to agree to undo the reforms. Wales and Northern Ireland have made clear they do not want the reform and Ofqual will have to rename the GCSE in England to distinguish it from their exams. Sources close to Mr Gove did not . recognise the name ‘i-Level’, which had been rumoured, and said no . decision had been made on what the new exam should be called. New curriculum: There will be a greater number of written exams as the coursework component was 'abused' as an easy way to gain marks . GCSE pass rates have soared in recent years. Last year, 22.4 per cent of passes were at A or A*. In 1988, when the exam began, 8.6 per cent got a top grade. A study by King’s College London and Durham University found attainment in maths had changed little since the mid-1970s, despite results. Mr Gove was forced to retreat from a plan to replace the GCSE with an English Baccalaureate Certificate, set by a single exam body, but today’s reforms still represent the biggest shake-up since the GCSE was introduced.","New tougher GCSEs will start from September 2015 .

The smile that says it all: Prince Charles couldn't hide his joy at the birth of his first grandchild in York today - smiling and joking with members of the crowd . India, from York, explained: 'He said hello and who's this, and I said this is Henry  and he is excited for your imminent arrival. 'And he said ""oh yes, we are excited"".' Charles then continued with his official duties but his joy was plain to see as he smiled and joked with the crowd. Later in the evening as Prince Charles left a function at Harewood House, near Leeds, was asked if there was any news from the hospital. Despite his grandson being born at 4.24pm today at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, Prince Charles laughed as he replied: ‘No. You'll hear before I do, I suspect.’ He was asked by a number of guests at the function whether he had heard anything from the hospital and he said he had not. His comments come as the Queen today returned to London after spending the night at Windsor Castle, travelling by car to Buckingham Palace. Return: The Queen arrived at Buckingham Palace this afternoon after leaving Windsor Castle, in time for her great-grandson's birth at 4.24pm . New child: But it is not yet known when the Queen will meet her new grandson for the first time . Return: The Queen was in London when the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth . Great-grandmother: The Queen left Windsor Castle this afternoon on her way back to Buckingham Palace . But while the Queen decided to return to London, Charles remained more than 200 miles away in the North of England, showing . that not even the most exciting family drama can stop him carrying out . his Royal duties. He arrived at the National Railway Museum in York by steam train as he began a two-day visit to Yorkshire today. The Prince stepped off the Royal Carriage through clouds of steam, to applause and cheers from the crowd. The . carriage was pulled into the museum by Bittern, the sister engine of . Mallard, which marked 75 years as the world's fastest steam train . earlier this month. Visit: While his daughter-in-law went into labour, Prince Charles tried out a steam train at the National Railway Museum in York . Out and about: Prince Charles greeted crowds in York as he continued his official visit despite the impending birth of his first grandchild . Dedicated: The Prince was not distracted from his Royal duties by the news the Duchess of Cambridge had gone into labour . Tribute: The Prince of Wales was visiting the centre to mark the success of the Mallard Locomotive . As he alighted, he spoke to well-wishers who had turned out to welcome him. Alex Dickinson and her sons, Thomas, seven, and Freddie, five, . travelled from nearby Church Fenton to catch a glimpse of Charles. She wished the Prince well with his grandchild as her children gave him a picture of a giraffe for the baby. She said her son Freddie had said the royal baby was coming in six hours, to which Charles replied: 'Yes, it may well be.' Asked by another bystander this afternoon, whether . there was any news from the hospital, the Prince replied: 'Absolutely . nothing at the moment - we're waiting.' Gift: The Prince was handed a teddy by members of the crowd outside the museum . On his visit Charles blew the whistle . of the Doncaster-built Mallard, which broke the world record for steam . when it reached 126mph on the East Coast Main Line in July 1938. It is . now a permanent exhibit at the museum. He met retired Mallard driver Bernard . Bell, 89, who once transported the Queen on a royal visit when he was . working as a fireman on another locomotive. Mr Bell, from York, who drove Mallard, . Bittern and similar engines for decades, said: 'He was very interested . in the locomotives and he asked me all sorts of questions about my . driving. It's the first time I've met him and he seemed very nice.' Charles also looked round the museum's . collection of royal carriages, including Queen Victoria's favourite . carriage, King Edward's saloon and Queen Elizabeth's saloon, used by the . Royal Family during the Second World War. The visit was the first event of the . tour of Yorkshire by the Prince, who will be joined by the Duchess of . Cornwall tomorrow when he will visit rural communities before ending up . in the seaside town of Bridlington.

Tour: The Prince of Wales was shown the Doncaster-built Mallard and the museum's collection of royal carriages . Engagements: Charles will visit several sites in central Yorkshire today before finishing with a reception for Prince's Trust supporters at Harewood House, near Leeds . He then moved on to York Minster, where he was greeted by cheering crowds and the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu. He walked through the magnificent interior of the Gothic cathedral with the Archbishop as tourists stopped to take photographs. He . was given a private tour of a recently opened state-of-the-art visitor . attraction, Revealing York Minster, in the Undercroft before moving on . to the workshops to talk to the craftsmen and apprentices restoring the . building. Charles even had a go with a chisel and a hammer as he talked to the stonemasons. The . Dean of York, the Very Reverend Vivienne Faull, said: 'We're proud and . excited that he's come today - but especially today because, in the life . of his family, this is going to be such an important day.' The Dean said she was especially pleased the Prince took such an interest in the apprentices working at the Minster. Exhibits: The Prince of Wales was shown around the museum's collection of royal carriages . Smiling: The Prince seemed happy and relaxed will looking around the museum's collection of trains . Train fan: Charles was apparently very interested in the vintage locomotives he saw in the museum . As the Prince left the workshops, in glorious sunshine, he was greeted by crowds shouting 'congratulations'. One York resident, John Dowson, had a joke with the Prince, shouting out 'It's triplets!' as a joke and receiving a generous laugh in return. During his visit to an abattoir, Charles joked about becoming a grandfather, saying: 'I'm very grateful indeed for the kind wishes for my rather slowly approaching grandfatherhood.' He added: 'Some of you may realise that with grandfatherhood comes, in four months' time, old-age-pensionerhood.' The Prince's comments came as he toured Dovecote Park, a food processing plant near Pontefract, where owner Richard Canvin said: 'We'd like to wish you a speedy and safe arrival of your first grandchild.' Technical director Peter Boyes said that Charles had been keen to discuss issues such as sustainability and animal welfare, especially since he keeps his own cattle.

Hospital: Kate was in labour in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London . Scrum: The media had gathered outside the hospital awaiting the birth of the future monarch . Charles has rarely commented publicly on the, but earlier this month he asked a women's group if they had any tips on being a good grandparent during to a trip to Kenfig in Wales. One 74-year-old grandmother told him, 'Spoil them - enjoy it,' leading him to reminisce about happy memories of his own grandmother, the Queen Mother. The Queen was kept informed about Kate's condition when she was at Windsor castle, and travelled to Buckingham Palace early in the afternoon. Prince Harry is at RAF Wattisham in Suffolk, where he is based with his squadron of Apache helicopter pilots, and is said to be very excited about becoming an uncle for the first time. The Earl of Wessex is currently in Devon. The whereabouts of the other Royals is . not known, but it is believed that William is the only relative to have . joined Kate in hospital today. Birth: Charles with Princess Diana and their newborn son William outside St Mary's in 1982 . Last week, the Queen suggested that she was keen to see the baby - her third great-grandchild - as soon as possible. During a trip to the Lake District, 10-year-old Fay Batey asked Her Majesty whether she wanted the child to be a boy or a girl. The Queen replied that she did not mind, but added: I would very much like it to arrive because I'm going on holiday soon... I wish it would hurry up.' Her Majesty is apparently set to travel to her private Balmoral estate in Scotland for her summer holiday in the next few days.

"Convicted: Emma Czornobaj, 25, faces life in prison after being found guilty of causing a crash which killed two people in 2010 . A woman who parked her car on a highway to rescue ducklings has been found guilty of causing the deaths of a motorcyclist and his daughter who slammed into her vehicle. Emma Czornobaj was convicted by a jury on Friday on two counts of criminal negligence causing death, a charge that carries a maximum life sentence, and two counts of dangerous driving causing death, which comes with a maximum of 14 years in jail. The 25-year-old was charged in the deaths of Andre Roy, 50, and his daughter Jessie, 16. She wiped away tears when the verdict was . delivered to a packed courtroom in Montreal. Quebec Superior Court . Justice Eliane Perreault said the 12-member jury voted unanimously. Czornobaj was released until her pre-sentence hearing on August 8. Roy's motorcycle slammed into Czornobaj's Honda Civic after the woman stopped in the left lane of Highway 30 in Candiac, Quebec on June 27, 2010. Jessie was sitting on the back of her dad's Harley-Davidson. Pauline Volikakis was riding her own motorbike behind her husband and daughter, and watched in horror as they were thrown into the air. Volikakis briefly fought back tears when she left the courtroom. 'I don't wish misfortune on anyone,' the widow said. 'It's time that we go on. This will not bring (back) my loved ones.' Heartbreaking: Pauline Volikakis' (left) husband Andre Roy, 50, and daughter Jessie, 16, both died in a Montreal highway crash in 2010 . Still grieving: Pauline Volikakis, whose husband and daughter were killed in the collision, fought back tears when she left the courtroom . She said she hoped publicity of the case will reinforce a basic message to drivers. 'Future and present drivers should know that we don’t stop on highways, and it’s very dangerous. Even if it’s a small animal that we like or that we want to preserve, we should not stop on the highways,' she said. 'It’s not a place to stop.' Czornobaj, a self-professed animal lover, told the court that she did not see the ducklings' mother anywhere and planned to capture them and take them home. She had three years driving experience at the time of the accident. National Post reported Czornobaj, who doesn't have a criminal record, was willing to plead guilty as recently as April but refused to do jail time. Her lawyer Marc Labelle said his client was stunned by the jury's decision. He said he may appeal. 'So now we are at the sentencing stage in this case. The question we have to ask is that considering the nature of the facts, it is rare that we have criminal negligence where there are no bad elements,' Labelle said. 'This was not a race. This was not a person who took a chance and drove drunk. This is not about someone who was speeding and took a risky maneuver.' During the trial, witness Martine Tessier testified that she noticed parked car didn't have its hazards on and that the driver's door was open. She also said she saw Czornobaj motioning to some ducks on the side of the road. 'I shouted to my [three] children: ‘What is she doing there? She’s going to get killed',' Tessier said, according to National Post. 'I saw a body go over the car. It looked like a rag doll. I shouted to my daughter to call 911.' Accident scene: Police said Emma Czornobaj stopped her car on Highway 30 in Candiac, Quebec (pictured) to rescue some ducklings on June 27, 2010 . Written off: Emma Czornobaj's car after the crash on a Canadian highway in 2010 . Scene: Emergency workers with the motorcycle Andre Roy and his daughter Jessie were riding when they crashed into a parked car on a Canadian highway in 2010 . Prosecutor Annie-Claude Chasse had a message for motorists. 'What we hope is that a clear message is sent to society that we do not stop on the highway for animals. It's not worth it,' she said. Czornobaj left the courthouse without commenting. According to National Post, she is a financial analyst who graduated from Concordia’s John Molson School of Business where she made the dean’s list.","Emma Czornobaj, 25, faces life in prison .

"Almost 80  staff at a city council have been sacked for calling in sick too frequently as the average time taken off by employees rose to two week. Cardiff  Council sacked 77 of its employees because of their high rates of sickness absence in the last 12 months. The sickest staff work in the health and environment departments, who are predicted to take off 17 days sick - more than three weeks - by the end of the financial year. Staff at Cardiff County Council were sacked because of the high levels of sickness, averaging 10 days a year . Councillors have branded the levels of sickness absence 'frightening.' On average staff at the council, the largest in Wales, are forecast to take 10.16 days off by the end of the financial year. This is more than double the average 4.4 days lost to sickness in Britain last year, and is higher than when sickness levels peaked in the UK at 7.2 days in 1993, according to the Office for National Statistics. It also exceeds the council's own current target of nine days. Around 11,000 staff work at the council and between April and June this year an average of 4.71 days per person were taken off sick. This equates to 53,000 lost working days over a three month period. Staff in the children's department phoned in ill for seven days during this period and are forecast to take 15.4 days off sick by April next year. Workers in the sport department are expected to be away from work because of illness for 13.6 days by the end of the financial year. Councillor Judith Woodman, leader of the council's Liberal Democrat group, described the statistics as 'quite frightening'. The council sacked 77 employees over their sickness absence between June 2013 and July this year, an increase of 40 per cent on the year before. A performance report by the authority's chief executive said sickness absence had increased in the few months up to July this year. This has forced the county council to raise its prediction to 10.16 days off sick, per employee, for the current year. This increase has taken place despite a policy introduced by the council last year to reduce sickness levels, which peaked at 25 days in the environment department in 2011/12. Paul Orders, chief executive of the council, said: 'The rate of improvement is insufficient and has highlighted a degree of non compliance with the corporate policy in regard to return-to-work interviews and trigger stage interviews.' Staff at Cardiff council have been sacked for taking too many sick days, as some are expected to take 17 . Mr Orders said the figures will be addressed with individual directors of each department. However overall sickness absence has decreased at the council. The average full-time council worker called in sick 11.73 times between July 2012 and June 2013. This fell to 9.98 days between July 2013 and June 2014, representing 13,000 fewer days lost.","Cardiff Council sacked 77 people for calling in sick on too many occasions .

"It can be hard to find enough hours in the day to catch up on both work and exercise. But now experts have designed a treadmill which allows runners to read while they are jogging. The system, called ReadingMate, adjusts text on a monitor to counteract the bobbing motion of a runner's head so that the text appears still. ReadingMate adjusts text on a monitor to counteract the bobbing motion of a runner's head so that the text appears still . Ji Soo Yi, an assistant professor of industrial engineering at Purdue University, where the treadmill was invented, said: 'Not many people can run and read at the same time.' 'This is because the relative location of the eyes to the text is vigorously changing, and our eyes try to constantly adjust to such changes, which is burdensome.' The small font size in text adds to the difficulty, he said. 'You could increase the font size and have a large-screen monitor on the wall, but that's impractical because you cannot have numerous big screen displays in an exercise room.' It comes after American experts created TrekDesk,  a desk that fits over a treadmill, enabling users to walk slowly while they work . The researchers developed ReadingMate on the hypothesis that the primary impediment to reading while running is the head's vertical movement. The new system allows a treadmill user to read normal-size text on a small monitor mounted in front of the machine. Findings appear online this month in Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society. The paper was authored by Yi, doctoral candidate Bum chul Kwon,and Yu Zhu, an associate professor of statistics. The study included 15 students, who carried out a 'letter-counting' task while running on a treadmill and using ReadingMate. The test requires participants to count how many times the letter F occurs in two lines of text situated among 10 lines displayed on a computer monitor. The user wears goggles equipped with infrared LEDs, and an infrared camera captures the LEDs, tracking the runner's bobbing head. Then the text is moved in unison with the head movement, taking into consideration the human reflex to compensate for motion. 'Our eyes can accommodate vibration to a certain degree,' said Yi, director of Purdue's Healthcare and Information Visualization Engineering Lab, or HIVE. 'There are compensatory reflex mechanisms that tend to stabilize the head and eyes to maintain gaze and head position.' Kwon led work to create an algorithm to correctly move the text, accounting for this reflex. 'You can't just move the text exactly in synch with the head because the eye is already doing what it can to compensate,' he said. 'So you have to account for that compensation by moving the text slightly out of synch with the head motion.' Working at the TrekDesk is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours . The research showed a higher accuracy for people who used ReadingMate compared to those in a control group. 'We also measured whether participants gave up on counting the letters because the task was too difficult,' Kwon said. 'We often saw people giving up without ReadingMate, especially with certain font sizes and smaller spaces between lines.' The system also might be used by heavy equipment operators and aircraft pilots. 'Both may experience heavy shaking and turbulence while reading information from a display,' he said. 'ReadingMate could stabilize the content in such cases.' Zygmunt Pizlo, a professor in the Department of Psychological Sciences, provided critical advice during preliminary investigations, and industrial engineering student Yuming Zhang assisted post-experiment data analysis. Doctoral Student Han Wu in the Department of Statistics also was involved in the research. It comes after American experts created TrekDesk,  a desk that fits over a treadmill, enabling users to walk slowly while they work. The manufacturer claims the height-adjustable workstation allows individuals the opportunity to gain the necessary amount of exercise daily to maintain health, reduce stress, prevent disease and strengthen muscles. Working at the TrekDesk is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours. The desk, which costs £300, is designed to fit over any treadmill and measures 72x34inches. It also features a manuscript holder, allowing you to read books, magazines or manuscripts while you type, talk and walk. Working at the TrekDesk is said to help users achieve the holy grail of 10,000 steps a day within three hours. It is also said to boost mood and productivity .","ReadingMate adjusts text on a monitor to counteract head bobbing motion .

"The frontman of a Grammy-nominated Christian metal band who plotted to have his wife killed admitted he's an atheist but lied about his faith to sell records. Timothy Lambesis, lead singer and founder of the band As I Lay Dying, was sentenced to six years prison last month for trying to hire a hitman to murder his estranged wife Meggan Lambesis. The 33-year-old's conviction shocked his devoted fans, some of whom prayed with the singer after concerts believing he was a devout Christian. However in an exclusive interview with Alternative Press, the Californian confessed he described himself to fans as 'not a Satanist' in order to avoid saying he was an atheist. Scroll down for video . Jail time: Tim Lambesis (pictured left and right) will spend six years behind bars for his role in the murder-for-hire plot . In the interview, Lambesis talked about a YouTube video he made in which he addressed fans who believed his new side project, 'Pyrithion', was satanic. 'As far as the [YouTube] video I did explaining 'Pyrithion''s lyrics… I was trying to put out a fire. I was afraid it would affect As I Lay Dying sales, which would affect my overall income. I was trying to put out the fire by saying the easiest thing, 'I'm not a satanist!'"" he explained. 'Truthfully, I was an atheist. The 'strategy' I had at the time was cowardly. Two of the songs on that record were about coming to grips with the idea that life has no purpose, no meaning. 'These were negative themes I wasn't 'allowed' to deal with in As I Lay Dying songs. I thought making As I Lay Dying darker would be bad for my career. That was my thinking.' He said some of his band members, and many other Christian bands, shared his views. He said the charade became awkward. 'When kids would want to pray with us after shows, I'd be like, 'Um, go ahead and pray!' I would just let them pray. I'd say 'Amen.' If praying while I have my hand on their shoulder makes them feel better, I didn't want to take that away from them,' he confessed. 'When they would specifically ask me to pray for something, I'd say, 'I don't really like to pray out loud, but I'll take that with me to the bus'.' Unhappy: Timothy Lambesis (left) was caught asking a a trainer at his gym if he knew anyone who could kill his estranged wife Meggan Lambesis (right) Father: Lambesis complained his estranged wife wouldn't let him see the three children they adopted from Ethiopia, now aged four, eight and 10 . He was arrested in May last year after giving an . undercover agent acting as a hitman, money, gate codes and an alibi to . kill his estranged wife, Meggan Lambesis, NBC San Diego reported. He said he wanted his wife dead because she was . going to get up to 60 percent of his income and would not allow their . three young children to join him on tour. According to court documents, Meggan Lambesis filed for divorce in September 2012 to end the couple’s eight-year marriage. In . divorce records obtained by the Associated Press, Meggan Lambesis . claimed the rocker had become 'obsessed with bodybuilding' and was . distracted with the children, even falling asleep once while watching . them. Last year, as their relationship further soured, Lambesis told a personal trainer at his gym, Brett Kimball, that he wanted to get rid of his wife. 'He wanted to know if maybe I could find someone to do it for him,' Kimball testified at a pretrial hearing. Police began an investigation in April following a tip-off. Lambesis was recorded telling an undercover agent that he wanted his wife killed, according to prosecutors. The . undercover agent, San Diego County Sheriff's Officer Howard Bradley, . testified last year that Lambesis met him at an Oceanside bookstore in . May and said he wanted his wife 'gone'. Bradley said he asked Lambesis directly if he wanted his wife killed, and the singer replied, 'Yes, I do'. The heavily-tattooed gym junkie said his wife had restricted his visits with their children aged four, eight and 10, . adopted from Ethiopia, after they separated in September 2012. The . singer also told the agent that he was angry that Meggan Lambesis would . get a large share of his income in a divorce settlement. Bradley said Lambesis told him at the end of their meeting, 'Just to clarify, just so you know, I do want her dead.' Lambesis . provided the undercover agent with an envelope containing $1,000 cash . for expenses, his wife’s address and gate codes, pictures of her and . specific dates when he would have the children and therefore, an alibi. Atheist: Musician Tim Lambesis admitted he faked his Christian beliefs so he could sell records . Tried to hire a hit man: Timothy Lambesis, co-founder of Christian heavy metal band As I Lay Dying, pleaded guilty to hiring someone to kill his estranged wife . As . I Lay Dying formed in San Diego in 2000 and has released eight albums, . including 2007's An Ocean Between Us, which reached No. 8 on . Billboard's charts. A single from the album, Nothing Left, was . nominated for a Grammy for top metal performance. The . band plays in an aggressive style that features lightning-speed metal . guitar riffs. The group's philosophical lyrics attracted a . following of Christian rock fans. Lambesis in the past openly declared he was Christian. He allegedly stated during an August 2010 radio interview on The Full Armor of God Broadcast that his writing was inspired by his Christian faith. 'I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics,' he said.

"Smartwatches may come with a host of features, but they're rarely as fashionable and good looking as traditional timepieces. With this in mind, a California design team has created the T-Band - a clip that adds similar smart tools to everyday, dumb watches. The T-Band comes in three versions - a basic activity tracker, a simple touchscreen and an advanced notification display - with prices starting at $129 (£82). Scroll down for video . The T-Band was created by California-based Kairos and features a smart module that attaches to watch straps measuring between 18mm and 24mm. It comes in three versions - a basic activity tracker, a simple touchscreen and an advanced notification display - with prices starting at $129 (£82) The adapter is the brainchild of San Francisco firm Kairos, which has set up an Indiegogo campaign to fund production of the band. Each band is adjustable and attaches to any watch with straps measuring between 0.7 inches and 0.9 inches (18mm and 24mm). The T-Band ND is the basic model and works like a fitness band to track steps, sleep patterns and skin temperature. It uses lights and vibrations to provide basic notifications, and connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth. An early-bird version of this band is available from $129 (£82). The second model is called T-Band HD and adds a touchscreen to the watch’s strap. This display remains hidden until a notification arrives on a connected phone. Prices for the HD start at $159 (£101). The high-end model is called T-Band OD. It has a curved, plastic-OLED, scratch-resistant touchscreen and adds images, videos, and voice calling thanks to a built-in speaker and microphone. The OD model starts at $179 (£114).

"Fat? Who? Me? Oh, get away with you. Yes, it’s strange, but true: two years ago, I was so far into self-deception that not only did I not mind being fat, I honestly didn’t even realise that I was. Where others might have been buffeted by shame, I had hurtled north of 60 in merrier mood, counting the blessings, but never the pounds. The hair was, and is, unblemished by grey. Adapting the mantra that ‘when I am old I shall wear purple’, my wardrobe eschewed chic black in favour of riotous colour. Carol says: 'You are fat because you gave your stomach too much and now you're giving it too little. Of course it's going to growl.' As for my fading eyesight, I turned it into a plus with a costly passion for outrageous glasses. But the body? Ah, the body. I think the mindset changes when you reach the age when your body is never again likely to be seen by anyone who has not already seen it. It’s not an overnight thing, but you start to cross lines — not least the line between dressing the body and draping it. I ate like a pig, the scales gathered dust and dresses grew wider. I no longer struggled upstairs on a bus, my ankles swelled in heat and I bought a bath with handles. Still, I thought, that’s just age. Isn’t it? And so to the awakening. A routine medical began with being weighed. ‘Two hundred pounds,’ the (skinny) nurse intoned. Or, if you prefer, 14 stone 4lb. On a 5ft 6in frame. Worse were blood sugar levels teetering towards diabetes. I didn’t need the doctor to mention the elephant in the room — and rarely has the phrase been so aptly used. On the BMI (body mass index) scale  I had waddled into ‘obese’ (over 30). Something had to be done. But what? Please, please let it not be a diet. Heaven knows, I am no stranger to diets. In younger days — propelled by vanity, not health, I would happily diet to 9st while smoking 40 a day — I tried the lot. 90 per cent of British women have been on some form of diet in their lifetime -  on average spending a staggering 17 years of their life dieting . From cabbage soup to grapefruit to high-protein to low-fat, from counting calories to counting carbs to injectable stimulants. And while I would — temporarily — lose weight, what I gained was an abiding loathing of the diet industry. The bare facts disgrace us: 29 million people in Britain tried to diet last year, with 39 per cent buying into the trendy 5:2, which is propelling its creator, Michael Mosley, towards the Rich Lists already climbed by his diet guru predecessors. Dr Robert Atkins (ten million books sold) died a millionaire — albeit a fat one; Pierre Dukan (seven million sold) is similarly wealthy. Yet all this money, together with billions generated by diet clubs, recipe books, supplements and ready meals, is made out of selling the lie that they will work when in the long run they do not. What is worse, the only way this industry can keep the lie alive is to turn clever women into stupid women. Answer this: which makes you fatter: a large sweet potato, roasted in oil then piled with cinnamon sugar and melting butter, or two sticks of celery? See? The fact is, any adult with an IQ above room temperature knows what makes them fat. And so back to my dilemma: dangerously porky, determined not to be, but damned if I would go on a diet. So, I resolved to lose weight my way. The BMI index hinted three stone should be enough; that’s 42 pounds. I decided to lose one pound a week, every week, for 42 weeks. And it worked. What annoys my  friends is that I can’t tell anyone else how to do it — if I could, I might sell a million books, too. All I can say is that I neither counted nor weighed anything. I relied instead on ‘more’, ‘less’ and ‘none’. The first two were trial and error: if the pound failed to budge one week, I’d revise the ‘more’ to ‘less’. ‘None’ was easy: some pleasures stayed sacrosanct (butter, Yorkshire pudding, red wine), others I banished (beer, cheese, sugar). Unlike diets, when all you think about is what you are next ‘allowed’ to eat, I put food on the back burner. Unlike diets, I told myself no lies. The first great lie that diets tell is that their food is delicious when it is not — egg-white omelettes enlivened by cottage cheese? Why pretend? Instead, I expected my food to be fuel, not fun. Breakfast — yoghurt, seeds, nuts and berries — and lunch — a small sandwich — passed without note. Dinner was steak or chicken with veg  (hence the butter and red wine). The second great diet lie is that you won’t be hungry; there is that terrific snack for elevenses and another at teatime … . 'All I can say is that I neither counted nor weighed anything. I relied instead on 'more', 'less' and 'none'.' says Carol, who lost 42 pounds in 42 weeks . This is nonsense. You are fat because you gave your stomach too much and now you’re giving it too little. Of course it’s going to growl. Fact: if you do not feel hungry on occasion, then you are not losing weight. Maybe this is why so many diets fail. The discomfort feels like a betrayal, you don’t believe in the diet any more, so where’s the biscuit tin? However, I could only let myself down. Or not. One trick was to drink a pint of fizzy water and go early to bed feeling full. Another was to drink the water AND red wine … then go early to bed with a smile. The point about losing weight my way is that everyone would choose different non-negotiables, different banishments and different tricks. The loss is in any case slow, so for ages it is unnoticeable. I did keep track, but because I was doing it for health I used a BMI chart: down it crept, from the ‘obese’ 33 to — hallelujah! — merely ‘overweight’ at 29 (180lb). In time, bonuses cheer you along, like the first time I hopped upstairs on a bus without thinking about it. Clothes fitted better, then not at all: just too big, at 20 or 18. Their replacements were less draped and more tailored. I could clamber more easily from the bath — of course I could; have you tried lifting a suitcase weighing 42 lb? My shoe size dropped, my ankles shrank, my puff calmed. ‘Overweight’ eventually fell into a ‘normal’ BMI of 25 as, after 40 weeks, I reached a loss of exactly 42 lb, to weigh 11 st 4lb. Better yet: my blood sugars also read ‘normal’. Admittedly, I am no string bean; I am a size 14 and need shapewear. Nevertheless, I understand my body better than ever and feel absurdly proud that I took control of it myself, rather than relinquishing it to someone else’s rules. So, again at my own behest, I chose to stop losing weight. And here’s the best bit of all. It is a year since I stopped. A year during which, if I gained a pound, I immediately took it off again just by following the same principle of self-control. This means that today, as I write, I still weigh the same  11 st 4lb. Smug? Oh, you bet. Unbearably.","Hater of diets, when Carol realised she was fat she wasn't sure what to do .

"Honoured: James Chaney will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously . Three civil rights workers who were killed by Ku Klux Klansmen in 1964 are going to be posthumously awarded the highest civilian honour of the US - the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The murders of Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman  in Neshoba County, Mississippi, saw the FBI launch a massive investigation dubbed 'Mississippi Burning'. The activists are among 19 people, including Stevie Wonder and Meryl Streep, who will be awarded the nation's highest civilian honor by President Barack Obama at the White House today. Despite this high honour, some relatives of the trio are uneasy about the award, saying it takes focus off all the victims of racism and those who were killed during the African-American civil rights movement in the 60s and today. 'There were not just three men who were part of a struggle. There were not just three men who were killed,' Rita Schwerner Bender, widow of Michael Schwerner said. 'You know, the struggle in this country probably started with the first revolt on a slave ship, and it continues now.' Chaney's sister, the Rev. Julia Chaney Moss, of Willingboro, New Jersey, said the award should be for all of those killed during the civil rights movement. 'It's really about all of those families,' she said. 'It's really about the history of the pain of the African-American experience in Mississippi.' Michael Schwerner, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman met working on black voter registration and had travelled to Neshoba County on June 21, 1964, to investigate the burning of a black church. Civil rights workers Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman were killed alongside colleague James Chaney in June 1964, which then became known as the 'Mississippi Burning' murders . Legacy: The national outrage that followed the murders saw president Lyndon B Johnson pass the Civil Rights Act 1964 and the Voting Rights Act 1965 . Critique: Rev. Julia Chaney-Moss of Willingboro, N.J., sister of slain civil rights worker James Chaney, said the residential Medal of Freedom should be for all of those killed during the civil rights movement . As they left the church, a deputy stopped their station wagon, cited Chaney for speeding and took the three to the Neshoba County jail. The deputy released them late that night, and the men were ambushed by awaiting Klansmen who chased them to an isolated country road and shot them to death. In 1967, an all-white jury in Meridian convicted seven men on federal civil rights charges tied to the conspiracy to kill Schwerner, Chaney and Goodman. The state reopened an investigation decades later, and on June 21, 2005 - exactly 41 years after the slayings - a jury made up of whites and blacks in Neshoba County convicted Edgar Ray Killen of manslaughter. He remains in state prison. Their deaths sparked a national outrage and the attention the investigation brought to the civil rights movement saw president Lyndon B Johnson pass the Civil Rights Act 1964 and the Voting Rights Act 1965 . On screen: The murders inspired the 1988 film Mississippi Burning with Willem Defoe . The activists are among 19 people, who will be awarded the nation's highest civilian honor by President Barack Obama at the White House today . Honored: Stevie Wonder and Meryl Streep are also set to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom . The story of the murders and the ensuing FBI investigation was made into a film, called Mississippi Burning, in 1988 starring Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe. Today, the 'Mississippi burning trio'  are among a distinguished group receiving a Presidential Medal of Freedom, reserved for individuals who have made 'meritorious contributions' to U.S. security, world peace or cultural endeavors. The list of recipients this year includes includes actress Meryl Streep, Ethel Kennedy, widow of the late Sen. Robert Kennedy, singer-songwriter Stevie Wonder and Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and the longest-serving member of Congress. Dingell is retiring at the end of the year. Others being recognized at a White House ceremony Monday are composer Stephen Sondheim, NBC journalist Tom Brokaw and author Isabel Allende.","Michael Schwerner, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, murdered in 1964 .

"A lawyer is being investigated by police for allegedly charging clients £25,000 for court appearances that never happened. Andrew Benson, who worked for London law firm Byrne & Partners, practised 'breathtaking deception' over three years while acting on behalf of a diamond dealer, a court has heard. His alleged dishonesty was highlighted by the former client who is fighting a High Court order to pay an Islamic investment company millions of pounds. A lawyer acted dishonestly over three years, charging his client £25,000 for court appearances and litigation with opposing solicitors in an ongoing civil claim which never happened, the Court of Appeal heard . Mr Benson, who has been dismissed from his former law practice, produced 'fictitious litigation' over three years while billing diamond dealer Rajesh Mehta. During this time he claimed to appear at court hearings and have extensive contact with solicitors acting on behalf of the investment company to which Mr Mehta was ordered to pay money. A High Court Justice has ruled however that no such appearances took place, and could find no correspondence between Mr Benson and opposing solicitors Norton Rose. The court heard how Mr Mehta paid £25,000 to the lawyer, under the impression he had been acting on his behalf in an ongoing civil court claim. 'The deception practised by Mr Benson... is rightly described as breathtaking,' said Mr Justice Hamblen. 'The motives for Mr Benson's actions are presently unclear.' Mr Justice Hamblen likened the lawyer's behaviour to A.P. Herbert's Uncommon Law, a satirical book poking fun at the British legal system through a series of made-up legal complaints. The lawyer is now being investigated by Metropolitan Police and the Solicitors Regulation Authority. Andrew Benson told his client he had attended court appearances and produced documents while fighting the civil suit on his behalf. He is being investigated by police (file image) As a result of his alleged deception, all adverse orders made against Mr Mehta in the period while he was being represented by Mr Benson have been set aside. This amounts to one order, made in 2010, being discarded by the court. Mr Justice Hamblen added: 'There is good reason to believe that [Mehta’s] own solicitor, a man who has been shown to be dishonest, was acting against his interests,’ the Law Gazette reports. ‘It is axiomatic that justice must be both done and seen to be done. 'In the circumstances of the present case in my judgment that requires the setting aside of the [order] unconditionally.' A spokesman for Byrne & Partners told the newspaper they had cooperated fully with police investigations into the man.","Andrew Benson charged his client for 'fictitious' court appearances .

"A pensioner had a lucky escape after her car got stuck on top of a brick wall while she tried to reverse out of her garage. Margaret Holliday had to be rescued by paramedics after her silver Hyundai Getz was left teetering on the edge of the wall and another resident's lawn in Moseley, Birmingham. The 81-year-old was trying to edge back out of her garage when her brakes failed and sent her flying backwards, at about midday on Saturday afternoon. The woman, in her eighties, had a lucky escape after she managed to get her car stuck on top of a brick wall . Her car became stuck and had to be hoisted off the three brick high wall by the fire service. She said: 'I was just parking up in my garage when I realised I was still a bit close to the entrance and the door wouldn't shut so I needed to edge back just about six inches. 'But instead of being six inches it ended up being more like six metres. 'As I took my foot off the brake it launched backwards out of the garage, across the little bit of lawn - by gosh it was scary. 'Then the car was just teetering on the wall - it's only small so I thought I'd be able to get out. 'I didn't realise how high up I was and when I tried to step out, I tumbled out, banged my head and ended up on my bum. Fire crews believe she got her foot jammed on the accelerator as she attempted to reverse out of her garage . 'The noise when the car hit the wall was huge and that's when all the neighbours rushed out and helped me get to my feet.' 'I have a minor scratch on my hand and a bump on my head and when I took my car to the garage they said my brakes had failed and would have to do some repairs but thankfully the wall itself didn't do too much damage.' Margaret was treated by a paramedic at the scene and is recovering at home but is hoping to have her car back, with new brakes and an exhaust, by the end of the week. Dave Clark, Highgate Fire crew manager, said: 'On arrival West Midlands Ambulance had managed to lift her down from the car. 'It appeared as though the lady had reversed out her garage, and her foot had become jammed on the accelerator. 'Fortunately a tree had prevented the car from falling over the edge. The crew then winched the car to safety.' 'The woman was doing fine, though of course it was a bit of a shock.

"It has long been claimed that names can influence your chances of doing well in life and now it seems that monikers can impact on behaviour at school as well. According to a new study, children named Jacob, Daniel, Amy and Emma are the most likely to display impeccable behaviour while those named Ella, William, Olivia and Joshua are most often to be found on the naughty step. The findings come from a survey that looked at the names of more than 63,000 school children who logged good behaviour or achievement awards in online sticker books. Scroll down for video . Naughty: Research reveals that Ella and Joseph are the most common names of poorly-behaved children . Those with the most good behaviour awards were named Jacob and Amy, closely followed by Georgia and Daniel. By contrast, girls named Ella and Bethany and boys named Joseph and Cameron proved to be the naughtiest. Other naughty names for boys included William, Jake, Joshua and Jamie while recalcitrant girls were also called Eleanor, Olivia, Laura and Holly. Well-behaved names included Emma, Grace, Charlotte and Sophie for girls and Thomas, James, Adam and Harry for boys. Good children: The survey found that children named Ella, like Miss Henderson, and those named James, like Mr Franco, are the best behaved in school . Baby names - and their impact on life chances - have been studied for more than 70 years, with the earliest studies finding that men with unusual first names were more likely to drop out of school. More recent studies have found more correlation between names and social backgrounds, with the parenting skills of mothers and fathers having a more critical impact on future development. Gregory Clark, the economist behind The Son Also Rises: Surnames and the History of Social Mobility, found that girls named Eleanor were 100 times more likely to go to Oxford University than girls named Jade. Although there are proportionally more Jades in the general population than Eleanors, the former was rarely seen at top universities, while the latter was relatively common. Other common names for Oxford students included Peter, Anna, Elizabeth, Richard and John, while among rarely seen monikers were Stacey, Connor, Bradley, Kayleigh, Shannon and Shane. The latest round of research into names was commissioned by School Stickers, which creates online stickers for teachers to award to pupils. Amy . Georgia . Emma . Charlotte . Grace . Sophie .

"'The current system is discredited': Gove orders inquiry into cheating row as teachers are 'coached by examiners' The heads of the country’s exam boards are being hauled before MPs in a bid to restore public confidence in GCSEs and A-levels, it was revealed yesterday. The Commons’ education select committee has called an emergency session in the wake of the scandal over school teachers being ‘coached’ by examiners in how to improve their pupils’ pass marks. Education Secretary Michael Gove hopes to de-commercialise the exam system so that each subject is tested by one board only – so rival boards would not be driven to offer tests that are easier than their competitors’ to try to win business from schools. Mr Gove said: 'I think one of the things about the Telegraph investigation is that it draws attention to the worst examples of a culture which has worked against excellence, which has been grotesquely unfair to students, because it means that their time has been taken up learning exam technique and not subjects.' Rod Bristow, on behalf of Edexcel, and Gareth Pierce, chief executive of the Welsh board WJEC, will appear before the select committee on Thursday, alongside Mark Dawe, chief executive of OCR, and Andrew Hall, chief executive of AQA. The exams regulator, Ofqual, and representatives from the Daily Telegraph have also been invited to give evidence. An undercover investigation by the newspaper exposed how teachers pay up to £230 a day to attend seminars with chief examiners, during which they have been advised on exam questions and the wording pupils should use to get higher marks. Two examiners have been suspended from WJEC, after being filmed giving detailed guidance on forthcoming GCSE history exams. Another examiner was suspended from Edexcel after being recorded claiming the course content in her board’s geography GCSE was so small she did not know how it had been passed by the regulator. The select committee is already investigating the country’s exam system. It now wants urgent answers from the exam bosses over the ‘shocking’ evidence unearthed. Graham Stuart, chairman of the select committee, said: ‘One of the areas we’re already looking at is conflicts of interest – the commercial exploitation of their position as awarding bodies and whether the way the examination system is structured incentivises the right behaviour in awarding bodies. ‘This…tends to suggest the pressures and competition within the system are driving them to behaviour that is not in the best interests of good standards of education.’ Paul Barnes was filmed apparently telling teachers they could ignore some parts of the syllabus as they wouldn't appear in the exams . He added: ‘The whole session will be on the evidence unearthed and the questions arising from that. ‘It will be about how we can have confidence in the system if the very people who are providing the awards appear to be complicit in gaining an encouragement of an approach which isn’t truly educational. We are already conducting an inquiry into exam boards and the need for reform. ‘The stories are shocking and suggest there may be a need for radical changes. The committee will question the heads of the exam boards to hold them publicly to account. We will also want to ask the regulator how such alleged breaches have been allowed to happen and explore what can be done to ensure that our qualifications support and encourage real learning rather than undermine it.’ Former senior examiner Martin Collier, who worked for Edexcel, told the committee last week that he wanted to see a single merged exam board because ‘it was wrong to put children’s qualifications into the marketplace’. Mr Collier, who was an A-level history examiner between 1996 and 2011, told MPs: ‘One of the reasons why grades have gone up and up is the issue of market share. ‘Exam boards are very wary of saying, “this year there have been fewer A grades”. ‘What the exam boards are worried about is that if they hit children hard one year and the number of top grades diminish they fear people will go elsewhere.’ Mr Gove has ordered an official inquiry into the scandal and the regulator, Ofqual, must report back before Christmas. Chief executive Glenys Stacey has outlined a number of possible sanctions including pulling ‘examinations set for January and for next summer with awarding bodies providing substitute scripts’. The Education Secretary said he is preparing to reform the exam system early in the new year, but is awaiting the findings of the investigation before finalising his proposals. His current plans would see exam boards compete to provide a single exam for each subject. 'The first response that most people understandably have is, 'Why don't you just have one exam board?' Mr Gove told the Telegraph. ‘As someone who grew up in Scotland I naturally sympathise, because we just had one exam board. I think it is the most compelling answer at the moment. But I owe it to students and to teachers to let the investigators come up with their recommendations. . .and present all the facts.’",Gove calls current exam system 'grotesquely unfair' to students .
"Controversial: Tahir Alam, the chairman of Park View School in Birmingham, said there should be sensitivity during swimming classes because pupils could accidentally 'swallow water.' A governor who is said to have orchestrated a plot by Muslim extremists to take over a group of schools believes children should not be allowed to swim during Ramadan because it may 'break their fast'. Tahir Alam, the chairman of Park View School in Birmingham, said there should be sensitivity during the Islamic holy month because pupils could accidentally ‘swallow water.’ The suspected ringleader of the 'Trojan Horse' operation also said Muslim women and girls have an 'obligation' to cover their bodies after denying claims he made schoolchildren wear headscarves. He describes himself as a 'conservative . Muslim', but says allegations of Islamification and extremist teachings . at the schools in Birmingham are false. Mr Alam drafted a document in 2007 suggesting songs with ant-Islamic lyrics should be banned from schools and dancing 'discouraged'. In an interview with BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Alam said no one had praised al-Qaeda in assemblies and refuted rumours that classrooms had been segregated. He added that schools' policies on areas such as collective prayer, headscarves and halal meat were 'within the legal parameters.' ‘No child has to wear a headscarf, nobody has to go to prayer in a compulsory manner ... only 5-10 per cent of our children pray during lunchtime,' he said. Despite having a 99 per cent Muslim . uptake, Mr Alam said Park View has no 'religious designation', which means they . cannot force any faith practices on students. ‘The whole thing has been blown out of all proportion. It's based on an anonymous document, unsigned, undated. ‘I wonder how many other unsigned and undated documents would generate 12 weeks of media hysteria and political storm.’ Claims: The school has been accused of segregating pupils, using anti-American propaganda in assemblies and forcing some students to cover their hair . The Islamic festival of Ramadan will fall between June 29 and July 29 this year. During this period, Muslims worldwide will observe between 29 and 30 days of fasting. Between sunrise and sunset, they cannot eat food, drink, smoke, involve themselves in sexual relations or swear. It is obligatory for all Muslims, except those who are ill, pregnant, breastfeeding or diabetic. In countries such as Kuwait, Algeria and U.A.E, it is illegal to eat or drink anything during the period. In Egypt, alcohol sales are banned throughout the month. The word Ramadan comes from the Arabic root ramiḍa or ar-ramaḍ, which means scorching heat or dryness. ‘So any accommodation that we may do in relation to catering for the children - for example, if it relates to the prayer maybe, or halal meals or collective worship - all these practices are well within the regulations and the law.’ Whistleblowing teachers have claimed . the school is in the hands of a group of extremists who infiltrated the . governing body, forcing non-Muslims out and replacing them with . hardliners. Six non-Muslim headteachers at schools in the city are said to have left their posts in the last six months. But Mr Alam said  he did not know the circumstances of their departures and assured listeners he had taken on non-Muslim staff during is tenure. After the allegations surfaced, Ofsted commissioned an emergency report to investigate practices at the schools. Mr Alam said he had received the draft report, but could not comment on the details. Asked if its contents would result in him leaving his post he said: 'I can't answer that question and you don't expect me to. Refute: Mr Alam denied that any extremist ideas were being taught at the school and said their policies adhered to 'legal parameters' 'We have run Park View as a highly successful school. Our results are amongst the highest in the area. ‘It's something that needs to be replicated not removed.’ Birmingham City Council has received 200 complaints about Muslim practices across a number of schools in the city. The Department for Education has commissioned an investigation into the claims, headed by former counter-terror chief, Peter Clarke.","Tahir Alam is suspected ring leader of plot at Park View School, Birmingham .

"Parents who have agonised over getting their children into the best school may have been wasting their time and effort. Surrounding a child with brighter peers could actually damage his or her education, researchers warn. They said constantly being outshone in the classroom by brainboxes could shatter their confidence so much that they end up doing worse academically. Findings: Weaker children may be better off at lower performing schools, research from the London School of Economics has shown . So weaker students – both boys and girls – might be better off at a less competitive school as they have the psychological advantage of being a ‘bigger fish in a smaller pond’. Being a competent pupil in such a setting can help ‘motivate’ children and lead to ‘confidence, resilience and perseverance’, according to the findings. Bright children, however, tend to thrive as they move through their school careers because they are already filled with self-confidence. This positive side of the phenomenon . affects both sexes although it is far more pronounced in boys, according . to the paper from the London School of Economics. Similar levels: Both sexes seem to suffer when they are surrounded by brighter pupils, the study found (library image) The gain was said to be similar to a child who is the best in their street at football and ‘becomes more confident and spends more time playing and so further improves’. Dr Felix Weinhardt, a post-doctoral research fellow in economics, said: ‘Our findings go against the common assumption that having better peers is always the best for children. Previously we thought there were no negative effects. ‘But just making it into a better school and being at the bottom end of the ranks can have a negative effect.’ The research looked at almost 2.3million English pupils taking National Curriculum tests in maths, English and science. Assessments for those aged 11 (Key Stage 2) were used as a benchmark of ability while those for  14-year-olds (Key Stage 3) were used to rate how well they did at secondary school. The project also used a survey on confidence taken by 15,000 pupils. The data revealed those near the top of their class in primary school continued to improve while those who struggled often did worse. The upward trend was stronger for boys but the same for both genders in pupils from deprived backgrounds. The ratings for both boys and girls in the bottom quarter of performance at primary dropped at secondary level. Dr Weinhardt said parents could follow up the conclusions by flagging up a struggling pupil’s strong areas eg that they were ahead of others in the area or were doing well according to national ratings.","Surrounding a child with 'brainboxes' could mean they do worse academically, research has found .

"An unlikely entrant is about to join the space race next year, as Scotland launches its first home-built satellite. The country's first satellite may not cause too much jealousy at Nasa - the UKube-1 satellite is made of three 10cm by 10cm cubes, slightly more modest than the International Space Station. UKube-1 is being built at the West of Scotland Science Park in Maryhill, Glasgow by a local company, Clyde Space. Clydespace's UKUbe-1 satellite will be the first satellite to launch from Scotland - the hi-tech vehicle is expected to launch next year . Gateway to the stars? Workers at Clydespace claim that few people believe that they are making satellites in Glasgow's Maryhill (pictured) ClydeSpace's Systems engineer Steve Greenland says, 'People often ask me what my job is and I tell them that I'm building satellites in Maryhill' ‘Sometimes they don't believe it. Sometimes they laugh at me.’ Clyde Space has made dozens of tiny 'CubeSat' vehicles for other companies - 10cm by 10cm cubes. Chief Executive Craig Clark says, ‘A typical CubeSat mission was a . student-built satellite that would maybe go beep or try something out . that didn't cost a lot of money.' But the company is to link three cubes together to create UKube-1 - which will be the first complete satellite to be assembled by Clyde Space.

"'Not here though, right?' 'You're, like, a legit nurse?' 'This is awkward.' Yes, no and absolutely, but it was all for a good cause as YouTube prank video group Simple Pickup took on the taboo nature of testicular exams. Their video stars Marissa, an attractive woman in a novelty nurse's uniform and armed with a supply of rubber gloves and the offer to perform touch tests on men's genitals. For every taker, the group pledged to donate $100 (£64) to the Movember campaign and for every 100,000 views their video received over 30 days they would donate the same amount again. Marissa, of the YouTube prankster group Simple Pickup offers free testicle exams on Los Angeles street . After a sheepish response from passers-by, one man is up for the free (if not qualified) check-up . Marissa dons a fresh rubber glove and performs a check she says every man should do for themselves . Not surprisingly, the Los Angeles street they chose to patrol with their sign simply labelled 'Free Testicle Exams' there were plenty of skeptical blokes. Comments such as the 'I just have a passion for testicles', in jest of course, no doubt didn't help. And of course there was a combination of curious looks from those wandering by and other taking out their camera phones to record the moment. This man's willingness to participate made a further $100 for Movember . Some men were more willing than others to show their face during the exam though it was a public street . The man unzips and does his bit for the charity that raises money and awareness for testicular cancer . But there were six takers, meaning $600 (£383) for the Movember campaign, and five days after the video was first posted there have been more than 3.5million views on their official channel.That means a total ticking well over $4,100 (£2,600). 'In all seriousness, we did this video to show that you are just as qualified as I am to give yourself a thorough examination,' Marissa says at the end of the clip. 'So, I want you to do it right now [as her two colleagues oblige]. So if you notice any lumps or swelling, visit your doctor immediately.","Youtube prank group Simple Pickup offered 'Free Testicle Exams'

"Commons leader William Hague tonight fired a warning at Labour that banning Scottish MPs from voting on English laws ‘cannot now be avoided’. The former Foreign Secretary, emerging from a summit with Tory MPs at the Prime Minister’s countryside retreat at Chequers, said ‘English votes for English laws’ was ‘something we have to face up to’ in the wake of the Scottish independence referendum. He said handing more devolved powers to Holyrood had to go hand in hand with less Scottish influence over English laws. William Hague, the Leader of the House of Commons, said English votes for English laws 'could not be avoided' But Mr Hague held out an olive branch to the Labour Party – insisting that it would be prepared to hold talks on the issue in the coming weeks. He said: ‘We will be open to discussions - of course we will be - with the Labour Party and other parties as well.’ However he stressed that the issue had to be dealt with and that if the Westminster parties - including the Liberal Democrats - could not reach agreement they would have to set out their rival positions at the general election in May. He said: ‘This issue of fairness for England - as well as for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - I think is one that cannot now be avoided. That is now something we have to face up to. ‘It has been discussed for a very long time. The time has now come to make some decisions about this.’ It came after the London Mayor Boris Johnson said proposals to hand sweeping new powers to Edinburgh  were being introduced at a ‘blisteringly fast’ pace - despite claims by Scottish nationalists that Westminster was 'reneging' on its campaign promises. But he warned that the ‘basic unfairness’ of allowing Scottish MPs to vote on legislation which does not apply north of the border needed addressing. He said this ‘can be done while keeping the Union together’, but added: ‘It is just bonkers to say that it can be done overnight.’ Mr Johnson’s remarks come amid growing pressure on Labour to back the Prime Minister’s proposal - announced just hours after last week;s referendum result was confirmed - to ban Scottish MPs from voting on laws which only apply in England. Mr Cameron said the 'English votes for English laws' measure should be introduced ‘in tandem’ with handing new powers to Holyrood. The PM is holding talks with senior backbenchers at his official country retreat, Chequers, today to win support for his proposal. But Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls this morning refused six times to say whether it was ‘fair’ for Scottish MPs to vote on laws which did not apply in Scotland – and slammed Mr Cameron for using the referendum in Scotland to score political points. It came after the Labour leader Ed Miliband evaded the question thirteen times. London Mayor Boris Johnson this morning called for David Cameron to be given time to introduce English votes for English laws . Mr Balls said he wanted a ‘fairer’ solution to the problem, but said: ‘I think David Cameron is just trying to dupe people with an idea that he’s got some easy, quick political fix which him and William Hague and George Osborne sorted out. ‘You can’t play political games with our constitution. I want fairness, but I’m not going to say there’s an easy and fair solution to the question you’re raising.’ He continued that the Prime Minister was ‘playing fast and loose with the whole of our Union’. ‘I’m not going to say to you I’m going to sign up to a change in a couple of months because David Cameron is in a hole. ‘I do think is possibly the most un-prime ministerial thing I’ve seen David Cameron do in the last few years.’ SNP leader Alex Salmond has jumped on the wrangling over English votes for English laws to accuse Westminster of ‘reneging’ on its pledge to devolve more powers to Scotland. But Mr Johnson this morning said it was ‘tosh’ that David Cameron was going back on his ‘vow’. The London Mayor said: ‘It is simply not true that the undertakings have been breached; on the contrary, all political parties are going to huge lengths to be obliging. ‘The “vow” that appears on the front of last week’s Daily Record is actually quite vague. It boils down to “extensive” new powers for the Scottish parliament and government, and an agreement to get to work on the agenda as soon as possible. ‘David Cameron is putting William Hague in charge, and we are promised details by Burns night in January. ‘That strikes me as blisteringly fast, when you consider the gravity of the matters at stake.’ But he said: ‘If we give any more powers to Scottish politicians, then we simply must address the basic unfairness to England; indeed, it should have been addressed years ago, as soon as devolution kicked in.’ He added: ‘It won’t necessarily be easy, but it isn’t beyond the wit of man. It can be done, while keeping the Union together and giving Scotland the “extensive” new powers that have been agreed. It is just bonkers to say that it can be done overnight.’","Prominent Tory backbench MPs held talks with David Cameron today .

"A century ago it was the pioneering 'poverty' map which charted starvation and deprivation across London and the squalor of Victorian Britain. Now a modern-day version of social researcher Charles Booth's influential health map has painted a similar picture of sickness and disease, but with very different 21st Century causes. While many of the poor in London 100 years ago were suffering from starvation, the same areas in the capital today are rife with deadly Type 2 diabetes, caused not by malnutrition but by an excess of junk food. Startling similarities: The areas of London at high risk of diabetes in the present day map of London, left, are virtually the same as those which are most deprived in Charles Booth's social map of 1889, right . Mr Booth, a renowned Victorian social researcher, created his famous 'poverty maps' in the 1880s as an early form of 'social cartography' where different colours on the streets indicated the income and class of inhabitants. Booth highlights several areas of East London which are coloured black and blue, meaning London's poorest inhabitants had a 'chronic want' and were 'vicious' or 'semi-criminal'. The 21st century take on Booth's data highlights how disease and poverty are rife in exactly the same geographical areas. Poverty-stricken: Victorian families like this one in the late 19th century had to endure low life expectancy rates caused by squalor, disease and starvation . Hard times: While many suffered ill-health due to starvation in Victorian Britain (like these children in 1860) modern youngsters are at risk of developing diabetes through addiction to junk food . Philanthropist . Charles Booth's pioneering social research was ahead of its time in . Victorian Britain and eventually helped influence government action . against poverty. A . campaigner who became disillusioned with politics in the 1870s, Booth . conducted surveys analysing the numbers of people in school and . employment. His initial research was a precursor to his key work, 'The survey into . London life and labour'. After . criticising existing published work on poverty, Booth worked on the . survey which would later become one of the most important documents in . founding British sociology. As . part of his research for the survey into London life and labour, Booth . spent several weeks lodging with working class London families. His first map produced in 1889 documented street by street levels of poverty and wealth using coloured sections. The . importance of his social statistics work was recognised straight away, . as Booth was awarded the first Guy Medal in Gold in 1882 by the Royal . Statistical Society. Dr Douglas Noble's modern interpretation, published in the British Medical Journal, highlights how the same areas as in Booth's Victorian map are now in the highest bracket for risk of diabetes. Although there appears to be a correlation between Victorian Britain and modern-day London, the newly-researched maps do not account for various other factors which made for difficult living conditions 100 years ago. At the turn of the century, widespread lack of sanitation and poor diets meant pitifully low life expectancy rates. According to House of Commons research, the life expectancy in 1901 was just 45 for men and 48 for women. Today, thanks to huge advances in medicine and greatly improved living conditions, men can expect to live to around 77 and women into their 80s. Infant mortality has also plummeted since the end of the 19th century, when 140 infants died per 1000 in 1900 compared to less than 10 by the millennium. The areas of Victorian London where the 'lowest class or very poor' lived are now inhabited by those with a 13.8 to 17.3 per cent chance of diabetes. Public health expert Dr Noble, from Queen Mary, University of London, said: 'It was no surprise to see that diabetes risk is high in areas where poverty was high. 'What was surprising was that some of these pockets of deprivation and ill-health have persisted for more than 100 years. 'But . unlike in Booth's time, we now know how diseases like diabetes can be . prevented. Using electronic records to create maps like these throughout . the country could improve health and save money for the NHS.' Dr Noble's team chose to study type 2 . diabetes risk because it has well-known risk factors and is . preventable. It is strongly associated with poverty and South Asian . ethnicity, both of which are common in east London today. Although the study examined the London . boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Newham, the researchers say the . same technique could be applied anywhere in the country, and to other . diseases. Unlike the Booth . maps, which were based on observation, the new study uses an entire set . of electronic records from GP surgeries in the area. This very precise . information means the maps are much more accurate and will be useful to . individual GP surgeries. Electronic . records from more than half a million people were included in the research. Each was assessed for risk of developing diabetes using a . well-established prediction tool, known as the QDScore. People . were categorised as 'high-risk' if they were found to have a one in . five or greater risk of developing diabetes within ten years. Overall, . about 10 per cent of the adult population fell into the high-risk . category. But the maps showed 'hotspots' where up to 17 per cent were at . high risk. Further analysis showed these hotspots were associated with . areas of poverty. And these hotspots were surprisingly similar to areas of poverty highlighted in Booth's maps from more than a hundred years ago. Dr . Noble said: 'When you think of what life was like in the East End in . the late 1800s it's extraordinary what the NHS and public health . professionals have achieved, often with limited resources. 'But there's more still to do, and we hope this detailed information will help to reduce risk of diseases like diabetes.'","Same areas of East London at risk of poverty and illness 100 years on .
While Victorians suffered ill-health through starvation, modern-day map shows current generation put health at risk through too much junk food ."
"A government-funded project is being launched to combat malnourishment among the elderly. One million people over the age of 65 in England suffer from or are at risk of malnutrition, according to the charity Age UK, which makes them more susceptible to poor health. The project aims to increase diagnosis and treatment of the condition, and improve care and support for older people to stop them 'slipping through the net'. Health risk: Age UK warned that a million over-65s are at risk of malnourishment, which can lead to ill-health more generally, and make it harder for people to recover from hospital treatment . The Malnutrition Prevention Project is being piloted in five areas of the country. Projects in Lambeth and Southwark in London, and Salford, Greater Manchester, will begin in January. Hospitals, GP practices and care homes will work with community groups to reach the elderly at risk. The project will focus on those who have a low body mass index, are underweight, or who lose weight without trying. It will also target dehydration, which is often linked to malnutrition. Volunteers and professionals will raise awareness the symptoms among, and help those affected to take action. The project is funded by the Department of Health and run by the Malnutrition Task Force. The group of experts, which includes Age UK, was set up last year to address preventable malnutrition and dehydration in older people. It is part of the Government's response to the Francis Report into the Mid Staffs scandal, which revealed that patients, many of them older, were unable able to eat or drink properly and that nutrition was not treated as a priority. Research has shown that 93 per cent of malnourished older people are living in the community, Age UK said. Yet the condition often goes undiagnosed or untreated because of the incorrect belief that a smaller appetite and losing weight is a normal part of ageing. People who are malnourished experience increased ill-health, hospital admissions and risk of infections. It also takes them longer to recover from surgery, the experts behind the project say. When compared with well-nourished people, those who were malnourished see their GP twice as often, have three times the number of hospital admissions and stay in hospital more than three days longer. Problems: Malnutrition was a serious issue at hospitals, including Stafford hospital, caught up in the Mid Staffs Inquiry. The investigation found many older people were unable able to eat or drink properly and that their nutrition was a priority. One in three older people are already at risk of malnutrition when they arrive at hospital, making speedy recovery from other conditions more difficult. In addition, 37 per cent of older people who have recently moved into care homes are at risk of malnutrition. Dianne Jeffrey, chairman of the Malnutrition Task Force and of Age UK, said: 'Eating and drinking properly is critical to being healthy and remaining independent. Yet malnutrition goes untreated and diagnosed in nearly one million older people in England. 'We hope that by working closely with hospitals, GP surgeries and care homes we can tackle this hidden problem and help ensure that older people do not slip through the net.' Health minister Dan Poulter added: 'Many people think of malnutrition as a problem that only affects the Third World. But the reality is that over three million people in the UK have the potential to become malnourished - many of whom are frail and elderly. 'Action must be taken, and that is why we're teaming up with Age UK and funding the first stage of its campaign. Damning: The new Government initiative is part of a response to a report by Robert Francis QC, who led the Mid Staffs Inquiry . 'Carers and NHS staff will be better equipped to identify, tackle and prevent malnutrition - so older people get better care and receive more support in their own homes and communities. 'Around 13,000 people a year are admitted to hospital while suffering from malnutrition, and that is something that needs to change.' It is hoped the scheme will be expanded to tackle malnutrition nationally. Lenny Kinnear, of Age UK Lambeth, said the charity believes that one in 10 people over 65 suffer from malnutrition, meaning about 2,500 people in Lambeth. Mr Kinnear told BBC Breakfast the project can work if the health side of care is integrated with community-based support, which would help protect the health service from increased emergency admissions from malnutrition. He said the Lambeth pilot might involve a 'social prescription' that would involve advice on exercise and healthy eating. 'Older people go for regular health checks and the idea is that when they get the prescription they get some information on nutrition and exercise,' Mr Kinnear said. 'We would like the GPs to refer them to us. We can give them an adviser who will pair them up with people locally who will befriend them and volunteer to go shopping and things like that.'","Age UK warns elderly who eat too little are at greater risk of disease .

"'What to Do If You're Stopped By The Police' brochures were reportedly passed out to students at a Manhattan high school last week as part of a two-day seminar. The New York Civil Liberties Union was invited to teach the seminar by East Side Community High School Principal Mark Federman, The New York Post reported on Sunday. Federman told the newspaper 'We’re not going to candy-coat things - we have a problem in our city that’s affecting young men of color and all of our students. 'It’s not about the police being bad. This isn’t anti-police as much as it’s pro-young people...It’s about what to do when kids are put in a position where they feel powerless and uncomfortable.' Scroll down for video . 'What to Do If You're Stopped By The Police' brochures were reportedly passed out to students at East Side Community High School last week . Students' police encounters were cited by Federman as the reason for the NYCLU-taught course, The Post reported. The newspaper revealed that the 450 high school students learned about both stop-and-frisk as well as the use of the Fourth Amendment. The  Post reported that 'NYCLU representatives told kids to be polite and to keep their hands out of their pockets. But they also told students they don’t have to show ID or consent to searches, that it’s best to remain silent, and how to file a complaint against an officer.' Two high school male students told The Post they had been previously questioned by police. John Jay College of Criminal Justice professor Eugene O'Donnell criticized the program, telling The Post 'It’s unlikely that a high school student would come away with any other conclusion than the police are a fearful group to be avoided at all costs.' Information: Students received this brochure indicating what to do in case they are stopped by police officers . 'Education is the key, but are Civil Liberties going in with an agenda or to educate? I think we deserve equal time and should have the opportunity to follow up with the same platform to explain exactly what police do and what we think is the best way to deal with the police,' president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association Ed Mullins told the newspaper. 'This is not about teaching kids how to get away with a crime or being disrespectful,' NYCLU Associate Director for Advocacy Candis Tolliver told The Post. 'This is about making sure both sides are walking away from the situation safe and in control.' 'We hope it includes information about the hundreds of police officers who have sacrificed their lives to get guns and drugs off our streets,' Patrolmen's Benevolent President Pat Lynch, who has not looked at the brochures, told WPIX.","The New York Civil Liberties Union was invited to teach a two-day seminar by East Side Community High School Principal Mark Federman .

"The CEO of Sweet Peach Probiotics is a woman, it has been revealed - and she is none too pleased with how her male colleagues have portrayed her product to the public. Last week, entrepreneurs Austen Heinz and Gilad Gome sparked an outrage after announcing they were launching a supplement that uses DNA printing technology to alter your natural feminine scent - or, more precisely, to make your lady parts smell like peaches. As it turns out, they had no right to speak on the subject, since the sole founder of the company is 20-year-old Audrey Hutchison, a former Bard science student and self-described 'ultra-feminist' who says her invention has been grossly misinterpreted. Speaking out: Audrey Hutchison (pictured), the female CEO of Sweet Peach Probiotics, is none too pleased with how her male colleagues Austen Heinz and Gilad Gome portrayed her product to the public last week . While Mr Heinz and Mr Gome touted Sweet Peach as a way to 'empower' women by changing their natural scent, Miss Hutchison claims its principle aim is to promote optimal vaginal health. 'I'm obviously sort of appalled that it's been misconstrued like this because it was never the point of my company,' she told Inc. 'I don't want to apologize for [Austen], but at the same time I want to apologize to every woman in the world who's heard about this and wants my head on a stake.' Miss Hutchison explained that she wasn't at the DEMO conference where Mr Heinz and Mr Gome made their controversial debut of Sweet Peach because the men, who both own their own biotech companies, were actually invited to present different products. 'I wasn't ready to publicize my company at all,' she said. 'So now I have a lot of questions being asked and a lot of really terrible things being said about my company.' Mr Heinz, a biotech entrepreneur who owns just 10per cent of the Sweet Peach company, raised eyebrows when he said in his presentation last week: 'The idea is personal empowerment. All your smells are not human. They're produced by the creatures that live on you.' And Mr Gome, who is reportedly not involved in Sweet Peach at all, added: 'We think it's a fundamental human right to not only know your code and the code of the things that live on you but also to rewrite that code and personalize it.' Misconstrued: 'I wasn't ready to publicize my company at all,' she said. 'So now I have a lot of questions being asked and a lot of really terrible things being said about my company' While the men did touch on the fact that the pill helps prevent yeast infections and other health problems, they did not give the impression that this was its main purpose. The peach scent, Mr Gome said, is an indicator that the product is working. 'What, would you rather have it glow?' he added. Falsely believing that they were the sole founders of Sweet Peach, many questioned why the pair chose to focus on that particular body part - to which they responded that their invention could 'connect you to yourself in a better way'. Mr Gome explained that the female genitalia is the ideal body part for this type of DNA printing. 'It's a better idea than trying to hack the gut microbiome because it's less complicated and more stable,' he explained. Untrue: While Mr Gome (left) and Mr Heinz (right) touted Sweet Peach as a way to 'empower' women by changing their natural scent, Miss Hutchison says its aim is to promote optimal vaginal health . Plus, he added: 'It only has one interference per month.' In reality, Sweet Peach has nothing to do with scent, says Miss Hutchison. She told the Huffington Post that her company, which is still in the development stages, will provide women with kits to swab their vaginas at home and mail the swab into a lab. Scientists can then sequence the genomes of their vaginal bacteria in order to create a personalized probiotic that can fight UTIs and yeast infections. 'It's nothing about scent,' she insisted. 'A vagina should smell like a vagina, and anyone who doesn't think that doesn't deserve to be near one.' Mr Gome and Mr Heinz's presentation upset Miss Hutchison to such an extent that she has since changed her Twitter bio to read: 'CEO of Sweet Peach Probiotics and definitely not interested in making your vagina smell like a peach'. 'All I want to do is provide women with agency in their own reproductive health,' she tweeted on Thursday, adding that due to reading the negative press instigated by Mr Gome and Mr Heinz, 'I'm on the verge of projectile vomiting everywhere.'","Last week, Austen Heinz and Gilad Gome announced they were launching a supplement that uses DNA printing technology to make your lady parts smell like peaches .

"If you've a Batman fan in your life and you don't know what to buy them for Christmas, it would be hard to do better than this: a life-size, fully-functional Batmobile. Costing £90,000, which is considerably less than the £2.3million paid for the original TV Batmobile earlier this year, this replica with a straight six, fuel-injected modern Jaguar 3.2 litre engine with automatic transmission is practically a bargain. The jet black machine with functional flame-thrower at the back is based on the Batmobile driven by Michael Keaton’s caped crusader in the 1989 blockbuster, and will be one of the star lots when it goes up for auction in Weybridge, Surrey, at the end of the month. The Batmobile replica comes complete with flame-thrower and is expected to sell for £90,000 at auction . The road-legal car has its own flame-thrower and hydraulic suspension that can raise it nine inches . Impressive spoilers: This Batmobile was inspired by the car in the 1989 Batman film directed by Tim Burton . Built in the UK on custom chassis, the rear-wheel drive Batmobile comes complete with a fully operational flame thrower and hydraulic suspension which can raise the car by a further nine inches. It is claimed the car will hit 60mph in less than five seconds, although the visibility has been compared to that of a fighter jet. The replica, which took a year to build, was inspired by the 1989 Batman rather than the recent Christopher Nolan trilogy. In the film, Bruce Wayne’s alter-ego goes up against Jack Nicholson’s Joker character, who wreaks havoc on the people of Gotham City. The car will go up for sale at the Historics car auction on 30 November, and is expected to sell for between £70,000 and £90,000. Edward Bridger-Stille, from Historics, said: 'The car is like a dream for any Batman fan. It brings traffic to a standstill with people wanting to be photographed by it. Where do you put your latte?

"Screaming desperately and weeping with fear, this is the harrowing moment social workers wrested an infant from his mother's arms moments after he was born. Almost a year on, the parents, who cannot be named, are no closer to getting their baby back. Now, the father has spoken of the moment his son was taken for the very first time. 'They’re just saying they’ve got an . order, they’ve got to follow it,' he remembers. 'They’ve got to follow their orders. You . feel - there’s nothing you can do to stop it.' The six-hour-old baby is cradled by its father as a police officer stands close by in the secretly recorded video . Social workers had obtained an order to take the child before he was even born on the grounds that the parents required too much support to take care of the baby themselves. That, however, cuts no ice with the distraught family. 'You feel powerless, . useless, you know worthless,' adds the father. 'When they started pulling my wife’s . arms, [I knew] that was it.' The case, which involved social workers from Staffordshire County Council, led to outrage when the video was first revealed last September. Shockingly, far from engaging with the parents, the council instead attempted to gag the father and have the video removed from the internet. 'Staffordshire County Council, their only response was to get it pulled off the internet as quick as possible,' remembers the father. 'It just feels like an injustice. They reach into your life, take everything away and they're telling me to be quiet about it.' The mother is clearly distraught in the video as Staffordshire social workers and police take the baby away . Secret forced adoptions are becoming . increasingly common in the UK as a new ITV documentary due to be . screened tonight makes plain. In Exposure: Don't Take My Child Staffordshire Council why they wanted to stop the father’s webcam filming being seen and whether the method of the son’s removal was necessary. They did not respond specifically to these points. But they did say that placing a child into care is an absolute last resort and it was the courts, and not the council, which make the final decision based on significant concern for the welfare of the child. But with figures showing that forced adoptions have shot up by 95 per cent over the last three years, this scenario is becoming increasingly common. In total, 1,860 children were adopted without their parent's consent last year, nearly all in closed adoptions which means the parent cannot contact the child in any way until the age of 18. Destroyed: The father says he was left feeling powerless and upset by the removal of his baby son . Escape: Some mothers have fled into the care of Ian Josephs' network rather than face social workers . Parents whose children are subject to forced adoption orders, which are not allowed in any EU country with the exception of the UK, cannot tell anyone what is happening to them and the media cannot report on the cases - all in the name of protecting the child and its family. It's a sign, says barrister and family lawyer Martha Cover, that things have gone too far. 'The purpose of the legislation that . protects the confidentiality of children’s proceedings and the identity . of children’s and their families, is to protect them,' she explains. 'But by a side wind, . it has had the effect of also protecting poor local authority practice, . poor social work, and inadequate experts, poor expert reporting to the . courts.' As a result, more and more parents are fleeing abroad and into the arms of networks such as the one run by Ian Josephs, a British multimillionaire currently living in Monaco. 'I've got one here from a 19-year-old girl who is pregnant and has been told by social workers that they will take her baby at birth,' he says, pointing to one of the thousands of cases he takes on each year. One social worker can be heard saying: 'We are here to take [baby J]. I don't want to have to get physical' Harrowing: The bewildered newborn baby can be heard crying during the distressing seizure . 'Why? Because [social services] say it's at risk of emotional abuse. French social workers don't believe me when I tell them children can be taken for emotional abuse, let alone for being at risk of it. 'I get so many people but the ones that get me rattled the most are the pregnant ladies. What chance to they have? 'I tell them to leave because social services can't stop a pregnant lady from leaving. They can't put an order on a foetus. They've tried but the judges said no, they can't do that.' For the family whose child was taken so publicly by Staffordshire County Council, the nightmare continues. 'As soon as they got the baby, they were out of the flat,' remembers the father.

"The shocking moment that thugs used a home-made battering ram to smash their way into a family home was captured on CCTV. The three burglars threatened the occupants with knives before breaking into the garage and stealing an Audi A5 and a BMW motorbike. The men, dressed in dark clothing and wearing balaclavas, were caught on an outside security camera as they raided the property in Blackley, Greater Manchester last Thursday. Scroll down for video . The first thug is caught on camera as he walks towards the property, past the car that was later stolen . Two of the men are seen carrying a homemade battering ram towards the front door of the family home . Their faces covered with balaclavas, the men lift up the battering ram - ready to break down the door . They used a makeshift battering ram to break through the locked front door shortly after 10.30pm, police said. Once inside, the three men split up, with one holding a 7in kitchen knife to the first victim’s throat while one of the other men went upstairs and threatened the second victim with a knife. Keys to the victims' Audi A5 and BMW motorcycle were taken, along with a motorcycle helmet and leathers. The thieves drove away from the raid in the vehicles. The thugs are described as white men, all wearing dark clothing and full face balaclavas. They all spoke with local accents. Holding the bar between them, the men break into the property, where they threatened victims with knives . After stealing the keys from inside the home, the men come back outside to start the engine of the Audi .

"In an episode of animated series Futurama, Professor Farnsworth unveiled a contraption known as the ‘Smell-O-Scope’, which let users ‘smell’ distant stars and planets. Although billed as a fictional device, Nasa scientists claim to have developed a similar system and have used it capture the 'flavours' of Saturn’s moon Titan. By replicating Titan’s atmosphere in a lab, they were able to work out what Titan's atmosphere is made from, and the technique could be used to discover the composition of other worlds as well. Nasa scientists have recreated the 'scent' of Saturn's moon Titan (pictured in ultraviolet and infrared) by combining gases in a lab and letting them react. This helped to determine the identity of a material that had been detected in the atmosphere by the Cassini spacecraft, which is now thought to be benzene . In the experiment, researchers at Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland recreated Titan’s atmosphere in a lab by mixing different gases thought to make up its hazy exterior. With . its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a . frozen version of Earth, several billion years ago, before life began . pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because . Titan is less massive than Earth, its gravity doesn’t hold onto its . gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (600 kilometres) into space. As on . Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight . that come with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about . seven Earth years long. Titan's ‘water’ is liquid methane, CH4, . better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be . frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180°C (-290°F). With . Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow . twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall . more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. Scientists think it rains . perhaps only every few decades. Two of these, namely nitrogen and methane, were previously known, but the third component that had been detected was a mystery. Through a method of trial-and-error, they eventually found their best attempts at mimicking the atmosphere occurred when their third gas was benzene - most commonly found in gasoline. The process was not entirely dissimilar to how a chef tastes a dish and works out what ingredients were used in the recipe. By trying different gases, the researchers were able to create an artificial atmosphere that matched the signature of Titan’s real atmosphere. Benzene is what is known as an aromatic hydrocarbon, and it's a sweet-smelling compound. However, the researchers warned that because of Titan’s immense surface pressure, people would have a hard time smelling it on the surface. 'Now we can say that this material has a strong aromatic character, which helps us understand more about the complex mixture of molecules that makes up Titan’s haze,' said Melissa Trainer, a planetary scientist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. In the research scientists aimed to create an 'atmosphere' that mimicked the signature of Titan's as shown in this graph. To do so scientists had to experiment with different gases until benzene was found to give the same signature. The process was similar to how a chef works out the ingredients in food by tasting it . In the animated television series Futurama, Professor Farnsworth creates a comical 'Smell-O-Scope' (pictured) that lets him and his crew 'smell' the composition of distant stars and worlds, used in one scene to spot a rip in space-time. Nasa's lab experiment, while less impressive-looking, surprisingly used a similar principle . Previous attempts to recreate Titan’s atmosphere in a laboratory have seen limited success, as aside from nitrogen and methane it was not well-known what it is composed of. This new method of combining gases and letting them react gives astronomers a better understanding of this Earth-like world, so labelled because of its thick atmosphere and surface lakes and seas. ‘Titan’s chemical makeup is veritable zoo of complex molecules,’ added Scott Edgington, Cassini Deputy Project Scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. ‘With . the combination of laboratory experiments and Cassini data, we gain an . understanding of just how complex and wondrous this Earth-like moon . really is.’ It is feasible this same method could be used to work out the composition of atmospheres on other worlds - including, most intriguingly, those of potentially-habitable planets outside the solar system. This would help astronomers work out if a particular exoplanet contains the right atmospheric ingredients for life to exist. Nasa's Cassini spacecraft (illustration shown) has been orbiting Saturn and its moons since 1 July 2004. The probe has been a huge success, revealing untold secrets of the Saturnian system including liquid oceans on Titan's surface, huge storms on Saturn and geysers on the icy moon Enceladus . Most of what we know to date about Titan comes from Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft, which has been orbiting the Saturnian system since 1 July 2004. However, while Cassini has imaged the surface and studied the atmosphere of Titan, it had been unable to identify a material in the moon’s smoggy haze. Now thanks to this research astronomers have a better understanding on what this world is made of. The mystery material was first detected by Cassini’s Composite Infrared Spectrometer, an instrument that makes observations in the infrared. ‘This is the closest anyone has come, to . our knowledge, to recreating with lab experiments this particular . feature seen in the Cassini data,’ said lead author of the study Joshua . Sebree.","Nasa scientists in Maryland recreated the atmosphere of Saturn's Titan .

"The timing of the birth of the future monarch was on everyone's minds today as the nation waited on tenderhooks for the little Prince's arrival. After the announcement that the baby boy arrived at 4.24 today, we now know he is a Cancerian, like his father Prince William and grandmother Diana, Princess of Wales. Astrologers predicted that if the Duchess of Cambridge had a lengthy labour, the Monarch could be a feisty Leo rather than an emotional Cancerian. Had he been born after 4.54 today, the child would have been a Leo, like its great aunt Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon, and Princess Anne. Scroll down to watch video . He's a Cancerian! Just like his father and grandmother, the Royal baby narrowly avoided becoming a Leo. If he had been born just half an hour later, we could have had a very different kind of Monarch . The Duchess of Cambridge went into labour at 5.30am this morning - with many suggesting the  approaching full moon at 11.16am helped bring on the contractions. Prince William was by his wife's side at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, west London, where he himself was born in 1982. Astrologer with The Association of Professional Astrologers International, Deike Begg, says the timing of the baby's birth this afternoon plays a huge role in his personality type. She said, as a Cancer, the baby should be . sensitive, caring, shrewd, family oriented and protective of their loved . ones. She said the baby's moon will be in Capricorn - which is the same star-sign as his mother. 'This means the baby will share a lot of the parents' personality traits. Different personality types: Diana, Princess of Wales, pictured left at a Live Aid for Africa concert in 1985, was Cancer, while Princess Margaret, pictured in 1960, was a Leo . 'As . a Cancer, the child will be very family oriented like its parents and . sensitive. Cancers often appear strong on the outside but are very soft . on the inside. 'But with a Capricorn moon it would also be aware of its responsibilities and dependable.' Traditionally . those born under the star-sign of Cancer arrive between June 22nd . and July 22nd although the exact dates vary slightly every year. Famous . Cancers include South African president Nelson Mandela, Hollywood . actors Harrison Ford, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise, and Edward VIII, who . gave up the throne for American divorcee Wallis Simpson. Prince William, who was born on June 21, is a Cancerian as was his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, whose birthday was July 1. Sharing signs: The Royal baby is a Cancerian like Prince William, pictured left, with a moon in Capricorn - the same star-sign as mother Kate, pictured right . Astrologer Patrick Arundell said the . future king or queen will be more conventional because it is a . Cancerian, but would have been more of a ground-breaker if he was born . tomorrow as a Leo. Mr Arundell said the baby would also have a lot of 'go-get energy' and star quality. 'Mars . and Jupiter are conjunct in Cancer and that will give the baby a . tremendous amount of go-get energy and that is already in motion,' he . said. He added: 'Venus . and the Sun are also in a magnetic connection which will give the baby a . star quality and a sparkling charisma.' Meanwhile there have been numerous theories as to what caused the Duchess of Cambridge to go into labour - whether it was the full moon, an electrical storm or just conventional 'Baby Mean Time'. Maternity . wards are said to be busier during a full moon, although there is . debate in the medical world about whether the moon does encourage women . to go into labour. Waiting game: Members of the world's media gathered outside The Lindo Wing when The Duchess Of Cambridge went into labour at St Mary's Hospital in London this morning . Mervi . Jokinen, of the Royal College of Midwives, said midwives often talk of . how the full moon makes for a busy spate of deliveries. 'It's . always sort of been an old wives tale saying that the full moon brings . women into labour. Midwives usually do say ""I'm on call. It's a full . moon. I'll be busy tonight"",' she said. 'There . was a study about 20 years ago at a hospital near the River Thames . which is a tidal river and it showed that on the full moon they did have . more births. 'The idea . is that because the baby is surrounded by water, the time of the full . moon and the high tide causes the waters to break. But there's not enough scientific evidence to show it's proven.' Birth . coach Zara de Candole, of Doula UK, said: 'As a doula (birth coach) who . has supported many women in labour, there does seem to be some link . between labour kick starting and a full moon.' There are also suggestions electrical storms and a drop in barometric pressure can bring on labour. Famous Cancers: Former South African President Nelson Mandela, pictured, actors Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise were all born under the Cancer star-sign . Western central London - near where William and Kate's Kensington Palace apartment is based - experienced isolated heavy rain, thunder and lightning strikes at 6am this morning - just at Kate was admitted to the Lindo wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington. Chris Burton, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'The storm affected western central London. There were lightning strikes at around 6am and very localised, intense heavy rain and thunder. 'We've had high pressure with the sunshine but now there's low pressure and it's hot and humid which can cause thunder storms.' Mervi Jokinen said she had not seen a connection between labour and electrical storms. 'We are full of electrolytes but I don't know. it's not something we've discussed as a midwific community. I can't vouch for that,' she said . She added that babies also arrived to their own agenda and their own time scale and put in an appearance when they are ready. 'Nature has its own way of preparing for labour. Before the baby comes, the body need to do some preparations and that's very important,' she said.

"McDonald's is testing a mobile app that enables customers to order and pay for food with a swipe of their cell phone. The fast food giant is trying out the new app at Salt Lake City, Utah and Austin, Texas stores with the intention of rolling it out country-wide if it proves successful. The new app is the latest attempt by the company to attract the millennial market, joining competitors such as Chipotle which has a mobile payment app, and Burger King, which in some cities offers online ordering and free delivery. Even easier: If the drive-thru window wasn't convenient enough, customers can now order and pay for their fast food fix with their cell phones . After placing and paying for an order on the app, customers can pick up their food in-store, at drive-through windows or curbside. According to CNBC, McDonald's is suffering lukewarm sales, posting a 0.2 per cent increase in same-store sales for August, which fell well short of the estimated 0.8 per cent. App-etizing: Many major retailers such as McDonald's are anticipating that smartphones will replace plastic as the primary payment method in everyday transactions . The fast-food chain has recently added menu items such as the McWrap and the Eggwhite Delight, designed to appeal to the millennial market, which has been difficult for the company to attract. According to Business Insider McDonald's doesn't even rank in the top 10 favorite brands for that generation. 'McDonald's is just evolving at the same pace as consumers - especially the younger generation and millennials who really don't pay in cash,' Darren Tristano, an executive vice president at Technomic, a research and consulting firm, told CNBC. The company already has one app which enables users to search for store locations, nutritional information and jobs, and offers free wi-fi in-store. 'We’re always looking at new technologies to make the McDonald’s experience better for our customers,' McDonald's spokesperson Lisa McComb told Bloomberg. 'We are testing some of these technologies in a few markets, so it’s premature to speculate on the decisions we may make after the tests, but we’re excited to bring a cutting-edge experience in the future to our customers.' The notoriously brand-disloyal millennial, or Generation Y, demographic is an important market for many companies, which are going to increasing lengths to secure their business. Fries with that? The new McDonald's app will offer promotions and a loyalty program . According to market researcher NPD Group, hamburger chains have seen a 16 per cent decline in traffic from millennials since 2007. A big reason for the courting of millennials, a group of 80 million or so people in the U.S., is that while younger people tend to follow in the their wake, older generations are also increasingly looking to the influential group and learning how to use technology such as smartphone apps from their children. 'They're 80 million [people] but they're influencing the next 80 million, both younger and older,' Gary Stibel, CEO at New England Consulting Group told Advertising Age. McDonald's has more than 14,000 locations in the U.S. and about 35,000 locations worldwide.","McDonald's is testing an app that enables customers to order and pay with their cell phones .

"The sex secrets of New York men reveal them to be a collection of neurotic, insecure, unfeeling perverts, too scared to commit to a relationship with someone they care for. According to Big Apple sex therapist Dr. Brandy Engler, who has listened to the psychological issues of the men-folk of New York for seven-years, serial cheating, porn addiction and soliciting prostitutes are all symptoms of an inability to settle down in the big smoke. From successful bank executives who pay for prostitutes, to S&M dungeon loving hedge fund chiefs and even men convinced that 'good guys finish last', Engler has listened to them all betray their sordid secrets - while charging them $150 an hour for the privilege. Dr. Brandy Engler has spent seven years working out of her Times Square offices in New York examining the sexual problems of the men of the city . Indeed, Engler has conducted so many sessions out of her Times Square offices examining ailments such as sex addiction, erectile dysfunction, sexual anxiety, chronic womanizing, jealousy and porn addiction, that she has compiled them into a book called 'The Men on My Couch'. 'There were times I felt repugnance,' Engler admitted to The New York Post. 'Sometimes I had to work hard to hide my instinctual reactions.' Originally opening her practice to counsel women, Engler says she was stunned that her most interesting clients were men. 'Young and handsome men — accomplished in almost every way — are coming to me nervous about being around women,' she said. 'They desire to please us, to perform for us, but have deep fears about what we really think about them. I was surprised at how many of my male clients were anxious to the point of dysfunction over their desire to satisfy a woman.' The therapist outlines different cases in point, with names changed to protect their anonymity. Dr. Engler found that successful men often found themselves seeking no-strings attach sex with prostitutes as a way of coping with their insecurities . Charles, a successful engineer was jilted by his fiancée on their wedding day and years later he makes his girlfriend play-act that she is two-timing him as the only way he can become sexually excited. 'Tell me how you're going to do it!' he commands. 'In the bathroom - while you're in the next room,' replies his confused girlfriend, half-heartedly. Engler recounts how Charles' current relationship became so weird that the girlfriend began cheating on him for real and eventually left him. Another striking example of the insecurities of men in New York who came to Engler for help was Paul, a bank executive in his early 40s who was deeply in love with his confident new wife. However, according to Engler, Paul could not perform in the bedroom, telling her, 'I'm having trouble keeping it up. So I'm having sex with prostitutes. I'll give you five sessions to fix this.' Together the pair analyzed his problems and realized that he was a 'blustery alpha male' who wanted sex without any expectation, or as he put it, sex with 'non-beings'. Engler told The New York Post that erectile dysfunction was 'the most common complaint' that she'd heard. And 'many of the men who were visiting massage parlors did have some sort of sexual dysfunction...with the women that they were actually interested in.' They got performance anxiety when it was someone whom they cared about pleasuring, or would judge them for it. Dr. Engler conducted therapy with men who were only committed to the chase of gaining some women's telephone numbers - with no desire to call them . So sending Paul back to his wife, Engler tried to get him to treat his wife in a caring and compassionate manner - but his wife rebuked his efforts and he stopped attending therapy. 'In the end, it was Paul who had become the 'non-being'. Another type of New York man was David, whom Engler dubbed 'The Number Gatherer.' He was a successful hedge-fund manager, who lived in TriBeCa and had bagged himself a model girlfriend. 'My girlfriend is absolutely gorgeous,' he bragged according to The New York Post. 'She’s tall and blond, a model with a perfect rack and rock-hard abs.' However, this wasn't enough for him and all he would do would spend time in clubs trying to get telephone numbers from available women - and most of the time would never call them back. 'It’s exciting, like winning a game,' he boasted to Engler. 'There’s a process to it, and I’m known for being the best.' The old axiom that 'nice guys finish last' rang true on a number of occasions for Dr. Engler during her dealings with her disaffected male clients . Engler says that she established with Engler that he was a show-off, a narcissist for whom 'everything is measured by how the outside world sees him.' Eventually after therapy, David discovered his girlfriend was cheating on him and he ended it with her, moved to Brooklyn and started learning to play the guitar. 'What I learned from David is that when men cheat, it’s often psychological, not physical,' Engler said. 'A man can be with the sexiest, most beautiful woman on Earth, but it will still not be enough.' Of course there is the flip side to all this promiscuity, with the 'nice guy' who was in a relationship where his girlfriend did not find him interesting anymore. Engler said that she had one couple, Kasha and Alex, who came to her because the sex had become monotonous. 'I’ve seen so many examples like this. Alex is the quintessential nice guy. He doesn’t know how to keep himself and his woman sexualized,' Engler said. 'I saw this all the time with my male clients: They learn some skills, but they don’t have the chutzpah — self-possession and courage — to pull it off.' Dr. Engel also discovered that when men were married to women more secure and confident than them that they often strayed because of their own insecurities . On the other side of the scale is Oscar, a building contractor who openly admitted during a group therapy session that he was cheating on his wife with a younger woman. 'She'll do anything sexually,' he boasted to the group. Engler told The New York Post that at first she would find it difficult to sympathize with a serial cheater until she could discover the reasons. Oscar told her that he felt impotent in his relationship and that his wife was smarter and her family richer than his. 'My wife makes all the decisions around the house. I know it’s because I’m never home, but I feel useless when I’m there. I’m just a paycheck to her. 'I feel like she doesn’t appreciate anything,' he told Engler. 'The number one complaint from men about women in long-term relationships is, ‘I don’t feel appreciated,’ Engler told The Post. 'Men are looking for some expression that they are valued.' No less destructive was the prevalence of pornography addiction among the men of New York City . The darker side of New York male sexuality is expressed by the so-called 'nice guys', trusted by women, but who hide the most dirty of secret sex lives. Engler discusses Casey, who would have been seen as an enlightened soul, whose mother was a feminist. The professor would complete a days work and then excitedly return home to download porn, especially degrading pornography. As is usually the case, the porn stars he idolized were nothing like his girlfriend, who he called 'a porcelain doll' and whose lovemaking he felt was 'routine and vanilla.' Engler has noted an increase in the number of men coming to her to examine their addiction to porn and she has some insight. 'I’m seeing this in a lot of men I treat,' Engler said. Other men had to attend S&M clubs where they would pay to hire women to 'torture' within the boundaries of the sexual play . 'They feel like they can’t be their authentic selves around the women that they are in love with. But guys who feel this way will find outlets somewhere.' In this case however, Casey's girlfriend was willing to come to therapy sessions where they were encouraged to discuss his more base sexual desires and now has 'much less interest in his nightly porn habit.' As an offshoot of soliciting prostitutes, one patient of Englers, Mark had developed a secret love and desire to visit S&M clubs where he would pay for prostitutes and 'torture' them.'He feels dominated, powerless and trapped by the women in his life, and he is full of rage about it,' Engler says. 'So it busts out in his very compartmentalized sex life.' However, for Engler, despite Mark's apparently well adjusted life, she says he taught her something about the 'good guys' of New York. 'There’s something wrong with their ability to be real and authentic. And they’re going to find a way to deal with their frustration elsewhere.'","New York sex therapist Dr. Brandy Engler has released a new book, 'The Men on My Couch' which outlines the various sexual malfunctions of the men in the city .

"Dr Raj Mattu, pictured with his wife Sangita, was sacked after blowing the whistle on shocking standards of care. A tribunal has now cleared him of any wrongdoing after a 13-year battle at a cost of £10million . The cardiologist sacked after blowing the whistle on shocking NHS failures was wrongly accused of sexual misconduct, fraud and assault as part of a decade-long intimidation campaign aimed at forcing him to drop his unfair dismissal case. The leading heart surgeon – who spoke out against dangerous overcrowding in NHS hospitals - has detailed the extraordinary bullying he suffered as his bosses attempted to blacken his reputation. Instead of listening to his concerns over the shocking standards of care on the wards, bosses first suspended, then sacked him and then spent millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money  pursuing him through an employment tribunal. They also submitted more than 200 false allegations about him to the General Medical Council – all of which, he says, were rejected. Dr Raj Mattu was cleared of any wrongdoing yesterday – after a 13-year battle thought to have cost the taxpayer £10million. Incredibly, it emerged his bosses also spent . thousands of pounds of public money hiring private investigators to look . into the affairs of the heart specialist, and on employing a PR agency . to deal with potentially damaging media fallout from the case. Dr Mattu said immediately following his decision to blow the whistle, the hospital’s head of security was asked to monitor his movements to start building a dirt file that could be later used to discredit his reputation. He says he believes the NHS wanted to ‘try and find as much information to use against me as possible’. ‘I was accused of fraud, I was accused of sexual impropriety, assaults, not doing my duties and so on,’ he told the BBC. 'Unfortunately that is . a common practice of many managers within the NHS, this denial of what the . primary reason is as to why you are targeted. ‘It is very hard to believe that it is sheer coincidence that, having never faced, from 1979 to 2001, any allegations or complaints, that suddenly I should have become so altered in my nature and personality that suddenly more than 200 allegations were justified. 'I just find it quite difficult to overcome the fact that there is always this attempt to put forward a plausible alternative when the real reason at the heart of why all these allegations were suddenly mustered up is the fact that I had whistle blown, spoken out as an advocate for the patients and was not prepared to accept what was in the best interests of the managers.' After the 13-year ‘David and Goliath’ battle, a tribunal yesterday found the surgeon had been unfairly dismissed. And, . in a landmark judgement, the tribunal ruled he had been targeted by . hospital managers specifically because he blew the whistle. 'I’m absolutely relieved that one of the things that has come out of this case that I have won is that I have been vindicated for what I did, because one of the other key findings of the tribunal is that they found that I had not caused or contributed to towards my dismissal,' Dr Mattu said. 'Emotionally it has been very draining. I have mixed emotions over the judgement: I am relieved that I have won the case, I am also pleased that my detriments have been recognised by the employment tribunal. 'But the saddest thing out of all of this for me is that the people who have lost out the most are the patients and the public because for 13 years the trust management have prevented me from looking after patients. 'They have also, in the way they have treated me, discouraged any further whistleblowers in the NHS from coming forward and risking having their career and livelihood destroyed.' Last night the Health Secretary, MPs and patients groups condemned Dr Mattu’s unacceptable treatment and the outrageous use of public money. Charlotte Leslie, a Tory member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘The fact that an individual, who has done their best to raise their concerns about patient safety, should have cost the NHS this amount of money is absolutely sickening. ‘The NHS needs to radically reform the way it thinks of whistleblowing.’ Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘This shows just how important it is that whistleblowers speaking out about poor care can be confident they will be listened to.’ Dr Mattu said he wanted talks with Mr Hunt and NHS chief executive Simon Stevens about his case and the treatment of whistleblowers. 'I am hoping Jeremy Hunt will now grant me a meeting and Mr Stevens, the new chief executive of the NHS, will eventually meet with me so that we may discuss my experiences and, perhaps most importantly, learn important lessons that will prevent any other doctor from being treated this way,' he said. He warned 'the protection presently available in the NHS is not adequate’ for those doctors and nurses who want to speak out. 'The NHS needs to radically reform the way it thinks of whistleblowing. This shows just how important it is' - Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . Dr Mattu first voiced concerns about the high death rate for heart bypass operations at Walsgrave Hospital in 1999, which at the time had far higher death rates than expected. He blamed at least two of the deaths on the cost-cutting practice of putting five patients into bays equipped for only four. In one case Dr Mattu and two senior nursing colleagues lodged an official report after a 35-year-old patient died because staff could not reach him with vital lifesaving equipment in an overcrowded bay. When the Trust failed to respond to his concerns, or those of the Commission for Health Improvement and the Department of Health, Dr Mattu decided to go public, and spoke to the BBC. This, he said, led to the start of a ‘witch-hunt’. Five months after appearing on the BBC he was suspended not for clinical mistakes or for whistle-blowing, but for allegedly bullying a junior colleague – claims that were later disproven. Meeting: Dr Mattu wants to explain his point of view to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt . Judgment: A tribunal ruling found against managers at the Walgrave Hospital in Coventry, now University Hospital Coventry . After seven years being suspended on full pay, in 2007 the £70,000 a year cardiologist finally had his suspension lifted – becoming the longest-suspended doctor in the country. But the trust made it impossible for him to return to his previous position, a Birmingham Employment Tribunal heard yesterday. Dr Mattu claims he experienced . increasing hostility from the Trust management. Then, after raising . grievance proceedings he faced further false allegations. Dr Mattu said: 'I can only hope that the NHS learns from my case and starts to listen to doctors and nurses' After a short period in work, Dr Mattu’s health deteriorated as a result of these unsubstantiated allegations, and he was forced to take sick leave in February 2010. Dr Mattu was eventually sacked by the Trust in 2010 – while he was still in his hospital bed – nine years after he first raised concerns about dangerous post-operative care. Judge Patricia Hughes and her panel at the Tribunal yesterday ruled the Trust unjustifiably treated Dr Mattu by dismissing him as a consequence of his illness. Judge Hughes added that Dr Mattu did not in any way cause or contribute to his dismissal. However, the tribunal said it could not prove that Dr Mettu’s claim that his dismissal in 2010 was a direct result of whistleblowing because ‘those claims were presented out of time’. Dr Mattu’s lawyer claims the Trust submitted over 200 false allegations about him to the General Medical Council, resulting in the cardiologist being investigated from 2002 to 2009 and 2011 to 2013. They say this makes him the UK’s most investigated doctor by the GMC. However, according to Mr Mattu’s lawyers, the GMC has never found cause to proceed to an inquiry, instead rejecting the many and varied allegations. Following yesterday’s judgment, Dr Mattu’s solicitor, Stephen Moore at Ashfords LLP, said Dr Mattu was ‘completely vindicated’. A statement from University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust said it was disappointed with the ruling.","Dr Raj Mattu was sacked after exposing two patients had died in dangerously overcrowded bays at University Hospital Coventry .

"A nurse who was part of desperate attempts to save the life of President John F Kennedy after he was assassinated has claimed he was shot by a 'mystery bullet'. Phyllis Hall, who was 28 at the time, says she was dragged into the operating room by a secret service agent as medics scrambled to help the president, who was fatally shot in Dallas, Texas on 22 November 1963. While cradling his head, which had been torn apart by gunshots fired from the famous 'grassy knoll', Mrs Hall says she spotted an unusual bullet, which was promptly removed and never seen again. Fateful day: President John F Kennedy and First Lady Jackie Kennedy ride in the President's motorcade through Dallas on November 22, 1963 . Claims: Phyllis Hall, pictured right, described a bullet in JFK's neck which she says was never seen again . She described the bullet in an interview with the Sunday Mirror, which she said looked completely undamaged, and bore no resemblance whatsoever to bullets later shown as evidence in investigations into the President's murder. She said: 'I could see a bullet lodged between his . ear and his shoulder. It was pointed at its tip and showed no signs of . damage. There was no blunting of the bullet . or scarring around the shell from where it had been fired. 'I’d had a great deal of experience working with gunshot wounds but I had never seen anything like this before. It was about one-and-a-half inches long – nothing like the bullets that were later produced. 'It was taken away but never have I seen it presented in evidence or heard what happened to it. It remains a mystery.' Motorcade: President John F Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally ride through Dallas moments before Kennedy was assassinated . Mrs Hall, who had six years of nursing experience at the time, says she was caught up in the effort to save the President by accident, as she had been visiting a friend who worked on another ward. She described the chaos as Mr Kennedy's entourage burst through the doors, and recalled clearly the vacant expression of First Lady Jackie Kennedy. Mrs Kennedy reportedly gripped the President's right foot as surgeons wages a losing battle to save him. Jacqueline Kennedy kisses the casket of her husband, President John F. Kennedy, in the rotunda of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, accompanied by their daughter Caroline . Mrs Hall, now 78, says she offered her condolences after a neurosurgeon pronounced Mr Kennedy dead after a 43-minute struggle by as many as 20 staff. However, she says the shocked First Lady simply stared into the distance. As her shift didn't finish until the evening, Mrs Hall continued working for hours after the President was declared dead, and didn't even tell her husband what she had witnessed. However, in recent interviews she revealed that she is 'a big believer in the conspiracy theories' surrounding the Mr Kennedy's death.","Phyllis Hall was 28 when President John F Kennedy was shot in 1963 .

Twopcharts said that 30% of existing Twitter accounts have sent 1-10 tweets, and only 13% of the accounts have written at least 100 tweets. It also found 47% of users have never uploaded a profile pictures. However, Twopcharts is unable to track how often people logged into their accounts. Last month, the firm estimated there have been 1.5 billion signups in Twitter’s eight-year history, but 500 million were deactivated or deleted as a result of spam and other transgressions. Twitter said it has 241 million monthly active users the last three months of 2013. The firm also tracked how people access Twitter, and found the iPhone app the most popular . Twitter defines a monthly active user as an account that logs in at least once a month. By Twitter’s standards, a person does not have to tweet to be considered a monthly active user. A Twitter spokesman declined to comment, saying the company does not comment on third-party data. Earlier this week the company said it was introducing a redesign of profile pages that includes bigger photos, more user controls and a distinct resemblance to Facebook. 'Moment by moment, your Twitter profile shows the world who you are,' the company wrote in a blog post. As part of its latest redesign, Twitter users can now pin tweets to the top of their profile, add larger profile pictures, and customise their header images. Tweets that have received the most retweets or interactions now appear larger on a person's profile. Michelle Obama's Twitter account pictured features the new look . 'Starting today, it will be even easier (and, we think, more fun) to express yourself through a new and improved Web profile.' As part of changes coming in the next few weeks, users who access Twitter via the Web will notice larger photos on their profile pages. Besides profile photos on the left corner of the page, the redesign includes a large banner photo that resembles the big rectangular cover photos on Facebook pages. Users will be able to ""pin"" one of their tweets to the top of the page to give others an idea of the topics they like to tweet about. In addition, tweets that receive the most interest from other users will appear slightly larger. Earlier this year, Twitter rolled out the new design to select users and it was criticised for closely resembling how Facebook profiles look. The . most noticeable change was the size of the cover photo. Twitter added . the feature initially during a redesign in September 2012, five months . after Facebook included it as part of its Timeline rejig.

She shared the footage on Facebook, which has been seen by almost 3.5million people, and four hours after the suspects dumped the dogs 11 miles away, she was reunited with Nelson and Brock. Scroll down for video . Two thieves were captured in shocking CCTV footage, which shows them brazenly stealing the two dogs . They were spotted by two 16-year-old boys who had been walking home from a party at about midnight on Friday when they were followed by two black and brown puppies. Jamal Betts and Matt Kipping had been discussing the video earlier that night with friends and it dawned on them that the two animals were the ones from the video. Mr Betts quickly called his mother and then the RSPCA and they waited with the dogs until the police arrived. His mother, Tara Betts, said: 'Nelson was very anxious but was coaxed into my car with Brock who was quick to jump in because he knew he was going home. 'The police took one look at the dogs and said ""yep, that's them"" and informed the boys that the dogs they had rescued were in fact the stolen working dogs from Cranleigh.' The two men drove up to Tina Drayson's house in Cranleigh, Surrey, on Friday afternoon, unaware they were being filmed .

The U.S. Air Force's top secret X-37B military plane which has orbited the Earth for nearly two years is set to finally land today . The shuttle took off from Cape Canaveral, in December 2012, but will finally come back to Earth this week . X-37B's original mission was supposed to last nine months, but it has now been circling the earth for far more than double that amount of time (artist's impression) Its original mission was supposed to last nine months, but it has now been circling the earth for far more than double that amount of time. Skeptics believe the 29ft (8.8m) shuttle's mission is defense or spying-related, but the military plane's purpose remains a highly-guarded secret. In 2011, amateur astronomers were able to detect the orbital pattern of the first X-37B which included flyovers of North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan, heightening the suspicion that the vehicle was being used for surveillance. The Orbital Test Vehicle, which is solar powered, is designed to land automatically. Two hangars at the Vandenberg base have been cleared, ready for its arrival. Colonel Keith Baits, 30th Space Wing Commander, said: 'Team Vandenberg stands ready to implement safe landing operations for the X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle, the third time for this unique mission.' The mystery spacecraft, which skeptics say could be being used for spying, is expected to land at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California . The X-37B is too small to carry people onboard, but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck, which is just large enough to carry a small satellite . The plane has been in space for a total of 672 days, far more than its two previous flights which lasted 225 and 469 days. The U.S. Air Force's unmanned X-37B space plane has flown three secret missions to date. Each time it has carried a mystery payload on long-duration flights in Earth orbit. The spacecraft looks similar to Nasa's space shuttle but is much smaller. The X-37B is about 29ft (8.8m) long and 9.5ft (2.9 m) tall. It has a wingspan of just less than 15ft (4.6 m). At launch, it weighs 11,000lbs (4,990kg). The craft is taken into orbit on a rocket but lands like the space shuttle by gliding down to Earth. The program's first mission launched in April 2010 and landed in December that year. The second space plane took off on March 2011 and came back to Earth in June 2012. According to X-37B manufacturer Boeing, the space plane operates in low-earth orbit, between 110 and 500 miles above earth. By comparison, the International Space Station orbits at about 220 miles. Both top secret missions ended at Vandenberg base, but this may soon change as Boeing, which built the shuttles, is working to renovate a NASA hangar at the Kennedy Space Centre, which could become X-37B's new home. All missions so far have launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida. While the airplane looks like NASA's retired space shuttles, it has its own identity. Like a shuttle, it is blasted into orbit by a rocket. However, it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft.

"Scientists have made the first ever detailed 3D images of polar sea ice, using an underwater robot. The depth of Antarctic ice has previously been difficult to measure using satellites because it is often covered in a thick blanket of snow. But now, the high-resolution maps of Antarctic sea ice will help scientists investigate dramatic changes in the polar region - and the results have already revealed the ice is thicker than first thought. Scroll down for video . A team of UK, US and Australian researchers have measured Antarctic sea ice. They found it was up to 56ft (17 metres) thick in places - much thicker than expected. The measurements were made using an underwater robot called SeaBed, also called 'Jaguar', which is pictured mapping under the sea ice . The measurements were carried out by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) known as SeaBed, which provides a new way of mapping sea ice, from below. It was built and operated by engineers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in Massachusetts, while the project also involves scientists from the UK, US and Australia. In some areas, the team found ice up to 56ft (17 metres) thick - much thicker than that measured by previous techniques - but the exact thickness, and the differences in thickness is not known. The research was reported in the journal Nature Geoscience. A report from the World Bank Group recently claimed that the world must brace itself for more extreme weather, as it is locked on a path to unstoppable warming. They said some effects of climate change will be unavoidable owing to past and predicted emissions from power plants, factories and cars. But they added the worst impacts could be avoided by cutting global emissions. The report, entitled 'Turn down the Heat: Confronting the New Climate Normal', stated that the average temperature on Earth will be 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels by 2050. Sea levels will also continue to rise as the vast ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica thaw slowly, they said. The submarine is 6.5ft (two metres) long and operates at a depth of 66ft to 98ft (20 to 30 metres), bouncing sound waves off the under-surface of the ice. Satellites can measure large-scale ice thickness, but their data is often difficult to interpret because of snow covering the ice. Man-made measurements carried out by drilling holes and observations from ships, meanwhile, are more accurate but are limited by lack of access. But the submarine can measure the thickness of the ice much more accurately. Three locations around the Antarctic Peninsula were mapped - the Weddell, Bellingshausen and Wilkes Land sectors covering an area of 5.4 million square feet (500,000 square meters). 'Our surveys indicate that the floes are much thicker and more deformed than reported by most drilling and ship-based measurements of Antarctic sea ice,' the researchers wrote in their paper. 'We suggest that thick ice in the near-coastal and interior pack may be under-represented in existing in situ assessments of Antarctic sea ice and hence, on average, Antarctic sea ice may be thicker than previously thought.' Ice floes - packs of floating ice - are shown in various regions of Antarctica. Previous data is in green (ship-based) and red (drill data), while the latest data using the SeaBed robot is shown in the blue squares. The team measured sectors covering an area of 5.4 million square feet (500,000 square meters) The submarine was built and operated by engineers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in Massachusetts, US. In some areas they found ice up to 56 feet (17 metres) thick - much thicker than that measured by previous techniques (stock image of Weddell Sea ice shown) The data from SeaBed, combined with airborne measurements of sea-ice surface elevation, ice coring surveys, and satellite observations, vastly improves scientists' estimates of ice thickness and total sea ice volume. The next step is for the scientists to carry out large-scale surveys that can be compared to large-scale observations from aircraft and satellites. Dr Jeremy Wilkinson, from the British Antarctic Survey, said: 'The AUV missions have given us a real insight into the nature of Antarctic sea ice - like looking through a microscope. 'We can now measure ice in far greater detail and were excited to measure ice up to 17 metres [56 feet] thick.' Here, researchers drill through the sea ice in the Bellingshausen Sea to position a navigational transceiver before a deployment of SeaBed. The data from SeaBed, combined with airborne measurements of sea-ice surface elevation, ice coring surveys, and satellite observations, improves estimates of ice thickness . The mapping by the submarine was undertaken in two expeditions during 2010 and 2012. Routine surveys will now allow the team to monitor changes over long periods of time. Dr Hanumant Singh, a member of the WHOI team, added: 'Putting an AUV together to map the underside of sea ice is challenging from a software, navigation and acoustic communications standpoint. 'SeaBed's manoeuvrability and stability made it ideal for this application where we were doing detailed floe-scale mapping and deploying, as well as recovering in close-packed ice conditions. 'It would have been tough to do many of the missions we did, especially under the conditions we encountered, with some of the larger vehicles.' The submarine (shown) is 6.5ft (two metres) long and operates at a depth of 66ft to 98ft (20 to 30 metres), bouncing sound waves off the under-surface of the ice. Satellites can measure large-scale ice thickness, but their data is often difficult to interpret because of snow covering the ice . And Professor Mike Meredith, deputy director of science at the British Antarctic Survey, said: 'Sea ice is changing in both polar regions, with important consequences for climate and the ecosystem. 'In contrast to the Arctic, the changes around Antarctica vary from region to region, but full understanding of the causes and impacts of these changes requires detailed knowledge of how thick the ice is, which has historically proven very hard to get. 'Satellites can now give information about this over large areas, but proper interpretation of the satellite data requires direct measurements also. 'This new paper presents important results obtained from a novel underwater vehicle that radically change our concepts of the structure of Antarctic sea ice, and the processes that influence it. Such understanding is key to improving our models of how sea ice will change into the future.'","UK, US and Australian researchers have measured Antarctic sea ice .
The ice was up to 56ft (17 metres) thick in places - thicker than expected .
But the exact thickness, and how it varies from previous measurements is not yet known .
Measurements were made using an underwater robot called SeaBed .
This was sent under ice floes and used sound waves to measure them .
These are the most detailed measurements of polar sea ice ever made .
But scientists said it is not an indicator either way on the effects of climate change and more data is needed ."
"Good wishes: Gary Goldsmith is the first relative of the Duchess of Cambridge to speak out . The Duchess of Cambridge's uncle Gary Goldsmith was the first member of her family to speak out today following news that she has gone into labour. The controversial businessman took to Twitter to discuss the 'very very exciting' announcement just a few hours after Kate was admitted to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London. However, there was no sign of any other members of the Middleton family - even though the Duchess' mother Carole and sister Pippa were expected to be at her bedside when she gives birth. Kate, 31, was driven from her home in Kensington Palace to the exclusive Lindo Wing of the hospital shortly before 6am today. She . is being accompanied in hospital by her husband William, who drove her . to London from her family home in Berkshire on Friday afternoon. This . morning at 7.30am it was publicly announced that the Duchess was in labour, and . Mr Goldsmith subsequently posted a message on his Twitter feed in which he subtly alluded to . the news. The . 48-year-old wrote: 'Woke up to Thunder this morning but not a drop of . rain? Now it's blistering & supposedly the hottest day if the year . oh & very very exciting'. He was then met with a chorus of . congratulations from his 1,710 online followers, and sent out thanks to . many of those who had got in touch. Tweet: The businessman took to Twitter with a subtle reference to the happy news . Joy: Gary Goldsmith, pictured on the day of the Royal wedding in 2011, has spoken of his happiness after his niece the Duchess of Cambridge went into labour . Mr . Goldsmith, a self-made millionaire who is the brother of Carole . Middleton, has courted controversy in the past after being caught . apparently taking cocaine in a sting operation. However, . he insists he is close to his elder sister, and was a guest at William . and Kate's wedding in Westminster Abbey in April 2011. The . Duchess is said to be exceptionally close to her parents, Carole and . Michael, as well as Pippa and their brother James, both of whom took . prominent roles in the wedding. Carole . and Pippa were said to be planning to joining Kate at St Mary's for the . birth, but it is not currently clear where they are. Where are they? Pippa and Carole Middleton, pictured at Wimbledon last month, were expected to join the Duchess of Cambridge in hospital but both have remained absent . Parents: Kate is expected to spend time with her father Michael and mother Carole after giving birth . Couple: Prince William is by Kate's side after she was driven to hospital from Kensington Palace this morning . It has been suggested that the Duchess will return to her family home in Bucklebury after she has given birth. She spent last week in the village with William and her close relatives before returning to London three days ago. Residents of Bucklebury today told of their excitement at the birth of a future monarch with roots in the area. The village has been strung with bunting, and pubs were preparing to open specially to mark the historic occasion. Hospital: Kate is in labour in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London . Anticipation: Crowds of visitors gathered outside Buckingham Palace waiting for the royal birth . Scrum: The world's media are gathered outside St Mary's Hospital where Kate is in labour . The Middletons' home is being guarded by police in a sign that the Royal couple are expecting to stay there in the near future. Kate's former piano teacher Daniel Nicholls said: 'It's fantastic news that she's in labour and it's fantastic news for Kate and William and their families. 'Bucklebury just remains Bucklebury - it's a sleepy little village. Kate, I think, is a normal straightforward person and it's great for the Royal Family she's on board. 'Once the baby is born, Bucklebury will take it in its stride that the future, future King or Queen of England will come from here.'

"A breast cancer test which could save thousands of women the ordeal of chemotherapy is to be made available on the NHS. The test can accurately predict the chances of a tumour returning once it has been removed by surgery. From today, doctors will be urged by the NHS rationing body NICE to offer women the test, called Oncotype DX, to check whether they really need chemotherapy. Thousands of women with breast cancer could be spared chemotherapy every year thanks to a test which has been approved for use on the NHS . At present, about half of the 48,000 . women diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK every year undergo a course . of this debilitating treatment after the tumours are taken out. This . is meant to eradicate any cancer cells that have broken away from the . main tumour, which could cause the illness to spread to other parts of . the body. But many women with the illness have a very low-risk form that is unlikely to spread. Experts . estimate that between 4,000 and 5,000 women a year with this low-risk . breast cancer are needlessly being put through exhausting chemotherapy. It usually lasts three to six months and causes hair loss, sickness and tiredness and may leave women permanently infertile. But . from now on, doctors will be urged to offer women the test – which . costs £2,580 a time – whenever they are uncertain about the risk of the . cancer returning. In three quarters of cases, doctors can estimate how . likely the tumour is to return just by looking at its size and how . quickly it has grown. The genetic test could benefit those with early-stage breast cancer facing the intensive treatment, which has side effects include nausea, vomiting, insomnia, hair loss and fatigue . But . the remainder of women (about 9,000 a year) have what is termed . ‘intermediate-risk’ cancer and it is very difficult for doctors to . assess it. Nearly all of . these women are given chemotherapy just in case even though about half . may not need it. The new test works by analysing small samples of the . tumour after surgery. The . samples will be posted by doctors to a lab in Redwood City, California, . where they are put through a machine that closely looks at 21 genes. Studies have suggested that half of women with the most common form of early breast cancer could be spared chemotherapy. Image shows breast cancer cells . The . machine then comes up with a score of between zero and 100 based on the . chance of the tumour returning. Patients who score zero to 18 will be . told they don’t need chemotherapy while those over 31 will be urged to . have the treatment. When patients get a score of between 18 and 31, doctors will use their own discretion. Professor . Carole Longson of the Health Technology Evaluation Centre at NICE, . said: ‘Breast cancer patients face significant emotional and . psychological strain when considering chemotherapy. ‘A . test that can help to predict better the risk of the breast cancer . spreading, and therefore the potential likely benefit of additional . chemotherapy, represents a significant step forward for patients.’ Sally Greenbrook, senior policy officer at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘This is a good decision from NICE.’ Recently other researchers have developed far cheaper versions of the test including one, ICH4, which costs just £120 a time. But . NICE said it needed to look at more evidence about the success of this . test –invented by doctors at London’s Royal Marsden hospital – before . recommending its use across the NHS. It comes in the wake of the release earlier this week of a new jab which will revolutionise breast cancer treatment. NHS England has given the go-ahead to the Herceptin injection being used. It takes just five minutes  to administer and is estimated to save the NHS £20million  a year.","Nice has approved the Oncotype DX test for use on the NHS .

"A report from the World Bank Group has claimed that the world must brace itself for more extreme weather, as it is locked on a path to unstoppable warming. They say some effects of climate change will be unavoidable owing to past and predicted emissions from power plants, factories and cars. But  they say the worst impacts could be avoided by cutting global emissions. Scroll down for video . The World Bank Group in Washington DC says Earth is locked a path to warming. They say extreme weather will become more common as the climate changes. This is due to past and predicted emissions from factories and plants (stock image shown), but the worst impacts can be avoided by cutting emissions . The report, entitled 'Turn down the Heat: Confronting the New Climate Normal', stated that the average temperature on Earth will be 1.5°C (2.7°F) above pre-industrial levels by 2050. Sea levels will also continue to rise as the vast ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica thaw slowly. At current temperatures, it's estimated seas would rise seven feet and six inches (2.3 metres) in the next 2,000 years. Temperatures are set to increase, though, meaning this effect will likely be faster - average temperatures have already risen by about 0.8°C (1.4°F) since the Industrial Revolution, according to the World Bank's report. 'Today's report confirms what scientists have been saying - past emissions have set an unavoidable course to warming over the next two decades, which will affect the world's poorest and most vulnerable people the most,' said Jim Yong Kim, President of the World Bank Group. 'We're already seeing record-breaking temperatures occurring more frequently, rainfall increasing in intensity in some places, and drought-prone regions like the Mediterranean becoming drier.' The report reveals how rising global temperatures are increasingly threatening the health and livelihoods of the most vulnerable populations on Earth, magnifying problems each region is struggling with today. Latin America and the Caribbean . Heat extremes and changing precipitation patterns will have adverse effects on agricultural productivity, hydrological regimes and biodiversity. In Brazil, without additional adaptation, crop yields could decrease by up to 70 per cent for soybean and up to 50 per cent for wheat at 2°C (3.6°F) warming by 2050. Ocean acidification, sea level rise, tropical cyclones and temperature changes will impact coastal livelihoods, tourism, health, food and water security, particularly in the Caribbean. Melting glaciers would be a hazard for Andean cities. Middle East and North Africa . A large increase in heat-waves combined with warmer average temperatures will put intense pressure on already scarce water resources, with major consequences for human consumption and regional food security. In Jordan, Egypt, and Libya, crop yields could decrease by up to 30 per cent at 1.5 to 2°C (2.7 to 3.6°F) warming by 2050. Migration and climate‐related pressure on resources may also increase the risk of conflict. Western Balkans and Central Asia . Reduced water availability in some places becomes a threat as increases in temperatures head toward 4°C (7.2°F). Melting glaciers in Central Asia and shifts in the timing of water flows will lead to less water resources in summer months and high risks of torrential floods. In the Balkans, a higher risk of drought will impact crop yields, urban health, and energy generation. In Macedonia, yield losses are projected of up to 50 per cent for maize, wheat, vegetables and grapes at 2°C (3.6°F) warming by 2050. Predicted effects include reduced crop yields and rising sea levels. In Brazil, without additional adaptation, crop yields could decrease by up to 70 per cent for soybean (pictured( and up to 50 per cent for wheat at 2°C (3.6°F) warming by 2050. In Jordan, Egypt, and Libya, crop yields could decrease by up to 30 per cent . A common threat is the risks posed by heat extremes. State‐of‐the‐art climate modeling shows that 'highly unusual' heat extremes, similar to the heat-waves experienced in the US in 2012 and Russia and Central Asia in 2010, increase rapidly if emissions cause the world to warm by 4°C (7.2°F). The report also reveals that the risks of reduced crop yields and production losses for the regions studied increase significantly above 1.5 to 2°C (2.7 to 3.6°F) warming. For example, a rise of 2°C (3.6°F) in average world temperature over pre-industrial times would mean a reduction in Brazilian crop yields of up to 70 per cent for soybean and up to 50 per cent for wheat in 2050. In the report Mr Kim wrote: 'Dramatic climate changes and weather extremes are already affecting millions of people around the world, damaging crops and coastlines and putting water security at risk.' As examples of extremes, he pointed to the hottest November day in Australia  'or the five to six feet [1.5 or 1.8 metres] of snow that just fell on Buffalo' in the US. Officials from almost 200 nations will meet in Peru from 1 to 12 December to work on a deal, due in Paris in late 2015, to slow climate change.","World Bank in Washington DC says Earth is locked on a path to warming .

"Shocking footage has emerged of a group of taxi drivers allegedly buying and smoking drugs before heading out to pick up passengers. In an exclusive A Current Affair investigation, four different cab drivers are seen  pulling up in the same street on several occasions and make a quick trip to the suspected drug house. The video appears to capture the drivers, in their work uniforms, brazenly smoking in their cars in broad daylight or the middle of the night in the west Melbourne suburb of Sunshine, while littering the ground with discarded sheets of burnt foil. Scroll down for video . Shocking footage has emerged of cab drivers apparently smoking ice before they hit the streets on their job . While observing the footage, drug and substance abuse expert from the Penington Institute John Ryan told the show it was likely the men were using methamphetamine, known as ice. ‘The vapour we saw in the video disappears quickly which is not typical of cigarette smokers – it’s a much more cloudy smoke from cigarettes than what it is say from an ice pipe,’ he told A Current Affair. In the footage, one cab driver is seen making a stop at a suspected drug house before he picked up a ‘friend’ and make their way to a busy shopping centre down the road. Former drug addict John Shaw told A Current Affair that he is 99 percent certain the men were smoking ice after viewing the footage. ‘You can see by the flame, at the bottom from the reflection of the windscreen that he’s heating up – you need to heat it up to melt it a little bit – it comes in crystallised form,’ he said. One man is seen jumping into the back seat with the other cabbies while holding a sheet of foil in his hand . The same man is seen leaving the vehicle sometime later and he is spotted holding a sheet of foil again, as well as a pipe sticking out of his mouth . Shaw was hooked on ice for nine months and revealed how the drug affected his life and how it affects the minds of users. ‘There's no way you could be under the speed limit and on ice because the adrenaline that goes through your body is way too high,’ he said. ‘You’re more likely to speed on the road because your mind is all over the place and you think of weird different things all at once so you can’t focus on anything. ‘Fatigue sets in very quickly – once again your concentration level is low, well, next to nothing.’ In another piece of footage, the same car returns to the street with two passengers while the cab driver is seen making his way into the suspected drug house before driving around the corner. Moments later, another man from another car is seen getting into the backseat of the car, with a sheet of foil in his hands. After spending some time in the car, the man gets out, while openly holding the foil in his hand and a pipe sticking out of his mouth. An hour later, the same cab driver is spotted back at the house and he drives to a nearby street shortly after to meet with another cabbie as he jumps into the vehicle. Not long afterwards, the cab driver is seen picking up passengers. The video captures the drivers, in their work uniforms, parked in front of the suspected drug house and some are spotted meeting up with other cabbies . The same car returns to the street on several occasions and the driver is seen making a quick stop at the suspected drug house . A Melbourne woman, who wished to not be named, told A Current Affair that she has constantly witnessed the same taxi drivers rolling up on her street and in front of the same suspected drug house for the past five months. ‘I thought maybe they were residents of the flats across the road but that had become very evident - there is a dealer,’ she told A Current Affair. ‘I’ve seen these taxi drivers pulling up to the drug house, doing the deal, take off aggressively into the other street, smoking the drug and then just littering the burnt foil out onto the street. ‘We’re not talking about one user – we’re talking about multiple users.' She also added that she has brought the matter up with the local authorities and even called triple zero but 'no one attended'. Former drug addict John Shaw told A Current Affair that he is 99 percent certain the men were smoking ice . A Taxi Services Commission spokesperson said the company ‘will take enforcement action against drivers found to be participating in illegal activities and putting passenger’s safety at risk' Ice, also known as methamphetamine or crystal meth, has shot to the top of Australia's crime enforcement agenda, with the Australian Crime Commission declaring the country is in the grips of an 'ice pandemic'. The drug, believed to be more addictive than heroin, can quickly cause brain damage comparable to Alzheimer’s disease, as well as violently psychotic behaviour and delusional paranoia. Victorian Minister for Public Transport Terry Mulder said in a statement there are 'strict penalties in Victoria, requiring all commercial drivers to be alcohol and drug free when they are driving'. 'The Napthine Government has recently announced that it will more than double the amount of random drug testing in Victoria from 40,000 to 100,000 a year.' A Taxi Services Commission spokesperson said the company ‘will take enforcement action against drivers found to be participating in illegal activities and putting passenger’s safety at risk'. ‘Taxi drivers found using illicit drugs while at work are likely to be subject to disciplinary action which may result in the suspension and/or cancellation of their driver accreditation by TSC. They may also be subject to criminal charges by Victoria police.'","Shocking footage has emerged of cab drivers apparently smoking ice .

"Hand transplants are being denied to English patients because of a bureaucratic NHS row, Britain’s leading expert said last night. In the meantime, Scottish patients can jump the queue and be treated in England while the dispute drags on. Professor Simon Kay performed the UK’s first hand transplant a year ago on former pub landlord Mark Cahill, 52. Potential hand transplant patients are being denied surgery because of a funding row, says the surgeon who performed the first transplant surgery on Mark Cahill (pictured) last year. Mr Cahill is progressing well . Success: Mr Cahilll's doctors say they are very pleased with his progress. He is gaining improved movement and feeling in his new hand . Professor Kay and his team at Leeds . General Infirmary performed the pioneering operation on Mark Cahill, who . is gradually regaining feeling in his hand. But no further operations have since been carried out - despite two patients being assessed as suitable for the procedure. It may not be until 2015 until these patients can undergo surgery and the delays follow the biggest-ever reconfiguration of the NHS. Clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), which have been given charge of the bulk of NHS spending - including hand transplant surgery - are refusing to finance the operations, claiming it is the responsibility of NHS England which pays for specialised care. The funding dispute is believed to be among a number due to the complex shake-up in April. Internationally-renowned specialist Professor Kay, who heads the transplant team in Leeds, said he was frustrated at the delay. Both patients, one from the East of England and another from London, could be operated on 'immediately' if funding of £66,000 for the first year was available, with further life-time costs mainly for anti-rejection drugs running into several thousand pounds a year. Frustrated: Because of the funding row, Professor Kay says he will most likely operate on a Scottish patient next - in England . 'We are saying this is clearly the responsibility of the CCGs,' said Professor Kay, 'If they want to say no to it, they have to give a good clinical reason and there isn't one. 'Surgery would be life transforming for both patients. We could go ahead now - we are up and ready to go. 'NHS England have been very constructive. The people who haven't got up to speed are the CCGs in this respect. We certainly hope it can be resolved. They really do need to understand the value for their patients and move quickly.' Instead, a patient from Scotland is likely to be the next to undergo a transplant in the summer as funding north of the border - which has had no re-organisation - is still available. Professor Kay added: 'It will mean a Scottish patient will have treatment in England when an English patient can't at the moment. It really does need to be sorted out.' The team say they are very pleased with the progress of Mr Cahill, of Halifax, West Yorkshire, who is gaining improved movement and feeling in his new hand. Mr Cahill, 52, a former pub landlord, said: 'It's something I've been very proud to have. I think it's super.' He left the infirmary three weeks after the transplant but regularly attends the hospital for physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychology, as well as checks from the team. NHS England said: 'The specialised services that are the responsibility of NHS England are set out in regulations and are determined by Ministers. Other hospital services are the responsibility of CCGs, including, at present, hand transplant. ""Ministers are looking at whether, during the next phase of deciding which services will be specialised, this service should become a prescribed service. 'In the meantime it remains the responsibility of CCGs to decide whether this surgery should be funded or not.'","Professor Simon Kay performed the first hand transplant last year .

"Suspended: Dr Christopher Driskill allegedly kept a stash of alcohol in his office and drank on the job . A doctor has been suspended by the New Mexico Medical Board after he allegedly had sex with patients, drank alcohol on the job and left women to give birth unattended. Dr Christopher Driskill, a married father-of-four from Hobbs, is even accused of leaving a woman in labor alone because he was busy having sex with another patient, according to the board's report, shared by the Albuquerque Journal. He posed a 'clear and immediate danger to the public' for his multiple infractions, the board ruled. Driskill, the incoming president of the New Mexico Medical Society, has not yet appealed the decision. The board is now considering whether to revoke his license but a hearing date has not been set. The board's report listed a number of startling incidents, the Journal reported. He has been accused of having sex with several of his patients, including some who worked for his former practice, and of prescribing drugs to a girlfriend without proper medical records. He also allegedly drank alcohol at work and worked while he was under the influence. He even had a stash of alcohol in his office, according to the report. He left moms-to-be to give birth unattended on multiple occasions 'within the past few years' at Lea Regional Medical Center and was once late to work so delayed a c-section, the board said. 'Family man': Driskill, pictured with his wife and their children, allegedly had sex with his patients and staff - and once missed a woman giving birth because he was having sex with a patient . 'Danger': The medical board ruled that the doctor posed a 'clear and immediate danger to the public' And in other instances, he wrote lewd personal notes in medical charts of certain patients. 'Your sexual relationships and abuse of alcohol have negatively affected your practice of medicine,' the board said in its suspension notice, the Journal reported. In August, Driskill was fired from his job at Premier Health in Hobbs and 10 days later, Premier told his other workplace, the Lea Regional Medical Center, of his termination. He had by then requested a temporary leave of absence and has not returned to work since - but he failed to tell the board about his termination and leave of absence, as is protocol. Scene: He worked at Premier Health and the Lea Regional Medical Center, which are next to each other in Hobbs, New Mexico. The report accuses him of stashing alcohol at his Premier Health office . The doctor was 'president-elect' of the New Mexico Medical Society and was expected to become president of the society in May. A representative from the organization, which represents the majority of physicians in New Mexico, said it would not comment on the matter until after the hearing. Records show he is married to wife Nancy Ann, and they have four children of school age together. He has not responded to requests for comment.","Dr Christopher Driskill, a married dad with four kids, 'kept a stash of alcohol at work, drank on the job and worked while under the influence'

"In the dock: Jacqui Porter, 40, denies a single count of concealing or converting proceeds of crime and says her husband's life of crime happened without her knowledge . The wife of a fraudster who stole millions from a property company claims she knew nothing about his life of crime despite it funding  luxury cars and holidays for his family, a court heard today. Company director Gerald Porter, 51, cheated his firm Greenfield Property Management Limited (GPML) to lead a super-rich lifestyle with wife Jacqui, jurors heard. But Mrs Porter, 40, wept today as she said her ‘cad’ husband cheated on her and embroiled her in his fraud while he partied at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles, a court heard. She denies any knowledge of her former husband’s crime, claiming she was at home looking after their children and had no idea what he was up to. She is accused of concealing or converting the proceeds of crime after allegedly using company cards for designer spending sprees and writing cheques from his company's accounts. ‘I was totally unaware of a lot of things that Gerry was doing,' she said. 'I was at home with the children and he was at work and I ran my side of things at home and he did his business things - the two didn’t cross over'. But her Scottish husband was having affairs and often on business trips, leaving her with piles of blank cheques to cover the family’s vast expenses and top up his legitimate £60,000 salary. ‘At least once a month he would be away for a long weekend and sometimes he would be away for a week at a time,' she said. ‘I think you heard from Brian [Comer, co-owner of GPML] that he went to Vegas and Los Angeles for the Lennox fight, he also visited the Playboy Mansion,’ she said. When Gerald scored his dream job with the Comers, he told her he was given a £25,000 ‘golden handshake’ and a salary of £150,000, the court heard. And he quickly started using GPML cash to bankroll contracting companies and to take set up businesses including a coffee shop and a nursery at the North London Business Park, it is said. Jacqui was recruited into the fraud, taking a substantial salary from companies she did minimal work for and writing more than a hundred cheques using GPML’s accounts. Evidence: Mrs Porter said her husband was away for long periods on trips where he would cheat on her, go to sporting events and even the Playboy Mansion, picture, on one occasion, the court heard . But she denies any knowledge of the scam, telling jurors Gerald fooled her into believing the GPML cash covered a shortfall in his salary and would be declared to the Inland Revenue. ‘Gerry would leave a pile of [signed cheques] and say that of someone was coming to the house to write out the cheque,’ she said. ‘I didn’t think it was inappropriate because Gerry told me it was all going to be balanced at the end of the financial year.’ Jacqui met her husband while working as an industrial chemicals saleswoman when he offered her a lift in his forklift truck across a muddy Uxbridge building site in 1994 . He initially moved into her three-bed council home but by 2005 the family with two new children moved to a five-bed rented mansion, costing more than £32,000 a year. The ex-policeman had a number of affairs throughout their relationship but Jacqui stuck by her husband, saying she felt responsible for becoming ‘fat and unattractive’ after the birth of her fourth child. Former rugby star Kenny Logan said he was taken in by Gerarld Porter a court heard. The Scottish winger gave evidence as a witness in the trial of Mr Porter's wife, Jacqui, today . ‘A package came through my door with a bundle of emails in it - they were very explicit,’ she sobbed. ‘They basically said Gerry had been having an affair with a lady he worked with and that I was stupid that I didn’t realise what had been going on, that basically he was a cad and philanderer and that I should leave him.’ Gerald also took a ‘high ranking police officer’ as a lover and temporarily left the family home, jurors heard. Jacqui went on credit card spending sprees across the world blowing thousands of pounds in French Connection, Emporio Armani and other designer labels in Dubai, the court has heard. She claims the Barclaycard, which was funded by the company, was only used for ‘emergencies’, the jury was told. Former rugby star Kenny Logan, husband of one of the BBC sport’s most highly paid presenters, said he knew Porter through his rugby world connections and was sucked into a ‘life of fantasy’. Rugby fan Gerald spent part of the cash on the London Wasps Rugby Club and Mr Logan who was unwittingly sponsored with the illegal cash. Gerald introduced himself to Mr Logan in an airport lounge and boasted he was the sponsor of rugby star Fraser Waters, a member of the London Wasps Rugby Club. Mr Logan believed Gerald to be a director of Comer Group, the parent company of GPML, and even entered into an investment with the Scotsman. Mr Porter ploughed £100,000 of GPML cash into Championship side London Scottish while the west London-based club were struggling financially and in the fourth-tier of the English rugby league. He even provided a Mercedes to the coach, unbeknown to the club, causing ‘a lot of confusion’ when the sacked coach attempted to hand it back. At one VIP dinner, held to celebrate the team winning the Heineken cup, Gerald arranged sponsorship by the Comer Group which would have cost ‘about £15,000’, jurors heard. It seemed that ‘money was no object’ for him who would indulge his passion by buying tables costing thousands at exclusive rugby events. He did not even attend one dinner at the upmarket Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh, worth £5,816, the court heard. He also splashed out on ‘top wines’ at ‘top restaurants’ including Claridges, in London and he ‘thought nothing’ of hiring helicopters to transport people to events. Mr Logan, who is married to TV presenter Gabby Logan (left), said he was ashamed to have introduced Mr Porter to his mother-in-law Christine Yorath (pictured, right, with her husband, former footballer Terry Yorath) The family jetted across the globe, taking luxury holidays to Bermuda, Mexico, Dubai and New Zealand which would have required an ‘astronomic’ salary to support them. They boasted a fleet of cars, including a Bentley used as a ‘company car’, a Range Rover, a BMW and a VW Beetle, . The couple spent £130,000 a year - their total legitimate household income - on private school fees for their four children to attend prestigious St. Benedict’s in Ealing, west London. And they hosted lavish parties at the family’s rented mansion in Harefield, Hillingdon, where a bouncy castle stood in the ‘park-like’ gardens, it was said. A further £62,000 was spent wining and dining at Royal Ascot and helicopters were chartered to ferry the family around, jurors heard. Gerald defrauded GPML, a subsidiary of the Comer Group, out of ‘many millions of pounds’ between 2004 and 2010, the court heard. Brian Comer, who owns the Comer Group with brother Luke, told jurors Gerald was ‘smooth talking’. Gerald quickly recruited ‘dishonest kindred spirit’ Gibrilla Kamara, a security guard at the North London Business Park, to be his bookkeeper and fiddle company accounts to conceal the six-year fraud. Mr Logan (centre in 2000) told the trial he had come to know Mr Porter around the time he played for Wasps . When ‘the wheels came off’ Jacqui immediately cashed in on the family savings and used the money to secure a further year in private school for the children and a year’s rent on the family home, it is said. She was ‘making hay while the sun shined’, jurors heard. Gerald was working at Middlesex University when he met the Comer brothers - Brian and Luke - who employed him as a company director of Greenfield Property Management Limited. The company collected service charges and ground rent from tenants which could be in excess of £1m. But former policeman Gerald and Kamara - who are not before the court - started to divert the cash into their own account giving them ‘direct and unfettered control of the money’. Jacqui Porter, of Ruislip, west London, denies a single count of concealing or converting the proceeds of crime. There is no suggestion that Kenny Logan or his wife Gabby had any idea that Porter was a fraudster. The trial continues.

"British spies failed to track the jihadi killers of soldier Lee Rigby – after MI5 decided they did not pose enough of a danger, an official report into the terror attack is set to reveal. Fusilier Rigby, 25, was run over and then butchered by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale  last year outside Woolwich barracks in south-east London. Both men were known to MI5 – especially Adebolajo, 29, who was arrested in Kenya in 2010 attempting to cross the border into Somalia to fight for the African terror group Al Shabaab. He was passed to British spies. Drummer Lee Rigby was almost decapitated in a brutal attack outside Woolwich barracks last year . In the months leading up the brutal murder in May last year, the killer was also posting extremist material on the internet. Despite their history of extremism MI5 assessed the pair as not posing a sufficient danger to require full monitoring. In a long-awaited report set to be published tomorrow Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee will insist that MI5 cannot be blamed for failing to track the pair. It will claim that the domestic security organisation was unaware of the extremist material they were posting on the interest which could have alerted them to the fanatical intentions of the killers. Internet service providers – who have come under intense pressure to do more to help police and the security services – did not alert them it was there. Tomorrow’s bombshell report will be presented to Parliament by the Prime Minister. Both men were sentenced in February to life imprisonment for the soldier’s murder, with leader Adebolajo told he would never be released. No individual will be criticised in the report into the security services’ handling of the case and that MI5 itself will not be blamed for failing to stop the attack, according to a report by the Guardian today. Michael Adebolajo, left, and Michael Adebowale, right, were jailed for life for the murder of Lee Rigby last year . Adebolajo has claimed spies attempted to turn him into an informant after he was arrested in Kenya in 2010. The report to be released on Tuesday runs to more than 100 pages, but the full report has already gone to the prime minister. The committee used its powers to read MI5 files about Adebolajo and Adebowale as well as to interview MI5 head Andrew Parker. After Drummer Rigby’s murder, several witnesses said Adebolajo had complained of his treatment by the security services, the Guardian has claimed. Adebolajo and Adebowale, both converts to Islam, had been known to the security services for up to eight years before the attack. Adebolajo went to Kenya in 2010, where he was arrested as he attempted to join extremists in Somalia.","Fusilier Rigby was  butchered by  Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale .

"The trial of a man accused of owning a dangerous dog which savaged his former partner's baby girl to death has been postponed because experts have not been able to identify the breed of the animal. Lee Wright, 27, was charged with possessing an illegal fighting dog after 11-month-old Ava-Jayne Corless was attacked by the dog on February 10 this year while she was sleeping at Wright's home in Blackburn. The girl was attacked by the animal while Wright and her mother Chloe King were downstairs. They tried to prise the child out of the animal's jaws but she died of her injuries in hospital. The trial of Lee Wright, accused of owning a dangerous dog which killed an 11-month-old child, has been adjourned because experts cannot identify the breed of the animal which savaged the girl in Blackburn . Police believe the dog, called Snoop, was a pit bull terrier type animal but Wright denied the charge, claiming it was an American Bulldog. Blackburn Magistrates' Court heard that experts struggled to identify the breed and type of the dog due to an 'invasive post-mortem' soon after the incident. Chrissie Hunt, prosecuting, said the post-mortem took place while Wright was being interviewed by police. She said: 'The decision to conduct a post-mortem at that stage may have been premature but in order to continue with the investigation, it was the only way forward. 'But degradation occured during the post-mortem. 'It is not impossible to ID the type of dog from photographs but it is certainly a more difficult case.' Ava-Jane Corless was mauled to death by the dog in February in Blackburn and died of her injuries .

"Miley Cyrus gyrating on-screen, Justin Bieber's childish antics and Russell Brand's incoherent political ramblings have been chosen as the most irritating things of the year. The tiresome stars, whose performances have been endlessly documented, were singled out by 1,000 people asked to list the things that have annoyed them most in 2013. They are joined by figures including Kim Kardashian, Katie Hopkins and Piers Morgan in a list highlighting individual events - such as the birth of Prince George, or Kim and Kanye West's own baby saga - as well as consistently irritating individuals such as Mr Brand. Tiresome: Justin Bieber, left, was the figure most people said had annoyed them in 2013, while Russell Brand, right, annoyed people with his entry into the political arena . Had enough: 35 per cent of people singled out Miley Cyrus as somebody who has annoyed them in the past year . Justin Bieber, whose questionable highlights this year included spitting on fans and abandoning his pet monkey, came top of the poll, with 36 per cent of people saying he annoyed them. Miss Cyrus, whose 'twerking' performance with Robin Thicke at the VMA awards was widely condemned, came a close second, with 35 per cent of people objecting to her, according to the survey commissioned Ask Jeeves. Russell Brand, who this year entered the political arena, calling for revolution and making appearances on Newsnight and Question Time, drew the ire of 28 per cent of those asked. Other people to get on the nerves of the British public over the past 12 months, and probably for some time before then too, include Lady Gaga, Harry Styles and Piers Morgan - all of whom have a very active presence on social media. However, while most of the issues on the lists were to do with celebrities, the single most annoying issue was the ongoing furore over energy prices, which has seen endless political posturing alongside painful price hikes of as much as 10 per cent. Baby fatigue: Large numbers of people were irked by the high-profile pregnancies of Kim Kardashian, left, and the Duchess of Cambridge, right, pictured with babies North West and Prince George respectively . This was followed by the fuss over the twerking phenomenon, with Twitter selfies and the rise of the onesie close behind. But drawn out baby sagas also annoyed Britain, from Simon Cowell’s prospective fatherhood to the royal baby announcement to the birth of North to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. With so much going on that made Brits feel either wound up or fed up, perhaps it is no surprise that 54 per cent said this year would be remembered as ‘average’. Noisy: Celebrities who have a very active presence on social media, such as Piers Morgan, left, and Helen Flanagan, right, featured prominently on the list . A spokesman for Ask Jeeves said: 'There seems to have been plenty that got on our nerves this year from pop stars to politics. 'Perhaps it is because things seem flat after we had the Olympics and Jubilee in previous years that we found so many aspects of 2013 to be really annoying. 'The rise of social media also means that no matter how hard one tries to avoid Justin Bieber or the news of Simon Cowell’s impending fatherhood, it is simply not possible.' 1.  Justin Bieber2.  Miley Cyrus3.  Russell Brand4.  Helen Flanagan5.  Kim Kardashian6.  Lady Gaga7.  Piers Morgan8.  Katie Hopkins9.  Harry Styles10.

"The family home of a 14-year-old Islamic State supporter who threatened to kill Christians as he drove past a school was targeted in Australia’s biggest-ever counter terror raids just two days later. The Sydney boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, drove by the Maronite College of the Holy Family in Harris Park, in the city’s west, on September 16 waving the Islamic State flag. He pleaded guilty in Parramatta Children's Court on Monday to shouting death threats at students and one teacher. Now the Sydney Morning Herald has revealed his home was raided on September 18 as part of a federal investigation to foil an alleged kidnapping and public execution plot. A 14-year-old boy has pleased guilty to intimidating behaviour and offensive conduct after he yelled threats outside a school and church in Sydney's west on September 16 . A random Australian was alleged to be the target of the plot that was designed to shock the community. Over 800 heavily armed officers raided households in Sydney and Brisbane and the 14-year-old’s home was one of those searched for Islamic State propaganda. Nobody in his family was charged during the raid. The following week the boy was charged with intimidating behaviour and offensive conduct after the school drive-by incident. Police arrested the boy at his home. Joseph Wakim, speaking on behalf of the Maronite school at the time, said news of the arrest would give parents and students a peace of mind during the school holidays. 'My daughter was very concerned that an overseas group making front page news every day could be at the front door of her school,' he told Daily Mail Australia. In this image one of the dozens of houses involved in Australia's biggest-ever counter terror raids is searched . Officers outside one of the homes in the September 18 terror raids . 'The fact the teenager was a passenger in a vehicle is a metaphor for a larger issue. A lot of these people are being driven and being steered and they need someone to say wrong way and go back.' Mr Wakim, who is the founder of the Australian Arabic Council, said the school commended police for their presence outside the school in the days following the incident. Witnesses to the September 16 incident reported seeing someone waving the Islamic State flag from the car and yelling out: 'We're going to kill all you Christians.' School principal Sister Margaret Ghosn told Daily Mail Australia the school had taken the threat seriously and had requested security from police. At the time of the incident, she said young people drove past the College twice and made 'silly noises'. Khaled Sharrouf, an Australian suspected terrorist leader in Syria and Iraq, pictured brandishing the Islamic State flag . The parish priest of Our Lady of Lebanon Church,  Mons Shora Maree, issued a statement after the incident. 'On Tuesday afternoon there was a single incident were by a verbal threat was made by a single passing motorist to a MCHF College staff members. 'The incident was reported to police who swiftly attended. 'This is now in the hands of police who are fully investigating. Please do not respond to or circulate any other version of the truth on social media as it creates unnecessary panic.' The 14-year-old will be sentenced later this year.

"Steph McGovern, 32, from Middlesbrough, was sent the money along with a letter from someone who said they were 'sorry' for the way she spoke . A BBC Breakfast presenter was sent £20 by a viewer who described her northern accent as 'a terrible affliction'. Steph McGovern, 32, who is originally from Middlesbrough, was sent the money along with a letter from someone who said they were 'sorry' for the way she spoke. The business editor, who appears regularly on the morning programme, was told she should use the money for 'correction therapy'. She also revealed that she thinks people 'underestimate' her because of her accent. Speaking to the Daily Express, Miss McGovern said that she received mixed reviews from viewers when she first appeared on screen. She explained that while some said they were glad to see a 'normal person' on television, others attacked her for the way she spoke. She said: 'People were coming up to me in the street going, ""I can’t believe they’ve put you on telly!"" – for both good reasons and bad. 'I got one letter that politely said, ""Dear Ms McGovern, I watched you on BBC Breakfast. I’m sorry about your terrible affliction. Here’s £20 towards correction therapy."" The affliction they were talking about was my accent.' She added: 'I think people tend to underestimate you when you have a northern accent, for instance if you have to talk to the CEO of an international company. 'But then when I’m talking to someone in a factory, it’s just like being with my mum’s mates.' The presenter's first job at the BBC was as a part-time researcher on now-defunct technology programme Tomorrow's World, which she did while studying science at University College London. The former champion Irish dancer soon became a financial news producer on the Today programme on Radio 4, and has also worked on BBC One news bulletins, Radio 2 and Radio Five Live. She first presented on BBC Breakfast in August 2012, and is one of the show's main relief presenters, presenting over Christmas 2012. It is not the first time Miss McGovern has spoken out about the criticism she receives for her accent. Last year she admitted that she encountered prejudice from BBC bosses before she landed her on-screen role. Miss McGovern said that she received mixed reviews from viewers when she first appeared on BBC Breakfast. She also admitted that she encountered prejudice from bosses before she landed the role . She told the Radio Times that, despite being a business journalist at the BBC for more than 10 years, there were still some within the Corporation who thought she was 'too common for telly'. She said: ‘I remember at the end of one BBC job interview being told by the manager, “I didn't realise people like you were clever”. Sad, but true.’ The presenter added: ‘You would think that after nearly two years in the job, people would be used to my Teesside tones. 'To be fair most are, but there are still some viewers who can't accept that someone with my accent can have a brain. It means that I regularly get abuse about it.' Teesside girl: She was brought up in Middlesbrough (pictured) and first worked for Tomorrow's World . Wrong accent? Former Today programme presenter Edward Stourton was forced out of his job amid suggestions his accent was 'too posh' In the 1950s, having a 'BBC accent' meant that you spoke RP, or the Queen's English, without a trace of a regional accent. More recently, however, speaking this way could do you out of a job at the corporation. In 2008 BBC Radio 4 Today presenter Edward Stourton was sacked by the BBC amid suggestions he sounded 'too posh'. Embarrassed executives insisted that the hugely experienced presenter, who was educated at Ampleforth and Cambridge, and who presented the flagship news programme for a decade, was leaving to 'pursue other projects' and that modern listeners wanted a 'more light-hearted' style of presenting. However Stourton disputed this, saying: 'I am leaving because they have removed me and there are no other projects.'  He went on to present The World At One and The World This Weekend as well as Sunday, R4's main religious and current affairs news programme. In 2010 the BBC nailed its colours to the mast when Jana Bennett, director of BBC Vision, said the corporation needed to 'increase the amount of network TV content which offers distinctive voices with an authentic sense of place.' She said more work should be done to ensure the BBC's output accurately reflected the UK's nations and regions, but insisted 'accents on their own' were not enough to make people from different parts of the UK feel represented. The following year the BBC Trust said that R4 should 'give greater exposure to presenters from the North'.","Steph McGovern received a note that described her accent as 'an affliction'

"Lawmakers set to meet to discuss introduction of 'Good Samaritan' legislation . The Chinese girl left bleeding in a road after being run over by two different vehicles and then ignored by 18 passersby has finally died. Horrific video footage emerged earlier this week of two-year-old Wang Yue - known as Yue Yue - being knocked down by a van in Foshan, a city in the southern province . of Guandong. As she bleeds on the narrow street . more than a dozen people walk or cycle past her for the next seven . minutes before a second truck runs over her. The toddler was eventually taken to . hospital and survived for more than a week before eventually dying of . brain failure. Both drivers who ran over the girl have been arrested. Scroll down for the video... Warning: Graphic content . Ignored: Yue Yue was left with horrific brain injuries and never recovered . Unaware: Video footage shows the youngster crossing the road at Guangfo Hardware Market, without realising the van is approaching her . The footage of the incident quickly spread via the internet causing shock around the world and triggered a bout of bitter soul searching in China about the nation’s apparent moral decay in the midst of an economic boom. It shows how a woman eventually pulls the girl to the . side of the road before her mother, a migrant worker in the city, rushes . to see what has happened to her daughter. As a result people in China called upon the government to introduce a 'Good Samaritan law' to punish passersby who refuse to help people in need. The case triggered . a furore across the nation, which questioned how such callousness could . occur - with some blaming it a descent into an 'immoral modern society'. China's economic boom and the growing . disparity between the rich and poor have made changing social values a . contentious topic, with some lamenting what they see as materialism . replacing morals. Grief: Yue Yue's mother and father were left devastated by their daughter's death . Support: Yue Yue's parents received donations from across the world to help them pay for her hospital treatment . Loved ones: Yue Yue pictured being held by her mother with her older brother in the foreground . Yue Yue's death quickly became the most talked about topic on China's version of Twitter, Sina's Weibo. Gongzai Xiaoben posted: 'I hope that . this little angel who was discarded by society can act as a wake-up call . to the nation about the importance of moral education.' Winter space added: 'Hope you can find some love in heaven. This world is full of apathy.' Her father had received more than . 270,000 yuan ($42,280) to help pay for Wang's medical treatment after . receiving donations from across the globe. One local Communist party chief urged 'searching reflection' over the incident, according to the official Guangzhou Daily. 'Take active and effective steps to raise the moral standards of the entire society,' he told a meeting of province officials. 'We should look into the ugliness in ourselves with a dagger of conscience and bite the soul-searching bullet.' Many people in China are hesitant to . help people who appear to be in distress for fear that they will be . blamed. High-profile lawsuits have ended with good Samaritans ordered to . pay hefty fines to individuals they sought to help. In Guangdong, where Yue Yue lived her brief life, the local party branch and government are attempting to apply a sticky plaster over Chinese society's gaping wound by discussing a new law to make it illegal for people to ignore strangers in distress. Lawyer Zhu Yongping says that the province could establish a Good Samaritan law as a local law, but it is difficult to define the motives of a person in each individual case. A group of lawyers will discuss the idea next month and push for related legislation. Wang Yang, a top official, told a high-level provincial meeting that the tragedy should be a 'wake-up call' for society and that such incidents should not be allowed to occur again. 'We should look into the ugliness in ourselves with a dagger of conscience and bite the soul-searching bullet,' he said. Despite its current social conditions, the Chinese government can point to some positive achievements, having lifted 400 million out of poverty to create a new middle class living in modern high rises in futuristic cities and peasants finding new lives in the factory boom towns. The vast majority of Chinese are literate and many well educated. Many are poor but none are starving. Injuries: Yue Yue is hit by a second van, which also fails to stop, leaving her lying in the road .

"An orphaned bear with life-threatening third-degree burns on her body has made a remarkable recovery and is now set to return to the wild. Nine-month-old Cinder was found in a driveway in Washington state this summer after getting caught in a blazing wildfire which covered more than 250,000 acres, destroyed 300 homes, killed one person and countless animals. The burned cub was air-lifted to the Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care rehabilitation center to be nursed back to health and now, three months on, her injuries are healed and she has almost tripled in weight. Scroll down for video . On the med: An orphaned bear with life-threatening third-degree burns on her body has made a remarkable recovery and is now set to return to the wild . Lucky escape: Nine-month-old Cinder was found in a in a driveway in Washington state this summer after getting caught in a blazing wildfire which covered more than 250,000 acres . The worst burns were on Cinder's paws as she walked across the burnt landscape of coals and hot ash. The infant later tried to alleviate the pain in her feet by crawling on her elbows. She also sustained agonizing burns to her face and chest. For weeks, vets painstakingly changed the bandages on Cinder's body every other day. Her paw pads had completely burned away leaving the raw pink flesh exposed. In a bid to get her up to a healthy size, the furry animal was fed a nutritious diet of fresh fruit and fish. Gradually she went from around 35lbs to 97.5lbs - her current weight. The care she needs: The 35lb baby bear, nicknamed Cinder, was in agony, with third-degree burns on all four paws and badly scorched sections of her ears, face and body . Bearing up? The cub had limped up a driveway and then took shelter under a horse trailer . Dinner is served: In a bid to get her up to a healthy size, the furry animal was fed a diet of fruit and fish . Steve Love, who lives in Methow Valley, discovered Cinder in August when he heard his dog barking. After venturing outside to see what all of the commotion was about he spotted the helpless bear cub hobbling in his driveway. Fish and Wildlife responded to the call and managed to capture the 35lb female. The little bear tried to escape when the officer used his catch pole but was unable due to her injuries. The cub was then transferred to Wenatchee, Washington, where state biologist Rich Beausoleil became responsible for her welfare. She was aptly named, Cinder. Back to where she belongs: Now that Cinder is healed, vets plan to release her back to her natural habitat . Before and after: Cinder's paw pads had completely burned away leaving raw pink flesh exposed - now the skin has healed over thanks to expert care . Looking for a more permanent home for the brown bear he decide to take her to Lake Tahoe Wildlife Care, a place that helps burned bear cubs rehabilitate. Pilot Bill Inman of Seattle transported the cub in his small, private airplane. Now that she is healed, vets plan to release Cinder back to her natural habitat. She will spend the winter hibernating at a rehab center in Idaho and then come spring, back to the woods of Washington.

"Trust in the Tories to control Britain's borders has halved in the four years since David Cameron promised to cut net migration to under 100,000, dramatic polling data shows. In 2010 almost half of voters (47 per cent) said the Tories had the best policies on immigration and asylum, but the figure has slumped to just 21 per cent. It comes as the Prime Minister finalises a major speech outlining another crackdown on EU migration, in which he will be forced to admit he has broken his promise to keep net migration to the tens of thousands. Scroll down for video . Analysis of polling by YouGov shows how the proportion of people who say the Tories would handle immigration best has tumbled from 47 per cent in May 2010 to just 21 per cent this month . Prime Minister David Cameron is preparing to give a major speech on tackling immigration from the European Union, in which he will be forced to admit he has not met the promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands. Mr Cameron pledged at the last election to cut net migration to the levels last seen in the 1990s. In 2011, he said this would happen by 2015, ‘no ifs, no buts’. But quarterly figures due to be released on Thursday are set to show that net immigration is still above 240,000 a year. The YouGov polling shows just one in five (21 per cent) think the Tories are best placed to deal with immigration and asylum, down from 47 per cent in May 2010. Only 16 per cent backed Labour, down one point, and just five per cent backed the Lib Dems, down nine points. Ex-Cabinet minister Owen Paterson called on the Prime Minister to set a course for Britain to leave the EU altogether . At the same time, suppport for 'other' parties has risen sharply, up 21 points to 27 per cent. The bulk of these voters are likely to be switching to Ukip, which has made major gains in the polls by putting immigration at the heart of its pitch to the electorate. The latest data from YouGov also shows 25 per cent of people most trust Ukip leader Nigel Farage to tackle immigration, ahead of Mr Cameron on 19 per cent. Mr Cameron knows he must persuade voters he has a deliverable plan to deal with immigration in order to lure them back from the Ukip fold. He is understood to be considering banning EU migrants from receiving in-work benefits, such as tax credits. About 250,000 are thought to receive the income top-ups, costing £1.6billion a year. But leading Tory Ken Clarke said this would be ‘totally discriminatory’. ‘You have an Englishman working alongside a Pole doing the same job, they both pay the same taxes . . . and the Englishman gets the tax credit and the Pole doesn’t,’ he said. Eurosceptic Tory MPs stepped up pressure on the PM today, demanding he set a course for Britain to leave the EU altogether. Owen Paterson, the former environment secretary, proposed that Britain invokes Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty – the mechanism for an EU exit, which has never been used before. It would legally compel the EU to negotiate the terms for a British exit within two years. If all 27 other EU countries approved a new deal for Britain, it could be put to voters in a referendum in 2017 – otherwise we would leave, he will say. Downing Street insisted that the missed net migration target remains the 'objective' to which the Prime Minister is working, as he finalises his major speech. However, Home Secretary Theresa May has admitted it is 'unlikely' that the net migration target would be met before the general election in May, and said the government had been 'blown off course' by the Eurozone crisis. The latest data from YouGov shows 25 per cent of people most trust Ukip leader Nigel Farage to tackle immigration, ahead of David Cameron on 19 per cent . Mrs May has until now insisted the Government could meet its pledge to slash migration to below 100,000 by the next election . Two weeks ago, Mrs May called the pledge a ‘comment’ and an ‘aim’ rather than a ‘promise’. And on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show yesterday she went even further. Pointing out that levels of non-EU immigration are now similar to at the end of the 1990s, she said: ‘But it is, of course, unlikely that we are going to reach the tens of thousands by the end of the Parliament. ‘Why is that? It’s because we have seen increasing numbers of people coming from across Europe, partly because our economy is doing better than other economies in Europe.’ She added that free movement was ‘one of those key issues that we are going to negotiate on, adding: ‘This is an issue that we see as centre stage but increasingly is seen by other countries as an issue they need to address.’ Net migration to Britain has returned to levels last seen under the Labour government when a quarter of a million more migrants were moving to Britain than leaving every year . However, today Number 10 insisted the Prime Minister had not abandoned his target and still hoped it could be met. 'It very much remains the objective towards which he is working and the reasons why remain the same,' the Prime Minister's official spokesman said. 'That's why he has not changed his view, it is the right approach.' The government has already taken action to tackle bogus colleges, employing illegal immigrants and introducing exit checks. 'In terms of whether or not more needs to be done, we know that that is the PM's view,' the spokesman added. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the Tory pledge was ‘in tatters’, adding: ‘Continually making and breaking grand promises on immigration is only undermining confidence in the entire system.’ Keith Vaz, the head of the home affairs select committee, said that migration policy was ‘a mess’.","Just 21% think Tories are best on immigration, down from 47% in 2010 .

"Legal action: The Government is making a final attempt to stop letters from Prince Charles (pictured last week) to ministers being released . Publishing dozens of letters in which Prince Charles lobbied ministers would infringe his ‘freedom of expression’, the Government claimed today. The heir to the throne’s correspondence with senior politicians on major issues of the day forms an important part of his training to become King and must remain confidential, lawyers argued. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve ruled that 27 memos sent by the Prince to ministers in seven Whitehall departments putting forward his views about policy could not be released. David Cameron and his Cabinet backed the decision even though they had not seen all of the letters, which date from when Tony Blair was prime minister. But the Court of Appeal overturned the ban, finding that Mr Grieve did not have ‘reasonable grounds’ for blocking the disclosure of the correspondence. The Government today appealed to the UK’s most senior judges at the Supreme Court in London in a final attempt to stop the Prince’s campaigning letters being made available for the public to read. James Eadie QC, for the Attorney General, argued that releasing Charles’ memos to ministers would be a ‘breach of confidence’. ‘Everyone has the right to respect for their correspondence,’ he said in a written submission to the court. ‘Such respect is necessary not only as an aspect of privacy, but also to enable freedom of expression, which would inevitably be inhibited by the removal of the right to communicate privately. ‘All the more so in the case of the Prince of Wales, whose freedom to express himself publicly is constrained by his role as heir to the throne.’ Charles has been accused of meddling in politics through his handwritten ‘black spider memos’ to politicians on topics about which he cares passionately, including GM foods, complementary medicine, farming and architecture. By contrast, when he succeeds his mother and becomes King, he will be bound by the long-standing constitutional convention that British monarchs can only encourage, warn and be consulted by the Government of the day. The unique court case heard todayis the culmination of a nine-year legal battle that began in 2005 when a journalist for the Guardian newspaper applied to get copies of the Prince’s letters to ministers under the Freedom of Information Act. Highest court: Judges at the Supreme Court will hear two days of evidence before deciding where correspondence from Charles should be made public . Letter lover: Prince Charles is said to have sent 1,000 letters a year at peak periods in his life . A defiant Prince Charles has always maintained he has the right  to express his forthright views to ministers even after he becomes King. At peak periods, his passionate words have poured out at the rate of 1,000 letters a year to ministers and other public figures. As the furore over his 'black spider' letters peaked in 2012, the heir to throne was said to be unrepentant about the row furore sparked by the Government’s decision to stop 27 ‘particularly frank’ letters written to ministers in the last Labour government to be revealed. Courtiers told the Mail that it is the prince’s ‘right and absolute duty’ to correspond with politicians over issues that affect his country and future subjects. And sources close to the prince made clear that Charles will continue to air his opinions, even during his private meetings with the Prime Minister after he accedes to the throne. 'The Prince of Wales absolutely sees it as his duty to make his views known to ministers,’ they said. ‘He is a man of passionate belief and will always strive to make his views clear.’ As a self-confessed ‘interfering busybody’, Charles has become renowned for expressing his strong views on a huge variety of issues ranging from youth opportunity to architecture and the environment. His prolific missives are known as ‘black spider memos’ because of his scrawled handwriting. Explaining his willingness to get involved in issues and causes he said himself: 'The trouble is, I always feel that unless I rush about doing things and trying to help furiously, I will not (and the monarchy will not) be seen to be relevant and I will be considered a mere playboy.’ Mr Grieve argued that Charles’ correspondence helped to prepare him for the exercise of his powers as King, the court heard. ‘Through the exchange of views with Ministers, the Prince of Wales would better understand the business of government and strengthen his relations with Ministers,’ Mr Eadie said. ‘Through interaction and correspondence of any nature, the Prince of Wales may be developing relationships with Ministers who at any moment may form his Government when he becomes sovereign.’ Mr Eadie said Parliament gave weight to the ‘public interest in preserving our constitutional monarchy’ when it passed the Freedom of Information Act by allowing for communications with royals to be withheld unless there was a clear public interest in releasing them. Views: An August 2000 letter from Lord Irvine, Tony Blair's mentor and later the Lord Chancellor, heavily annotated by Prince Charles in his 'black spider' handwriting . But lawyers for the Guardian argued that powers allowing a Cabinet Minister or the Attorney General to overturn any tribunal ruling that information should be disclosed under the Act were ‘unique’ in British law. This power has been used only seven times in the past 10 years since the Freedom of Information Act came into force in full in 2005. Dinah Rose QC, for the Guardian, argued in written submissions that the Attorney General was ‘neither independent nor impartial’ because he was a member of the Government seeking to stop the Prince’s letters being released. The case is believed to be the first time that anyone has challenged the Attorney General’s powers to block access to information. The hearing continues tomorrow. The judges will make their ruling at a later date.","Attorney General making final attempt to block release of Charles' letters .
