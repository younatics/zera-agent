"What makes a truly fun theme park? Is it the rides, the size of the budget, the staff in big-eared costumes hugging kids? For Stefan Zwanzger, who's visited no fewer than 264 parks in 92 countries in his guise as ""The Theme Park Guy"" -- a self-funded roving reviewer of gated entertainment centers around the world -- it's when all of the above combine to work their magic. ""A great theme park is one you leave and don't forget about instantly,"" he tells CNN. ""I'm really curious about the whole experience. ""I wonder about the atmosphere that's been created and what the vision for the park is."" The German-born Zwanzger, who grew up in Munich and who has lived in Berlin, Dubai and London, says he judges a theme park not just on the quality of the rides but on whether the attraction's creators achieved the vision and atmosphere they set out to create. ""A good ride is like a good movie, it surprises you,"" he says. ""There should be at least one unexpected twist in the story. There are very few good rides out there in the world -- most are predictable. ""A standalone ride on its own for me has little fun factor, I really like theme parks because they're not fun fairs. ""Fun fairs are a collection of rides. A theme park is a gated experience, and the moment you pass through the gates you should be entering a different world. And if this world surprises or inspires you, then it's fun."" Here are Zwanzger's top 10 ""funnest"" theme parks: . 1. Tokyo DisneySea (Urayasu, Japan) Zwanzger says: ""This park is based around a truly unique concept, with science fiction author Jules Verne at its center. ""Verne lived in the 19th century and wrote futuristic novels, and large parts of this park are modeled after the way he was imagining the future back then -- it recreates a future that's never existed. ""It's impeccably themed with erupting volcanoes, giant drilling machines and Jules Verne-themed rides. There's also a Middle Eastern corner, an Adventure/Indiana Jones corner and a Mediterranean Harbor -- everything in the park is based on stories about the sea. ""I love Disney parks, but DisneySea really stands out because it's markedly character free. It has the Disney budget, talent and vision, but tells a completely different story than Donald and Mickey. ""It's a great collection of rides with the world's best theming and you can really see a huge budget at work.""

Atlantis Paradise Island (Nassau, Bahamas) Zwanzger says: ""This isn't too different from the other Atlantis park in Dubai, but this is the better one. ""It's a casino resort, but you feel that the casino is just 2% of the park and the other 98% is slot machine-free fun, with meticulous theming and incredible attention to detail. ""Atlantis has a wonderful combination of aquariums featuring huge tanks and a vast variety of fish with a beach resort and a very well-themed water park that's completely up to Disney standards.

Disneyland (Anaheim, California) Zwanzger says: ""This simply is the original. Just think about the entrepreneurship and risk-taking involved when Walt Disney set this up. ""He put a German castle at the end of an American high street and it became a role model for theme parks around the world until today. ""In China and other places around the world they're still copying what he did. ""That park opened in 1955 and it changed so much, it basically created this industry, and visiting it and seeing a lot of the original structures still standing is a very special feeling.""

Europa-Park (Rust, Germany) Zwanzger says: ""Europa-Park is unique because it's managed to create an immersive experience without using any major intellectual properties for support. ""They've created various lands based on European countries and the continent's culture, history and architecture. ""It's a unique and great concept that is very successful and doesn't need any film studios or cartoon characters. ""It's really good for people who don't travel that much, they can come to Europa-Park and experience all the different architecture and cuisines found throughout Europe. ""Think world exhibition with rides and highly themed local villages."" Europa-Park, Europa-Park-Strasse 2, Rust, Germany; +49 7822 776688; Read Zwanzger's full review . 5. Tropical Islands (Krausnick, Germany) Zwanzger says: ""This park is housed in a huge hangar originally constructed to build cargo airships. ""The company went bust before the first ship had ever been built, so they were left with the vast hangar some 50 kilometers south of Berlin -- and no one knew what to do with it. ""Then a Malaysian investor came along and used it to create an Asian-themed indoor water park with a beach. ""Water parks with an Asian theme and palm trees and beaches are fairly normal, but when you see this place in the winter time with all the Germans and Czechs and Poles sitting there in a tropical environment staring up at that gigantic ceiling, it feels like a Mars colony.""

Cedar Point (Sandusky, Ohio) Zwanzger says: ""This is a classic, American coaster paradise. It's like being at a coaster trade show, with all the rides assembled.

Sochi Park Adventureland (Sochi, Russia) Zwanzger says: ""I've only been here before the Winter Olympics when the park was still under construction, but I'm really looking forward to going back. ""This is Russia's first ever theme park, and it's an ambitious project with a big budget and quality rides imported from Europe. ""So many theme parks think they need an intellectual property, so they get characters running around, hugging the kids, but I think the creators can be much more bold and try something else, like theming it around the history of a country or region. ""This is what they've tried to do here -- create a window on Russia. I've been to Russia many times and I think it's a super fascinating country. ""For an amusement park-loving person this will certainly be a great place to see before exploring the rest of the country. ""Russia needs more tourists and contrary to all the bad press they always get, Russian people are great hosts and it's a joy to visit there."" Sochi Park Adventureland, Str.

""There's two levels, seaside and mountain, connected with a really stunning funicular train, creating an amusement park spread over a vast area. I've never seen anything as big as this except in Disney World. ""Not everything is the highest quality, but they have some good rides, many of them imported, and it's just so big and spectacular, particularly the view from the top. ""Everyone who visits Hong Kong and loves theme parks should make their way over there, it's about 45 minutes from the Hong Kong-China border by taxi.""

Happy Zone (Yangon, Myanmar) Zwanzger says: ""This is a very low budget theme park and that's what makes it so much fun. When you combine low budget and the passion of the creators, sometimes beautiful things arrive. ""The ghost train here is really scary. As you move forward everything brushes your face, the ghosts are practically falling into your car. ""There's such an overdose of ghosts and puppets, it's one of the funnest things I've ever done. ""If anyone goes to Myanmar, first of all they should meet the people and experience the country, of course, but Happy Zone in Yangon is really worth the side trip.

Buffalo Bill's Resort and Casino (Primm, Nevada) Zwanzger: ""This is another classic. I love the location, because it's really in the middle of nowhere. ""If you drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, right after the Nevada border you see a lone casino and there's a huge coaster sticking out of it. And, heck, that coaster is wild. ""When you pass from California to Nevada, laws differ wildly. You're really crossing an open border and this coaster represents this in many ways. ""You've this ruthless ride standing in the desert that shakes you up before allowing you to continue to Vegas to do all the things you can't do in California.

"Thirteen years and more than 2,000 American casualties after it began, the war in Afghanistan will conclude responsibly, President Barack Obama said on Sunday. In a written statement marking the formal end of U.S. combat there, Obama said the remaining 10,000 or so American troops in Afghanistan would still face danger but that the longest U.S. war ever was now history. ""Our personnel will continue to face risks, but this reflects the enduring commitment of the United States to the Afghan people and to a united, secure and sovereign Afghanistan that is never again used as a source of attacks against our nation,"" Obama said. American troops went to fight in Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and the U.S. spent more than $1 trillion dollars there and lost upwards of 2,200 servicemen and women. Obama vowed to wind the Afghan war down when he took office, eventually announcing this year he would reduce the number of troops stationed there to about 10,000 — a massive reduction from the nearly 150,000 who once served. In a ceremony in Afghanistan's capital of Kabul on Sunday, the commander of the International Security Assistance Force officially marked the end of coalition combat in Afghanistan by rolling up the ISAF flag. The city has suffered an uptick in Taliban violence as the drawdown date approached, though U.S. officials maintain the country is far better off now than when the U.S. began its mission 13 years ago. ""Our courageous military and diplomatic personnel in Afghanistan — along with our NATO allies and coalition partners — have helped the Afghan people reclaim their communities, take the lead for their own security, hold historic elections and complete the first democratic transfer of power in their country's history,"" Obama said. The President has spent much of last year marking the withdrawal of combat troops in Afghanistan, from his announcement in May that U.S. combat troops would leave the country by January 2015, to an appearance at Fort Dix earlier this month acknowledging persistent security challenges there. ""Afghanistan is still a very dangerous place,"" Obama said at the New Jersey base. ""But I want you, and every American who has served in Afghanistan, to be proud of what you've accomplished there."" RELATED: 2 American soldiers, 19 Afghans killed . Currently on vacation with his family in Hawaii, the President used a Christmas address to Marines stationed on Oahu to hail the achievements of the U.S. military in Afghanistan, asserting the U.S. is safer because of the effort there. Afghanistan is ""not going to be a source of terrorist attacks again,"" he said at the Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe Bay. Other U.S. officials — including Vice President Joe Biden and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel — have also marked the end of the U.S. combat mission in Afghanistan. Hagel said Sunday the work of U.S. troops has ""made our world safer and given Afghanistan the opportunity to chart a secure, democratic, and prosperous future."" Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican, visited Kabul on Christmas to meet with Afghanistan's new president.","Obama says Afghanistan better off after 13 years of war .

"(CNN) -- Don Henley, a founding member of ""The Eagles,"" is suing a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, claiming the candidate is misusing two of his popular songs. Don Henley performs at the Stagecoach Country Music Festival on May 2, 2008. The suit filed Friday in federal court in California claims Charles DeVore is using Henley's hit songs ""The Boys of Summer"" and ""All She Wants to Do Is Dance"" without authorization. The suit comes from two campaign videos that DeVore posted on YouTube that used Henley's music, according to the lawsuit. In one of the videos, DeVore's campaign changed the words of ""All She Wants to Do Is Dance"" to lyrics that attacked Sen. Barbara Boxer, the lawsuit alleges. Mike Campbell, who co-wrote ""Boys of Summer,"" is also named as a plaintiff in the lawsuit. ""Don Henley and Mike Campbell brought this action to protect their song, 'The Boys of Summer,' which was taken and used without their permission,"" Henley's spokesman said. ""The infringers have vowed to continue exploiting this and other copyrighted works, as it suits them, to further their own ambitions and agenda. It was necessary to file a lawsuit to stop them."" DeVore, a member of the California State Assembly, is running against Boxer, a Democrat, in the 2010 election, according to his Web site. DeVore mentions Henley's legal actions on the Web site. ""We're responding with a counter-claim, asserting our First Amendment right to political free speech,"" the site said. ""While the legal issues play out, it's time to up the ante on Mr. Henley's liberal goon tactics. By popular request, I have penned the words to our new parody song."" DeVore then posted the lyrics of a song he called ""All She Wants to Do Is Tax."" CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report.","Don Henley files lawsuit against Republican running for Senate seat .

"(CNN)When is a can of beans more than just a can of beans? When it's a weapon of self-defense for students to throw at an armed intruder who has just entered their school. That's one scenario Valley, Alabama, officials are considering as part of their training to respond to school shootings. Though it may strike some as an insignificant and perhaps even silly response to a deadly problem, it's no joke at W.F. Burns Middle School. It's part of active shooter response training offered by the ALICE Training Institute, a company founded by a former police officer and former elementary school principal. School officials have gotten some criticism for sending a letter to parents asking students to bring canned goods to attack would-be intruders. ""We realize at first this may seem odd; however, it is a practice that would catch an intruder off-guard,"" the letter reads, according to CNN affiliate WRBL. ""The canned food item could stun the intruder or even knock him out until the police arrive. The canned food item will give the students a sense of empowerment to protect themselves and will make them feel secure in case an intruder enters the classroom."" Chambers County School Superintendent Kelli Moore Hodge acknowledges that the middle school didn't educate people properly before sending the letter home, but she says the cans are a very small part of the training. ""The major point of the training (which is called ALICE - Alert, lockdown, inform, counter, and evacuate) is to be able to get kids evacuated and not be sitting ducks hiding under desks,"" Hodge wrote in an email. Even if you can't escape and are barricaded behind closed doors to avoid the shooter, there are still steps to take to increase your safety, suggests an Auburn University ALICE video. Auburn is providing the training to the school district. Once the door has been locked and barricaded and students have moved to an area out of sight, students should have a plan if the attacker breaks into the room. That's when canned goods and other classroom items come into play. ""Start gathering several items you can use to protect yourself. Every room has something you can use to distract and defend from the aggressors' attack,"" says the Auburn video's narrator. ""Communicate with others around you and tell them your plan. Don't wait until the aggressor gets into your safe area to have a plan of action."" Students can throw books, book bags, computers and, yes, those canned goods to distract any aggressor.","Alabama students were asked to bring canned goods for school security .

"Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli President Shimon Peres committed themselves to the quest for peace Sunday during a meeting of key figures in the Middle East peace process. But unlike previous attempts to achieve a resolution to the region's turmoil through traditional means, there would be no negotiating nor any political talks at Sunday's summit. This appeal would be made to a higher calling: Abbas and Peres prayed for peace together Sunday at the Vatican home of Pope Francis. The meeting comes two weeks after the Pope invited the two leaders to do so during his visit to the Holy Land. ""In this, the birthplace of the Prince of Peace"" the Pope said in Bethlehem's Manger Square following a May 25 Mass, "" I wish to invite you, President Mahmoud Abbas, together with President Shimon Peres, to join me in heartfelt prayer to God for the gift of peace."" Sunday's meeting was a first for the Vatican, which had never hosted a prayer gathering of two leaders engaged in conflict. However pious the agenda, the day wasn't totally free of political subtext. After prayers read in Arabic, Hebrew and Italian by figures from different religions, each leader offered his own invocation. ""Without peace, we are not complete. We have yet to achieve this mission of humanity,"" Peres said. ""Even when peace seems distant, we must pursue it to bring it closer."" ""We ask you, Lord, for peace in the Holy Land, Palestine and Jerusalem,"" said Abbas, according to a CNN translator. ""Together with its people, we call on you to make Palestine and Jerusalem, in particular, a secure land for all believers, a place of prayer and worship."" The Pope said the meeting is the response to people who want to live as brothers and sisters and not as enemies. ""I hope that this meeting will be a journey toward what joins us, to overcome what divides us,"" Francis said. The groundbreaking meeting -- which was the result of the Pope offering an olive branch two weeks ago -- concluded with the two men exchanging kisses on the cheek before they broke ground themselves for the planting of an olive tree. Only time will tell if today's prayers will go answered. ""The metric that Pope Francis would be using to measure the success of this event is much longer term. I don't think anyone is expecting an immediate result,"" said CNN senior Vatican analyst John L. Allen Jr. ""Now that said, you could also argue that the success of tonight could be measured by the simple fact that it happened.""","Pope Francis says meeting is for people who want to stop living as enemies .

"A State Department contractor jailed in Cuba has reached a financial settlement with the company that sent him to the island, according to court papers filed Thursday. The amount to be paid to Alan Gross and his wife, Judy, by Development Alternatives Inc. was subject to a non-disclosure agreement, the court filing said. Last year, the couple sued the company and the U.S. government for $60 million. The settlement does not include the government. The company hired Gross to fulfill a U.S. Agency for International Development contract to connect private citizens to the Internet in Cuba, a scarce commodity on the island. But Gross was arrested in 2009 after arriving in Cuba. He was later sentenced to 15 years in jail for smuggling in banned satellite communications equipment to the island and trying to destabilize the Cuban government. Gross argued that his work wasn't political and he was trying to connect Cuba's tiny Jewish community to the Internet. In the lawsuit, Gross' attorney's argued that he was not warned by Development Alternatives Inc. that his work could run afoul of Cuban authorities. ""We have been clear from day one that Alan's safe return to his family is our first priority,"" Jim Boomgard, the company's president and chief executive, said in a joint statement with Judy Gross. ""Settling this litigation allows us to work together on that overriding goal."" ""We are very pleased that DAI has committed to help address the injuries sustained by our family,"" Judy Gross said in the statement. ""We want Alan back home, safe and sound."" Last year, Cuban authorities offered to discuss to Gross' case with the United States as well as that of five Cuban agents jailed in the United States on spy charges. But the State Department refused to discuss a possible swap, saying Gross is not a spy and that shaky U.S.-Cuba relations will not improve until he is released.","State Department contractor Alan Gross, wife sued company and U.S. government .

"Brussels, Belgium (CNN) -- NATO members agreed Thursday to take over enforcement of the no-fly zone over Libya, but stopped short of interpreting that mandate as a license to attack government troops who may be threatening unarmed civilians. ""What we have decided today is that NATO will enforce the no-fly zone,"" NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN's Wolf Blitzer from the organization's headquarters in Brussels. Under Thursday's agreement, NATO forces will be able to close air space to all flights except for humanitarian ones and will be able to use force in self-defense. NATO also has sent a directive to its military chain of command asking for a plan on how to execute an expanded role for enforcement of U.N. Resolution 1973, according to NATO sources. Under what some officials were calling ""no-fly plus,"" NATO would be given more robust rules of engagement to ensure that civilians are protected, the sources said. And, in an effort to ease concerns from Turkey -- the organization's sole Muslim country -- coalition forces would be allowed to withdraw from certain missions, such as those involving attacking Libyan soldiers, the sources said. As for the prospect of a more robust mandate, one that the U.S.-led coalition has followed so far, ""That decision has not been made yet,"" Rasmussen said. He added that NATO will have outside help in whatever mission it opts to pursue. ""It's of utmost importance to stress that this is not primarily a NATO operation,"" he said. ""It is a broad international effort in which we will include partners from the region that have pledged to contribute to this protection of civilians in Libya."" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who will travel to London to attend an international meeting on Libya on Tuesday, gave an upbeat assessment of what the coalition has accomplished in five days. ""We have made significant progress,"" she told reporters. ""A massacre in Benghazi was prevented. Gadhafi's air force and air defenses have been rendered largely ineffective, and the coalition is in control of the skies above Libya."" She welcomed the fact that the coalition includes aircraft and pilots from Qatar and Thursday's announcement by the United Arab Emirates that it, too, would send planes to protect Libya's civilians. ""In the days ahead, as NATO assumes command-and-control responsibilities, the welfare of those civilians will be of paramount concern,"" she said. ""This operation has already saved many lives, but the danger is far from over."" Rasmussen said the issue did not represent a split in NATO over the mission. However, he also acknowledged that, if unaltered, the agreement would mean the overall mission would have two parts, with NATO enforcing the no-fly zone and the U.S.-led coalition handling a naval blockade and airstrikes. Thursday's deal was reached after a conference call among Clinton and her counterparts from Britain, France and Turkey, according to diplomatic officials who spoke on condition of not being identified by name. So far, U.S. forces have shouldered the bulk of the mission, according to figures provided by the Pentagon. Of the 175 Tomahawk missiles fired, 168 were from the United States and seven from Great Britain, the only two countries to possess them, while U.S. planes have flown almost two-thirds of the sorties and U.S. ships comprise more than two-thirds of the total involved. The flurry of diplomatic activity came as the battle for control of Libya was continuing to unfold. After a fifth consecutive night of pounding by coalition jets, Libyans gathered at a seaside cemetery in Tripoli on Thursday for the funerals of 33 people Gadhafi's government said were victims of an airstrike. State television said the dead were victims of the ""crusader colonial aggression."" Earlier, a Libyan government official said coalition planes struck the suburb of Tajura and state TV showed images of fires, smoldering vehicles and the charred bodies of the dead. At the cemetery, anger trumped grief and Gadhafi's message was loud and clear: innocent people were wrongly killed and the Libyan people will fight back. CNN could not independently verify the circumstances of the deaths or who the victims were. In Tripoli, CNN reporters go on government-organized tours in an effort to do their own reporting; Libyan authorities forbid independent movement by international journalists in Tripoli. The reports of civilian deaths were given little credence by coalition forces, which launched airstrikes Thursday near Tripoli, Misrata and Ajdabiya in Libya. ""The only civilian casualties we know are for certain are the ones that the Libyan government itself has caused,"" U.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said. At the United Nations, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he has seen no signs of a cease-fire by Libyan government authorities, as called for by U.N. Resolution 1973, which was hurriedly passed last Thursday as Libyan forces were closing in on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi. Ban told council members, ""to the contrary, fierce battles continue in and around the cities of"" Ajdabiya, Misrata and Zinan. He added that his envoy told Libyan authorities that if the government did not comply with the cease-fire resolution, ""the Security Council was prepared to take additional measures."" Ban said he had sent his envoy to an African Union meeting to be held Friday in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, at which representatives of the Gadhafi government and the opposition were expected to attend. ""Their aim: to reach a cease-fire and political solution."" But there was no sign that any such solution was near. The battle for Misrata, Libya's third-largest city, has been ongoing for more than a week. British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Thursday that many residents remain trapped in their homes without electricity and communications and with a dwindling supply of food and water. In the east, Gadhafi's tanks were shelling Ajdabiya, where fighting had occurred the day before. Loyalist forces still controlled the northern and western gates to the city. ""This underlines the appalling danger its inhabitants would be in without coalition action, as do continued threats by Gadhafi forces to 'massacre' residents in areas under bombardment,"" Hague said. The coalition has established a no-fly zone that spans from east to west along Libya's coast. French jets fired air-to-ground missiles on a Libyan combat aircraft Thursday that was in violation of the no-fly mandate, destroying it, the French Defense Ministry said. The plane was struck as it was landing in a Misrata airfield. The civil war was sparked in February by protests demanding an end to Gadhafi's nearly 42-year rule. The Libyan strongman responded with force against civilians, prompting the international community to take action beginning last weekend. Though the rebels' position may have improved since then, a U.S. official said Gadhafi's forces still have the upper hand. They remain capable of carrying out attacks on the opposition, are relatively well-organized and continue to fight effectively, the official said. CNN's Nic Robertson, Arwa Damon, Elise Labott, Paula Newton and Jim Bittermann contributed to this report.","All 28 NATO allies authorized a plan that includes civilian protection .

"Rafael Caro Quintero, wanted in the U.S. for the torture and killing of DEA agent Enrique Camarena, has been ordered released from a Mexican prison because of procedural errors in his case. A federal court in the state of Jalisco overturned Caro Quintero's conviction for the kidnapping and killing the U.S. agent in 1985. The court ruled that the infamous drug lord was incorrectly tried in the federal judicial system, when he should have been tried at the state level. The ruling also dismissed the cases of two other killings that he was accused of. A conviction for drug trafficking was upheld, but he has already completed the prison sentence for that crime, the ruling said. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration issued a statement Friday saying it was ""deeply troubled"" by the apparently impending release of Caro Quintero, who the DEA called the ""mastermind and organizer"" of its agent's death. The agency said it will ""vigorously continue ... efforts to ensure Caro-Quintero faces charges in the United States for the crimes he committed."" The killing of Camarena, nicknamed ""Kiki,"" strained relations between the United States and Mexico. In the eyes of the U.S. justice system, Caro Quintero remains an international fugitive, and his release would sting U.S. authorities. But Mexican judicial authorities said in a statement that Caro Quintero's release is ordered ""as long as there is no other legal reason to impede it."" It was unclear if U.S. efforts to extradite Caro Quintero would be considered legal impediments to his release. Caro Quintero, who was arrested when he was 33, has spent the last 28 years in prison. He was indicted in the Central District of California in 1988 on racketeering charges, which were eventually augmented with charges of kidnapping and murder of a federal agent. A second indictment in the same district charges Caro Quintero with conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine and marijuana. He also was indicted in the District of Arizona on drug trafficking charges.","DEA: ""Deeply troubled"" by pending release, will work ""vigorously"" for U.S. prosecution .

"(CNN) -- One of two suicide bombers responsible for killing two African Union soldiers in Somalia was from Minnesota, the FBI announced Thursday. Fingerprints showed that Farah Mohamed Beledi, 27, from Minneapolis-St. Paul, was one of the attackers, the FBI's Minneapolis field office said in a statement. In recent years, approximately 20 young men have traveled from the Minneapolis area to Somalia to train with al-Shabaab, and a number of them have gone on to fight with the terrorist organization, U.S. officials said. Beledi was one of 14 people indicted in July 2010 on charges of aiding al-Shabaab. Beledi was charged with, among other things, conspiring wth and providing material support to al-Shabaab, and conspiring to kill, kidnap, maim and injure persons abroad, the FBI said. He was believed to have left Minnesota in October 2009 for Somalia, the FBI said. According to the African Union, several ""extremist insurgents"" disguised themselves as Somali government forces in order to attack an African Union checkpoint May 30. Al-Shabaab, a Somali militant group allied with al Qaeda, posted a statement on its website identifying the suicide bomber as Abdullahi Ahmed, a Somali-American from Minneapolis. It was not clear if Ahmed is the second bomber the FBI is trying to identify. Al-Shabaab has been waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia law. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has added to the humanitarian crisis in the nation on the Horn of Africa.

According to Turkey's semi-official Anatolian Agency, Nisanyan received a one year and 45-day jail sentence for ""openly denigrating the religious values held by a certain portion of the population."" Anatolian reported that Nisanyan's initial nine-month jail sentence was extended because ""the crime was committed through the press."" Turkey is a majority Muslim country. Nisanyan said the court cited a passage in his blog published last September that referred to the international uproar triggered by cheaply made Hollywood film called the ""Innocence of Muslims.""  The film, which ridiculed the most revered figure in Islam, the Prophet Mohammed, sparked violent protests in Egypt and Libya.  The Turkish prime minister also denounced the movie as ""Islamophobic,"" though protests on Turkish streets were small and peaceful. On Wednesday, Nisanyan published an English translation of the passage in question from his September 2012 blog post: . ""It is not 'hate crime' to poke fun at some Arab leader who, many hundred years ago, claimed to have established contact with Deity and made political, economic and sexual profit as a result. It is almost a kindergarten-level case of what we call freedom of expression,"" Nisanyan wrote. Since the blog was published last year, Nisanyan said, prosecutors have taken him to court simultaneously for this passage in three separate courts across Turkey. Nisanyan said he represented himself at the criminal court in Istanbul, without the help of an attorney.  He acknowledged that he took a confrontational approach in his statement to the court, arguing that no one should be prosecuted for discussing the historical background of a religious figure. CNN Blog: Erdogan's troubling shift toward repression . ""In consequence of his claim to have established contact with Deity, this Muhammed, who was a lowly merchant, acquired political dominion over all Arabian and gained the financial means to raise 30-thousand-strong armies,"" Nisanyan wrote, citing his statement to the court. ""It is an incontrovertible historical fact that this person made political, economic and sexual profit from his alleged contact with Deity."" In his interview with CNN, Nisanyan recognized that he was deliberately throwing fuel on the fire regarding his conviction. ""I'm hoping to contribute to the ongoing debate in this country on freedom of expression and freedom of religion,"" Nisanyan said.  ""I think I'm performing a useful public service."" This is not the first time people have been convicted of insulting Islam in Turkey. Last month Fazil Say, Turkey's most famous classical pianist, received a 10-month suspended jail sentence for insulting Islamic values in a series of statements disseminated on Twitter. International press freedom organizations have slammed Turkey in previous years for having more journalists in prison than any other country. On April 30, the human rights watchdog Amnesty International denounced a new package of legislation sponsored by the Turkish government. ""Amnesty International believes the reform package will allow abusive prosecutions to continue, forcing still more political activists, journalists and human rights defenders to face jail sentences for carrying out their work,"" Amnesty wrote. According to Anatolian, the judge in Istanbul ruled ""not to postpone the punishment"" for Nisanyan because he has a record of prior convictions. Nisanyan served 11 months in prison a decade ago for committing building violations in the touristic Turkish village of Sirince, where he owned and operated a hotel. Prior to becoming an outspoken political blogger and newspaper columnist, Nisanyan was a prominent travel writer and hotelier who promoted the boutique hotel and bed-and-breakfast industry in Turkey. He said he is currently appealing a dozen convictions with sentences that add up to 20 years in jail. During his previous prison term, Nisanyan wrote and published a dictionary of Turkish etymology, a study of the history of words.","Sevan Nisanyan accuses Turkey's government of politically persecuting him .

"The National Labor Relations Board in Chicago has ruled that football players at Northwestern University are employees and can unionize, the board said Wednesday. In a statement, Northwestern acknowledged the ruling and says it plans to appeal. Read the board's ruling (PDF) The players' petition was a way to get a seat at the bargaining table in college sports and could change the landscape of the NCAA model. Northwestern University fought the petition by saying its players are students, not employees. But the board's decision indicates that there was enough evidence presented that the athletes are employees of the university -- getting paid in the form of scholarships, working between 20 and 50 hours per week and generating millions of dollars for their institutions. The athletes have said they're seeking better medical coverage, concussion testing, four-year scholarships and the possibility of being paid. But while former Northwestern quarterback CJ Bacher said he agrees with the reform issues set forth by the College Athletes Players Association and other groups, he doesn't think unionizing is the way to achieve those goals. ""While we agree with CAPA's stated objectives, the decision made by the NLRB today is disconcerting to those of us that care deeply about the future success & stability of Northwestern athletics,"" Bacher said. Richard Epstein, labor law professor at New York University, said the ruling has ""vast implications for the structure of the sport, if upheld."" But he noted an appeal would likely take years to resolve. The regional NLRB office said any requests for review of its decision must be filed  with the board's headquarters in Washington, D.C. by April 9. The NCAA promptly said that while it wasn't party to the proceeding, it was ""disappointed"" with the board's ruling and disagreed ""with the notion that student-athletes are employees."" ""We frequently hear from student-athletes, across all sports, that they participate to enhance their overall college experience and for the love of their sport, not to be paid,"" said the statement from NCAA chief legal officer Donald Remy. ""While improvements need to be made, we do not need to completely throw away a system that has helped literally millions of students over the past decade alone attend college. ""We want student-athletes -- 99 percent of whom will never make it to the professional leagues -- focused on what matters most -- finding success in the classroom, on the field and in life."" Last week, Northwestern University's president emeritus said that if the football players were successful forming a union, he could see the prestigious private institution giving up Division I football. ""If we got into collective bargaining situations, I would not take for granted that the Northwesterns of the world would continue to play Division I sports,"" Henry Bienen said at the annual conference for the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics. He further said that if the players won their fight, private institutions with high academic standards -- he specifically cited Duke and Stanford -- could abandon the current model in order to preserve academic integrity. He compared it to the pullback of the Ivy League schools decades ago, when the Ivy League conference decided to opt out of postseason play and to end athletic scholarships, preserving the emphasis on academics for the players. ""In the 1950s, the 'Ivies' had some of the highest-ranked football teams in the country. The Princeton teams were ranked in the top 5 or 10 at that time. They continue periodically to have ranked basketball teams, but they've given up a certain kind of model of sports,"" he said, adding that ""under certain conditions"" the same could happen at other private elite universities that ""continue to play big time sports."" Jerry Price, senior associate athletic director at Princeton, said that change for the Ivy League allowed those schools to maintain academic integrity in the sports where, at other schools, academics can often be compromised in the name of the game. ""It was sort of a breaking point moment,"" Price said, saying the Ivy League schools made the decision not to move forward like the bigger conferences -- to ""draw the line with the commercialization of what football was becoming."" ""And the results have been that Ivy football is not what it was in the first half of the 20th century,"" Price said. ""Certainly not like Big Ten football, SEC football. Its crowds are generally less than 10,000 people. They play only 10 games a year. ... Certainly not what is going on at BCS level."" Bienen, who was president of Northwestern from 1995 to 2009, made his comments during a panel discussion that included a presentation from Ramogi Huma, the president of the National College Players Association (NCPA) and the man who helped organize another former Northwestern quarterback, Kain Colter, to lead a unionization attempt. Huma talked, as he has for months, about the issues his organization sees as great flaws in the current NCAA model. The NCPA believes that athletes in the revenue-generating sports of college football and men's basketball are taken advantage of by universities, conferences and the NCAA, making billions from games, while the players sometimes struggle with basic needs like medical care, concussion testing and guaranteed scholarships. Huma told CNN his organization has, for years, tried other strategies but failed. ""Everyone is entitled to opinions, but after a decade of advocacy, I've tried every other way,"" he said. ""We've begged, pleaded, pressured, changed laws. There is no other way to bring forward comprehensive reform, and just like other billion-dollar industries, the answer is a union."" Huma said he won't comment on whether other teams at other schools are now planning to follow in the steps of the Northwestern football players, but he did note that the NLRB judge ruled in CAPA's favor on every point they made. ""This sets a precedent,"" Huma said. ""This ruling is going to apply to all private schools in (Division 1). That's a significant number of schools, a significant domino to fall where hundreds of thousands of players will have rights under labor law and that's the first step in creating an environment where players are protected."" In March, the NCPA took its fight before the NLRB in Chicago and presented a case during a five-day hearing. Both sides recently submitted court briefs. Northwestern's appeal could go as far as the U.S. Supreme Court, and it could take years before there is a definitive decision. During his daylong testimony last week, Colter talked about year-round time requirements, at times 50 hours a week devoted to football. Colter said he had to give up his major related to pre-med studies because he couldn't fit the classes into his schedule. The university countered that by bringing in students who were able to stay in rigorous classes, but Colter's sentiment was echoed by the NCAA itself in a 2012 survey that asked athletes what they would change about their college experience. About 15% of men's football, baseball and basketball players said they would have had different majors had they not been athletes. Twelve percent of Division I football players said athletics prevented them from majoring in what they wanted. The average time spent on athletics in-season hovered around 40 hours per week for all three sports, according to the survey. That flies in the face of the NCAA 20-hour rule, which states that, no matter the sport, coaches can't take up more than 20 hours of their players' time.","NCAA ""disappointed"" in ruling, warns against dismantling student-athlete system .

"Patrick Sawyer had one stop to make before heading home to Minnesota to celebrate his daughters' birthdays: a conference in Lagos, Nigeria. But when he landed in Lagos, Sawyer, 40, collapsed getting off the plane. He had been infected with Ebola in Liberia, where he worked as a top government official in the Liberian Ministry of Finance. Sawyer was isolated at a local Nigerian hospital on July 20. He died five days later. Sawyer's wife Decontee Sawyer, lives in Coon Rapids, Minnesota, with the couple's three young daughters, 5-year-old Eva, 4-year-old Mia, and Bella, who is 1. The Sawyers are naturalized citizens; their daughters were born in the United States. ""He was so proud when he became a U.S. citizen,"" Decontee told CNN. ""He voted for first time in the last U.S. presidential election. He lived in the U.S. for many years, and wanted that for Liberia -- a better democracy."" Sawyer had been caring for his Ebola-stricken sister in Liberia, Decontee said, though at the time he didn't know she had Ebola. Sawyer is the first American to die in what health officials are calling the ""deadliest Ebola outbreak in history."" His death has sparked concerns that the virus could potentially spread to the United States. ""People weren't really taking it [Ebola] seriously until it hit Patrick,"" Decontee said. ""People are ready to take action."" Let's take a step back and look at what we know about the Ebola outbreak: . Where is it happening? Up until this past week, the Ebola outbreak had been contained to three West African countries: Guinea, where it began, Liberia and Sierra Leone. Sawyer is the first known case outside of these three countries. As of July 23, the World Health Organization had confirmed more than 800 Ebola cases in the region, but suspects there have been many unreported infections and there may be more like 1,200 cases. Sierra Leone has been hardest hit with approximately 525 cases. How many people have died? The World Health Organization says as of July 23, there have been 456 confirmed Ebola deaths, and another 216 suspected deaths, bringing the number possibly to more than 670. The country of Guinea has the most suspected deaths. The epidemic has been in that country longer. It is believed the epidemic began in the nation's capital of Conakry. While international leaders have mobilized to fight the epidemic, it can be a difficult one to stop. It is so highly infectious that it typically kills 90% of those who catch it. The death rate in this particular outbreak had dropped to roughly 60% since it has been treated early in many instances. There is, however, no Ebola vaccination. Have other Americans been infected? Last week, two American aid workers in Liberia's capital city, Monrovia, were confirmed to have the disease. Doctors and medical staff are particularly vulnerable to the virus because it spreads through exposure to bodily fluids from the infected. It can also spread through contact with an object contaminated by an infected person's bodily fluids. Dr. Kent Brantly, a 33-year-old Fort Worth, Texas, resident, had been treating Ebola patients in Monrovia when he started to feel sick. Brantly works with Samaritan's Purse, a Christian international relief agency. He has been the medical director for the Ebola Consolidated Case Management Center in Monrovia and has been working to help Ebola patients since October. After testing positive for Ebola, Brantly went into treatment at ELWA Hospital. Samaritan's Purse has been working to evacuate him for better care, said Ken Isaacs, vice president of the agency. Unfortunately, emergency medical evacuation flights in the area are not equipped to handle the ""intense isolation"" required for an Ebola patient. Brantly's family had been with him in Liberia, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but left for the United States before he became symptomatic; as such it is highly unlikely that they caught the virus from him. Out of an abundance of caution they are on a 21-day fever watch, the CDC said. ""We have a strong family unit within a stronger faith community that has given us incredible support,"" the Brantly family said in a statement. ""Kent remains very physically weak, but his spirit has been determined throughout this ordeal."" Nancy Writebol from Charlotte, North Carolina, has also been infected. She is employed by Serving in Mission, or SIM, and had teamed up with the staff from Samaritan's Purse to help fight the Ebola outbreak in Monrovia when she got sick. She, too, is undergoing treatment. It is believed one of the local staff was infected with Ebola and came to work with the virus on Monday and Tuesday, Isaacs told CNN. ""We think it was in the scrub-down area where the disease was passed to both Nancy and Kent,"" he said. That staff member died on Thursday. Both Brantly and Writebol are stable, according to a statement released Tuesday by SIM, though both patients are still exhibiting symptoms of the virus. ""Due to the upsurge in cases of Ebola in the region, SIM and Samaritan's Purse have taken the precautionary step of mandating the evacuation of all nonessential personnel from Liberia,"" the statement said. ""Timing, means, and place of evacuation are being decided now."" Could Ebola spread to the U.S.? The CDC held a media briefing Monday to emphasize that there is ""no significant risk"" of an Ebola outbreak in the United States. There has never been a confirmed case of Ebola spreading to a developed country, said Kamiliny Kalahne, an epidemiologist with Doctors Without Borders. ""This is because people generally transmit the infection when they are very sick, have a high fever and a lot of symptoms -- and in these situations, they don't travel. ""And even if they do get sick once they travel to a developed country, they will be in a good hospital with good infection control, so they are very unlikely to infect others,"" she said. The U.S. health care system is also better suited to handle an Ebola case than many in West Africa, said Dr. Marty Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine. Health officials would likely recognize such a case and be able to trace all points of contact with the patient to prevent further transmission, he said. ""Epidemics of disease are often followed by epidemics of fear and epidemics of stigma,"" Cetron said. ""All of these things occur in a social context that can make containment very challenging."" That said, Sawyer did end up on an airplane at an international airport: What's to say others might not do the same, and actually make it to the United States? Count CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta among those who believe ""it's going to happen at some point."" One big reason is that it takes 2 to 21 days between the time a person is infected and when he or she shows symptoms -- including vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function, and sometimes internal and external bleeding.  Ebola is not contagious until symptoms appear, though that doesn't mean a person cannot travel in the incubation period. ""Just observing the whole process, it's almost impossible to prevent from happening,"" Gupta said. ""But I think ... it can be then stemmed, so it doesn't turn into all these mini-secondary outbreaks."" What should I do? Avoiding these West African countries is the easiest way to prevent the outbreak from spreading, Cetron said. If you have traveled recently to the region and develop a fever, or other symptoms consistent with Ebola, notify your doctor right away. If you're a humanitarian worker in the region, you need to be familiar with proper infection control precautions and avoid contact with blood or any other bodily fluids, he said. You should also report any needle sticks or possible exposures early to receive testing and, if necessary, start treatment as soon as possible. The Sawyer family is working with their church community to start ""Concerned Liberians against Ebola,"" Decontee said. Their goal is to raise $500,000 to help two international organizations: Samaritan's Purse and Global Health Ministry. How can those with the disease be helped? While experimental vaccines exist, there are no licensed ones that get widespread use, according to the World Health Organization. The disease can be devastating and, ultimately, deadly in a few ways. One is because it ""disarms your immune system, (so it) cannot fight the virus,"" Gupta notes. Another is that it causes people to lose fluids, because of vomiting and diarrhea in addition to bleeding, as Ebola inhibits one's ability to clot, adds Gupta. The most important thing a person needs to do to survive is to get treated as early and effectively as possible. But that's not always easy in some parts of Africa, says Monia Sayah, a nurse with the humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders. ""We go into communities where we are not necessarily welcome, because they understand now that the survival rate is not very high,"" Sayah told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Sayah acknowledges that, in addition to immediate family members, health care workers are among those at highest risk of being infected. One need look no farther than Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan, a doctor who was on the front lines fighting the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone before dying this week from complications of the disease. Health care workers don gowns, gloves and masks, among other measures, to guard against the disease. ""Every inch of the body has to be covered,"" Sayah said. ""It's essential.""

"(CNN) -- Danish political cartoonist Kurt Westergaard hid in a ""panic room"" inside his home as a man wielding an ax and knife cracked the glass in the home's front door, Danish police said Saturday. Police said a home alarm alerted them to the scene in Aarhus at 10 p.m. Friday, and they were attacked by the suspect when they responded. Police shot the suspect. Westergaard took his 5-year-old granddaughter into the ""panic room"" when he realized what was happening, Chief Superintendent Ole Madsen said. Westergaard, who has been threatened for drawing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, is ordinarily accompanied by bodyguards when he leaves his home, but nobody was on guard at the house Friday, the Security and Intelligence Service told CNN. Police said Westergaard was ""being taken care of"" after the break-in, but wouldn't reveal his new location. The suspect, meanwhile, appeared in court Saturday, charged with attempted assassination, the Danish Intelligence and Security Service said. The suspect was shot in the right leg and left hand and hospitalized after the incident, police said. Video showed him appearing in court Saturday strapped onto a stretcher. Authorities did not identify the suspect because the judge decided it would be illegal to disclose his name, said  Madsen, with the East Jutland Police. Authorities said he was a 28-year-old Somali who has legal residency in Denmark and lives in Sjaelland, near Copenhagen. The suspect was charged with the attempted assassination of Westergaard and a police officer on duty, the intelligence service said. The judge ordered the suspect held for four weeks while the investigation proceeds. Madsen said the man is the only suspect in the case, and he would not say whether police were investigating anyone else. Police had no indication that an attack was being planned on Westergaard, Madsen said, though the intelligence service said the suspect had been under surveillance because of his terrorist links. Danish intelligence officials said the suspect is connected to al-Shabaab, al Qaeda's ally in east Africa. Al-Shabaab, the militant organization with alleged ties to the suspect, is waging a bloody battle against Somalia's transitional government and is currently on a U.S. government list of terrorist organizations. At a news conference in the Somali capital of Mogadishu, al-Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage said, ""We are very happy with the Somali national who attacked the house of the Danish cartoonist who previously insulted our prophet Mohammed. This is an honor for the Somali people. We are telling that we are glad that anyone who insults Islam should be attacked wherever they are."" The incident ""once again confirms the terrorist threat that is directed against Denmark and against cartoonist Kurt Westergaard, in particular,"" said Jakob Scharf, spokesman for the Danish Security and Intelligence Service. Westergaard's caricature of Muhammad -- showing the prophet wearing a bomb as a turban with a lit fuse -- sparked an uproar among Muslims in early 2006 after newspapers reprinted the images months later as a matter of free speech. The cartoon was first published by the Danish newspaper Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten in September 2005. At the time, Westergaard said he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terrorism. However, many in the Muslim world interpreted the drawing as depicting their prophet as a terrorist. Over the years, Danish authorities have arrested other suspects who allegedly plotted against Westergaard's life. After three such arrests in February 2008, Westergaard issued a statement, saying, ""Of course I fear for my life after the Danish Security and Intelligence Service informed me of the concrete plans of certain people to kill me. However, I have turned fear into anger and indignation. It has made me angry that a perfectly normal everyday activity which I used to do by the thousand was abused to set off such madness."" Scharf said authorities have taken measures to ensure Westergaard's safety, and that the protection has ""proven effective."" CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","Somali man attacked home of political cartoonist, police say .

"Two families scarred by the Bosnian war -- and joined by the memories of a couple who dared to love across the ethnic divide -- have the same message of peace as the nation marks the 20th anniversary of the conflict. In Sarajevo, Zijah and Nermina Ismic live in a plush apartment scattered with photos and a huge painting of their daughter Admira. Half-a-day's drive away in a Serbian village, Radmila Birkic lives in a comfortable home where the centerpiece is a TV stand converted into a photo frame of her smiling son, Bosko Brkic with Admira. Bosko was Serbian, Admira was Muslim. They were childhood sweethearts before the war ripped Bosnia apart. Together, they tried to escape the besieged city of Sarajevo but were shot as they tried to cross the Vrbanja Bridge, and died in each other's arms. As their bodies lay together for eight days -- with no one able to safely retrieve them -- they became known as the ""Romeo and Juliet of Sarajevo."" Today they are in Sarajevo's Lion cemetery still lying together, a symbol that defies the hatred of the ethnically charged war, and their parents have remained close friends. See these amazing photos from the war . Both sets of parents said they blame the politicians, not the soldiers, for their loss, and both recognize ethnic resentment can simmer beneath Bosnian society . But they also said the time has come for those still harboring hate to start living without prejudice. In Djunis, a small village 14 kilometers from Krusevac in Serbia, Radmila, a widow since before the war, lives with her son, Bane. She is recovering from a stroke and walks with a crutch. Despite the passing of 20 years she remembers the deaths as if they were yesterday and photos of Bosko and Admira dominate her home. The photos show the couple as teens learning to love and as adults in each other's arms. They had been together for nine years when they were killed on May 18, 1993, both age 25. In Sarajevo, retired mechanic Zijah and Nermina live with their daughter Amela in a new apartment block -- part of the construction program that has disguised many of the landmarks of the three-year siege. Just like Radmila, the home has photos of their children throughout. When they talk about their loss they are at pains to remember all 11,541 killed during the siege. As Sarajevo rebuilds it is also trying to move on from the war. A plaque was erected on Vrbanja Bridge to commemorate victims of the war but amid the bustle most locals just walk past it. The bullet-pocked walls are being pulled down. They have been replaced by new apartment buildings, American fast food shops and a 20-story tower. Many people in the city now were born after the war and they are keen to look forward. For many that also means not talking about the war. If they learn the lessons from their city's Romeo and Juliet the future could be bright.","Bosnia marks 20th anniversary of the outbreak of the war fought largely on ethnic grounds .

"The suspect in a Georgia toddler's death told police he used the Internet to research child deaths inside vehicles, a search warrant said. The father, Justin Ross Harris, 33, has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and second-degree child cruelty in the death of his 22-month-old son, Cooper Harris. The boy died after he was left seven hours in a sweltering SUV on June 18. ""During an interview with Justin, he stated that he recently researched, through the Internet, child deaths inside vehicles and what temperature it needs to be for that to occur,"" according to a sworn statement in the warrant from a police officer. ""Justin stated that he was fearful that this could happen."" According to search warrants from a Cobb County magistrate court, investigators seized a number of items from the father's home: An iPhone 5, Hyundai car, home laptop computer, computer tower, a ""Google chrome cast Internet searcher"" and other electronic devices. Cobb County Police said the purpose of the search warrants was to find blood, DNA, writings and photographs relating to child abuse, child neglect, homicide to children and cruelty to children. Harris sits in jail without bond, with an appearance before a judge set for next Thursday. Police in Cobb County, part of metro Atlanta, have been tight-lipped and haven't said whether what they found on the computer is one of the reasons they arrested Harris. Father calls in to son's funeral . Though Harris wasn't allowed out of the Cobb County Jail to attend his son's funeral on Saturday in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, he called in and spoke to the entire auditorium on speakerphone. ""Thank you for everything you've done for my boy,"" he said. ""Good life.  (Inaudible)  No words to say. Just horrible. (Inaudible)  I'm just sorry I can't be there."" "" He told everyone he loved them and started crying again. The child's mother had wanted to obtain photos of her son from seized computers for use at the funeral, but Cobb County police turned down her request, said Maddox Kilgore, the attorney for Harris. Police spokesman Michael Bowman told CNN, ""If we have evidence, we will not be releasing that due to chain of custody issues."" Bowman would not confirm what, if any, evidence they had in their possession. A charity fund at Harris' employer, The Home Depot, will pay for the funeral, company spokeswoman Catherine Woodling told CNN. Harris, who worked as a Web designer, has been placed on unpaid administrative leave, she said. The funding of the funeral from the Home Depot charity, the Homer Fund, is a ""standard approach,"" she said. In an obituary for Cooper appearing in the Tuscaloosa News newspaper, the family asks that in lieu of flowers donations should be made to the Homer Fund. Mom of toddler 'absolutely not' angry with husband . 'What have I done?' Initially, police described the death of the toddler as the result of tragic absent-mindedness. They said the dad had apparently forgotten the boy was in the back seat of his Hyundai Tucson; he didn't remember until he was done with his workday, drove a couple of miles and pulled into a shopping center parking lot. But suspicions grew as police investigated. ""The chain of events that occurred in this case does not point toward simple negligence, and evidence will be presented to support this allegation,"" said Cobb County Police Chief John House. A criminal warrant released Wednesday described the events that led to Cooper's death. A timeline of events . On the day Cooper died, Harris stopped for breakfast at a fast-food restaurant and afterward strapped his son into a rear-facing child restraint seat on his SUV's back seat, police said. He drove to his workplace, a Home Depot corporate office, about a half-mile away. He works as a Web designer there. Usually, he would take his son to an on-site day care. But that day, police said, Harris left him in the car seat. During his lunch break, he returned to his car, opening the driver's side door to put something inside, police said. After work, around 4:16 p.m., the 33-year-old father got in his car and drove away. A few miles away, he stopped the car at a shopping center and called for help. When it became clear Cooper was dead, Harris was so inconsolable police had to restrain him. ""What have I done?"" he wailed as he tried to resuscitate the boy. A wave of sympathy . Each year, dozens of children die from heatstroke in cars, according to KidsandCars.org. More than 40 died last year. The organization says its tally is likely incomplete and much lower than the real toll. The charging of Harris triggered a wave of sympathy and a vigorous debate over whether the heartbroken father should be punished. Two change.org petitions urging authorities to release Harris were started and then shut down this week. One petition posted this note:  ""I think that based on the recent developments this petition is no longer relevant. I still pray that this was truly an accident. If that is the case, the DA now knows that the community does not want Justin prosecuted on murder charges."" Another, set up at YouCaring.com, has raised more than $22,000 for the Harris family. ""Please don't listen to the media. It just upsets me to watch it,"" wrote Heather McCullar, who set it up. ""Please don't listen to the media. The family will speak when they can."" Contacted by CNN via e-mail, she wrote back, ""No one is allowed to comment right now."" 'The manner of death is homicide' As Harris sits in jail, his wife, Leanna, would not discuss the case with the media. The Cobb County medical examiner's office found the child's cause of death ""consistent with hyperthermia and the investigative information suggests the manner of death is homicide,"" according to a Cobb County Department of Public Safety statement issued Wednesday. Temperatures hit 92 degrees Fahrenheit on the day of his death. The medical examiner's office is waiting for toxicology test results before making an official ruling as to the cause and manner of the toddler's death.

And it will get out of the way of the approximately 20 states that allow so-called medical marijuana. With a referendum on marijuana scheduled in 2014 in Alaska and action likely in coming years in California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and Oregon, half the states in the union may soon allow the sale of marijuana to almost anybody determined to buy it. To understand where the marijuana debate is going, it's important to appreciate that ""medical marijuana"" is a laughable fiction. In California, the typical user of so-called medical marijuana is a 32-year-old white man with no life-threatening illness but a long record of substance abuse. Under Colorado's now-superseded medical marijuana regime, only 2% of those prescribed marijuana suffered from cancer, and only 1% from HIV/AIDS. Some 94% cited unspecified ""pain"" as the justification for their pot prescription. False patients find unscrupulous doctors: in Oregon, only 10 practitioners write the majority of all marijuana prescriptions in the state. When a TV crew visited a marijuana dispensary in Los Angeles last year, they met for five minutes with a man who turned out to be licensed as an acupuncturist and were then handed a prescription signed by a doctor they never met. Sanjay Gupta: Why I changed my mind on weed . Where marijuana is allowed to be sold, somebody will sell it. As Sabet warns, the marijuana industry of the future is already taking form. In March of this year, Fortune magazine devoted its prestigious cover to the Arcview Group, an investor group seeking to capitalize on the emerging marijuana market. Warren Buffett famously explained the economics of tobacco: ""It costs a penny to make. Sell it for a dollar. Plus, it's addictive!""  Alcohol conforms to the same ugly logic. Half of all the alcohol consumed in the United States is consumed by underage and excessive drinkers. As one industry observer has bitterly remarked: ""Regardless of its public stance, the industry considers underage and excessive drinking to be profit centers that need nurturing, rather than problems that need solving."" Sabet foresees that the emerging marijuana industry will target the same populations as are targeted by the tobacco and alcohol industries -- young people and racial minorities -- and for the same reason: secure and contented people don't tend to be heavy consumers of psychoactive substances. Sabet has laid out a better vision of an effective national drug control policy in his new book, ""Reefer Sanity."" Sabet's message eschews punishment in favor of treatment; it replaces condemnation with compassion. But it understands the difference between compassion and credulity. Nobody ever helped a troubled person by accepting lies at face value. ""Reefer Sanity"" debunks seven myths about marijuana, beginning with the biggest myth of all: that this drug is harmless and nonaddictive. It's a message that is all the more timely in the face of last week's report by the Department of Health and Human Services that regular marijuana use surged over the half-decade from 2007 to 2012. ""Reefer Sanity"" is the best explication I've seen of the errors on which the case for marijuana legalization has been built. It's a book that every concerned parent should read -- and that every advocate of legalization should be challenged to answer.","David Frum: In August, the Obama administration retreated on marijuana policy .

"In her 30-year career as a nurse, Sara Barron had seen only two babies with anencephaly, a tragic birth defect in which infants are born missing parts of their brain and skull. Then in 2012, while working at a hospital in rural Washington state, she saw two cases in two months. To see that many in such a small hospital seemed bizarre to her. Barron mentioned the unusual spike to an obstetrician friend working at another hospital 30 miles away. That doctor had just seen a case of anencephaly, too. That's it, Barron thought to herself. She called the state Department of Health and made a report. Barron's phone call spurred epidemiologists into action. They went through hospital and doctors' records in a three-county area and found 23 cases of anencephaly from January 2010 to January 2013. Such a finding meant a rate of 8.4 cases per 10,000 live births -- four times higher than the national average of 2.1 cases per 10,000 live births. But the next part of the investigation has come under fire with accusations that state epidemiologists haven't looked hard enough for the cause of a birth defect that's always fatal. 'What are you researching?' For months, Andrea Jackman has been expecting a call from the Department of Health. While pregnant, Jackman lived in the Yakima Valley, an agricultural area in south-central Washington. Her daughter, Olivia, was born in September with spina bifida, which, like anencephaly, is a neural tube defect the state is also tracking. Unlike anencephaly, however, spina bifida is usually not fatal. She says she's incredulous and outraged that state researchers haven't called to ask questions: What did she eat while she was pregnant? Did she spend time near farms that sprayed pesticides? Did she take any herbs or supplements? How about Olivia's father? Was he exposed to any toxic chemicals? But no one has called. Mandy Stahre, the state epidemiologist who's investigating the cluster of birth defects, says it might be upsetting for mothers to get a call with such questions. Most of the women were pregnant with babies who had anencephaly, and the outcome is always horrible. If a woman didn't miscarry, she had to make a decision whether to terminate her pregnancy or go ahead and have a baby sure to die soon after birth. Stahre and her colleagues asked themselves: Would a phone call traumatize these women? ""We have to weigh that heavily. This is a devastating diagnosis, and we know that for a lot of these women they had to make some hard choices,"" Stahre says. ""We have to weigh how invasive we want to be with these types of interviews."" Jackman says that attitude is paternalistic and condescending. She says she would do anything to help prevent another family from having a baby with a severe birth defect. State epidemiologists should have made those phone calls a long time ago, she says, since every day that passes, her memory, and those of other mothers, start to fade about what their habits were during pregnancy. ""What are you researching if you haven't physically called the families to find out?"" she asks. 'Very bad research' Stahre has an answer to Jackman's question: The state examined the mothers' medical records, which revealed, among other things, the women's home addresses. By the address, epidemiologists can learn a mother's water source, whether she lives near an agricultural area and whether she took folic acid early in pregnancy, which helps prevent neural tube defects. ""(Medical records) give us a lot of information about all of the known risk factors,"" the epidemiologist  says. The state's rigorous search of the women's medical records, along with birth and death certificates, found nothing linking the families who had babies with birth defects. That finding doesn't surprise Dr. Beate Ritz, who's done several studies on birth defects. Ritz, vice chair of the epidemiology department at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, says medical records are notoriously unreliable: One doctor, for example, might note whether a woman smokes, but another doctor might not. ""From a research point of view, this is very bad research,"" she says. She says medical records reveal whether a woman has been prescribed any drugs, or diagnosed with a certain condition, but they don't contain detailed information about a mother's diet or possible toxins she might have been exposed to in the environment. ""The data quality on medical records is so low that it's not really research,"" she says. Even the state Department of Health admits that medical records are limited, writing in a press release: ""Medical record reviews might not have captured all information, preventing a cause from being identified."" But doing the research the right way, Ritz says, costs hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of dollars, and state health departments often don't have those funds. 'I wish they would take it more seriously' In a few months, Washington state's Department of Health plans to report how many babies were born with neural tube defects in 2013 to see if the cluster has continued, Stahre says, adding that it may interview the mothers at some point in the future. ""We're still investigating this,"" she says. ""This is nowhere near finished."" In the meantime, she says pregnant women in the area should not be nervous. But Barron, the nurse who found the original cases of birth defects, isn't so sure. ""I think it's very scary. I think there's absolutely something going on that needs to be investigated more thoroughly,"" she says. ""I wish they would take it more seriously.""","Birth defects in three counties are four times more than national average .

"(CNN)It's the white whale of the skies and one of aviation's rarest and most loved planes currently in service. The Airbus A300-600ST, popularly known as the ""Beluga"" because of its resemblance to the white Arctic whale, is the European plane manufacturer's super-sized transporter jet. Five of these enormous planes make more than 60 flights each week, carrying parts for all of Airbus' planes from manufacturing sites -- wings in the UK, tails in Spain, for example  -- to the final assembly facilities in either Toulouse, Hamburg or Tianjin. The planes have been in service since 1994, but are in need of reinforcements. Since the plane's inaugural flight, Airbus's production rates have increased five fold, so a new fleet is planned to keep up with demand, especially with the new A350XWB plane now entering service. ""The need for the new Beluga comes with the increase in production rates and to get extra capacity on top of this fleet of five aircrafts,"" says Stephane Gosselin, head of Airbus Transport International. ""So initially there will be a mixed fleet use of both new Beluga and old Beluga. And then the second need was as well to anticipate replacement of an aging fleet."" A crew of three operates the Beluga: two pilots and a loadmaster. Because of its size the plane reacts differently to other large jets in turbulence; moving sideways more than up and down. Read more: The white whale turns 20 . The five Belugas currently in operation are, actually, Airbus A300-600 jets that have been modified to carry large cargo. The top section of the aircraft was cut and an additional, wider fuselage section -- resembling a bubble -- was added to the airframe, giving it its characteristic hump. The cockpit was lowered, making it possible for the cargo hold to be loaded and unloaded through the front of the aircraft. The result is an incredibly spacious cargo hold of 1,400 cubic meters. That's the equivalent to 671 people, 36 cars or seven elephants. ""The perception you have (when the cargo door opens) is of a huge volume like a cathedral,"" says Gosselin. Although the Beluga's maximum payload of 47 tons is surpassed by a handful of other cargo aircraft, its voluminous hold makes it suitable for transporting oversized, but not particularly heavy, cargo, like aircraft parts. Read more: Superjumbo on streets of tiny village . The Beluga can carry the wings of an A340 airliner or a fuselage section for Airbus' newest wide-body aircraft, the A350. But it's not large enough to transport many A380 super jumbo parts. Those need to travel by boat, barge and road. With the A300 now out of service, the new Belugas will be based on the Airbus A330 and be bigger than the existing fleet. While the current planes can only carry one wing for the new A350 at a time, the new jet will be able to take on board both on the same flight. And for plane-spotters who love the unique shape of the existing Beluga, that will remain much the same. ""It will be the same look,"" says Gosselin, ""because we will operate both fleets in parallel for a number of years and it will also be compatible with existing loading means."" The first of the new fleet will enter service in 2020. Watch: First flight of Qatar Airways' A350XWB . Aviation writer Miquel Ros contributed to this report.","Airbus' fleet of five Beluga super transporters has been in service for over 20 years .

"(CNN) -- Baltimore Orioles pitcher Alfredo Simon was freed Thursday by an appeals court in Puerto Plata Province in the Dominican Republic after being held more than two months in jail for involuntary homicide, his lawyer told CNN. The 29-year-old athlete, who paid bail of about $50,000, spent the time in the Fortaleza San Felipe in Puerto Plata, the only jail in the country that has a baseball field, lawyer Carlos Olivares said. Simon still faces the charge, Olivares told CNN in a telephone interview from Santo Domingo. But he is free to travel. ""He can leave to the United States,"" Olivares said, adding that the Baltimore team has kept him on its roster. Simon surrendered himself and his weapon on January 3 to Dominican National Police and was jailed in the northern coastal town of Puerto Plata after being accused in the New Year's Eve shooting death of 25-year-old Michael Esteban Castillo. Olivares said shooting in the air in celebration of the new year is a common practice in the Dominican Republic and that Simon was one of many who did so that night. ""A group of 14, 15 people shot up in the air, including my client,"" he told reporters. ""So, they planted the thesis that it could have been him."" Assistant D.A. Hernandez said in January of Simon, ""So far he's the one. There's no doubt about the incident."" Simon hails from Santiago, about an hour south of Puerto Plata. He joined the Orioles in 2008. Olivares said the ballistics report absolves his client, though it has not been made public. The judge in the case originally ordered his client held for a year, but the appeals court rejected that, Olivares said. ""We know that he had nothing to do with this victim,"" the lawyer said. The Orioles' website said Thursday that ""Simon is unlikely to pitch in 2011 due to off-the-field issues.""","Simon still faces a charge of involuntary homicide in the Dominican Republic .

"Students gathered as the chef sliced tomatoes with a plastic knife in a Brooklyn public school cafeteria. Their eyes followed as she held up a slender green cylinder before the crowd of parents and kids in plastic aprons and hairnets. ""What's that?"" kids shouted. ""It's a scallion. But don't eat it now,"" warned Leigh Armstrong, a culinary student and volunteer chef. ""It doesn't taste like celery."" Armstrong was helping at Cooking Matters, a free, six-week class that teaches parents and kids how to shop for and prepare healthy, inexpensive meals. The program launched 20 years ago through the nonprofit Share our Strength, and it now serves more than 11,000 families across the country. Most participants use or have used food stamps, free or reduced-price school lunches or food pantries to cover their nutritional needs, and almost all are still looking for ways to stretch a few ingredients into meals. The number of families that struggle to get enough food has increased in recent years. The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported that in 2010, 14.5% of households in the United States -- about 17.2 million -- lacked the resources to provide enough food for everybody. Among those, about 6.4 million households saw normal eating patterns disrupted or reduced because there wasn't enough food. Food insecurity -- uncertainty about where the next meal will come from -- is particularly hard on one group: children. The nonprofit Feeding America, a network of more than 200 food banks around the United States, reports one in five children are at risk of hunger. For children in African-American or Latino households, it's closer to one in three. They're likely to have trouble focusing in school. They might experience illness or poor health as a result. They're also likely to struggle with stress at home or in class. While many are eligible for free or reduced-price food at school, those programs don't provide food at night, on weekends or during breaks from school. Hunger is still a more frequent problem for homes headed by single parents and for homes below the federal poverty line, the USDA reports, but it has also crept into homes that have never experienced it before. ""It's invasive and real,"" said Paula Thornton-Greear, a Feeding America spokeswoman. ""It's a time of record need, a time when you're seeing people from all walks of life needing to turn to assistance to meet their food needs."" For adults, the most important step might be talking about it, Thornton-Greear said -- reaching out to friends and family who can help and learning what government and nonprofit food programs are available. ""At some point, we're all in need of something,"" she said. ""It's reflective of a society experiencing a huge downturn. It's not reflective on one individual."" For kids, it might mean getting adults more engaged in teaching nutrition and stopping hunger before it starts. On TV, a new ""Sesame Street"" puppet, Lily, is talking about food insecurity from the perspective of a 7-year-old who doesn't always have enough to eat. In Orange County, California, chef and restaurateur Bruno Serato feeds pasta to about 300 children every night. Serato, one of the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2011, began cooking for kids when his mother visited from Italy and saw a child eating potato chips for dinner. The boy, like dozens of others near his restaurant in Anaheim, lived in a motel, where his family had limited access to food and cooking space. ""'Bruno, you must feed them pasta,'"" he recalled her saying. Serato continued the nightly pasta feast throughout the recession, even as his restaurant struggled. ""They're customers,"" he told CNN earlier this year. ""My favorite customers."" And back in Brooklyn, it means teaching parents to shop and cook with kids in tow. The Cooking Matters curriculum includes taking families to grocery stores and then getting them into kitchens at schools, community centers or even housing units. Today's menu: breakfast burritos with eggs, cheese and homemade salsa. The cost: less than $2 a serving. At Saprina Gressman's first Cooking Matters class this month, the 25-year-old mother of three said her kids first told her about the class. ""I'm hoping to learn a lot,"" she said, as she helped her 4-year-old daughter, Kiara, cut a tomato to make salsa. ""I'm hoping to learn to cook with my children, because you need patience."" While parents will usually be the ones to budget, buy and cook food, getting kids excited about preparing and eating homemade meals can keep everyone engaged in healthier choices and smart shopping. Aliyah Rowe, the Cooking Matters program coordinator for City Harvest in New York, said some members of the class rely on food stamps, but it's designed for anyone with food insecurity -- people who recently lost jobs and have to rethink their food budgets, or families that occasionally seek assistance from food banks. It also gets parents and kids spending time together and talking about the food the fuels them. ""I remember baking with my grandmother, but that doesn't happen anymore,"" Rowe said.  ""The reality is parents are busy; you have some that work two jobs. But the kids come here and they are so excited, and they go home excited. And that inspires parents to cook with their children.""","Millions of American households don't have enough food for everyone .
The problem is spreading to families who have never experienced it before .
Food insecurity can be especially tough on children, experts say ."
"Tuesday marks the 40th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. In a 7-2 ruling on January 22, 1973, the justices declared laws prohibiting abortion violated a woman's constitutional right to privacy. They also said states could regulate abortion procedures in the interest of a woman's health or in protecting a potential human life starting at the end of the pregnancy's first trimester. Abortion was legal under common law in the United States leading up to the 19th century, says Leslie Reagan, professor of history and law at the University of Illinois and author of ""When Abortion was a Crime."" Early laws only prohibited the use of toxic substances to cause miscarriages after ""quickening,"" or when a woman feels her child move -- usually four or five months into the pregnancy. ""That was the moral point where people understood there was a life,"" Reagan says. Since then, the definition of life has been debated many times over, but Roe v. Wade remains the law of the land. Opinion: Millennials have the power to protect Roe v. Wade . Learn more about the events leading up to this historic decision, and what's happened in the four decades since the ruling: . 1821: Connecticut passes the first law in the United States to restrict abortion. It prohibits the use of a toxic substance to cause a miscarriage after ""quickening."" A number of other states follow. 1873: Anthony Comstock, head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, lobbies to pass the Comstock Law, a federal law banning the selling or distributing of materials related to contraception and abortion. 1930s: The number of abortions increases significantly during the Great Depression. ""The Depression years make vivid the relationship between economics and reproduction,"" Reagan writes. ""Married women with children found it impossible to bear the expense of another, and unmarried women could not afford to marry."" The dangerous practice of unregulated abortions led to a high U.S. maternal mortality rate, Reagan says. In her book, she cites a study done in 1931 showing illegal procedures are responsible for 14% of maternal deaths. 1950s: Hospitals start to form ""therapeutic abortion boards"" to decide whether doctors can perform an abortion on a case-by-case basis, according to Reagan. Therapeutic abortions are allowed by law if the mother's life is in danger. Hospital restrictions generated resentment among physicians who felt ""shackled"" by the law, Reagan writes. 1955: Planned Parenthood organizes a conference, ""Abortion in the United States,"" that includes testimony from sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, abortionist G. Lotrell Timanus and Planned Parenthod's then-medical director Mary Calderone. A record of the conference is published in 1958, launching a national discussion on reformed abortion laws. 1960s: Pat Maginnis founds the Society for Humane Abortion, later becoming one of the first people to publicly campaign for legalizing abortion. ""They thought she was insane,"" Reagan says of Maginnis' fellow pro-choice advocates. ""They're trying to start talking about reform... and having her out there was hurting them."" 1962: Sherri Finkbine, an Arizona mother of four, travels to Sweden after a local hospital denies her request for a legal abortion. Finkbine had taken the drug thalidomide, which researchers linked to birth defects. The hospital was initially going to perform the procedure but withdrew its offer after Finkbine told her story to the local newspaper in hopes of alerting mothers to the dangers of the drug. The resulting publicity threw her into the middle of a worldwide debate. 1969: A group of young women in Chicago starts ""Jane,"" an underground system that helps women find safe and affordable illegal abortions. Eventually they learn to perform the procedures themselves, completing nearly 12,000 abortions from 1969 to 1973, according to a documentary about the group. Two significant court cases -- People v. Belous and Doe v. Scott, which reached the Supreme Court in 1971 -- declare abortion laws unconstitutional. ""That prompted people all over the place to start putting together cases... challenging state abortion laws,"" Reagan says. 1970: By the early 1970s, 20 states have passed abortion reform or repeal laws. Hawaii, Alaska, New York and Washington state have legalized abortion. 1972: The Supreme Court legalizes the use of birth control pills for all women, regardless of marital status. Before the decision, only married women were able to receive the pill through a doctor's prescription. 1973: The Supreme Court settles Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, declaring abortion a right-to-privacy issue and hospital therapeutic abortion boards unconstitutional. ""Though often overlooked since, (Bolton) was as important as Roe,"" Reagan writes. ""The Court held in Doe v. Bolton that policies designed to restrict access to abortion ... violated the rights of women to health care and of physicians to practice."" 1976: In Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, the Supreme Court declares a statute that requires parental and spousal consent for abortions unconstitutional. Congress enacts the Hyde Amendment for the first time, banning the use of federal funds for abortion except in cases of rape, incest or endangerment of the mother's life. This amendment has been attached to the congressional appropriations bill and approved by Congress every year since then. 1983: In Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, the Supreme Court declares unconstitutional an Ohio law that requires all abortions after the first trimester be performed at a hospital, a 24-hour waiting period and parental consent for girls younger than 15. 1989: The Supreme Court deals a blow to anti-abortion forces in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services by striking down a law that requires doctors to test the viability of the fetus before an performing any abortion. Three justices said they would allow restrictions on abortion but only if the restrictions had a rational basis. 1992: Supporters on either side of the abortion issue are left confused after the Supreme Court rules on Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania. v. Casey. The court says abortion regulations that present an ""undue burden"" on women's constitutional right will be prohibited; critics say ""undue burden"" is too vague. 1994: President Bill Clinton signs the Abortion-Clinic Protection Bill into law, which is designed to protect abortion clinics from attacks, blockades and acts of intimidation by pro-life protesters. 2000: The Food and Drug Administration approves the abortion pill RU-486. The drug enables a woman to terminate a pregnancy within seven weeks from her last menstrual period, without the need for a surgical abortion. 2003: President George W. Bush signs the ""partial-birth abortion"" bill, outlawing the procedure known as intact dilation and extraction (D&X). Federal judges quickly issue injunctions that temporarily nullify the law's effect for many abortion providers. 2004: About 800,000 demonstrators gather in Washington for the ""March for Women's Lives,"" a protest against Bush's reproductive rights policies. This is the largest abortion-rights demonstration since a 1992 rally that drew at least 500,000 participants. 2007: The Supreme Court upholds the partial-birth abortion law 5-4 in the first federal restriction on a particular abortion method since Roe v. Wade. In a bitter dissent read from the bench, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg says the majority's opinion ""cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away a right declared again and again by this court."" 2009: President Barack Obama ends a ban on the use of U.S. foreign aid funds by international family planning programs that provided abortions or advice on obtaining one. The ban had first been instituted in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan. George Tiller, a physician who performed late-term abortions, is shot and killed in Wichita, Kansas. Tiller, who had been subject to antiabortion protests and harassment for more than 20 years, was the first abortion provider killed since 1998. 2011: Voters in Mississippi reject the ""personhood"" amendment, which would have outlawed all forms of abortion, including for cases of rape, incest and life-threatening pregnancies. Research from the Alan Guttmacher Institute finds the number of abortions is at its lowest level since Roe v. Wade, remaining steady at about 1.2 million reported procedures in 2011, down 25% since the all-time high in 1990. 2012: Susan G. Komen for the Cure announces it will cut off funding to affiliates of Planned Parenthood. The organization reverses the decision three days later amid a public outcry. The Supreme Court upholds President Obama's Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. Starting in 2014, the level of abortion coverage each woman will receive will depend on their state's policy, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The ACA prohibits states from including abortion in any essential benefits package and no plan in an insurance exchange is required to offer abortion coverage. In addition, states can bar all plans participating in the exchanges from covering abortions.

"The trial of James Holmes, accused in the mass shooting at an  Aurora, Colorado, movie theater, has been delayed again. The trial was scheduled to begin in October, but a psychiatrist conducting a second sanity examination on Holmes asked for more time to complete the examination, according to a judge's order from Arapahoe County District Court made public Wednesday. Judge Carlos Samour said he had ""little choice but to grant the examiner's request"" despite the fact many victims would be opposed to the delay. The examination was originally set to be completed by August 15, but the deadline was extended until October 15, according to the order.  A new trial date is set to be scheduled at a July 22 hearing. Holmes is accused of opening fire inside a packed movie theater during a midnight showing of Batman film ""The Dark Knight Rises"" in July 2012, killing 12 people. He has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to the 166 charges he faces in connection with the rampage. The attacker threw tear gas canisters into the theater then started shooting, according to witnesses. Police said he used several weapons, including an AR-15 rifle, before fleeing the theater. Holmes was taken into custody outside the theater, where authorities said he identified himself to police as ""The Joker,"" one of Batman's archenemies. This is the third time the trial has been delayed.  It was originally set to begin in August 2013 but was pushed back to February.  That date was then delayed until October, which has now been postponed.

"The Libyan government on Sunday declared a three-day national mourning period after the country's first suicide bombing since the fall of the Gadhafi regime more than two years ago. At least 13 people were killed in the attack on a checkpoint leading to the eastern gates of Libya's second city, Benghazi, early Sunday, the government said. Most of those killed were soldiers and members of the security forces, the government said. At least two others were still missing in the aftermath of what has been described as a powerful blast. A security official told the state news agency LANA that a suicide bomber rammed his vehicle into the Barsis checkpoint -- about 50  kilometers (30 miles) east of Benghazi -- killing and wounding security forces and civilians who were in the area. The security situation in Benghazi has been worsening over recent months with a noticeable uptick in bombings and assassinations that have mostly targeted members of the security forces. While no one has claimed responsibility for these attacks, many residents blame the violence on Islamist militants in the eastern region, and some of these groups have ties to al Qaeda. People in Benghazi and the eastern city of Derna, angered by the increasing bloodshed, have recently taken to the streets protesting against extremist groups. One group many have accused of being responsible for attacks on the security forces is Ansar al-Sharia, the same group the United States believes attacked its consulate in Benghazi last year, killing U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Ansar al-Sharia has denied involvement in the attack on the consulate and other acts of violence targeting security forces. Last month fierce fighting erupted in Benghazi between soldiers from the army's special forces, who have been trying to secure the city, and members of  Ansar al-Sharia. At least nine people were killed in the rare confrontation between security forces and militants. The weak central government has been struggling to secure the country, especially the city of Benghazi where militants have attacked diplomatic missions forcing western countries to shut down their consulates. The United States, the United Kingdom and other countries advise their nationals against traveling to Benghazi. Earlier this month, an American teacher in the city was shot dead while jogging. No one has claimed responsibility for his killing. As locals and security forces began confronting militants, analysts monitoring the violence trends in Benghazi have been concerned about an escalation in violence and shift in tactics used by these groups. ""This cowardly act is an attempt to obstruct the strenuous efforts made by members of the national army, with the Thunderbolt (special) forces at the forefront, to establish security and preserve the life of citizens in Benghazi,"" the government said in its statement.

The ""American Idol"" host, radio personality and seemingly ubiquitous showbiz presence has co-founded a tech startup that seeks to make it easier for people to type on their iPhones. Seacrest also is helping bankroll the company, Typo Keyboards, which makes an iPhone case that includes a BlackBerry style keyboard. The Bluetooth-enabled accessory, for the iPhone 5 and 5S, was apparently the result of a dinner shared by Seacrest and co-founder Laurence Hallier, a real estate developer and serial entrepreneur who, like his partner, doesn't like typing on a touchscreen. ""One night, we were out to dinner and both had our phones on the table. Two people, four phones!"" reads a blurb on the Typo website. We looked at each other and thought there was an easy solution to the problem."" They said they both looked for iPhone keyboards and, when they weren't happy with what they found, decided to make their own. The case, which sells for $99, is available for pre-order and is scheduled to ship next month. But ... Seacrest? Really? It's his first venture into the tech startups, to be sure. He joins the likes of Justin Timberlake, Ashton Kutcher and MC Hammer (yes, MC Hammer) as an entertainer dipping a toe into the tech world. Reaction online was predictably snarky. ""Surely this must be a typo...,"" one Twitter user wrote. (We see what you did there.) Not everyone was down on the idea, though. ""Best news ever. ... The iBerry is coming.

"(CNN) -- When researchers present what the media perceive as ""big"" findings -- as my colleagues and I did last week in reporting a plume of oil from the Deepwater Horizon oil well in the Gulf of Mexico -- it is incumbent on scientists and journalists to keep the results in perspective and refrain from veering into misleading waters. Unfortunately, in this case, both parties failed. Reporters and editors, in their quest for the biggest story possible, injected their reports with implications unintended by scientists. For their part, scientists from various corners of government and academia -- including our group at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) -- let it happen. In some cases, they may have even encouraged it. Instead of being able to consider our results on the basis of the information alone (''just the facts, ma'am''), readers, viewers and listeners around the world were exposed to newspaper, TV and radio reports clouded with politically charged agendas that were premature at the least and outright wrong at the most. I must have spoken with at least 25 journalists last week, and despite my every effort to explain our findings, the media were more interested in using the new information to portray a duel between competing scientists. The story turned into an us-versus-them scenario in which some scientists are right and others are wrong. Seeking to elucidate, I felt caught in a crossfire. On August 4, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a report giving its best initial estimates accounting for where the oil spilled in the Gulf went. Two weeks later, scientists at the University of Georgia and the Georgia Sea Grant countered with their own inventory, arguing NOAA underestimated the amount of oil remaining in the ocean. Our research confirmed the existence of a subsurface oil plume in June that did not come from a natural sea floor oil seep and that was not substantially degraded by deep-sea microbes. The research added new information to an unfolding investigation, but the media seemed more interested in whether our work decided whether NOAA or the Georgia group was right. Even though my colleagues and I repeatedly avoided contrasting our results with previous NOAA estimates that some 75 percent of the spilled oil was already gone from the Gulf, much of last week's coverage of our work made that a prominent part of the story. For example, The Washington Post reported, ""Academic scientists are challenging the Obama administration's assertion that most of BP's oil in the Gulf of Mexico is either gone or rapidly disappearing -- with one group Thursday announcing the discovery of a 22-mile 'plume' of oil that shows little sign of vanishing."" In doing so, it cast our results as evidence of sorts that the NOAA estimates were wrong, and at the same time had the effect of giving the Georgia work our imprimatur. Neither of these conclusions was ever meant to be drawn from our research on the oil plume. This reasoning implicit in the media coverage was not only premature, but it might turn out to be wrong. Science does not work that way. It is incremental. It is not a house of cards where one dissenting view leads to a complete collapse. Rather, science is more like a jigsaw puzzle. Each piece is added. Occasionally a wrong piece may be placed, but eventually science will correct it. Both the corrections and the completion of any scientific puzzle take time. Scientific peers regulate the process of presenting hypotheses, acquiring data and assessing them. In this process, questions are asked, gaps get filled, inconsistencies are hammered out, discoveries are made, problems get solved and knowledge is obtained. Science's regulatory systems have a very solid record of accomplishment. Unfortunately, the process takes months or years, but in this case, it has been compressed into days with dueling reports and news conferences on the fantails of boats. News organizations haven't the luxury of time to distill scientific findings and put them into context, which increases the risk of oversimplifying scientific findings. Some of these problems are scientists' fault. In our world in the peer-review process, we liberally, passionately, sometimes harshly interrogate each other, where we argue over details and interpretations of research results to ensure that they are bulletproof. Out of the academic world, reporters can magnify negative comments by scientists about research results. As the number of science journalists gets smaller, this problem will grow. One solution is for scientists to gain skills needed to bridge the communication gaps between the academic world and the lay public, media and policymakers. In addition, scientists need to learn how to say ""no"" to reporters. For many of us, we desperately want to please a reporter, who for the first time cares about what you do. And scientists, including me, have egos, so we want our thoughts and work recognized. But scientists have a better chance of getting the story straight if they listen carefully to the questions asked by reporters and understand the reporters' goals. In 1994, 11 scientists published a study, ""The fate of the oil spilled from the Exxon Valdez: The mass balance is the most complete and accurate of any major oil spill."" Of these 11 authors, six were NOAA scientists, one was from academia and four from four different consulting firms. The Exxon Valdez oil spill happened in 1989. Science takes time. If it took five years to ""balance the books"" on how much oil was spilled and where it went for the Exxon Valdez spill, how are we getting estimates of the Deepwater Horizon spill only weeks afterward? It's not trivial to decipher something as vast, fluid, complex and inaccessible as the ocean. So given that it is so early in this investigation of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, I would consider both the NOAA and Georgia studies as first passes. Neither is absolutely right or wrong. They are certainly not the definitive findings, but should be thought of as a foundation from which to work, road maps to use in assigning future research assets in examining the transport and fate of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. Those road maps will be refined into robust values as more information becomes available. Eventually, teams of scientists will be able to ""balance the books"" for the Deepwater Horizon spill, too. Over the next few months, many scientific studies on the spill will be published and reported on. Journalism, the first draft of history, is incremental, too. Consider each scientific report like a chapter in an epic novel, and not necessarily in order. Let the dust settle and read the book in a few years. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher Reddy.","Christopher Reddy's team confirmed subsurface oil plume in Gulf in June .

"A Bulgarian woman claims she is the mother of the blond, blue-eyed girl taken by police from a Roma couple in Greece last week. The mystery of ""Maria,"" who is believed to be 5 to 6 years old, prompted an international search for the girl's biological family and answers to how she ended up in a Roma community in central Greece. The woman told Bulgarian investigators that she left the girl in Greece with a family she worked for in 2009, Bulgarian Interior Ministry General Secretary Svetlozar Lazarov said Thursday. ""We gave her, we gifted her, without money,"" Sashka Ruseva told Bulgaria's TV7 Thursday. ""I didn't take any money. I didn't have any food to give to the kid. I saw it yesterday and I've been sick. I haven't eaten since last night."" Maria's photograph has been broadcast worldwide. Her 15-year-old son also spoke to reporters outside of the police station where they were questioned. Isak Ruseva  said his mother ""became sad and started crying"" when she saw the child in television Wednesday. ""They didn't sell the girl,"" he said. ""They didn't have money to come back and that's why they left her."" CNN visits Roma community where 'Maria' was found . DNA testing set for Friday . A DNA sample will be taken from Ruseva on Friday for comparison with the child in Greece, Lazarov told CNN.   Greek officials did not respond when CNN asked if they were providing the child's DNA results to Bulgarian authorities. Greek authorities charged the Roma couple who had Maria until last week -- Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, and Christos Salis, 39 -- Roma couple with abducting the child. They appeared in court Monday and were both remanded into custody pending trial. Authorities initially asked questions about Maria because she has fair skin and blond hair, while the couple who said they were her parents have darker complexions typical of Roma, a people descended from Indian nomads and who face widespread discrimination in Europe. Medical tests showed she wasn't their daughter, authorities have said. The girl's DNA didn't match any profile in Interpol's database, the international law enforcement agency said Tuesday. Their lawyers say the couple took the child into their home after her biological mother, who they say was from Bulgaria, was unable to look after her. Residents of the Roma community backed that assertion in interviews with CNN. ""Maria used to play here with the other children and go to the store with her mum. Maria was not hidden away,"" Maria Kaleas said. ""The mother gave her away and Eleftheria was enchanted by Maria's beauty. She shared the food for her own children with Maria."" Interpol said Greek authorities have asked for its help in finding out Maria's identity. ""Until now, a comparison of the girl's profile against Interpol's global DNA database has not produced a match,"" Interpol said in a news release. The agency has more than 600 missing people listed on its website, 32 of whom are 5 or 6 years old. A spokesman for a Greek children's charity said that about 10 cases of missing children around the world are ""being taken very seriously"" in connection with Maria's case. ""They include children from the United States, Canada, Poland and France,"" said Panagiotis Pardalis of the Smile of the Child charity. The Smile of the Child said the girl, who was found a week ago, is being cared for in a group home. Greece mystery girl: Interpol says no DNA match in its database . Blond child returned to Roma family in Ireland . As Maria's story became global news, another mystery emerged in Dublin, Ireland when authorities took a blond, blue-eyed girl from a Roma couple there. Police, acting on a tip, removed the 7-year-old girl from a home on Monday and placed her in protective care. But the child was returned to the couple after DNA test confirmed she is their daughter, a source familiar with the case's legal proceedings told CNN on Wednesday. The parents, who live in the suburb of Tallaght, told CNN they have a passport for the girl, but they do not call her by the name on the passport. Their attorney said the couple is going to take some time before considering their legal options, the British Press Association reported. ""Her parents greatly appreciate the help and assistance that they have been given by friends and relatives over the last few days,"" Waheed Mudah told the PA. ""They now intend to concentrate on looking after their family and, in particular, in trying to reassure their daughter that she will be in their care."" Prejudice against the Roma . Prejudice and discrimination against the Roma are widespread in Greece and elsewhere in Europe, Amnesty International says. Maria's case plays into old prejudices about them stealing children for forced labor. Pardalis, with the charity now caring for her, mentioned such a possibility, saying, ""We don't have any other information if this girl was forced to work or to beg on streets."" The Greek government news agency also raised ""the possibility of the existence of a ring bringing pregnant women to Greece from Bulgaria and then taking their children for sale."" The agency cited past reports that empty coffins had been found for infants who supposedly were stillborn to foreign mothers in Athens.

"Shouts of ""Hands up, don't shoot!"" and ""No justice, no peace. Stop the racist police,"" fill the chilly November air as the crowd jostles for position in a fenced-off pen on the sidewalk. Hundreds have gathered to voice their anger and frustration at events in Ferguson, Missouri, and to offer their support for the family of Michael Brown, the unarmed black teenager shot dead by a white police officer in August. Many of those taking part in the protest also demonstrated here during the summer; months later, following the decision of a Grand Jury not to indict Darren Wilson for killing Brown, they have returned. Some wave placards reading ""Justice for Michael Brown,"" ""Solidarity with Ferguson"" and ""Black Lives Matter,"" while others cup candles in their hands, protecting them from the autumn drizzle as their chants of ""killer police off our streets"" echo around the square. But this isn't St Louis or New York or Chicago. It is London, England -- more than 4,000 miles from Ferguson and a sign of how fury at the controversial case has resonated across the Atlantic. The protesters have gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Grosvenor Square, an imposing fortress-like structure amid the 18th-century terraces of one of London's most exclusive addresses. Carole Duggan is among those to address the crowd, which organizers say numbered up to 1,500 people. Her nephew Mark, 29, was shot by police in north London in 2011. His death sparked protests that led to days of rioting across London and other English cities. His family say he was unarmed, a victim both of the police and of a smear campaign by the media which portrayed him as a ""gangster."" An inquest into his death found that he was lawfully killed, and that it was more likely than not that he had thrown a gun away shortly before police fired at him. Duggan's aunt said the people of Ferguson had been ""pushed to the edge"" and felt they had no other choice but to take to the streets. She insisted they were ""very, very brave"" to do so despite the threat posed by ""trigger happy"" U.S. police. Offering her condolences to the Brown family, she told the crowd: ""We feel the pain, we know the pain of losing somebody at the hands of the police. We stand in solidarity with the people of Ferguson."" It was this feeling of solidarity which had brought most people -- black, white, young and old -- onto the streets of Mayfair. Duggan warned the crowd: ""What happens there will eventually happen here: If they can murder Michael the way they did, they can murder anyone's mother, father, brother, sister, daughter or son."" Marcia Rigg sees painful parallels between the case of Brown and that of her brother Sean. The 40-year old died in police custody in London in 2008. An inquest ruled police officers used an unsuitable degree of force to restrain him. She says ""institutional racism"" is a global problem. ""We need change"" she insists. ""There needs to be a political will to change, a political will for justice."" Rigg refuses to condone the looting and arson attacks in Ferguson and elsewhere but says she understands the frustration people feel when loved ones are killed. ""What else are they supposed to do? People are dying unnecessarily on the streets. How can there be peace if there is no justice?"" Several hours after the rally began, dozens of protesters marched from the embassy along New Bond Street -- home to some of London's most upscale designer stores -- and into Oxford Street, one of the capital's biggest shopping centers, their windows filled with Christmas displays and twinkling fairy lights. Others marched along Whitehall, past Downing Street -- home of the Prime Minister -- to Parliament Square and New Scotland Yard, headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, which covers London. Protester Diane Neville says she is an ""ordinary mother"" just like Lesley McSpadden, the mother of Michael Brown, and that like her she has brought her son up to respect the police. But she is still anxious whenever her son goes out that something will happen to him. ""I saw [Brown's] mother crying this morning -- I'm a mother just like her; I've raised my son, I love my son, as much as she loves -- or loved -- hers,"" Neville told CNN. ""The very thought of someone taking my son's life, I don't know what would happen to me, I don't know if I'd survive... I would die of a broken heart."" Alejandro Hernandez, from Mexico City, says it is important for communities outside the U.S. to come together in support of the people of Ferguson. ""We can pressure the U.S. government... [show them] that there are people in solidarity, from different movements in different countries who speak different languages, and who are going to be promoting these calls for accountability against Darren Wilson."" Glenroy Watson took part in the protest ""in solidarity with another murder of African people, whether it is here or in the U.S."" adding that while Brown's death had hit the headlines, he was just one black American to die in such a situation: ""we know that there are many, many more going on... the situation of enslavement is continuing."" Watson says hopes had once been high that the election of Barack Obama -- the first black U.S. President -- could mend the U.S.'s troubled civil rights history, but that in practice it had done little to improve the situation.

"Amazon is trying it. UPS has considered it. Ice fishermen in Minnesota used it to get beer. Yelp created one just for burritos. Google is the latest company to branch out into delivery by drone, it revealed Thursday. The technology giant started running its first test flights earlier this month as part of Project Wing, a secretive, 2-year-old program exploring drone delivery. A team of Google engineers and experts on unmanned aerial vehicles, called UAVs, safely carried out more than 30 test flights this month, transporting an assortment of goods including chocolate bars, a water bottle, radios, a first aid kit, dog treats and a cattle vaccine one kilometer. It conducted the tests on a farm in Queensland, Australia, to avoid the FAA's strict guidelines that limit the use of UAVs in the United States. Google developed its own prototype hybrid drone with fixed wings and four rotors for the tests. It is 1.5 meters wide and can soar as high as 60 meters, far enough up to dodge houses and trees. Drones have the potential to revolutionize how goods are transported. In typical Google fashion, the company is presenting Project Wing as a way to make the world better, rather than as a tool to boost its bottom line; an early goal of the program was to deliver defibrillators to heart attack victims. Now Google imagines using the vehicles to deliver medicine and help the environment. UAVs can rise above traffic congestion, make a beeline for remote locations where roads are shoddy or nonexistent, and potentially cut down on pollution by replacing cars or trucks. In emergencies where regular routes are blocked, a drone could quickly ferry water and medicine to people in need. The Atlantic's Alexis Madrigal got an inside look at the previously undisclosed program, which was headed by MIT roboticist Nick Roy and Google[x] lab director Astro Teller. ""What excited us from the beginning was that if the right thing could find anybody just in the moment that they need it, the world might be a radically better place,"" Teller told Madrigal. Actual drone delivery, at least by Google, is still years off. The project's next goal is to determine if delivery by UAV is even viable. Then it will focus on safety features to handle potential problems like midair collisions and crashes. It also wants to reduce the noise made by its drones and fine tune navigation features to address issues like privacy. Project Wing is part of Google[x], the company's lab dedicated to making big technical leaps, like Google Glass and self-driving cars. The department is led by Google co-founder Sergey Brin. This is not the first time Google has taken to the skies. It purchased a drone company, Titan Aerospace, for a reported $60 million in April. It is also working on Project Loon, which is testing the use of high-altitude balloons to bring Internet connections to remote areas. It also works with Makani, a company developing airborne wind turbines that hover between 80 and 350 meters in the air. The undersea drones revealing the ocean's secrets .

"Iran's navy has captured what it says is a U.S. drone after it entered Iranian airspace over the Persian Gulf. However, a U.S. defense official, who could not be named because the official was not authorized to speak to the media, told CNN that whatever the Iranians claim to have, it is not an actively operating U.S. Navy drone. Read more: A dangerous new world of drones . ""The U.S. Navy has fully accounted for all unmanned air vehicles (UAV) operating in the Middle East region. Our operations in the Gulf are confined to internationally recognized water and air space,"" the source said. The internationally recognized territorial limit is 12 nautical miles off the coast. Read more: Key U.S. official defends use of drones . It is not yet clear whether any other branch of the U.S. military or government might have been operating a drone in the area. Iranian state media quoted Adm. Ali Fadavi, of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps, as saying the unmanned aerial device was a ScanEagle. The device was spotted carrying out ""spying operations"" in the Persian Gulf area in the past few days and was captured by Revolutionary Guard anti-aircraft squads, according to Iran's official news agency, IRNA. With a wingspan of just over 10 feet, the ScanEagle is designed to fly for 24 hours or more without refueling and can survive extreme weather conditions, according to its manufacturer. It can be launched from the ground or from a warship. The ScanEagle is a relatively low-cost, low-tech system and is operated by a number of U.S. allies in the Persian Gulf region. Iran has not given details of exactly how or when it captured the supposed U.S. device. Iran's official Press TV channel showed footage of what was purported to be the drone. No identification markings were visible. Last month, the Pentagon said Iranian jets had fired on a U.S. drone as it flew off the Iranian coastline in the northern Persian Gulf. The armed MQ-1 Predator was on a routine surveillance mission above international waters, 16 miles off the coast, the Defense Department said. The latest announcement comes a year to the day after Iran claimed to have shot down another U.S. drone, a high-altitude RQ-170 Sentinel.

"Sen. Rand Paul surprised members of the Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday when he threatened to force a vote on a declaration of war against ISIS as an amendment to an unrelated bill dealing with clean drinking water around the world. The Kentucky Republican, frustrated that Congress hasn't voted to formally okay the military operation already underway against the terrorist group, said he hoped his move would ""shame"" the Congress into action. ""I think the most important duty of a legislator is to vote yea or nay on whether or not we are sending our young men and women to war,"" Paul told CNN. ""I think we've been derelict in our duty, Congress has abdicated that duty. The President, I think, in his arrogance, has assumed that he doesn't even need to ask."" The unexpected move by Paul, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, prompted Democrats to quickly counter with proposals of their own and launched a spirited debate inside a small, camera-less committee room in the Capitol about the role Congress should play in approving military strikes. There were no TV cameras because none of the television outlets that cover Congress had planned to cover action on the somewhat obscure water bill. During the debate, Democrats like Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, argued the senators had a solemn obligation to their constituents to vote on an Authorization for Use of Military Force, even if it's unlikely Congress can complete action on it before the congressional session ends in a few days. But Republicans like Bob Corker of Tennessee, who will be the committee chairman next year, argued the debate was being ""rushed"" and that the administration itself hasn't said what it wants or needs in an AUMF. He argued that a lot of the ""passion"" in the room was from Democrats ""wanting to go on record not wanting boots on the ground."" Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, complained the proposals had some ""very strange things"" in them, including restrictions on ground troops. He said that would make it very difficult for the U.S. to defeat ISIS.  He argued that the reason the administration has not asked for an AUMF is because ""they have no strategy"" against ISIS. McCain said it was ""ludicrous"" a ""nice little water bill"" was used as a vehicle for a war authorization that has little chance of passing Congress. ""It's a living, breathing argument against lame duck sessions,' he said. In the end, committee leaders got everyone to agree to push off action until next week, when they promised a more structured and focused debate. Committee Chairman Robert Menendez said they want Secretary of State John Kerry to testify in open session Monday about what the administration is looking for in an AUMF. That would be followed by a classified session with Kerry or other administration officials where they could go into greater detail about the military strategy to defeat ISIS. Finally, on Wednesday, the committee would reconvene in open session for a more full debate and votes on AUMF language and amendments. ""We will now have the opportunity to engage in meaningful, transparent debate ion the U.S. military mission against ISIL, as I've been calling for since military action began nearly four months ago,"" said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Virginia, a leading advocate for Congress to vote on an AUMF. ""We owe it to our service members and the American people to have this debate and take this vote before adjourning for the year and I'm pleased we're on track to do so in the right way."" TV cameras will probably show up this time.","Sen. Rand Paul threatened Thursday to force a vote on a declaration of war against ISIS .

"Former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega has a message for the publishers of a popular video game that features a mission to capture him: You owe me money. In a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Tuesday, the 80-year-old once known as one of Latin America's most powerful strongmen accused the Activision Blizzard video game company of harming his reputation with ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II."" Noriega -- convicted of drug trafficking, money laundering and killing political opponents -- is serving out a prison sentence in Panama, where he was extradited in 2011. He argues in the lawsuit that his portrayal ""as a kidnapper, murderer and enemy of the state"" in the 2012 video game damaged his reputation. The company used his image and name in order to make money, the lawsuit says, therefore he's entitled to a share of the profits. ""Plaintiff was portrayed as an antagonist as the culprit of numerous fictional heinous crimes, creating the false impression that defendants are authorized to use plaintiff's image and likeness,"" the lawsuit says. Activision Blizzard did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In 2012, the company said ""Call of Duty: Black Ops II"" had netted more than $1 billion in sales worldwide in its first months on the market. The video game includes historical footage and several real-life characters in Cold War scenarios, including Oliver North. But while North did his own voice over for the game and acted as an adviser, Noriega said in Tuesday's lawsuit that he wasn't consulted -- or compensated -- for the use of his likeness. Former CIA Director Gen. David Petraeus is also depicted in a fictional scenario in the game as the secretary of defense in 2025. Activision said in a 2012 statement that ""including Gen. Petraeus and other real-life figures was strictly a creative decision made many months ago when the story line was drafted."" For almost two decades, Noriega was a major player in a country of critical regional importance to the United States because of its location on the Panama Canal, the key strategic and economic waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans on the narrow isthmus linking the Americas. Amid growing unrest in Panama, then-U.S. President George H.W. Bush ordered the invasion of the Central American nation in December 1989, saying Noriega's rule posed a threat to U.S. lives and property. Noriega fled his offices and tried to seek sanctuary in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. He surrendered in January 1990 and was escorted to the United States for civilian trial. Noriega was indicted in the United States on charges of racketeering, laundering drug money and drug trafficking. He was accused of having links to Colombian drug lord Pablo Escobar's notorious Medellin cartel and, in the process, amassing a multimillion-dollar fortune. He was convicted of drug trafficking and other crimes and served nearly two decades in prison. In 2010, a French court sentenced Noriega to seven years in prison for laundering €2.3 million ($2.9 million) through banks there. He was ordered to pay the money back. In Panama, where he was convicted of killing political opponents, he has been hospitalized several times since he returned in 2011 to serve out his prison sentence.","Former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega says a video game damaged his reputation .

"Michael Skakel, the nephew of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, has been denied parole after serving 10 years in prison for bludgeoning Martha Moxley to death with a golf club outside her home in 1975. The decision Wednesday morning marked Skakel's first chance at parole since his conviction in Moxley's killing, according to a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Correction. The 15-year-old's body was found after a night of partying with Skakel, his older brother Tommy and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. Robert F. Kennedy's son in court . Skakel, now 52, was also 15 at the time of the murder. Twenty-seven years later, he was tried and convicted as an adult. Martha Moxley's mother, Dorthy, said she wanted Skakel to serve at least 20 years. ""I'd like him to stay in longer, if possible. Only 10 years of a 20-to-life sentence -- that doesn't seem right to me,"" she said. Skakel has maintained his innocence. In a letter to the parole board, John Moxley spoke of the toll his sister's murder had taken on his family and asked that Skakel's parole be denied. ""I believe that Michael Skakel is representative of the most dangerous aspect of our society in that he was raised in an environment in which he was exposed to and at some point embraced the mind-set that the rules of our general society did not then and do not now apply to him."" Skakel's attorney, Hope Seeley, said in a statement, ""Michael's conviction was a miscarriage of justice, but that aside, his further incarceration would also be a miscarriage of justice since he should have been sentenced as a juvenile with a maximum sentence of four years."" 2007: Defense witness gives Skakel alibi . She added that ""there has never been a person more deserving of parole than Michael Skakel."" ""His track record during the past 10 years shows the person we all know him to be -- caring, generous, and committed to his faith, family and friends,"" Seeley said. His defense has submitted 65 letters to the board on Skakel's behalf. Several describe him as a model prisoner and deeply religious, and said he has taken an interest in mural painting while in prison. A letter from Robert F.

"Suspended Vanderbilt football star Chris Boyd admitted Friday to helping cover up an alleged on-campus gang rape, accepted a yearlong probation sentence and agreed to testify against four men accused directly in the crime. After prosecutors laid out the case against him, Boyd pleaded guilty to one count of being an accessory after the fact. As part of his plea deal, Boyd said he will willingly pay court costs, face 11 months and 29 days of unsupervised probation and ""testify truthfully"" against the men he helped last June. Beyond giving some closure to Boyd -- a suburban Atlanta native who had been on the official ""watch list"" for the Biletnikoff Award, which is given annually to college football's top wide receiver, prior to his suspension from the Commodores -- Friday's court hearing also revealed information about the prosecutors' case against the four former Vanderbilt players charged with rape. Chris Boyd indicted in rape case . Early on June 23, Davidson County Deputy District Attorney Tom Thurman alleged in court, Brandon Vandenburg took an unconscious Vanderbilt student into a building on campus. He was joined in his dorm room by three others also charged with rape --  Corey Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian McKenzie -- Thurman said. ""Different individuals"" then sexually assaulted the young woman, the prosecutor said, as captured by CNN affiliate WSMV. Vandenburg texted the 21-year-old Boyd a picture of her, which Boyd promptly erased so his girlfriend wouldn't see it, Thurman said. Soon after that text, Vandenburg called Boyd ""saying the victim had been messed with in the hall and sexually assaulted in the room, and he needed Mr. Boyd to come over,"" Thurman said. ""Mr. Vandenburg further stated that he wanted to have sex with the victim, but he could not get an erection even though he used cocaine,"" added the prosecutor. Boyd went over and, with two other people, moved the woman -- who was lying in the hall unconscious, partially clothed -- to a room, put her on a bed, then left, Thurman said. Subsequently, Boyd exchanged texts with Vandenburg and Batey, Thurman said. In one, Boyd said, ""Tell the boys to delete that sh**. I'm looking out for your a**."" Boyd also texted his girlfiend that he ""got everything cleared up"" and ""deleted everything,"" Thurman said. More texts followed the next day, including one in which Boyd detailed how he had helped move the young woman and said ""she doesn't know anything that happened."" Boyd also talked about it with Vandenburg, Batey, Banks and McKenzie at a Popeye's restaurant, Thurman said. ""The defendant was not completely truthful with the police or the district attorney's office in his initial interviews,"" the prosecutor said. ""... He later came forward and gave additional information."" Asked later by a judge if Thurman's presentation was correct, Boyd replied, ""Yes, sir."" His lawyer, Roger May, after the hearing described Boyd as ""a 21-year-old young man that was forced with making a decision in a situation that he did not fully understand."" ""He is paying for that decision,"" May added, ""and he will be paying for it the rest of his life."" Thurman said after the hearing that, if Boyd was convicted, he probably would have gotten a 1-year sentence given his clean criminal record. ""I don't know how good a deal it is for him,"" the prosecutor told reporters. Vanderbilt spokeswoman Beth Fortune said later Friday that Boyd remains enrolled at the school, though he is still suspended from its football team, ""pending further review by the university."" The incident came to light when university officials checking the dorm's hallway surveillance recordings regarding an unrelated situation observed unusual behavior by the defendants, police said. That prompted a notification to campus police on June 26. That same day, Vanderbilt University Police called Nashville Police into the investigation. Four days later, Vandenburg, Batey, Banks and McKenzie were dismissed from the football team and suspended from the university. The university and city police announced the dismissals but did not identify the players at that time. The four young men now each face five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. Vandenburg was also charged with one count of tampering with evidence and one count of unlawful photography.","Chris Boyd pleads guilty to being an accessory after the fact in an alleged rape .

"(CNN)From the buzzing message boards on local social networking site Red Social de Cuba, to the hip campus of the University of Havana, young residents of the island are riding a wave of optimism following the historic announcement of a new deal with the U.S. on December 17. ""I hope for new investments in different areas of our economy,"" says Pepe Nieto, a young, privately-employed graphic designer in Havana. ""That means more work, more advertising. Everybody who is ready to work hard will benefit."" Across social media, mooted upgrades to Internet infrastructure are causing as much excitement among young Cubans as a new iPhone launch would among their counterparts across the Florida Straits. A beleaguered workforce needs some good news. Public sector wages are at around a quarter of 1989 levels at roughly $22 a month, national growth has slowed to 1.2%, and traditional allies such as Venezuela and Russia have their own economic problems, limiting the value of their support. The agreement between Presidents Obama and Castro offers a timely boost, although reforms are piecemeal. Restrictions on business dealings and banking have been eased, while the remittance limit to Cuba has quadrupled. But lifting the U.S. embargo -- in place since 1961 -- would still need Congressional approval. Cuba's economy Minister Marino Murillo has already revised growth estimates up for 2015 up to 4%. Part of this will come through traditional industries such as tobacco and rum, which should perform better as the new rules allow U.S. visitors to import limited amounts. But private business can yield greater dividends. Even before the U.S. deal, the amount of privately employed people -- cuentapropistas -- had risen to around 500,000, from just 150,000 in 2006. This growth had been matched with lay-offs in the state sector. ""I think the Cuban government concluded that outlawing small business was just pushing it underground, forcing people to buy goods and services illegally,"" says professor Arch Ritter, a specialist in the Cuban economy at Canada's University of Carleton. ""For the convenience of everyday life (private business) was necessary, and it has been remarkably dynamic."" Ritter expects tourism to offer major opportunities: . ""When travel for Americans becomes regular, there could be a tourism tsunami. In anticipation those in the hotel business are renovating old hotels, building new hotels and retirement homes, and low-cost apartments. This could see a big construction boom around tourism that spreads to areas like food and car rentals."" To fully grasp these opportunities, the Cuban government would likely be forced into greater commercial liberalization. With fewer restrictions and greater investment, agriculture could expand its capacity and serve international markets. Through its favorable climate, Cuba can become ""a winter garden for North America,"" Ritter believes. The island also boasts an advanced biotech industry that is vital to the nation's economic strategy, as well as its own high standards of healthcare. But to build its exports the government must consent to international testing and standardization. Although President Raul Castro has shown greater flexibility on private business than his predecessor -- brother Fidel -- a more fundamental shift in approach would help the new generation of entrepreneurs. ""The Cuban government should provide a stronger legal basis for private businesses, giving them the same rights and duties as for the non-private companies"", says graphic designer Nieto. ""Without that, I think there will not be any serious economic growth."" Evidence of such a fundamental shift can be seen in the port town of Mariel, site of the Cuban Missile Crisis. A ""special economic zone"" has been created, with the backing of Brazil, allowing tax-free foreign investment in industries such as mining and manufacturing. ""There are major real estate projects that the government would like to see, there could be billions of dollars of investment,"" says Johannes Werner, editor of the Cuba Standard, the island's only dedicated financial media. ""But there has been a lot of insecurity around foreign investment -- the greatest being the U.S. embargo."" ""The Obama announcement sends the signal to investors that it's OK to move ahead, as well as telling them that U.S. investors may be here soon so be ready before their competition arrives."" Improved Internet infrastructure is a deal-breaker for this new vision of the Cuban economy. Grand-scale projects will not be sustained by a connection on the strength of satellite signals and a single fiber-optic cable from Venezuela. The U.S. has made a priority of co-operation on this issue, although these plans are viewed with skepticism, based on previous American efforts to subvert the government through social networks as well as open suggestions that the liberalization of the economy could help overthrow Castro's regime. ""The problem is that the Obama proposal prioritizes private enterprise over the state economy with the idea being to strengthen capitalism on the island,"" says Rosa Miriam Elizalde, editor of the loyalist Cuba Debate news site. ""This contradicts our society that has tried to defend and protect social access to our resources... If American intentions is to impose capitalism here through seduction it will not be successful."" While the leaders of both nations have declared a commitment to co-operation with respect for ideological differences, it remains to be seen whether the decades-old phoney war will continue by other means. An isolated pariah, or bread basket of North America? Cuba's path is open.","Cuba has new opportunities following historic deal with U.S.

"Michael Skakel, a Kennedy relative convicted of the 1975 murder of a 15-year-old neighbor, walked out of a Connecticut courthouse Thursday on bail. A Connecticut judge set bail at $1.2 million for Skakel, whose murder conviction in the death of Martha Moxley was vacated last month after a judge decided he did not receive adequate representation in his 2002 trial. After bail was posted, Skakel sauntered out of the courthouse, flanked by his attorneys, a slight grin on his face. He did not speak. Hubert Santos, his attorney, told reporters that ""two tragedies"" occurred in Greenwich nearly four decades ago. ""The first was of course the murder of Martha Moxley,"" he said. ""A great tragedy for the Moxley family and for everyone else associated with the matter. The second tragedy occurred in a courthouse ... in 2002 when Michael was convicted of the murder of Martha Moxley. A murder he did not commit. And hopefully we are at the first step of righting that wrong and making sure that an innocent man now goes free."" Stamford Superior Court Judge Gary White set several conditions for the bail, including barring Skakel from leaving Connecticut without court approval, ordering him to wear a GPS tracking device, to refrain from contacting the victim's family, and requiring that he report to a bail commissioner. Skakel, the 53-year-old nephew of Robert and Ethel Kennedy, has spent more than a decade in prison for the murder of the 15-year-old girl. Moments after bail was granted, about two dozen relatives of Skakel, seated together on one side of the courtroom, applauded the decision. Skakel turned to them, placed his right hand to his heart and smiled. In a statement, the Skakel family said the decision was a ""first step in correcting a terrible wrong."" ""We look forward to Michael being vindicated and justice finally being served,"" said the statement. ""We are thankful to God that after 11 and one half years he will be reunited with his sons. We are grateful for the love and prayers of Michael's many supporters who have sustained him through this ordeal."" Outside court, the victim's ailing mother, Dorthy Moxley, said she was ""disappointed."" ""It's been a little over 11 years now"" since Skakel was convicted, she said. ""The whole thing didn't have to be this way, but I think it's a lesson to parents. If your child does something wrong, face up to it. ... I'm disappointed, but this is life."" She added, ""I don't think he was a Jeffrey Dahmer or one of the mass murderers ... he was just a kid who had problems. We don't have anything to be afraid of now."" Earlier, prosecutor John Smriga said a bail of $500,000 or even $1 million was inappropriate and on the ""low side,"" given the brutal nature of the crime, the age of the victim and Skakel's admitted mental health issues. In court, Santos cited his client's ""track record"" of appearing in court. He said Skakel never got a fair trial because of the ""circus atmosphere"" that surrounded the case, and questioned the quality of state's evidence and testimony in securing a conviction. The defense filed court papers describing Skakel as a former world-class skier, noting his work with Alcoholics Anonymous, and even citing a meeting he once had with the late Mother Teresa of Calcutta. ""He's one of the most recognizable faces in America,"" Santos said. ""He's not going anywhere."" Appellate Court Judge Thomas Bishop overturned Skakel's conviction last month, ruling that defense attorney Michael ""Mickey"" Sherman's representation of Skakel at his murder trial was ""constitutionally deficient."" Moxley's body was found in 1975 after a night of partying with Skakel, his older brother Tommy and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. Authorities said the 15-year-old was bludgeoned and stabbed to death; a broken golf club was found near her body.

"A high-profile murder case involving one of America's most well-known political families took a dramatic turn Wednesday when a judge ordered a new trial for Michael Skakel, the nephew of Robert and Ethel Kennedy. Skakel, who has spent more than a decade behind bars, is accused of killing 15-year-old neighbor Martha Moxley with a golf club in 1975. Twenty-seven years after her death, he was convicted and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison. For years, Skakel fought unsuccessfully for his conviction to be overturned. But a Connecticut judge gave Skakel, 53, a chance for a fresh start Wednesday, ruling that the defense during his 2002 trial had been inadequate. State's Attorney John Smriga said prosecutors plan to appeal, but are still reviewing the judge's decision. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has long maintained his cousin's innocence, described the judge's order as a ""blessed event."" ""I think everybody who knows Michael's overjoyed with it,"" Kennedy told CNN's ""AC360."" Martha Moxley's mother said the judge's ruling does nothing to change her mind. ""There's not a way they can erase what was said during the first trial. ... I have not given up and I do believe Michael Skakel killed my daughter,"" Dorthy Moxley told CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live."" ""If there is a new trial, I will be there."" Judge: Defense 'constitutionally deficient' In a lengthy opinion Wednesday, Connecticut Appellate Judge Thomas Bishop ruled that defense attorney Michael ""Mickey"" Sherman's representation of Skakel was ""constitutionally deficient."" ""The defense of a serious felony prosecution requires attention to detail, an energetic investigation and a coherent plan of defense (capably) executed,"" Bishop wrote in his decision. ""Trial counsel's failures in each of these areas of representation were significant and, ultimately, fatal to a constitutionally adequate defense."" Skakel's new attorneys had argued that Sherman failed to adequately represent him in court. Sherman said Wednesday that he was happy for his former client. ""I've always believed in Michael's innocence,"" Sherman told CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin called the judge's order a ""shocking development,"" saying the case ""was brilliantly litigated by the prosecutors."" Moxley said she disagreed with the judge's assessment. ""Mickey Sherman did a wonderful job at that trial,"" she said. ""I was nervous the entire time."" What's next? Hours after the judge's order, Skakel remained behind bars at the MacDougall-Walker Correctional Institution in Suffield, Connecticut, according to prison records. The judge's ruling raises a number of questions: What's next in the high-profile case? Will Skakel be released on bail? And will prosecutors push forward with a new trial, nearly four decades after the alleged slaying? In his decision, Bishop wrote that Skakel's conviction would be set aside, ruling that a new trial should be the next step in the case. ""A defendant's constitutional right to adequate representation cannot be overshadowed by the inconvenience and financial and emotional cost of a new trial,"" he said. But so many years after Moxley's death, that may be easier said than done. ""Now it is going to be very difficult to try him again, so that's why the prosecutors, I think, are going to do everything in their power to get this conviction reinstated without having to go back to court,"" Toobin said. Brutal killing in an affluent community . Moxley's body was found after a night of partying with Skakel, his older brother Tommy and other teenagers in an affluent gated community in Greenwich, Connecticut. Authorities said she was bludgeoned and stabbed to death by a broken golf club found near her body. For more than two decades, the case languished. A series of books on the high-profile crime renewed interest, leading to new tips and a new suspect in January 2000: Michael Skakel, who was 15 at the time of the killing. He turned himself into police after an arrest warrant was issued, all the while proclaiming his innocence. Kennedy told CNN on Wednesday that five witnesses saw Skakel 11 miles away at the time of Moxley's death. ""He has an airtight alibi,"" Kennedy said, ""but unfortunately, he was very poorly represented.""","Victim's mother: ""I have not given up""

"(CNN) -- Police have identified the man whose shooting of another man outside a store in Naples, Italy, was captured by a surveillance camera, the Italian news agency ANSA reported Saturday. The announcement came two days after police released the video of the brazen daylight shooting in hopes it would lead someone to come forward. Police did not release the man's name. The video, shot May 11, shows a man wearing jeans, a dark jersey and a baseball cap, walking into the store and looking around, turning and walking back out. Passersby appear unfazed. One woman tries to lift up the victim's head in an apparent attempt to see if she knew him; a man steps over the body. Police said they had been without any clues before the release of the video. A source who was not identified publicly said the killer was a man in his 30s from Naples' northern Sanita district who had recently left the city. A third man seen in the video was thought to have been an accomplice, but he told Il Mattino newspaper that he had nothing to do with the killing. ""I am the man of the film, but I have never been a lookout, and now I am afraid,"" the 39-year-old man said. ""I was taking a breath of air, waiting for my daughter to go shopping."" The man said he had been living ""in terror"" since acquaintances called him from Germany to tell him they had seen him on the video. Police said they knew of no motive for the killing, which took place in the poor neighborhood of Rione Sanita, where Camorra, the name for organized crime in Naples, is strong. The victim was a bank robber, the spokesman said. A police spokesman said Camorra has been blamed for about 60 killings this year in Naples and its surrounding county.","Surveillance video shows man shooting another man outside a store in Naples, Italy .

"(CNN) -- We don't yet know all the facts behind the now-infamous, poorly fact-checked story in Rolling Stone about an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia. What we do know: Rolling Stone at first blamed the alleged victim, ""Jackie"" -- rather than its own journalistic sloppiness -- for so-called ""discrepancies"" (before changing its callous statement). And new reporting by the Washington Post does reveal that Jackie's friends, cited in the story, say they are skeptical about some of the details. Still, they all believe that Jackie experienced something ""horrific"" that night, in the words of one, and we do know that Jackie stands by her story. Most of the doubts about it were apparently raised by those she's accusing, including the fraternity and main alleged assailant -- whom, I guess, we're supposed to believe instead. But one other thing we do know is that gang rapes just like what Jackie is alleging do happen -- too often, and all over America. Here's one measure: Today the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics released a new report showing  that 80% of college rapes and sexual assaults go unreported to police, and 67% of such attacks by non-students go unreported. It would be a terrible and infuriating mistake to use the confusion around Jackie's story as a convenient way to discount this reality. While Rolling Stone's reporting was clearly shoddy, for example, some writers who initially poked holes in Jackie's story did so for ideological motives. For instance, even before the reporting lapses were revealed, conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg called Jackie's story unbelievable. ""It is not credible,"" Goldberg wrote in the Los Angeles Times. ""I don't believe it."" Instead, Goldberg insisted, Jackie's account was ""a convenient conversation for an exposÃ© of rape culture,"" something, incidentally, Goldberg also doubts to be real. ""'Rape culture' suggests that there is a large and obvious belief system that condones and enables rape as an end in itself in America,"" Goldberg later wrote in National Review. It's all hogwash, says Goldberg, alleging that the very idea of ""rape culture"" is just ""an elaborate political lie intended to strengthen the hand of activists."" In other words, whatever the reality of what happened to Jackie, Goldberg and others were skeptical because they simply don't believe rapes like that happen with the participation of groups of assailants, let alone the complicity of bystanders. This is where they're mistaken. On October 24, 2009, in Richmond, California, a 15-year-old girl was repeatedly raped by a group of young men in a courtyard outside their high school homecoming dance. Six assailants were eventually tried and ultimately pleaded guilty or were convicted. Over two hours, as the assault occurred, as many as 20 other people watched. ""As people announced over time that this was going on, more people came to see, and some actually participated,"" said Lt. Mark Gagan of the Richmond Police Department. The witnesses didn't report the crime to police. On August 12, 2012, a 16-year-old girl who was incapacitated by alcohol was raped by two high school football players in Steubenville, Ohio. In the backseat of a car and later in the basement of a house, the two assailants stripped their victim naked and took turns, one inserting his fingers into her vagina, the other forcing his penis into her mouth. This is not in dispute. Both football players were convicted of the crime. As the crimes were taking place, friends took pictures that were shared with other friends. Ultimately, Ohio investigators confiscated 17 cell phones used in sharing the pictures. Some of those at the party even posted pictures of the unresponsive girl, being carried by her wrists and ankles, on Twitter with words like ""rape"" and ""drunk girl."" In Steubenville, four adults have been indicted after being accused of covering up the incident, including the school superintendent. On May 11, 2014, an 18-year-old woman was allegedly sexually assaulted by three students at a party after their high school prom. The three alleged assailants, all prominent athletes, have been charged with multiple counts of aggravated assault and are awaiting trial. According to police, at least one person witnessed the assault in the room where it took place and several other people at the party knew it was happening. But no one stopped it. In June 2014, a 16-year-old girl went to a party where she was allegedly drugged and raped. She doesn't remember what happened, only passing out and waking up the next morning with her clothes messed up. But weeks later, the young woman received text messages of photos showing her unconscious and undressed, apparently taken at the same party. The photos went viral on the Internet, with Twitter users posting photos of themselves in the same awkward position, mocking the alleged victim. When the Houston Press asked someone who posted such a picture on Twitter why he did it, he simply said he was ""bored at 1 a.m. and decided to wake up"" his Twitter feed. This is by no means an exhaustive account of incidents in which young women have been gang raped while bystanders have either cheered the crime, hidden it or stood by in silence. In the case of Jackie, I believe in innocence until guilt is proven, even as I realize that we have a society where rapists are given the benefit of the doubt, often despite overwhelming evidence, while female victims are shamed (see multiple Bill Cosby allegations). The fact is, there doesn't appear to be any incentive for Jackie to have lied. She wasn't seeking to tell her story in the first place (the Rolling Stone reporter found her), and she must have known that she would face the usual victim shaming and blaming (witness the slime ""journalists"" who have now published what they allege is Jackie's full name and address). Indeed, while Jackie named the fraternity involved, she left her alleged assailants' names out of it, so it's hard to see what sort of ""revenge"" agenda could be served by fabrication. Anti-feminists have it wrong. No one, myself included, wants Jackie's story to be true (that's absurd and offensive), but we cannot apologize for erring on the side of a fair, compassionate and credulous hearing of a woman's account. What feminists want -- as we all should -- is a culture in which it is safe for women to report sexual assault when it happens, where they can trust that their families, their peers, the police and courts and, yes, the media will respond with sensitivity and compassion, not skepticism and shame.","Sally Kohn: Facts hazy on UVA rape allegations, but victim-blaming is back in the mix .

"(CNN) -- By day, tens of thousands turned out in cities across Egypt -- demanding the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, calling for major economic and political reforms and, in multiple spots, bloodily clashing with police forces. By night, with the security forces seemingly disappeared, some had stepped back to mourn those killed, treat their wounds or gather strength. Other citizens, meanwhile, gathered whatever weapons they could find as they banded together with friends, family and neighbors to protect their communities from roving bands of looters. ""There's no army, no one to prevent (theft and chaos). They disappeared,"" said one man from a Cairo suburb on Saturday night, who united with friends, cousins and neighbors to protect their property. Closer to the capital's center, as well as in Alexandria and Suez, the main events earlier Saturday were turn-outs by tens of thousands of demonstrators. For the fifth straight day, they held up signs and shouted for an end to Mubarak's 30-year reign, unsatisfied with his newly shuffled government. ""What's happened to our president?"" said one woman in Cairo, wearing a black veil. ""We don't want him (because) he's responsible for all this."" But her anger was tempered by satisfaction that people had turned out, in such large numbers, to express their views after decades of silence and suppression. ""I am happy,"" she said. ""I feel yes, we can change."" In Alexandria, protests have gained strength during the course of the week. Throngs chanted Saturday, ""We want him out, we want him gone, Mubarak has to go."" One demonstrator told CNN's Nic Robertson that Mubarak, after an early Saturday speech signaling his intent to reorganize his government but stay in power, was trying to challenge demonstrators. He said his decision to implement a curfew, which extended from 6 p.m. to 7 a.m., was irrelevant and suggested that the opposition is only getting stronger and bolder. ""He cannot order us, he's not the president anymore,"" the man said. ""He wants to calm us down by saying he will stay. That is not calming us down."" There were also tears Saturday, the result of mounting casualties from sporadic confrontations between demonstrators and police. At one point, the body of a man, apparently killed while trying to approach the Interior Ministry, was carried through the streets, wrapped in an Egyptian flag. Also in Cairo, a mosque was turned into a makeshift clinic. There, a handful of men came in with wounds from what appeared to be rubber pellets fired by police, they told CNN, . And at least 31 people were killed in Alexandria, Egypt, hospital authorities told CNN. Besides civic discontent and violence, general lawlessness was also pervasive -- especially in areas outside the city centers, which were largely free of any police or military presence. Looters, some sporting swords and riding motorcycles, had infiltrated numerous public and private buildings. While there were reports of a large gun battle Saturday night, they largely went unbothered by security forces, though not as often by residents. Fires could be seen in several Cairo neighborhoods, set by people paying no heed to the government-imposed curfew. People also continued to roam the streets, in what was in some ways one of the quietest nights since the protests began earlier this week. An increasing number of residents, fearful given the apparent absence of any official security apparatus, had taken matters into their own hands. They worked together to set up barricades around some streets. Many -- including the wife of CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman -- handed out clubs, kitchen knives and whatever other implements they could find to trustworthy men and teenagers who could help ward off looters. This sense of community and desire for protection was evident early Sunday outside the famed Egyptian Museum, home to King Tut and other milllenia-old relics of the nation's storied past. Army tanks surrounded the museum, with some soliders standing inside its garden. In front, mostly euphoric civilians stood arm-in-arm -- in solidarity with the military and in defense of some of Egypt's greatest treasures. Still, there was also ample evidence of chaos and destruction. Numerous police stations had been burned and ransacked. And private businesses also were hit, including several shops in an upscale Cairo neighborhood. Residents said they were worried about possible anarchy and prisoners escaping from jails. Others told CNN they worry that the chaos is President Hosni Mubarak's strategy -- that all the crime could turn people against the protesters, and build favor for the government security forces to restore order. Shereif Abdelbaki, a resident of Cairo, said he saw people burning cars and taking parts from a junkyard. He said the police had withdrawn or were otherwise occupied, while the Army was downtown, leaving community members to work together or fend for themselves to protect property. ""We have all become vigilantes,"" he said. ""Basically, it's like the Wild West. Where is the security?"" CNN's Ben Wedeman, Nic Robertson, Mary Rogers and Frederik Pleitgen contributed to this report.","NEW: Civilians stand arm-in-arm in front of tanks to protect famed Egyptian Museum .

"The Seattle Police Department has used weapons either excessively or unnecessarily more than half the time during arrests, the U.S. Justice Department announced Friday. The finding was the result of a lengthy investigation that concluded the Seattle department engaged in a pattern of excessive force in violation of the Constitution and federal law. The investigation, which began in March, was conducted by the U.S. attorney's office in Washington state along with the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. ""The problems within SPD have been present for many years and will take time to fix,"" said Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division. The Justice Department said it reviewed thousands of pages of documents, including training materials and written policies, video footage, internal reports and investigative files. Hundreds of interviews were conducted with officers, supervisors, city officials, community members and local advocates. The Justice Department also looked at whether the Seattle Police Department used discriminatory policing. According to the Justice Department, it did not make a finding that officers engaged in a pattern of discriminatory policing, but ""the investigation raised serious concerns that some of SPD's policies and practices, particularly those related to pedestrian encounters, could result in unlawful discriminatory policing."" Investigators looked at a random sample of force reports between 2009 and 2011 and concluded when Seattle Police Department officers use force, they did so in an unconstitutional manner nearly 20% of the time. It found officers too quickly resorted to using impact weapons such as batons and flashlights. ""SPD officers escalate situations, and use unnecessary or excessive force, when arresting individuals for minor offenses,"" the Justice Department said. ""This trend is pronounced in encounters with persons with mental illnesses or those under the influence of alcohol or drugs."" Justice officials found that problems within the police department were exacerbated by the large number of less-experienced officers. Approximately one-third of the officers had three years or less experience, and more were likely to be hired, as another 350 officers were retirement eligible. ""Proper leadership, training (including mentoring), and oversight are critical for molding this next generation of SPD officers,"" said Justice officials in a letter sent to Seattle Mayor Michael McGinn and Police Chief John Diaz. In an effort to restore public confidence and trust, the Seattle Police Department has begun to implement a number of remedial measures, including new force policies and training for officers on how to conduct effective and constitutional policing, according to the Justice Department. ""We remain optimistic about the changes that are to come. Failure is not an option,"" Perez said.","Seattle police have a pattern of excessive force, federal officials say .
A joint federal-state investigation of the department began in March.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Space travel, security threats and increasing passenger numbers are forcing major changes in the way airports are designed. Elegant space: the interior of the proposed Virgin Galactic spaceport in New Mexico . In fact, when discussing the future of the airport it is now appropriate to consider both conventional air travel hubs we are familiar with, as well as the imminent 'spaceports'. The rush of interest in setting up 'space tourism' companies has seen proposed spaceport projects in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, and California, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Florida, Virginia, Alaska and Wisconsin in the United States. Russia, Australia, Sweden and Portugal have also been rumored as potential spaceport locations. Meanwhile, the air travel industry is continuing to expand operations despite the challenges facing some airlines. And there are some radical new ideas being developed for future air and spaceports.  See a picture gallery of futuristic airport and spaceport designs » . The adventurous views of Dave Evans, chief technologist at business solutions company Cisco Systems, highlight the types of changes we could soon see in airports and indeed the new features we may witness in spaceports. Speaking at a FAA/NASA/Industry Airport Planning Workshop in 2006, Evans suggested that pilots of the future could fly without hands and from the comfort of their own home (using brain-machine interfaces, in which the human brain actually exchanges electronic signals with a computer). He also said future airports would have virtual intelligence personnel to perform the jobs of many airport workers; and that people would be able to check-in remotely using a cell phone embedded with a RFID (radio frequency identification) chip. But what will these new airports and spaceports look like? Graeme Johns, who is an architect at British airport design company, The Design Solution, believes airports of the future will continue to expand, with bigger security and commercial areas. Johns, who is involved in projects in London (the new Heathrow T2 terminal), Delhi, Mumbai, Doha, Abu Dhabi and Oman, said many new airports were being more adventurous with designs. ""I think there is definitely a move towards more avant-garde designs. People are trying to do things more site-specific rather than keeping to the same old formula. ""Definitely in the Middle East they throw everything at it, also in the Far East there are some large developments. They are all vying for transit passages,"" he said. Johns said one of the biggest challenges was balancing commercial space with operational space. ""There's lots of pressure to make larger security areas ... but a big thing for us is trying to move up the commercial side of airports."" Future airports would likely include a better range of shops, he said. ""We are definitely looking at broadening the offering of shops and bringing in things that haven't traditionally been in airports,"" John said. If all of this isn't exciting enough for you -- then of course there are spaceports. Internationally renowned design company Foster and Partners won a competition to build Virgin Galactic's spaceport in New Mexico. Company founder Lord Norman Foster said the project was one of the most exciting and futuristic he had been involved in . ""This technically complex building will not only provide a dramatic experience for the astronauts and visitors, but will set an ecologically sound model for future spaceport facilities."" And what will this magnificent new structure include? A tunneled entrance, a 'super-hangar' for the space-craft, and retaining walls that form an exhibition documenting the history of space exploration alongside the story of the region, are just some of the features. So whether or not you have the money to make the space flight, Virgin Galactic's spaceport is going to be a place well worth visiting.","Airports are likely to see bigger security and commercial areas in future .

"(CNN) -- In a significant first, a U.S. appeals court has struck down a state ban on same-sex marriage, creating greater political and legal momentum for the Supreme Court to decide whether gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to wed. It happened on Wednesday in Utah, where a panel ruled 2-1 against the prohibition, saying that any couple, regardless of sexual orientation, has the right to marry. Enforcement of the decision was stayed temporarily. ""We hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental right to marry, establish a family, raise children, and enjoy the full protection of a state's marital laws,"" the majority opinion from the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals said. ""A state may not deny the issuance of a marriage license to two persons, or refuse to recognize their marriage, based solely upon the sex of the persons in the marriage union,"" the court said. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said his office would appeal to the Supreme Court. The justices then would decide whether to hear the case. Derek Kitchen, a key plaintiff in the case along with his partner, Moudi Sbeity, said they were ""overjoyed"" by the ruling. ""Since the lawsuit was filed last year, we have received so much support from so many people in our state, and we are now looking forward to the day when we will finally be married,"" he said. The legal, social, and political conversation over expanding the definition of marriage that is playing out in Utah is by no means unique, but merely another thread of an issue that is being confronted in courtrooms and living rooms nationwide. Same-sex marriage is legal in the District of Columbia and 19 states: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Massachusetts was the first to make it legal, in 2004. A recent Williams Institute survey found that among metro areas with a population above 1 million, Salt Lake City had the nation's highest rate of same-sex couples raising children, at 26%. Virginia Beach, Detroit, Memphis and San Antonio were not far behind. Among states, Mississippi led the list, also at 26%. When it was passed in 2004, Utah's Prop 3, which banned same-sex marriage, had 66% voter support. But that has since fallen. A Salt Lake City Tribune poll has found residents there equally divided on whether same-sex couples should be allowed to get state-issued marriage licenses. Unclear is whether the Utah appeals court decision would also apply to the other five states within its jurisdiction in the Midwest and Mountain West. Oklahoma's same-sex marriage ban was also before it. Enforcement of the Utah ruling was also stayed to give the state time to explore its legal options. It means same-sex couples in Utah cannot get married for the time being. But in the meantime, Hillary Hall, clerk and recorder for Boulder County, Colorado, said Wednesday that she would begin issuing same-sex marriage licenses. ""Because the Court stayed its mandate, officials in Utah will not have to implement the decision immediately. Even so, I believe the opinion is clear and it is important to act immediately. ""Colorado's prohibition on same-sex marriage has treated our family, friends and co-workers as second class citizens for long enough. Unless a Court in Colorado or the U.S. Supreme Court tells me otherwise, I plan to begin issuing licenses,"" she said in a statement. Colorado's attorney general stressed that the state's prohibition on same-sex marriages remains in effect. In his statement, John Suthers said that any marriage licenses issued to such couples before a final resolution would be invalid. ""There might be a bump in the road along the way ... The state may challenge this,"" said Tracey MacDermott, who married her partner of 18 years on Wednesday. Standing beside their license, she added: ""I think this will actually mean what it says it means down the road,"" CNN affiliate KUSA reported. Wednesday's decision also spells further legal limbo for 1,300 Utah couples who were legally wed when a federal judge first struck down the state's ban in late December. Those marriage licenses were issued for a 17-day period before the Supreme Court agreed with Utah officials to temporarily halt further marriages while the issue was appealed. Utah's senior senator, Orrin Hatch, a Republican, expressed disappointment in Wednesday's ruling. ""Although I am not surprised by today's decision, I disagree with the court's reasoning and hope the Supreme Court ultimately adheres to the original understanding of the Constitution and allows each state to define marriage for itself,"" said Hatch. But lawyers for the three same-sex couples who first filed the lawsuit challenging Utah's ban said the issue was simple. ""If you boil it down from all of the legal rhetoric, it really comes down to fundamental principles of equality and fairness,"" said Peggy Tomsic, a Salt Lake City attorney who argued the case before the appeals court. ""I am genuinely hopeful that the Supreme Court will take this case and resolve this issue and declare it's unconstitutional."" The Utah decision and one by a federal district judge in Indiana striking down that state's ban, came a year and a day after notable Supreme Court rulings on the issue. A 5-4 majority struck down a federal law known as the Defense of Marriage Act, which had denied legally married same-sex couples the same federal benefits, including tax breaks, available to heterosexual couples. The court, also 5-4, dismissed a same-sex marriage appeal on jurisdictional grounds, ruling that private parties do not have ""standing"" to defend California's voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. The ruling cleared the way for same-sex marriages there to resume.","Colorado attorney general says state's prohibition on same-sex marriages remains .
Utah decision is the first of its kind by an appeals court on the hot-button issue .
The state will appeal the decision directly to the Supreme Court .

"This is another one of those stories that seems absolutely hard to believe. A 6-year-old boy near Colorado Springs, Colorado, was suspended from school for kissing a girl on the hand. You read that correctly. ""It was during class,"" first-grader Hunter Yelton said in an interview with CNN affiliate KRDO. ""We were doing reading group, and I leaned over and kissed her on the hand. That's what happened."" Not only did Hunter's peck get him suspended from school, but the school accused him of sexual harassment, KRDO reported. Hunter's mom, Jennifer Saunders, is outraged. ""This is taking it to an extreme that doesn't need to be met with a 6-year-old,"" Saunders told KRDO. Now my son's asking questions, 'What is sex, mommy?'"" She said Hunter had problems at school before, getting suspended for rough-housing and for kissing the same girl on the cheek. The family has been working with him on ""class disruptions"" by grounding him and giving him ""big restrictions,"" Saunders said. Robin Gooldy, the superintendent of Cañon City Schools, told KRDO that Hunter's record will remain within the district and that his behavior fits the school policy description of sexual harassment, which includes unwanted touching. ""Our main interest in this is having the behavior stop because the story is not just about the student that was disciplined, it is also about the student receiving the unwanted advances,"" Gooldy told HLN. ""We have to think about both students in the situation."" Saunders said the girl in question was ""fine with it"" because Hunter and the girl consider themselves ""boyfriend and girlfriend."" The girl's parents have not commented publicly on the issue. But Saunders wants her son's record cleared of anything suggesting sexual harassment. On Wednesday, Saunders told CNN that the boy's school principal would ask the superintendent to reconsider removing the term sexual harassment from Hunter's record. The superintendent did not return a phone call from CNN. ""Remove it from his record,"" Saunders told KRDO. ""I need to stand up and fight for him. I can't just let that happen because it's not the case. It's not what happened at all."" Hunter for his part said he feels ""sorry"" for doing something wrong and tries to be good in school. ""But I just have a lot of energy. Six-year-olds, they have a lot of energy,"" Hunter said. They sure do, and as a parent of a 6-year-old and a 7-year-old, an innocent peck on the cheek or on the hand seems as natural for kids this age as declarations of who they plan to marry. They don't know anything about sex or sexual harassment. So how on earth can they be accused of such behavior? Reaction online to Hunter's story has been swift, with the majority of commenters expressing pure outrage. ""The school probably traumatized the kid for life with that stupid move,"" wrote Brenda Esselman on the Facebook page for ""New Day."" ""Poor child, he's (too) young to even know what sexual harassment is,"" Ortencia Solis also wrote on Facebook. ""Another example of how we are now overreacting to something as simple as a childhood crush,"" Benny Barboza wrote. Eric Vetch, also on Facebook, said he kissed a girl when he was 6. His punishment? ""I remember writing on the chalkboard 'I will not kiss girls at school,' and it was a private Christian school ... go figure."" On the other side, there are a small number of people voicing some support for the school's actions. ""The kid shouldn't go around kissing someone's child. Because if it was my daughter, the parents and I would be talking. Let's keep it real,"" Russell M. Walker wrote on Facebook. We clearly need to hear more from the school and the school's district because this might turn out to be another case where the pressure to follow set school rules gets in the way of common sense. We saw this recently with two other stories: the Long Island school heavily criticized for banning most ball playing and even requiring supervision of games of tag while the school yard was under construction, and in Boston, where a student who allegedly went to a party to drive a friend home who was drunk was suspended from playing on her school's volleyball team. What do you think about this latest case of a school taking a controversial stand? Do you think a 6-year-old should be suspended and accused of sexual harassment for kissing a girl on the hand? Let us know in the comments below.","6-year-old suspended for kissing a girl on the hand, CNN affiliate KRDO reports .

"Venezuela said Monday that three U.S. diplomats have 48 hours to leave the South American country, accusing them of conspiring against its government. The State Department fired back, calling that claim ""baseless and false"" and saying the United States had not yet received any formal notification of the officials' expulsion. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Elias Jaua accused the U.S. officials of using a visa program as a cover to meet with youth organizers at private universities ""for training, financing and creating youth organizations through which violence is promoted in Venezuela."" The expulsion, which President Nicolas Maduro first announced Sunday, comes after the State Department expressed concerns about rising tensions in Venezuela. Three anti-government protesters died in clashes last week in Caracas, and authorities have issued an arrest warrant for opposition leader Leopold Lopez on charges including conspiracy and murder in connection with the violence. The Venezuelan Foreign Ministry sharply criticized the Obama administration. ""The U.S. government is lying when it denounces the arrest of peaceful anti-government protesters,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""The Venezuelan state has acted and will continue acting against violent actions of extreme right-wing groups that are conspiring dangerously against democratic freedoms. ... The world must know that there is enough evidence that the groups that have caused violence in recent days are headed by Mr. Leopoldo Lopez."" Lopez's party, Popular Will, has accused the government of being responsible for violence during the protests. On Monday, the party said government troops had violently raided its headquarters, firing tear gas and demanding security cameras. Venezuelan officials could not be immediately reached to respond to that claim. In a YouTube video posted from an undisclosed location over the weekend, Lopez called for new anti-government protests Tuesday and vowed to show his face in front of Venezuela's Justice Ministry and hand over a list of demands from the Venezuelan people to government officials. ""I made the decision to present myself before the justice system of my country, a corrupt and manipulated system, because I am not a delinquent, I have not committed any crime, and because I have the obligation to deal with this,"" Lopez said in an exclusive audio statement sent to CNN's ""Amanpour"" Monday. ""To leave the country or to hide would be to plant doubt about what our motivation is, which is to rally millions of Venezuelans in order to effect change -- social change, political change -- in the face of a reality the affects us all."" Lopez encouraged protesters to be peaceful and to allow him to walk the final stretch to the ministry alone. ""We have raised a flag of change to organize millions of Venezuelans, that we want to effect change in a peaceful manner, not in a violent way,"" Lopez told CNN. While opposition groups plan another protest Tuesday, government officials appear to be looking for support beyond the country's borders. Jaua said he plans to meet Tuesday with ambassadors from Latin American and Caribbean nations, and with ambassadors from Russia and China, to discuss the recent violence. On Monday, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called for dialogue in Venezuela as tensions mount. ""We support human rights and fundamental freedoms -- including freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly -- in Venezuela as we do in countries around the world,"" she said. ""But as we have long said, Venezuela's political future is for the Venezuelan people to decide.  We urge their government to engage all parties in meaningful dialogue.""","An opposition party says government troops raided its headquarters .

"Venezuela's President says his country has arrested three air force generals accused of plotting a coup. ""Last night we captured three generals, who we had been investigating...three generals who were trying to turn the air force against the legitimately constituted government,"" President Nicolas Maduro said in remarks broadcast Tuesday on state-run VTV. ""They were organizing a coup. This captured group has direct ties with sectors of the opposition, and they said that this week was the decisive week."" The generals, whom he did not name, will be charged in military court, he said. Maduro revealed the arrests as he spoke to a commission of South American foreign ministers who are visiting his country as part of efforts to facilitate dialogue as political tensions mount. Weeks of clashes between opposition protesters and government forces have left at least 36 people dead, authorities say. Protesters and government officials trade blame for the violence. Last week, opposition leader Henrique Capriles Radonski blamed Maduro for fueling tensions. ""Nicolas threw gas on the fire. He and he alone will be responsible for how the situation develops,"" he said in a Twitter post. In an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour this month, Maduro was unapologetic about his government's response to opposition protesters. Think about what the U.S. government would do if a political group laid out a road map for overthrowing President Barack Obama, Maduro said. ""What would happen in the United States if a group said they were going to start something in the United States so that President Obama leaves, resigns, to change the constitutional government of the United States?"" Maduro said. ""Surely, the state would react, would use all the force that the law gives it to re-establish order and to put those who are against the Constitution where they belong.""","Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says three generals were arrested .

"A Florida man was denied bond Monday on a murder charge stemming from a weekend shooting that started with a complaint about loud music and ended with a teenager dead. A statement by the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office described a Friday-night confrontation in a gas station parking lot that escalated into at least eight shots being fired at a car carrying a group of teenagers. Seventeen-year-old Jordan Davis, among the teens, was fatally wounded. Forty-five-year-old Michael Dunn of Brevard County, Florida, was arrested Saturday and charged in the fatal shooting. According to the statement from the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, Dunn told authorities that he had asked the teens to turn down loud music from their vehicle adjacent to his, as he waited while his girlfriend, who was returning with him from a wedding, went inside the gas station to make a purchase. Dunn told police he felt threatened by the response from the teens, the statement said. Dunn's attorney, Robin Lemonidis, told CNN Monday that Dunn told police that he reacted after having seen a gun barrel in the window of the teens' car and after hearing a profanity-laced string of threats against him and his girlfriend while the teens motioned they were opening the door. Lemonidis said that was when Dunn reached for his gun and opened fire on the vehicle. She added that, ""When all the evidence has been flushed out, I believe that it will be extremely clear that Mr. Dunn acted as any responsible firearm owner would have under the same circumstances."" Eight or nine shots were fired at the teens' car, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office statement added. There were no guns found inside the teens' car, the statement said. Lemonidis said her client and his girlfriend left the scene after the shooting, fearing that they had encountered gang members and that more would follow. The couple went to a local hotel for the night, and saw the news the next morning that Davis had died. They returned to Dunn's home in Brevard County, where local police arrested him Saturday on an out-of-county warrant. Dunn was arraigned Monday afternoon, and Lemonidis said she entered a not-guilty plea on her client's behalf. Ron Davis, the victim's father, told CNN affiliate WAWS that he wants to see justice, ""Whether it be through the legal system or to God. God's going to punish him for that, so me, I don't want to do anything to him.""","A 17-year-old is dead after a weekend shooting in a gas station parking lot .

"Google has heard all the concerns about Glass, its digital headset expected to hit the market by the end of the year. They've heard people's fears they'll be secretly recorded by a Glass-wearing creeper. They know somebody's going to be stupid and drive while using them. And, yes, they know that some people might think you're a ""Glasshole."" So, now, they're serving up a list of ""do's"" and ""don'ts"" to avoid those awkward moments and get the most out of what may be the most high-profile entry in the emerging wearable-tech market. On its website for Glass, Google has posted advice for testers in its current Explorer program and, presumably, the folks who will be entering the world of Glass when the headset goes on sale to the public. Here's a breakdown of some of our favorites. DO: Ask for permission . ""Standing alone in the corner of a room staring at people while recording them through Glass is not going to win you any friends,"" Google says. ""The Glass camera function is no different from a cell phone so behave as you would with your phone and ask permission before taking photos or videos of others."" Fears about privacy around Google Glass have been one of the device's biggest hurdles on its path toward acceptance. Restaurants have banned them, and complete strangers have confronted testers because of the device's ability to shoot photos and video. Easing those fears will be important for Google as it moves forward. DON'T: Be creepy or rude (aka a ""Glasshole"") Yes, Google itself used the derogatory term ""Glasshole"" (although it's been massaged into a description of bad behavior, as opposed to its broader meaning as a slur, voiced by some critics, used to describe anybody wearing the headset). This is the flip side of the first entry. ""If you're asked to turn your phone off, turn Glass off as well,"" Google writes. ""Breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about Glass and will ruin it for other Explorers."" DO: Take advantage of the Glass voice commands . This is the real advantage of a lot of wearable tech. You don't have to fiddle around with it like you do a smartphone. But we mostly just like Google's hypothetical scenarios here: . ""Glass can free your hands up to do other things like golfing, cooking, or juggling flaming torches while balancing on a beach ball."" DON'T: Glass out . Google is pushing Glass as a way of getting quick updates or performing quick actions, as a complement to other mobile devices instead of a replacement.

DON'T: Wear it and expect to be ignored . Google is treating its Explorers (many of whom forked over $1,500 for the right to say they were first) as walking billboards for the product. They don't want those billboards acting like ... well ... Glassholes. ""If you're worried about someone interrupting that romantic dinner at a nice restaurant with a question about Glass, just take it off and put it around the back of your neck or in your bag,"" says Google.

"When a building is on fire, every second counts for the first responders rushing to the scene. A computer-savvy firefighter in North Carolina is hoping a bit of futuristic wearable technology and clever programming can help save time and lives. Patrick Jackson has developed an app for Google Glass, Google's experimental head-mounted computer, which feeds important information directly to the eye-line of firefighters in an emergency. ""I'll hear a little notification and can look up into the top corner of my vision and see a map of where it is. I see the location of the incident and what type of call it is,"" Jackson said. By routing information directly to Glass, the app can save firefighters from having to stop what they're doing in order to reach for a radio, smartphone, tablet or computer. Jackson plans on adding even more useful data in future versions, like information on specific buildings including blueprints, potential building hazards and contact information for owners. A firefighter might be able to say an address out loud or simply look at a building with the Glass camera to retrieve information. Glass can also record the first video of a situation when crews arrive. That early documentation will be important to fire investigations down the line. For now, Glass isn't compatible with the oxygen masks firefighters wear on the ground, so the app is more for external personnel. Jackson's Glass stays behind in the truck. People like Jackson who are finding genuinely helpful uses for the device might help Glass gain more widespread acceptance. Google Glass has struggled with its public image since Google first made it available to a limited group of developers in April. The device's ability to snap photos and record video and audio has raised privacy concerns from regular people and even members of Congress. Its use in social situations and public venues has led to etiquette questions. The device hit a legal speed bump when a woman in California was cited for wearing Google Glass while driving. Her case was later dismissed when the court didn't find enough evidence that the device was turned on. There's even an unfortunate epithet just for the people who wear Google Glass regularly: glassholes. That's not what Jackson saw when a group of skydivers demonstrated Google Glass at the annual Google developers conference in 2012. ""They had a video of some guy diving out of a blimp wearing Glass and riding a bike into the conference,"" Jackson said. ""Right then I started thinking about uses for the firefighter."" A self-taught programmer, Jackson first started tinkering with computers when he was 7 and later spent a year studying computer science in college before transferring to the University of North Carolina, Asheville, for an environmental management and policy program. He became a firefighter and didn't do much with computers for another decade. Then, about four years ago, he purchased a smartphone and was inspired to start programming again. ""Since then I've taught myself way more than I ever knew about programming. I've developed an Android app, an iPhone app and a Glass app,"" Jackson said. His first project was the Android app Firefighter Log, which similarly routed key information directly to the smartphone, including text messages from fire and EMS dispatchers, streams of emergency radio feeds, and location information for fires and nearby hydrants. Jackson says more than 20,000 people have downloaded the apps. To get his hands on Google Glass, Jackson submitted his idea to Google's IfIHadGlass competition. He raised money to cover the cost of the hardware through an Indiegogo campaign and received the device in September. Fire departments don't all have the funding necessary to upgrade to the latest technology, but many are seeing the potential to save money and become more efficient at the same time. Jackson's own Rocky Mount Fire Department recently installed iPads in its vehicles. The tablets cost significantly less than the laptops they're replacing and can show the same information, such as call notes, fire hydrant locations, maps and dispatch information. ""You don't need a big laptop with a hard drive and all this on it,"" Jackson said. Other fire departments across the United States have expressed interest in Jackson's Google Glass setup. One wants to take it to the next level and link a thermal imaging camera to Glass customized to work with oxygen masks. Then firefighters could have partial vision through smoke and darkness. Other fire departments and researchers also are experimenting with wearable technology, thanks to a recent availability of affordable wearable sensors that can track vitals and environmental factors like air quality and temperature. The Wearable Advanced Sensor Platform, or WASP, can track a firefighter's location as well as physical data such as heart rate, breathing and activity levels in real time. A Belgium finalist for Microsoft's Imagine Cup created a system that combines location sensors and augmented reality glasses to help firefighters move around buildings when there is minimal visibility. When he's not fighting fires or perfecting his app, Jackson is working on another possibly life-saving use for Google Glass: an app to help administer CPR. Using the built-in accelerometer in Glass, the app can measure how fast someone's chest compressions are and instruct the person to go faster or slower.","A firefighter has developed a Google Glass app to help first responders save time .

"If you want to know how U.S. schoolchildren are performing, you don't have to look far: A wealth of information is available, thanks to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. Go online and see, for instance, that Massachusetts children outperform those in Texas, that average math scores have gone up nationally over the past 20 years and that the District of Columbia was the only urban district to improve in math and reading in grades 4 and 8 last year. But what if you want to know how much students are learning in college? Here, the trail grows cold. The Obama administration's proposed college ratings would measure access, affordability and outcomes such as graduation rates -- all of which are well worth tracking. But there's no proposal to find a way to measure student learning. This failure to examine systematically what is, after all, the core mission of colleges is a big problem for U.S. higher education. We're awash in efforts to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of our colleges. But without a better base of comparative evidence, we won't really know how these reforms affect learning. That's why it's time for NAEP to go to college. Tests of what college students know are nothing new, of course, within individual classrooms and institutions. Comparative, standardized measures are rarer, though -- and much more controversial among college leaders. There's the Collegiate Learning Assessment, or CLA+, which examines critical thinking, reading and writing skills and is administered to small samples of undergraduates at about 200 colleges each year.  But many wary administrators contend the CLA should be used for self-assessment and career placement rather than college-to-college comparisons. And some won't make their data public. That may be no surprise: a 2011 book drawing on CLA data found dismayingly low levels of student learning across the nation. It's the same with the National Survey of Student Engagement. A growing number of colleges use this survey, which doesn't measure learning directly but asks students about things such as how often they write long papers or talk with professors outside class. However, many still don't release the results off-campus, preferring to use them for internal improvement. An intriguing new initiative led by Massachusetts will compare student learning across nine states by evaluating work such as student papers and lab reports. But because it will consciously avoid standardized tests, its ability to make credible cross-state comparisons may be limited. The enormous advantages of an integrated, independent national test are clear. Like the NAEP used in elementary and secondary schools, a college NAEP could be administered to representative samples of students around the country. It would provide broad national and state-level results, including a breakdown of learning outcomes by race and socioeconomic status, and trends over time. It wouldn't assess individual colleges, which should alleviate the (overblown) anxieties of educators worried about curriculum-narrowing or one-size-fits-all rankings. Still, the idea has long been contentious. It last received serious consideration more than 20 years ago, when the National Education Goals Panel recommended a voluntary national assessment to gauge the number of college graduates with advanced critical thinking and problem-solving skills. But higher education groups torpedoed the proposal. They argued, among other things, that a single measure would be unfair to institutions with large proportions of disadvantaged students, including community colleges. Today, a collegiate NAEP would undoubtedly face similar objections. In fact, even as an idea, it already has --  in rather dramatic terms. Clifford Adelman, senior associate at the Institute for Higher Education Policy, contended recently that the ""shadow of a government test,"" taken by very different kinds of students, studying a variety of subjects at a wide range of institutions, ""is enough to freeze the soul, let alone elementary statistical sanity."" But objections based on the diverse nature of American higher ed don't carry a lot of weight when lobbed at a sample-based test of vital academic skills that any student should be learning at any college. Indeed, testing expert Gary Phillips of the American Institutes of Research, who once ran NAEP, has sketched a persuasive vision of a new experimental test that could make cross-state comparisons and also provide achievement data for different groups of institutions, from community colleges and liberal arts schools to Ivy League universities. The next time a state boasts about the prowess of its universities, wouldn't it be nice to have an objective yardstick -- a reality-check that shows how those undergrads stack up academically against their peers in the rest of the country? It's an appealing prospect. Why not give it a try?","Ben Wildavsky: You can find lots of information on U.S. schoolchildren's performance .

"For months he was held captive by the North Korean regime, not even sure what he would be charged with. Then in one fell swoop, American citizen Matthew Todd Miller was convicted of committing ""acts hostile"" to North Korea and sentenced to six years of hard labor, North Korean state-run media reported Sunday. While Miller's fate is now clear, the circumstances surrounding his alleged crime remain murky. According to the state-run Korean Central News Agency, the 24-year-old arrived in North Korea as a tourist on April 10 and ripped up his tourist visa, shouted his desire to seek asylum and said ""he came to the DPRK after choosing it as a shelter."" DPRK refers to North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Its government is a communist dictatorship renowned for human rights abuses. Washington demands release . Early Monday, the U.S. State Department demanded that North Korea release Miller and fellow American prisoner Kenneth Bae. ""The charges for which he (Miller) and the other detained U.S. citizens were arrested and imprisoned would not give rise to arrest or imprisonment in the United States or in many other countries around the world,"" said spokesman Darby Holladay. He also asked for amnesty for the men and for American Jeffrey Fowle. Fowle, 56, was arrested in June while traveling as a tourist. Holladay said that U.S. citizens are discouraged from visiting the country. Miller talks to CNN . Earlier this month, Miller told CNN's Will Ripley that he ""prepared to violate the law of DPRK before coming here. And I deliberately committed my crime."" But Miller didn't elaborate on what his ""crime"" was. He said he wouldn't learn of his charges until he went to trial. It's unclear whether his statements were made freely or under coercion. The North Korean government surprised CNN by presenting Miller and two other detained Americans -- Kenneth Bae and Jeffrey Edward Fowle -- for interviews. Each five-minute interview was monitored by the government. ""My situation is very urgent,"" Miller told CNN. ""... Very soon, I'm going to trial and I will directly be sent to prison. I think this interview is my final chance to push the American government into helping me."" How North Korea may be using U.S. detainees as 'bargaining chips' A quiet California kid . Miller's family lives in Bakersfield, California. Close friends and neighbors told CNN they were instructed by the family not to speak to reporters. Miller is a 2008 graduate of Bakersfield High School, according to CNN affiliate KBAK. A few classmates told CNN that Miller seemed like an average kid. Two said they barely remembered him because he was so quiet. In a July interview, a neighbor told The Associated Press that Miller went to South Korea about four years ago to visit his brother and that he found a job teaching English. He traveled to North Korea this year after arranging a private tour through the U.S.-based company Uri Tours, which takes tourists into North Korea. Uri Tours has said it doesn't have ""any understanding of why"" Miller ripped up his visa. The company offers tours despite U.S. State Department warnings that U.S. citizens have been subject to arbitrary arrest and detention in North Korea. Miller's case presents many questions, said Robert Kelly, an American who teaches International studies at Pusan National University in South Korea. ""If he wanted asylum, why's he trying to get out?"" Kelly asked. ""Now, he changes his mind? This is why the (U.S.) State Department encourages citizens not to go to North Korea.""","Washington calls for the immediate release of Miller and Kenneth Bae .

"Pope Francis has laid down a law making it a crime to abuse children sexually or physically on Vatican grounds, the Holy See announced Thursday. The acts were already crimes under church law, but are now specifically outlawed within the Vatican city-state, which is home to hundreds of people. The legislation also covers child prostitution and the creation or possession of child pornography. But it has a ""broader scope,"" according to Radio Vatican. It adds provisions of international laws against war crimes, racial discrimination and humiliating treatment or punishment to the Vatican's legal system. It includes wording from the Geneva Conventions. Francis issued the new laws as a ""moto proprio,"" meaning that the document was his own initiative, Vatican Radio said. The new criminal laws are part of an ongoing update of the Vatican's legal system, which began under Pope Benedict XVI. The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, a U.S. advocacy group for victims of abuse by priests and other clergy, dismissed the law as ""a feel good gesture."" ""For the Vatican's image, this is a successful move. For children's safety, this is another setback ... because it will help foster the false impression of reform and will lead to more complacency,""  said SNAP director David Clohessy in a written statement.

"(CNN) -- The world finally is starting to wake up to the plight of the pangolin -- an awesomely introverted, scale-covered mammal that's capable off fending of lions but gets snatched right up by poachers. The International Union for Conservation of Nature said this week it considers all eight species of pangolin to be threatened with extinction because of the black market trade in its meat and scales. ""In the 21st century we really should not be eating species to extinction,"" Jonathan Baillie, co-chair of the IUCN's pangolin specialist group, said in a statement. ""There is simply no excuse for allowing this illegal trade to continue."" Related: The most trafficked mammal you've never heard of . The IUCN, which publishes the well-known ""Red List"" of threatened species, now estimates more than 1 million pangolins were poached in the last decade. That's a staggering number -- pangolins already were thought to be the most trafficked mammals in the world -- and an important reminder that the world could lose these amazing little creatures if more isn't done, immediately, to protect them. When I went to Vietnam and Indonesia earlier this year to report undercover on the pangolin market, I came across a number of reasons the trade continues unabated. Among them: . 1. Conservation groups don't make the pangolin a priority. They focus on the ""charismatic"" animals -- panda, rhino, tigers -- instead of these awkward introverts. The pangolin needs a serious PR campaign in order to survive -- and an army of supporters who recognize how incredibly cool it is. To that effect, here are some fun pangolin facts: . 2. Governments in Southeast Asia and China have been slow to crack down on the illegal trade. I found pangolin meat easily available on restaurant menus in Hanoi, Vietnam, and am told by activists that little is done to stop pangolin consumption. 3. It's not just about busting the poachers. For this trade to end, there need to be incentives for poachers to stop poaching -- as well as for pangolin consumers, primarily in Vietnam and China, to stop eating pangolin meat as a delicacy. I'm thankful to CNN readers for donating more than $17,000 toward the creation of a pangolin public service announcement in Hanoi, Vietnam. Similar efforts must be made in China. Source countries, including Indonesia, must create jobs and other opportunities for people who now work in the black market. Low-level poachers are trying to buy milk for their kids, not get rich. And with better economic opportunities, they would leave the trade. Related: 7 ways to save the pangolin . An action plan from the IUCN -- cleverly named ""Scaling Up Pangolin Conservation"" -- outlines other helpful steps that should be taken, including more pangolin science. ""Our global strategy to halt the decline of the world's pangolins needs to be urgently implemented,"" Dan Challender, co-chair of the IUCN's pangolin group, said in a statement. ""A vital first step is for the Chinese and Vietnamese governments to conduct an inventory of their pangolin scale stocks and make this publicly available to prove that wild-caught pangolins are no longer supplying the commercial trade."" I'm saddened by this week's news about the size of the pangolin trade and that it now involves all eight species. But this is also an opportunity. I'm confident the more people know about the pangolin, the more they'll insist on its protection. They'll do things like start petitions asking Disney to cast a pangolin in an animated film. Or they'll create meme-y online videos like these two from CNN readers. That stuff is goofy but meaningful. If the pangolin has a big enough fan club, governments and conservation organizations are bound to listen -- and to do more to help these defenseless underdogs. The pangolin's survival may rest in people being able to see it as sassy and cool. The good thing: It's both of those. We just have to take time to notice.","IUCN says all eight species of pangolin are threatened by illegal trade .

"Republican attorneys general in several states say they are weighing legal challenges to President Barack Obama's overhaul of immigration rules. The man who rose to conservative stardom as the first attorney general to challenge Obama's health care law in court, Virginia's Ken Cuccinelli, said they're in a ""powerful position to make the legal assault."" But, he said, because Obama's immigration move was an executive order rather than a bill that worked its way through Congress, attorneys general have less time to prepare their moves than he did in 2010. ""The best thing to do there is just to take it slow,"" Cuccinelli, who now helms the Senate Conservatives Fund, said Friday. ""One of the challenges for lawyers can be explaining first of all, what the legal issue is, and second, its significance. And both of those are important."" ""This shouldn't be done as a political undertaking, it should be done as a legal undertaking,"" he said. ""As long as they keep that focus, understanding they have to communicate to people who aren't lawyers what they're doing and why, I think they'll be just fine."" Texas could play the lead role in challenging Obama's executive order easing deportation for the undocumented parents of children born in the United States and others. The state's GOP attorney general, Greg Abbott, who's just weeks away from replacing outgoing Gov. Rick Perry, said Wednesday night that he's planning to sue. In Oklahoma, Attorney General Scott Pruitt promised a lawsuit. Republicans hammer legal case against Obama . Other elected officials also are considering challenges, as well. Indiana Gov. Mike Pence said his state will take ""any available legal actions necessary."" At a Republican Governors Association meeting this week, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker all said they'd consider a lawsuit. Even Joe Arpaio, the colorful sheriff in Arizona's Maricopa County, said he's suing Obama over immigration. The list could grow, and it's already populated with Republicans who could enhance their standing among conservatives by hammering a president deeply unpopular with their base. There are risks, though. Immigration could be a tricky issue for Republicans in 2016, when their opposition to easing deportation rules -- especially once Obama is out of office -- could alienate Latinos, a rapidly growing group of voters. Cuccinelli said immigration is ""just like Obamacare but with different players. It's not just some political positive all the time. There will be people who will not appreciate it."" Read transcript of Obama's immigration speech . The legal challenge to Obama's signature health care reform law was the star turn for Florida's Pam Bondi, who led the multistate battle that reached the Supreme Court. It also turned Cuccinelli, who had campaigned for office on fighting Obamacare, into a conservative darling -- and catapulted him to the Republican nomination in last year's governor's race, though he narrowly lost to Democrat Terry McAuliffe. Cuccinelli's lawsuit was eventually rejected, but other states had some success with the Supreme Court, which rejected a challenge to the law's individual mandate but allowed states to opt out of its expansion of the Medicaid program. Cuccinelli said attorneys general needed to play a ""federalist role,"" then and now. ""If the AG's position is this violates the law and the separation of powers, it cannot stand for that reason alone. Whatever anyone may think of immigration, then that's the job of the attorney general,"" he said. Opinion: Obama's immigration move is a win . Cuccinelli said there is strength in numbers for attorneys general who, while elected in most states, are usually lower-key lawyers unaccustomed to the spotlight that comes with taking on the White House. ""When one person does something, you look like an outlier,"" he said. ""And whether it makes sense or not, the states get a certain level of respect from the courts that other people don't. When you file an amicus brief and you represent a state, the court reads your brief. It is a powerful position to make the legal assault from.""","States' top GOP attorneys are considering lawsuits challenging Obama's immigration overhaul .

"(CNN)He was the so-called ""Fastest Man on No Legs,"" and his inspiring story captured the imagination of the world at the London Olympics. Now, Pistorius is playing the lead role in a more tragic tale that began in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013. The Olympic and Paralympic sprinter is facing a maximum five-year prison sentence after he was found guilty of the negligent killing of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp on February 14, 2013. He claimed he mistook Steenkamp for an intruder and was cleared of murder. Despite a seven-month trial, much remains in question about what happened at his upmarket home in Pretoria, South Africa around 4 a.m. that Thursday morning, leaving stunned fans at a loss to explain how their hero could have fallen so far and so fast. Speaking to CNN's Robyn Curnow in the last few weeks before his sentencing, Pistorius told her that he would respect and accept the decision of the court and that he was not afraid of imprisonment. He said he hoped to contribute while in prison by teaching people how to read or start a gym or running club. But it may prove to be the greatest challenge yet for a man who's already overcome many difficulties. Born with a congenital abnormality, Pistorius, 27, had both his legs amputated below the knee before his first birthday, but through sheer determination carved out a career in world-class athletics. In 2012, he became the first double amputee to compete against able-bodied runners at the London 2012 Olympics, adding to his fame as the ""Blade Runner,"" a reference to his carbon fiber prosthetic legs. While he failed to win a medal, Pistorius' presence on the track was hailed as a triumph over adversity and a victory over critics who claimed his blades gave him an unfair advantage over the able-bodied. He did take home medals from the Paralympic Games. For many, he was an example of what could be achieved through a potent mix of determination, positivity and skill. Who is Oscar Pistorius, really? Soon after his arrest, the athlete's image was pulled from billboards across South Africa. Sponsors suspended their deals as admirers questioned whether Pistorius' sporting successes had perhaps obscured a more complex character off the track. Was Pistorius violent? On the edge? In a story titled ""The Fast Life of Oscar Pistorius"" published in the New York Times, writer Michael Sokolove wrote: ""Pistorius is, as well, blessed with an uncommon temperament -- a fierce, even frenzied need to take on the world at maximum speed and with minimum caution."" After the shooting, a police spokeswoman said there had been ""previous incidents"" at Pistorius' home, including ""allegations of a domestic nature,"" but did not say what they had been. Besides the five-year prison term for culpable homicide, the athlete was also given a three-year sentence, suspended for five years, on a weapons charge stemming from an incident in which he discharged a loaded firearm in a restaurant. The sprinter moved into his uncle Arnold's house in Pretoria after the shooting. Video surfaced last June of Pistorius training, but he has not returned to the track in an official capacity. In an exclusive interview last summer, Arnold Pistorius said his nephew was heartbroken. ""What can you say if the person you love the most dies, and you were the instrument?"" he told CNN. ""How would you feel? It's unthinkable."" It was known that Pistorius owned guns. He was a keen shooter and despite his disability he was not afraid to take risks. During a visit to Pistorius' house a few years ago, he showed CNN images of himself water-skiing, scuba diving and quad bike riding. ""I grew up in a family where disability was never an issue. We didn't really speak about my disability, not because it was a topic that was taboo... it was just never an issue. And that's the mentality that I've had,"" Pistorius told CNN in late 2012. From a young age, Pistorius dedicated himself to being the best he could be at sport. ""I was never much of an academic at school so I had to find something which I enjoyed. I started sports and from a very young age, my mother said to us 'sports is not about being the best, but it's about giving your best.' Divided reaction . Support from Pistorius' family has been firm and unwavering since Steenkamp's death. ""We have no doubt there is no substance to the allegation and that the State's own case, including its own forensic evidence, strongly refutes any possibility of a premeditated murder or indeed any murder at all,"" said Arnold Pistorius before the athlete's conviction. Addressing reporters after the sentencing, Arnold Pistorius again criticized the state prosecution for pursuing the murder charge, saying that as a result ""the truth became totally irrelevant to the state's attempt to to make the premeditated murder stick."" He said the 20 months since Steenkamp's death had been harrowing for both families and Pistorius -- and had left everyone emotionally drained and exhausted. ""As an uncle,"" he said, ""I hope Oscar will start his own healing process as he walks down the path of restoration. ""As a family we are ready to support and guide Oscar as he serves his sentence."" Pistorius' agent, Peet Van Zyl, referred to the sprinter as his ""friend and a great professional athlete."" He said thousands of people had sent messages of support from all over the world in the wake of the shooting. Steenkamp's family is skeptical about the man who killed their daughter. Her father Barry Steenkamp told the Afrikaans-language newspaper Beeld: ""It doesn't matter how rich [Pistorius] is ... and how good his legal team is. He needs to live with himself if he lets his legal team lie for him."" Oscar Pistorius' affidavit to court in full . ""But if he's telling the truth, I may forgive him one day,"" he said. But ''if it didn't happen as he described it, he should suffer. And he will suffer ... only he knows."" At the supermarket down the road from his house, parking attendant Andre Tsekedi told CNN last February that he saw Pistorius and Steenkamp a few days before the shooting: ""They were holding hands and looked so happy."" Another, Samuel Motau, described Pistorius as ""a very generous man."" ""He tipped us $10 every time. The only reason I never went to bed hungry was because of Oscar Pistorius."" Growing up . As a child, Pistorius competed in water polo, cricket, tennis, triathlons and Olympic wrestling and boxing, before he smashed his knee while playing rugby at the age of 16. He took up track running as part of his rehabilitation, and within one year he was covering 100 meters faster than the existing Paralympic world record. In 2004, Pistorius took his first gold at the Athens Paralympics and one year later competed against able-bodied Olympics for the first time, at the South African Championships. Pistorius' career on the track suffered a setback in 2009 when he suffered serious head injuries in a boating accident. It took him almost eight weeks to recover, a period of time the athlete has described as ""fairly difficult"" as it marked the first season in four or five years in which he didn't record a personal best. Soon after the London Olympics, Pistorius led his national team onto the track as South African flag-bearer in the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games. He went on to set a new world record in the 200-meter event but later suffered a shock defeat in the final, his first competitive loss over the distance in nine years. During the very last track event of the Paralympics, Pistorius again picked himself up and smashed the 400-meter T44 Paralympic record in a time of 46.68 to take gold. It ended a summer he later described as ""a dream come true,"" according to his website. Beyond the track . Pistorius' determination to succeed made him one of the world's most recognizable athletes. He appeared on the cover of men's magazine, GQ Style, under the headline ""Man of the Future,"" and was named on People magazine's 2012 list of ""Sexiest Man Alive."" According to his website, Pistorius is an ambassador for the Mineseeker Foundation, a non-profit organization that works to clear landmines worldwide. When asked about his thoughts on being a role model, Pistorius told CNN before the shooting: ""I think it's a massive blessing. ""Obviously, being an international sportsman, there's a lot of responsibility that comes with that. So having to remember that there are kids out there, especially, that look up to you is definitely something that you need to keep at the back of your mind."" Pistorius has more than 300,000 followers on Twitter, tens of thousands of whom added in the days since his arrest last year. His account laid dormant for a year until the anniversary of Steenkamp's death in February, when he tweeted a link to ""a few words from my heart"" on his website.

"After months in detention, two Americans who had been held prisoner in North Korea soon will be back in the United States following a rare visit by a top U.S. official to the reclusive nation and a letter from President Barack Obama. Kenneth Bae and Matthew Todd Miller, the last two Americans detained in North Korea, were due to arrive at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state about midnight ET (9 p.m. PT). The pair were released after Director of National Intelligence James Clapper went to Pyongyang as an envoy of President Barack Obama, a senior State Department official told CNN. Clapper delivered a letter from Obama, addressed to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, describing Clapper as ""his personal envoy"" to bring the Americans home, a senior administration official told CNN on Saturday. The letter was ""short and to the point,"" the official said. Clapper did not meet with Kim. Clapper had no guarantee he would bring the Americans home, a senior State Department official told CNN. The North Korean government issued a statement about the release, saying it received an ""earnest apology"" from Obama for the men's actions. It also said the two were ""sincerely repentant of their crimes and (were) behaving themselves while serving their terms."" According to the statement, the first chairman of North Korea's National Defense Commission ordered the release. The title is one of several top positions that Kim holds in the North Koran hierarchy. China assisted in the monthslong process of arranging the release, the official said. Clapper's visit came after North Korea contacted the U.S. government unexpectedly and urged the administration to send a Cabinet-level official to North Korea's capital to discuss the detained Americans, according to two sources close to the matter. A U.S. official told CNN that Washington believes Pyongyang reached out to show it had the clout to get a Cabinet-level official to come and doing so would help solidify Kim's power. The request came about two weeks ago, the official said. Clapper ended up canceling an event in New York on Wednesday as the trip was being arranged, an Obama administration official said. He went to Pyongyang ""prepared to listen"" on other issues, but that his sole focus was to bring Bae and Miller home, according to the same official. In fact, an official in Clapper's office said the talks didn't even touch on North Korea's controversial nuclear program. And other U.S. officials said there was no ""quid pro quo"" for the men's release. 'We are filled with joy' Clapper's office said the U.S. government is facilitating the two men's return home. Bae's family is to meet the plane but will not grant media interviews. Clapper and a U.S. delegation also are on the flight. Bae's sister, Terri Chung, told CNN that her family spent Saturday morning shedding happy tears and spreading the good news among relatives and friends. ""Words cannot adequately express our relief and gratitude that Kenneth is finally coming home!"" the family added later in a full statement. ""We have been waiting for and praying for this day for two years. This ordeal has been excruciating for the family, but we are filled with joy right now."" There was no immediate reaction from Miller's family. Obama expressed appreciation for Clapper's efforts ""on what was obviously a challenging mission"" and happiness Bae and Miller will soon be home. ""It's a wonderful day for them and their families,"" the President said. Another American let go weeks earlier . The Americans' departure from North Korea comes less than a month after North Korea released Jeffrey Fowle, an Ohio man who spent five months in detention. North Korean authorities took Fowle into custody after he left a Bible at a club in the northern part of the country. Bae had been held since late 2012, and in April 2013 was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for ""hostile acts"" against the North Korean government. North Korea claimed that Bae was part of a Christian plot to overthrow the regime. The Lynwood, Washington, resident operated a China-based company specializing in tours of North Korea, according to family members, who have described him as a devout Christian. 'He's not a spy,' Bae's sister says after conviction . Earlier this year, Bae -- who was transferred to a hospital last year -- told a Swedish diplomat that he was worried about his health. Miller had been detained since April. According to the state-run Korean Central News Agency, he was convicted in September of committing ""acts hostile"" to North Korea and sentenced to six years of hard labor. He's been accused of tearing up his tourist visa and seeking asylum upon entry into North Korea. American Miller convicted, sentenced . In September, all three Americans then detained in North Korea -- Bae, Fowle and Miller -- talked with CNN in Pyongyang for about five minutes apiece. All said they'd signed statements admitting their guilt, did not complain about their living conditions and asked for U.S. help. Americans detained in North Korea talk to CNN . The interviews -- which CNN learned about only after being shuttled on a van to a secret location -- were monitored and recorded by North Korean officials. Talking Saturday, Fowle said that he'd been ""upset"" when he learned his fellow American detainees weren't going home with him last month. ""Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller should have been released before I was,"" Fowle told CNN. ""But I'm glad to hear that they're on their way home now."" In a statement, South Korea's Foreign Ministry welcomed the release of the two Americans and urged North Korea to release missionary Kim Jung-wook, who has been detained in the north on spying charges. It also asked North Korea to work with the south on humanitarian issues, such as family reunification. Ex-diplomat: North Korea may want to thaw U.S. relations . CNN could not independently confirm details of the three Americans' detention or other facts about their cases, in part because of the secrecy that defines much of North Korea's dealings with the world. That includes the Communist nation's much-maligned quest to develop nuclear weapons, something that has put it at odds with the United States, South Korea and many other countries around the world. North Korea has been subject to stringent international sanctions aimed at curbing its nuclear aspirations. The State Department official said that Bae and Miller's release is ""unrelated"" to other U.S. issues involving North Korea. Who is Kenneth Bae? The United States welcomes the move, but if North Korea wants a better relationship with the world it needs to ""show it is serious and prepared to abide by its commitments, particularly concerning denuclearization,"" the official said. ""And they must take significant steps to improve their human rights record."" Gordon Chang, the author of ""Nuclear Showdown: North Korea Takes On the World,"" opines something must have changed in Pyongyang's philosophy to justify releasing three American detainees in less than a month. ""I think right now there is a charm offensive,"" Chang told CNN. Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations who tried to win Bae's release during a 2013 visit to North Korea, echoed that view, saying, ""They are sending a message to the United States that 'we're ready to talk.'"" He added that no decision this big would have been made without the approval of Kim, who took over as North Korea's absolute leader following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011. ""It appears that it is a good move by the North Koreans to restart the North Korean-American relationship, which has been in a really deep freeze,"" said Richardson. Former basketball star Dennis Rodman, who has been criticized for his chumminess with North Korea's leader, said in statement Saturday that his trips to the country influenced Bae's release.

"Think of five children you know. One of them may suffer from a serious debilitating mental illness. If this child is your own, finding answers to the question ""How can I help my child?"" can be daunting and overwhelming. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), 20% of Americans under the age of 18 live with or have experienced a seriously debilitating mental disorder. And unfortunately many of those suffering from mental illness ultimately choose suicide as the  way out. According to the Centers for Disease Control, suicide is ranked as the 10th leading cause of death in Americans over the age of 10. Gesine Sauter, a licensed mental health counselor at the Karen Horney Clinic in Manhattan, says suicide is the third-leading cause of death among people ages 15-24. But there are ways to help and resources available if you feel a loved one might be suicidal. ""If you detect any of the risk factors and you are concerned about someone, always directly ask if he or she feels suicidal. You do not plant any suicidal thoughts or bring the other [person] closer to taking action. Just the opposite: being asked can be the first step or chance for the suicidal individual to experience a sense of relief just by being able to share some of his or her anguish and feeling less alone,"" Sauter says. While a diagnosis of mental illness or disorder of any level of severity can seem overwhelming to a parent, there are resources available to support families on their journey through diagnosis and treatment. Here are just a few: . The Balanced Mind Foundation offers support and for parents and guardians of children with mood disorders. The nonprofit provides online support groups, a professional resource directory, and a family helpline where families can submit questions to trained parent volunteers. They have twenty-eight support groups listed on their website that address the needs of all ages from toddler to what they call ""transition age"" or in their twenties suffering from depression or bipolar disorder as well as their family members. The goal of the Balanced Mind Foundation is to see these children thrive in spite of their disorders because they are receiving the proper care and support they deserve. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) provides a Peer-to-Peer Recovery Educational program geared toward healthy living strategies and skill-building resources for adults. The course is free, confidential and led by trained individuals in recovery from mental illness. They also facilitate a discussion group called Teen Consumers, which provides a healthy environment for teens to discuss their diagnoses and treatments. NAMI has a support group for parents of teens with mental illness, as well. The nonprofit's website also provides a state-by-state directory of local support groups. NAMI offers an information hotline for general information, referrals and support: 1-800-950-6264. Hours of operation are 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET on weekdays. The Autism Society's  approach is to focus on each individual child's needs. They preach a message that no method is the right method for all children diagnosed with autism. Their goal is to provide parents with many options and different avenues of advice and support. The Autism Society created  Autism Source, a comprehensive database of local professional services. Visitors to the website can explore a wide range of resources, including housing needs, medical professionals and educational services. The Treatment Advocacy Center is a nonprofit that works to promote policies that support people with severe mental illness. The website features a link that connects these families and individuals to treatment options, legal resources and crisis response strategies. The Arc is a national community-based organization that serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, including autism, Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome. In their mission statement, the team from the Arc promotes a people-first approach and ""believes that all people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are defined by their own strengths, abilities and inherent value, not by their disability.""

"Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday coalition airstrikes have not flushed the terror group ISIS from Iraq, but they may have prevented the fall of Baghdad and Irbil to ISIS militants. ""What we've done is we've stopped the onslaught. That was what we were able to achieve with air power. They were moving towards Irbil. They were moving towards Baghdad. Baghdad could well have fallen. Irbil could have fallen,"" Kerry said In an exclusive interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour. The United States and coalition members conducted a second day of airstrikes Tuesday night in Syria and Iraq since the expanded military campaign against the extreme terror group began.  But it will take time for airstrikes to degrade ISIS, Kerry said, echoing previous comments by President Barack Obama. ""There's a definitely a second day and there will be a third and more. This is going to go on,"" he added. Kerry insisted, however, that airstrikes aren't designed to defeat ISIS by themselves. ""You and others should not be looking for some massive retreat in the next week or two,"" he told Amanpour. More airstrikes against ISIS . Comprehensive effort against ISIS . The campaign will be lengthy, Kerry said, partly because the Iraqi military needs to be reconstituted, and because it will take time to arrange the kind of local support similar to the Sunni Awakening years ago. The secretary of state said the battle to stop ISIS is a multifaceted effort that includes foreign fighters, cutting off financing, and a major effort to ""reclaim Islam by Muslims."" ISIS is a threat to the people in the region, he said, but also to national sovereignty. Kerry and Obama are in New York for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, where Obama will appeal to the global community to get behind the U.S.-led effort. ""I'm absolutely convinced that the coalition is on board,"" Kerry said, referring to five Arab nations that the United States considers partners in the military campaign. In a letter to the U.N. secretary-general, the United States defended its actions, invoking Article 51 of the U.N. Charter -- acting when a country is unwilling or unable to handle a threat itself. Does hurting ISIS help al-Assad? ""The Syrian regime has shown that it cannot and will not confront these safe havens effectively itself,"" Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., wrote in a letter obtained by CNN. ""Accordingly, the United States has initiated necessary and proportionate military actions in Syria."" Share your view on the airstrikes . Other targets . The first wave of airstrikes mostly targeted the Khorasan Group, which Obama described as ""seasoned al Qaeda operatives in Syria."" Asked whether the leader of the Khorasan Group was killed in an airstrike, Kerry said he ""can't personally confirm that."" He did confirm, however, that ""there were active plots"" against the United States, but he gave no details. Kerry also defended the fact that the Obama administration has not previously talked about the Khorasan Group at length, saying the administration ""didn't want them to know"" that the United States was tracking them so closely. And the secretary of state softened previous declarations from the President that no U.S. troops would become engaged in a ground war, a statement that many in Congress and even some military advisers say is unrealistic. ""There's lots of people on the ground already in different forms,"" Kerry said, pointing to intelligence agents and U.S. aligned foreign fighters.

"At least two of the vials employees at the National Institutes of Health found in an unused storage room earlier this month contain viable samples of the deadly smallpox virus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday. Employees found six forgotten vials when they were preparing to move a lab from the Food and Drug Administration's Bethesda, Maryland, campus to a different location. The laboratory had been used by the NIH but was transferred to the FDA in 1972. When the scientists found the vials, they immediately put them in a containment lab and on July 1 notified the branch of the government that deals with toxic substances, called the Division of Select Agents and Toxins. The CDC said previously there is no evidence that any of the vials was breached, nor were any of the lab workers exposed to the virus. On Monday, law enforcement agencies transferred the vials to the CDC's high-containment facility in Atlanta. The CDC is one of only two official World Health Organization designated repositories for smallpox. CDC Director Tom Frieden said his scientists worked through the night on the samples as soon as they got them. Testing confirmed that there was variola DNA in the vials. Additional test results showed ""evidence of growth"" in samples from two of the vials, suggesting that the smallpox virus is alive. The other four vials still need to be tested for evidence of growth, Frieden said Friday. After their investigation is complete, the CDC will destroy the vials and all the growth that came out of them. The World Health Organization will oversee that destruction. Smallpox, known also by its scientific name as variola, was the deadly virus that was the scourge of civilization for centuries. It's been considered an eradicated disease since 1980, following successful worldwide vaccination programs. The last known outbreak in the U.S. was in 1947 in New York. Childhood vaccination programs are safe, seriously . The vials were created February 10, 1954; that is before the smallpox eradication campaign began. Frieden says that the NIH is currently scouring their buildings to make sure there are no other surprises left in unused storerooms. He says the problem in this case is not in the creation of the vials; the discovery points to a ""problem in inventory control."" Smallpox Fast Facts .

"President Obama's decision to target militants from ISIS -- which is now calling itself the ""Islamic State"" or ""IS"" -- operating in Iraq comes as a huge relief to the Iranians. Officials in Tehran have been panic stricken since ISIS forces overran the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on June 10. All political factions in Tehran would like to see ISIS suffer and its latest advances rolled back. At the same time, contradictory statements made in Tehran make it clear that the Iranian authorities are divided about the implications of the American military's return to Iraq. The moderates, the group of people associated with President Hassan Rouhani's presidential administration, are nudging toward an open admission that American military operations in Iraq compliment Tehran's policy goals. The hawks in Tehran, however, remain reluctant to publicly admit to any shared interests with Washington.  Still, overall, Iran and the US are clearly going in the same direction in Iraq, at least while the fight against ISIS rages on. At first, there was nothing but silence in Tehran as U.S. F-18s on Friday began to target ISIS militants. The silence was more than revealing. In the corridors of power in Tehran, where no opportunity is missed to condemn American foreign policy at every turn, the silence was tantamount to a roaring approval of Washington's intervention. On Monday, the moderate faction of President Rouhani took a step to formally spell out its backing for American airstrikes. Not only was Tehran approving but is evidently looking to expand the campaign against ""IS"" and began touting a joint Iranian-American effort in doing so. Mohammad Sadr, a deputy to Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, told an Iranian newspaper ""Iranian-American cooperation against [IS] is possible and achievable."" This was the first time since the U.S .airstrikes began that a senior Iranian official has spoken in such terms. It is easy to dismiss Sadr as bureaucrat whose words carry little weight in Tehran. But his statement was clearly carefully formulated and was hardly a fluke. And given his stature inside the Iranian system his words must be seen as a peek into the internal policy debate in Tehran about the situation in Iraq and Iran's options. Some kind of -- at least tacit -- cooperation with Washington is one of those options being studied. Politically, it is already happening. Tehran and Washington don't just agree on the need for airstrikes against ISIS. They are also in agreement that Iraq above all needs a new political leadership and that Prime Minister Maliki has to go. Since Monday's developments in Baghdad and the nomination of a new premier by Iraq's President Fouad Massmoum, Iran's reaction has been one of approval of the turn of events. Maliki's fate . Today, Ali Shamkhani, the head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, gave his unequivocal approval for a new prime minister to take over in Baghdad.  No more Iranian dithering on the fate of Maliki it seems. The fact is that Shamkhani was himself heavily involved in recent weeks to seek out an alternative to Maliki, including a trip he made to Iraq in late July to consult with various Iraqi political circles. The Americans were quicker to recognize Maliki to be at the heart of Iraq's malaise but the Iranians have finally come around to the same conclusion. And this matters a lot given Tehran's immense leverage within Iraq's Shia but also Kurdish political factions. For Shia Iran, the fight against the extremists from the Islamic State is a critical threat. Tehran desperately wants to keep Iraq intact as a nation state. It is particularly adamantly opposed to Iraqi Kurdistan seceding as Iraqi Kurds have been threatening to do. And in this equation, Maliki had become an unbearable burden for Iranian policy. The Kurdish leadership that Tehran is so hard trying to cultivate and steer away from an independence bid want Maliki gone. And Maliki's woeful management of the Iraqi military's response to the newly declared ""Islamic State"" made the Iranians just wonder what he was good for. There are reports the Iranian military is engaged in supporting Kurdish Peshmerga forces against ISIS militants. If true, this goes to show the depth of Iranian anxieties about the ""Islamic State's"" rise in Iraq. Who's in driver's seat? As far as the U.S. role in combating the Islamic State is concerned, the Iranian debate is likely to remain split between the moderates and the hawks. The moderates like to focus on the practical challenge at hand in Iraq and ways that Tehran and Washington can collaborate. They are comfortable with limited tactical cooperation if that is all that can come out of it. And, they readily admit that the neutralization of ISIS needs an American military involvement. The hawks, immersed in a historic cloak of hostility to the U.S., cannot yet bear to admit to this reality even if they cannot fail to see its inevitability. But all the recent trends suggest that the moderate viewpoint in Tehran has the upper hand on the policy question of Iraq and how Iran can best serve its interests. And President Rouhani seems eager these days to battle it out with his hawkish critics. On the question of the need for Iran to negotiate and cooperate with the U.S. on its nuclear program, he told his detractors this week to go ""to hell."" Time will show if Rouhani and his moderate wing can continue to sit in the driver's seat on the question of Iraq.","Alex Vatanka writes that Tehran is relieved by the U.S. decision to strike ISIS .

"(CNN) -- An evangelical preacher killed his wife several years ago and stuffed her body in a freezer after she caught him abusing their daughter, according to police and court documents. Anthony Hopkins appeared in court Thursday to face murder, rape and incest charges. Anthony Hopkins, 37, was arrested Monday night at the Inspirational Tabernacle Church of God in Christ in Jackson, Alabama, just after he had delivered a sermon to a congregation that included his seven other children, officials said. He faces charges including murder, rape, sodomy, sexual abuse and incest. Hopkins was denied bail Thursday when he appeared before Mobile County District Judge George Hardesty. The case is set for arraignment next week, Hardesty's clerk said. The case began Monday, when the daughter, now 19, went to the Mobile Police Department's Child Advocacy Center and reported that she had been sexually abused by Hopkins since she was 11 years old, according to an affidavit filed in support of a search warrant of the preacher's home in Mobile. The affidavit related the daughter's story as follows: . Her mother, Arletha Hopkins, 36, caught her father abusing her in a bathroom in November 2004. Afterward, her parents argued, and her mother locked her father out of the house. The father came to the daughter's window and asked her to let him in, and she did so. The next morning, her father asked her to help him hide her mother's body in the freezer in the laundry room of the home. The girl said she moved out of the home about two weeks ago and was living with a neighbor. She told police that her mother's body was still in the freezer. When authorities went to the home, no one was there, as Hopkins and the other children were at the church. A body was found in the freezer, the affidavit says. Although police think the body is that of Arletha Hopkins, an identification is not expected until early next week, Mobile Police spokesman Officer Eric Gallichant said Thursday.  Watch Nancy Grace's report » . Mobile Police Chief Phillip Garrett had said that an identification and autopsy results would take a few days: ""obviously, the body was in a freezer."" He said he was not sure of the body's condition or whether it was intact, as upon seeing the body, authorities immediately sealed the chest-type freezer. The body had been covered in the unit, he said, and the entire appliance was taken to the state Department of Forensic Science. At the Inspirational Tabernacle Church of God in Christ, Hopkins was preaching at a revival, pastor Beverly Jackson told CNN affiliate WKRG. His message, she said, was about forgiveness and not passing judgment -- and at one point, he turned to his seven children and asked them to forgive him his past, present and future. Police allowed Hopkins to finish his sermon before arresting him, Jackson said. She said she asked police why they were arresting him and was told, ""he murdered his wife."" She said Hopkins had told her his wife died four years ago while giving birth to their youngest son. Attempts to reach Jackson on Thursday were unsuccessful. Authorities moved quickly on the daughter's accusations to make sure the children still in the household were OK, Garrett said. They were placed in the custody of child welfare authorities. The next-oldest child is a 17-year-old female, he said. All eight were the children of Arletha Hopkins, and Anthony Hopkins fathered six of them, he said. An investigation has not found any record of Arletha Hopkins' existence since 2004, according to the affidavit. Asked how long police think the body had been in the freezer, Garrett said, ""I'm thinking that she's probably been there for a number of years."" He said Anthony Hopkins did not have a regular church but apparently preached in various areas around the South. ""Part of the mystery here is that, apparently, none of these children were in school"" but were being home-schooled, Mobile County District Attorney John Tyson said. ""Home schooling, under this situation, removes almost any chances of us catching up with these kinds of things until there is a catastrophe."" Pastor Jerry Porter said he used to preach with Hopkins at his church, the Williams Street Holiness Church, and knew the family. Arletha Hopkins ""was very quiet,"" he told Mobile television station and CNN affiliate WPMI. ""She was kind of secluded. She'd talk, but not much."" Anthony Hopkins, he said, made statements that led him to believe all was not well at home. ""He always used to tell me ... 'You're blessed in the fact that you have a wife that supports you and what you're trying to do for God,' "" Porter said. He said Arletha Hopkins disappeared shortly after the couple's youngest child was born. As rumors swirled, Porter said, he confronted Hopkins and asked whether his wife was dead. Hopkins ""wouldn't give me an answer,"" he said. After that, Porter said, he banned him from the church but remained on good terms with him. He said he visited the family a few years ago, and their home was clean and well-kept. ""It was the ideal family. I mean, the children were so respectful, just so easygoing,"" Porter said. ""Didn't seem to be no stress at all. Never got that impression, never."" The children, he said, ""loved their dad. They were very close to him."" Of Hopkins' preaching ability, Porter said, ""he was a bulls-eye prophet. If he told you something, you could pretty much bank on it.""","NEW: Anthony Hopkins denied bail at initial court appearance .

"Pope Francis has told a senior Vatican official to ""act decisively"" against sexual abuse and carry out ""due proceedings against the guilty,"" the Vatican announced Friday. Francis last month took the helm of a Roman Catholic Church that has been rocked in recent years by allegations of priests sexually abusing minors. Francis recommended that the Church's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ""act decisively with regard to cases of sexual abuse, first of all by promoting measures for the protection of minors, as well as in offering assistance to those who have suffered abuse, carrying out due proceedings against the guilty,"" the Vatican said. The statement does not specify who ""the guilty"" are. But in recent years, priests, nuns and other people connected to the Catholic Church have been accused of sexually abusing children. Catholics: 5 ways for Francis to move forward . His instructions to move decisively, ""continuing along the lines set by Benedict XVI,"" came in an audience with Archbishop Gerhard Ludwig Muller, the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith -- or the Vatican's main doctrinal enforcer. Benedict held that role before he became pope. Francis called for the Church hierarchy to ""formulate and implement"" the necessary directives to address an area he described as ""so important"" to the Church's credibility and worship. The pope said that the ""victims of abuse are present in a particular way in his prayers for those who are suffering,"" the Vatican said. It's the first time Francis has publicly addressed the issue since becoming pope. Opinion: Next pope must tackle sex abuse . 'Victims need action' The U.S.-based group SNAP, or the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, reacted with skepticism to the news from the Vatican. Barbara Dorris, victims outreach director for SNAP, said there was a need for action rather than words. ""Once again, as has happened hundreds of times already, a top Catholic official says he's asking another top Catholic official to take action about pedophile priests and complicit bishops,"" she said in a statement. ""Big deal."" The new pope should be ordering a change of track rather than a continuation on the same course, Dorris said. ""It's tragic that Pope Francis is asking a top aide to stay on the irresponsible path charted by Pope Benedict,"" she said. ""It's tragic that a pope who's shown a willingness to send signals that hint at change in several ways is not signaling that he wants no change in how the church deals with child sex crimes and cover ups.""

Benedict XVI said many times that abusers should be prosecuted, but was accused by SNAP and other victims' groups of doing too little. He stepped down as pontiff at the end of February. Benedict spoke with some victims of sexual abuse by priests on papal visits to countries including the United States and the United Kingdom, where he expressed his ""deep sorrow"" over the scandal. The Vatican selected those whom he met. Members of SNAP in Illinois have asked Francis to meet with survivors of abuse by priests. Last month, one alleged victim of priest sex abuse in Los Angeles, Michael Duran, urged Francis to give Catholics new hope and make priests and cardinals accountable for their actions in cases where children have been sexually abused by clergy. Duran said he was sexually abused for three years by a Los Angeles Archdiocese priest beginning in 1983, when Duran was 11. The priest has since been defrocked and a lawsuit against him and the archdiocese has been settled.","Victims' group calls for action not words, says Francis should take a new path .

"Four days after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded its investigation into June's accidental anthrax exposure, more details are being released about the government health agency's mishandling of potentially dangerous pathogens. The CDC concluded its investigation into the anthrax incident last week, saying that no lab workers had been infected with the disease. But the public health agency's report also detailed other instances in which lab workers had not followed protocol. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has also been investigating the anthrax incident. In a memo prepared for a congressional hearing this week, the USDA says it had to track down missing anthrax containers and found the infectious bacteria ""stored in unlocked refrigerators in an unregistered hallway"" where workers were freely passing through. USDA inspectors also found that ""select agent materials"" were transferred using Ziploc bags, which do not meet CDC requirements for carrying these materials. The problems date to 2011, according to the USDA memo. A report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ""found weaknesses in inventory records and expressed concerns about the lack of biosafety and security training for workers with access to these labs."" In March 2014, a USDA inspector again expressed concerns about the CDC's bioterrorism lab, including incomplete inventory records for select agents, such as botulinum and anthrax. The anthrax incident was discovered June 13. The CDC report says the potential exposure happened between June 6 and June 13. A lab that had been preparing the anthrax samples for use in two other labs on the CDC's Atlanta campus ""may not have adequately inactivated the samples."" That means the other labs were working with samples thought to be harmless; therefore, workers didn't wear protective equipment they would otherwise have been using when handling such infectious material. Procedures in two of the three labs may have exposed workers to the anthrax, the CDC said. Hallway and lab areas have since been decontaminated. The leader of one of the labs was reassigned shortly after the incident was revealed. CDC spokesman Tom Skinner would not confirm the name of the person who was reassigned. There are three types of anthrax infection: cutaneous (through the skin), inhalation (through the lungs) and gastrointestinal (through digestion). According to the report, the exposure happened because the lab that was handling the dangerous material initially didn't use an approved sterilization technique. It didn't have a written plan reviewed by senior staff to make sure all safety protocols were followed, and there was a limited knowledge of peer-reviewed literature about the process that would make it less dangerous. The lab also did not have a standard operating procedure that would make sure the transfer of the material would be safe. Bottom line, ""the scientists failed to follow a scientifically derived and reviewed protocol that would have assured the anthrax was deactivated,"" CDC Director Tom Frieden said Friday. It ""should have happened, and it didn't."" The lab involved in the anthrax incident will remain closed for such dangerous microbes until Frieden personally approves its reopening under conditions that prevent any such mishap from happening again, Frieden said. The CDC has also stopped moving any biological material out of its two highest-level labs while their procedures are being reevaluated. As a result of these problems, the CDC has created a high-level group of leaders who will work on lab safety issues. It has also started putting together an external advisory group to take a closer look at lab safety. And the CDC is carefully reviewing all the other procedures for labs working with dangerous pathogens, and it has put together a rapid-response command structure to hopefully help the labs avoid future incidents. ""I will say that I'm just astonished that this could have happened here,"" Frieden said. He stands by his labs, which are considered some of the best in the world, and he stands by his scientists. But he added that he is ""upset"" and ""angry"" and has lost sleep over the incidents, and he is ""working around the clock"" to make sure it never happens again.

"Thousands of Venezuelans are expected to line the streets Wednesday morning as Hugo Chavez's remains are taken from the military hospital where he died to the Fuerte Tiuna Military Academy in Caracas. Presidents arrived in the country  for the funeral procession, including Uruguay's Jose Mujica, Argentina's  Cristina Kirchner and  Bolivia's Evo Morales. The country has declared seven days of mourning, closed schools for the rest of the week and deployed armed forces to ""guarantee peace."" The death of the longtime charismatic but controversial leader Tuesday leaves many unanswered questions that Venezuela and the world must now grapple with. Who is expected to succeed Chavez? In the short term, Vice President Nicolas Maduro will take over as president of Venezuela until an election is held. He is Chavez's hand-picked successor and delivered the news to the country of the longtime leader's death. Maduro, 50, has long been a high-profile face in Chavez's administration. He rose from a career as a bus driver in Caracas to Chavez's inner circle. Venezuela's interim leader thrust into spotlight . What is Maduro's reputation? Chavez minced no words in his support of Maduro. ""I ask this of you from my heart,"" Chavez told a crowd in December about Maduro. ""He is one of the young leaders with the greatest ability to continue, if I cannot."" But other opinions are mixed. Maduro has been Venezuela's vice president and foreign minister and has been the recent author of some the country's most radical policies, said Javier Corrales, a professor of political science at Amherst College in Massachusetts. ""But he also has been behind some of the most pragmatic and conciliatory decisions, including the turnaround in relations with Colombia,"" Corrales said. When will elections take place? An election will be called within 30 days, Foreign Minister Elias Jaua said Tuesday. '10 reasons why I will not miss Chavez' What power, if any, does the opposition have? Though Chavez has held a tight grip on his presidency for 14 years, there is an opposition movement in Venezuela. A coalition between former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski and a group called the Democratic Unity Roundtable has made the country's opposition the strongest it has ever been, some analysts say. But, says Carl Meacham of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the opposition may still not be strong enough. ""Capriles' 11-point defeat in October's presidential election, coupled with Chavez's allies winning 20 of 23 gubernatorial elections in December, underscores the fact that the opposition still holds little power,"" Meacham says. After Chavez, a power vacuum . Will Chavez's death improve relations with the United States? Chavez, for years had a stormy relationship with the U.S., and would stir up nationalistic sentiment and popularity by picking fights with the ""imperialist"" United States and its allies. Senior American officials don't expect the relationship to change dramatically -- at least in the short term -- primarily because Chavez's system still exists. He leaves the economy more equal, less stable . The post-Chavez era started out tumultuously Tuesday when Venezuelan officials accused two U.S. Embassy officials of plotting to destabilize the country and said it was expelling them. The United States will stay out of the upcoming election, an Obama administration official said. But the White House wants it to be ""free and fair and credible,"" the official said. The U.S. remains open to restoring diplomatic relations with an ambassador regardless of the winner, the official said. U.S. open to 'more constructive relationship' with Venezuela . Why does the U.S. want better relations? One reason analysts point to is Iran. The U.S. may seek Venezuela's help in imposing sanctions on Iran for its nuclear program, senior American officials said. Iran and Venezuela have close relations. Last year, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad traveled to Venezuela as part of a tour of Latin America. The two leaders vowed to work together. Over the years, the two nations have signed more than 270 accords, including trade deals and agreements on construction projects, car and tractor factories, energy initiatives and banking programs. The other is oil. Will the death affect Venezuela's oil supply? It may, some analysts say -- and that would be a huge concern for the United States. Venezuela remains the fourth-biggest oil supplier to the U.S. market. If the power vacuum causes exports to drop, U.S. consumers could face higher prices and another hit to the U.S. economy, analysts say. When is Chavez's funeral planned? Venezuela is planning a state funeral Friday that is expected to be attended by regional and world leaders and dignitaries, including Ahmadinejad. Chavez will be buried after the ceremony but officials have not said where. What has been the reaction to the death? Chavez allies, such as leaders of Ecuador, China, Iran and Cuba, expressed sorrow and solidarity. Bolivian President Evo Morales' voice cracked as he spoke to reporters, describing Chavez as someone ""who gave all his life for the liberation of the Venezuelan people ... of all the anti-imperialists and anti-capitalists of the world."" Longtime critics had a different view, with some saying his death could be seen as an opportunity for change. ""At this key juncture, I hope the people of Venezuela can now build for themselves a better, brighter future based on the principles of freedom, democracy,""  Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper said. Opinions varied too among CNN readers who offered their thoughts on iReport. ""We can't in the U.S. always looks at somebody and just label them as a dictator,"" said Omekongo Dibinga, a motivational speaker from Washington DC. ""At the end of the day, he's somebody who really wanted to help others to do better. For that he should be respected, even by those who did not agree with his policies."" Carlos Quijada said he fled Venezuela 10 years ago as a teen because there was no future there. ""My life was completely altered because of that man. And I will not hide the fact that I am happy that he is no longer alive,"" he said. ""I left Venezuela because my brother got kidnapped, our house got burglarized, cars stolen, my parents had an import business and the currency control made it impossible for them to import anything anymore.""","Chavez's death leaves many unanswered questions .

"As the political situation in Thailand worsens with deaths on Bangkok's streets this week, CNN takes a look at the root causes of the protests, and what the latest developments might mean for the country's political future. Who is protesting and why? Unlike the 2010 protests, which saw red-shirted supporters of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra turn out in force, this time around it is opponents of his younger sister Yingluck Shinawatra's government who are protesting in the capital. As with previous protests, the country is largely divided between a younger, educated urban middle-class and a conservative class of poor rural voters, largely from the north of the country. It is the former group who have taken to the streets and are currently battling the police after months of deepening political division. The protestors, led by Suthep Thaugsuban -- a deputy prime minister in the previous Abhisit Vejjajiva-led government -- rejected YIngluck's poll in early February and are calling for the creation of an unelected ""people's council"" headed by a premier appointed by Thailand's king. What triggered the current crisis? Yingluck's prime ministership was largely stable until her party attempted to pass a controversial amnesty bill in November. The bill would have nullified former Prime Minister Thaksin's corruption conviction and would have allowed him to return to the country. The policeman-turned-tycoon has been living in exile in a number of different locations, most recently Dubai, since he was removed in a bloodless coup in 2006. He briefly returned to Thailand in 2008. Later that year, he was convicted by a Thai court of corruption and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison over a controversial land deal. Courts have also frozen billions of dollars of his assets, but he is believed to still have a great deal of money held elsewhere. What is Thaksin's role in the current crisis? While he technically plays no part in the current political situation, the deeply-divisive Thaksin is never far from the heart of Thai politics, communicating with supporters via social media and video messages. With his younger sister in power since 2011, his influence remains strong. Critics say Yingluck is Thaksin's proxy but she insists she has always been independent. The current protests were sparked by attempts by her government to enact the amnesty law that opponents said was designed to protect him and others, facilitating his return to the country -- and ultimately, to an active role in Thai politics. Why are Thai protests in the news so often? The country has had a restive history since the dissolution of its absolute monarchy in 1932. There have been a dozen military coups d'etat over the years, most notably in 1947, and again in the 1970s, which led to the creation of a new constitution. The most recent military coup was in 2006, which led to the ouster of Thaksin. Civilian rule was restored with a Thaksin-linked civilian government in charge but protests in 2008 -- including the blockade of the capital's airports -- eventually led to the creation of a coalition government. 2009-10 saw pro-Thaksin supporters, known as the red shirts, take to the streets and demand fresh elections, eventually leading to Yingluck's election -- which brings us to the current situation. What impact did the February 2 election have? Under pressure, Yingluck dissolved parliament and called for new elections at the beginning of February. These were disrupted by protestors, particularly in the capital and in the south of the country. Ahead of the elections, Suthep -- the leader of the protests -- urged his supporters to boycott the poll and recently petitioned the Constitutional Court to annul the election. They were not successful and while the results are still in doubt, the country is being ruled by an interim government headed by Yingluck, but one that lacks absolute authority. What role is the Thai king playing in all this? Despite the turbulent nature of Thailand's democratic political scene the country is home to the world's longest-serving monarch. Bhumibol Adulyadej, aged 86, is universally revered in Thailand but prefers to remain ostensibly neutral in matters of government, although he called for national unity in his birthday speech in December. What caused the latest flare-up? After a period of relative calm -- and a feeling that appetite for the protests was dying down -- trouble has flared up again this week as police in the capital tried to reclaim official government sites occupied by protestors. Reacting to the attempted eviction, around 6,000 demonstrators were estimated to be on the streets of the city Tuesday. An outbreak of violence that day saw five people -- including at least two protestors and a police office -- killed in central Bangkok. Following police action in which tear gas was fired in an attempt to disperse crowds of demonstrators in the streets, people among the protesters began firing guns at police, who responded with both rubber bullets and live fire. 15,000 police are said to have been mobilized in the latest operations. Seventy-three people -- both police officers and opposition supporters -- have been wounded in recent clashes. Will the military step in? Up until now the military has resisted calls from the protestors to intervene on their behalf, and it seems that its current leadership lacks the appetite for regime change. However, the country's army chief, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, has not ruled out the possibility that the military will intervene if violence on the streets of Bangkok worsens. What's the story with the rice-pledging scheme? The political crisis took on a new twist when a subsidy program that benefited rice farmers -- part of Yingluck's base -- was decried as corrupt by opposition leaders. The scheme was a centerpiece of Yingluck's election platform and has been beset with payment problems. Yingluck criticized her opponents for politicizing the issue, but this week the country's National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) announced their decision to charge her with ""dereliction of duty,"" which could have serious implications for her retention of the premiership. She is expected to answer the charge on February 27, according to the Bangkok Post. Is Thailand safe? In the run-up to the elections several countries issued travel advisories for tourists and in the wake of this week's fatalities it is likely that these precautions will be used more frequently. Reports of office closures in Bangkok on Tuesday and Wednesday have been received by CNN as the situation on the ground escalates.","Escalating violence in Bangkok as five confirmed dead on Tuesday .

"Three soldiers have been arrested in connection with the stabbing death of a fellow soldier who was celebrating his pending departure from the Army -- an attack that police in Washington state now say doesn't appear to be racially motivated. Jeremiah Hill, 23; Cedarium Johnson, 21; and Ajoni Runnion-Bareford, 21, were arrested on charges of murder in the death Saturday of Army Spc. Tevin Geike, police said Monday. All four were assigned to Joint Base Lewis-McChord, not far from the Lakewood sidewalk where police say Geike was accosted as he walked with two friends and fellow soldiers early Saturday. Police initially said they were investigating the death as a possible hate crime after witnesses said a black assailant directed a racial comment toward Geike, who was white, and his white friends shortly before the stabbings. But interviews with all involved now lead investigators to believe that race was not a motivating factor, Lakewood police said Monday, without elaborating. Geike, 20, of Summerville, South Carolina, was walking along a Lakewood street with two fellow soldiers after 2 a.m. Saturday when a car carrying five black men passed, with one of the occupants yelling a comment about the three being white, police initially said. One of Geike's companions, Brian Johnson, told CNN affiliate KIRO that someone in the car yelled ""something like 'white' and 'cracker.' "" The other friend, Matthew Barnes, told KIRO that he yelled back: ""So this is how we treat combat veterans now?"" The vehicle turned around and stopped, and five black men got out, police said. The groups exchanged words, but the five began retreating once they realized they were all soldiers, police said. But Hill stabbed Geike -- and cut himself in the process -- before they left, authorities said, citing one of Hill's companions who police said they interviewed. Barnes said Geike died in his arms. ""I'm sitting here holding him, trying to stop the bleeding with my right hand and calling 911 in my left, trying ... to get them here,"" Barnes told KIRO. ""Right before I got off the phone, I couldn't feel a heartbeat anymore, and he was gone."" Geike, Barnes and Brian Johnson were on their way to a celebration of Geike's upcoming discharge from the Army, Barnes told KIRO. Suspect asked for first aid, police say . Police said they made the arrests after Hill asked a fellow soldier for help mending his hand for a knife wound. That soldier, claiming Hill told him he wounded the hand when he killed someone, told a sergeant, police said. According to police, Hill told the sergeant he injured the hand while cutting vegetables. Hill eventually went to a hospital, where he claimed he hurt the hand while cutting parachute cord, police said. The sergeant went to police. Later, investigators identified and talked to a man who was among the five in the car. That man told investigators that Hill had bear-hugged Geike and pushed him to the ground, and that Hill was covered in blood when he got into the car, police said. The five sped away and got rid of the knife, police said, citing the unidentified witness. A second person corroborated the witness's account, according to police. Police didn't say how Cedarium Johnson or Runnion-Bareford were involved. They also didn't say why they don't believe the incident was racially motivated, except to cite interviews from ""everyone involved."" Hill did not talk to investigators, who still do not know why the stabbing happened, police said. Geike, an aviation operations specialist, joined the Army in October 2010 and arrived at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in April 2011. Hill, Cedarium Johnson and Runnion-Bareford, as well as their two companions, were assigned to a combat infantry unit at the base, police said. By Sunday, friends of Geike had placed flowers, a balloon and a sign on a sidewalk where the stabbing happened. Barnes said Geike was a good man and a great soldier. ""They were looking for trouble,"" Barnes told KIRO of the assailants. ""They were looking for someone to attack. And we just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.","It now appears the stabbing was not racially motivated, police say .

"(CNN) -- Sometimes it seems that Abu Dhabi, despite being one of the richest cities on earth, is uncertain of its identity: much of its new architecture is heavily influenced by European examples rather than a desert or Gulf vernacular. British designer Thomas Heatherwick aims to change that. ""Some of the parks that have existed here have been based on the romantic notion of a European park. It's as if someone went to Paris and said, 'ooh, that's a nice park,' and rolled it up and dropped it on top of the desert,"" notes Thomas Heatherwick, the British designer of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics cauldron and the London Routemaster bus. Heatherwick is hoping to renew the UAE capital's pride of place. His weapon of choice? A cracked, underground park that embraces both the natural aesthetic and flora indigenous to the land. ""There can be a mentality that can easily exist here that sees the desert as a surface to be covered up, instead of maybe celebrating its uniqueness,"" says Heatherwick, who recently unveiled plans for proposed 1.3-million-square-foot Al Fayah Park. On the outside, the public space will resemble a 65-feet high mound of parched earth. Heatherwick imagines it as a space where residents will congregate to picnic, or catch an outdoor concert. Underneath the dome (which is really a patchwork of canopies held up by several columns) will live lush gardens (including date palms and a community vegetable patch), streams and pools, cafes, and a public library. ""The amazing thing about living in a city, in a place where people live in close proximity to each other, are those times when you want to see your fellow citizens, when you want to be amongst them and have your mind move forward,"" Heatherwick notes. ""Unlike in London, where you can go for a walk down the street, the extreme climate in Abu Dhabi limits your options. That kind of socializing tends to happen mainly in shopping malls,"" explains Heatherwick. Al Fayah Park, he hopes, will be offer the city's residents a viable alternative. The domed park will also give the otherwise flat city an undulating quality. ""It's almost two stories in the middle. It's almost like Abu Dhabi's first hill,"" he says. To reduce the nation's carbon footprint, Heatherwick has also opted to mix concrete from desert sand, eliminating the need to rely on imports. Furthermore, the shade provided by the rooftop will also reduce the amount of desalinated water needed to irrigate the plants underneath by restricting evaporation. ""The partial shade will mean we can use half the quantity of water that the current site used, and create more lushness in the process,"" he says.","British designer Thomas Heatherwick recently unveiled plans for Al Fayah Park .

"China has expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"" with a U.S. statement urging the government to free protesters imprisoned after the 1989 crackdown near Tiananmen Square. At a daily Ministry of Foreign Affairs briefing, spokesman Liu Weimin accused the U.S. government of making baseless allegations and interfering with China's internal affairs. ""The U.S. side has been ignoring the facts and issuing such statements year after year, making baseless accusations against the Chinese government and arbitrarily interfering with China's internal affairs. The Chinese side expresses strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition to such acts,"" he said. The U.S. statement came as pro-democracy activists marked 23 years since Chinese soldiers followed orders to open fire on unnarmed civilians near Tiananmen Square. Official Chinese government figures put the number of dead at 241, including soldiers, with 7,000 injured. Rights group say the number of dead was likely to be in the thousands. The U.S. State Department issued its remarks on the eve of the anniversary, saying the United Statements ""joins the international community in remembering the tragic loss of innocent lives."" ""We encourage the Chinese government to release all those still serving sentences for their participation in the demonstrations; to provide a full public accounting of those killed, detained or missing; and to end the continued harassment of demonstration participants and their families,"" the statement said. Human Rights Watch estimates about a dozen Chinese citizens are still imprisoned over the June 1989 protests. The U.S. statement added: ""We renew our call for China to protect the universal human rights of all its citizens; release those who have been wrongfully detained, prosecuted, incarcerated, forcibly disappeared, or placed under house arrest; and end the ongoing harassment of human rights activists and their families."" The statement came just weeks after relations between the United States and China were strained over Chen Guangcheng, the blind human rights activist who escaped house arrest and sought refuge in the U.S. Now studying law at a university in New York, Chen claims he and his family suffered ""beyond imagination"" at the hands of local officials during 18 months of house arrest in his village of Dongshigu in Shandong. Before that, he was imprisoned for four years for ""damaging property and organizing a mob to disturb traffic"" after campaigning to win more rights for village residents. Chen weighed in on the June 4 anniversary by writing a message to be read to the tens of thousands of people expected to gather Monday in Victoria Park in Hong Kong. ""This Democracy Movement deserves universal approval,"" he said in the statement. ""We ask that its requests be treated appropriately. We do not desire revenge but we want to completely reveal the truth. We are in favor of tolerance, but against forgetfulness. People who are forgetful have no future,"" he said. Chen is one of a number of activists who have been imprisoned or are currently detained for campaigning for human rights or religious freedom in Communist-led China. In the days leading up to June 4, many known pro-democracy activists were said to have been detained as a pre-emptive measure to prevent dissent. ""Many of my friends and fellow freedom fighters have been under house arrest. Especially in the last week or so, many were confined under soft detention without any freedom of movement,"" said Bob Fu, the founder of Christian human rights group ChinaAid who was student protest leader back in 1989. ""It was a tragic massacre for simply the students exercising the peaceful protest for demanding reform and anti-corruption and freedom in China,"" he said. While Tiananmen Square has become the focal point for the events of June 4, 1989, most of the casualties occurred outside the square. In the lead up to that fatal day, protests had spread beyond Beijing to cities including Shanghai, Chengdu and Guangzhou. And while students initiated the push for greater freedom, their cause was taken up by a broader section of society. In China, there was no mention of the June 4 anniversary in local newspapers on Monday. No comments on China's version of Twitter, Weibo, referred outright to the anniversary. Some users were said to be trying to evade government censors by referring to ""May 35th."" Others posted photos rather than messages, which were re-posted with the term ""RIP."" One user posted a photo of a candle with the words: ""At this moment, on the other end of the dark night, a country is celebrating their queen's 60 anniversaries as Monarch. We, on the other side of the earth however, are not allowed to light the candles."" This year, for the first time, the Hong Kong commemorations will include Chinese activist Fang Zheng, a former student activist who lost both legs when he was run over by a tank in the streets off Tiananmen Square. He spoke about his experiences while visiting a temporary museum dedicated to the crackdown in Hong Kong, a special admininstrative region of China. ""A row of tanks, three in a row, came towards us. ... I don't know whether other students encountered the tanks before me, I could have been the first one,"" he said. ""There were students in front of me as well and the tanks rushed towards us."" On the anniversary, Amnesty International also issued a statement again calling for the government to hold an ""open and independent inquiry into the events of 1989."" The rights group paid tribute to Ya Weilin, the 73-year-old father of student who was shot and killed in the 1989 crackdown. Amnesty said Ya and his wife Zhang Zhenxia spent 20 years campaigning for the government to make amends for those killed in the 1989 demonstration. In a note written just before his death, Ya complained of the government's refusal to hear his grievances about his son's death, and therefore said he would ""fight with his death."" Ya was later found hanged in a garage below his home.","China expresses ""strong dissatisfaction"" with a U.S. statement on the June 4 anniversary .

"(CNN) -- Faced with the threat of arrest, fans of an English soccer club defied police Sunday by chanting an anti-Semitic term which they claim to have appropriated in a positive manner. A section of Tottenham Hotspur supporters chanted ""Yid Army"" and ""We'll sing what we want"" at the home Premier League match against London rival West Ham -- a fixture which last season saw one of the visiting fans banned for life for performing a Nazi-style salute. Just one man was arrested this time, the UK Press Association reported, as he was taken aside by police at halftime and held on suspicion of committing a public order offense in the East Stand at White Hart Lane. Spurs fans greeted their players' entrance onto the pitch with their customary ""Yiddo"" greeting, PA reported, and sang ""Jermain Defoe, he's a Yiddo"" for the club's former West Ham striker. While last season some West Ham fans chanted ""Adolf Hitler is coming for you"" and mimicked the sound of gas chambers, this time they responded to the call of ""Yids"" with humor, replying with ""Racists! Racists"" according to PA. Tottenham's fanbase has a large Jewish contingent, and they originally called themselves ""Yid Army"" in response to anti-Semitic abuse from rival supporters. However, the use of sensitive words has sparked intense debate -- police said before the match they would arrest any offenders, but British Prime Minister David Cameron defended the Tottenham fans' chanting. ""There's a difference between Spurs fans self-describing themselves as Yids and someone calling someone a Yid as an insult,"" Cameron told the UK-based Jewish Chronicle newspaper. ""You have to be motivated by hate. Hate speech should be prosecuted -- but only when it's motivated by hate."" But Cameron's views have been dismissed as ""ludicrous"" by Race for Sport, a group which prides itself on ""promoting fairness, justice and equality within all sports."" David Neita, a spokesperson for the group and a member of the Society of Black Lawyers, says the attempt by Tottenham fans to suggest they have reclaimed the word ""is an insult to anybody's intelligence."" While Tottenham's fans may have seemingly won this battle with the police, on the pitch the club's title hopes were hit by a 3-0 defeat -- Spurs' first home reverse this season. New Zealand international defender Winston Reid scored the Hammers' first away goal of the 2013-14 campaign before Ricardo Vaz Te and Ravel Morrison, with a solo breakaway, moved their club out of the bottom three. Tottenham dropped to sixth place, three points adrift of north London rival Arsenal -- which returned to the top on goal difference above Liverpool after being held 1-1 by West Brom. Claudio Yacob headed a first-half opener, but Jack Wilshere -- criticized in midweek by manager Arsene Wenger after being seen smoking outside a nightclub -- rescued Arsenal with a deflected 63rd-minute equalizer. Chelsea, the fourth London club in action Sunday, claimed third place with a 3-1 victory at Norwich thanks to late goals from substitutes Eden Hazard and Willian. Oscar had put the Blues ahead in the fourth minute after combining with striker Demba Ba, but Anthony Pilkington gave Norwich hope with a second-half equalizer. Southampton moved into the top four after a 2-0 win at home to Swansea, with a goal in either half from winger Adam Lallana and substitute Jay Rodriguez.","Tottenham fans ignore threat of arrest after police's ""Y-word"" warning .

That is the warning from London police to fans thinking of using the word ""yid"" at Sunday's potentially explosive Premier League derby game between Tottenham and West Ham. England's Football Association recently said the word -- deemed anti-Semitic but chanted by some Spurs fans as a term of endearment -- had ""no place in our game."" Tottenham, based in North London, has a large contingent of Jewish fans, with some even calling themselves the ""Yid Army."" ""Some words -- like the 'Y' word -- which historically have been perceived by some as acceptable, cause harassment, alarm or distress to others, and people who use this language could be committing a criminal offense,"" the Metropolitan Police said in a statement on its website. Chief Superintendent Mick Johnson, Sunday's match commander, added that the decision wasn't taken lightly. ""This topic has been debated at length but our position is clear, racism and offensive language have no place in football or indeed in society,"" Johnson said. ""Those supporters who engage in such behavior should be under no illusion that they may be committing an offense and may be liable to a warning or be arrested. ""The Met has a long history of working with football clubs and the football authorities, including the FA, to educate, encourage and empower supporters to stamp out racism in football and to ensure that there is no misunderstanding about what constitutes racist language or behavior."" The authorities will be hoping the game doesn't mirror last season's fixture at White Hart Lane, when a section of away fans chanted, 'Adolf Hitler is coming for you.' A West Ham season-ticket holder was later banned for life for performing a Nazi style salute. It prompted then Hammers midfielder Yossi Benayoun, an Israeli international, to call the behavior ""embarrassing."" Tottenham sits third in the Premier League, two points behind leader and North London rival Arsenal, while goal-shy West Ham is a point above the relegation zone.","Fans using the word ""yid"" at Sunday's game between Spurs and West Ham face arrest .

"Ferguson, Missouri (CNN) -- Two months. It looks like it might be that long before a local grand jury decides whether to bring charges in the death of Michael Brown -- the loud, passionate calls for swift justice notwithstanding. The shooting of the African-American teenager by a white Ferguson, Missouri, police officer has sparked days of demonstrations and nights of often violence protests in the St. Louis suburb. St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch told CNN affiliate KMOV that his office planned to begin presenting the case to a grand jury Wednesday. The grand jury could levy significant charges against Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot and killed the 18-year-old Brown. But McCulloch suggested Wednesday that any action -- charges or no charges -- won't come any time soon. ""The aspirational time is by mid-October to have everything completed,"" the prosecutor told the station. Granted, McCulloch isn't the only law enforcement leader whose office could take action against Wilson. One other such leader -- U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder -- spent Wednesday in and around Ferguson, Missouri, talking with residents, leaders and the man charged with maintaining security in the city after nearly two weeks of unrest. The most high-profile figure in President Barack Obama's administration to visit Ferguson, Holder has stressed that the federal government is on the case and listening -- both to protesters calling for Wilson's arrest and for an end to what they describe as a heavy-handed police response, and to residents and law enforcement officers challenged with looting and violence from some in the crowd. Holder joined dozens of FBI agents who have swarmed on the eastern Missouri city, as the U.S. Justice Department's civil rights division probes the case. But for charges and a conviction in a federal civil rights case, authorities would have to prove ""racial hostility,"" according to CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, should they argue that Wilson somehow targeted Brown. Holder himself acknowledged this distinction Wednesday, saying that he hoped all of the investigative work being done has a positive impact. That said -- for all the symbolic significance of a sitting attorney general visiting the site of an active investigation -- what happens in the St. Louis County courts may more likely impact activists' bottom line: justice for Brown's family in the form of Wilson's arrest. On the local level, Missouri's governor could appoint a special prosecutor to the case in place of McCulloch. Antonio French, a St. Louis alderman who has been a protest fixture, thinks installing a special prosecutor would be smart given the African-American community's distrust of the county prosecutor and law enforcement in general. Perception equates to reality if it means that citizens don't trust McCulloch, French said. ""We're trying to restore faith in the justice system,"" said French, who claimed McCulloch's ""relationship with the African-American community has not been good for a long time."" For his part, McCulloch told KMOV that he wants the case to proceed through the grand jury ""expeditiously"" but also ""thoroughly."" ""We're not going to rush it through, and we're not going to leave anything out,"" he said. ""They will have absolutely everything that there is, every piece of paper, every photograph, every bit of physical evidence, all the forensic information."" Assuming McCulloch stays in charge and his grand jury timeline holds, French said that having weeks and weeks go by will only aggravate the situation. ""I think the people expect to see something by now,"" he said. ""And they're getting frustrated."" 5 things to know about Michael Brown's shooting . Wilson backers challenged, then whisked away . While not as large in number as previous days, protesters were out again Wednesday night. One thing different this time around: a man and a woman who held up a sign that read, ""Justice for Police Officer Wilson."" Dawn, a restaurant employee who asked not to be identified by her full name because she believed that Wilson's supporters could be endangered, said, ""We just feel like we have a First Amendment right like everyone else. If they're calling for justice, we need justice for everyone."" The man alongside her, Chuck, added: ""All our friends think we're crazy, but someone has to take a stand."" The pair quickly drew dozens of Brown family supporters, who converged and yelled at them. Yet the commotion ended quickly when the two Wilson supporters were whisked away. On Tuesday night, hours of relative calm were upended when someone threw a bottle at police. Officers -- lined up in front of businesses, wearing helms and shields -- responded by sprinting after young men. This prompted a handful of protesters to toss more bottles, glass and plastic. Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who is in charge of security, later told reporters someone threw urine on police. Complete coverage of Ferguson shooting and protests . After the chase, the number of riot police ballooned. Officers brought out dogs. One officer used pepper spray on some in the crowd. Protesters locked hands in front of a police line, and some urged the crowd to remain peaceful. Others, wearing T-shirts printed with the word ""peacekeeper,"" tried to defuse tensions. Johnson credited them for preventing further escalation. Police arrested 47 people, Johnson said, including a car full of people who he said were armed and threatened to shoot an officer. At least one officer also threatened a protester: The St. Louis County Police Department said an officer from nearby St. Ann was suspended indefinitely after pointing an assault rifle at a ""peaceful"" protester. Video showed the St. Ann officer cursing and threatening to kill a protester. Russel Honore, a retired Army general who handled crowd control in the chaos that ensued after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005, was among those critics of the law enforcement response. Looking at crowd members through the scope of a gun sends the wrong message, he said. ""You're there to protect people,"" Honore added. ""They need to sense that from you."" Holder: 'We need concrete action to change things' In his public comments, Holder has urged law enforcement to show restraint and respect people's right to protest, while he has condemned looting and violence by protesters. On Wednesday, he made it personal as well. In addition to meeting with Michael Brown's parents, Holder talked at nearby Florissant Valley Community College about his own experiences as a black man with racial profiling -- including once when police flagged him down for no apparent reason in Washington, when he was a federal prosecutor. ""We are starting here a good dialogue, but the reality is the dialogue is not enough,"" he said. ""We need concrete action to changes things in this country."" After these remarks, 27-year-old student Molyric Welch -- who said her brother died of cardiac arrest, allegedly after Ferguson police used a stun gun on him in 2011 -- credited Holder with giving her and others needed ""inspiration"" at a time when her city's future ""is blurry.""

"Grunge and glam rock are among the genres that got the nod from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as it announced its inductees for 2014. The final choices, announced Tuesday, include angst-ridden alternative rockers Nirvana and big-haired, makeup-slathered pop metal band KISS. They are joined by blue-eyed-soul hitmakers Hall and Oates, experimental artist Peter Gabriel, pop star Linda Ronstadt and folk singer Cat Stevens. Between them, the new inductees boast an impressive array of chart success and critical plaudits. Hall and Oates, Gabriel and Ronstadt have all hit No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart. Ronstadt, Nirvana and KISS have each sold more than 20 million albums. The legacy of Nirvana, who almost unwittingly brought grunge into the mainstream in the early 1990s, has been described as ""one of the most influential in rock & roll history,"" by Allmusic.com's Stephen Thomas Erlewine. The group's sound -- ""both fiery and melodic,"" per Erlewine -- proved irresistible to many rock fans, most notably with the breakthrough album ""Nevermind."" But the band's story is shrouded in sadness after lead singer Kurt Cobain, who suffered from depression and drug addiction, killed himself in 1994. Gabriel, the winner of multiple Grammy Awards, has been acclaimed for exploring electronic and world music in his varied solo career. Genesis, the progressive rock group he led in the 1970s, was already inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2010. KISS may have received mixed responses from the critics during its 1970s heyday. But the extravagantly outfitted group built a roaring fan base called the ""KISS Army"" on the back of incessant touring, pyrotechnic stage shows and several hit albums. Hard rock fans may be less impressed by the gentler sounds of some of the other inductees. Ronstadt, who emerged from the Los Angeles folk scene in the late 1960s, went on to have a glittering career that spanned a variety of styles, including country, new wave and Latin music. She won a raft of Grammy Awards and sold at least 30 million albums. Earlier this year, she told AARP that she was suffering from Parkinson's disease and could no longer ""sing a note."" British singer-songwriter Cat Stevens crafted a string of popular songs for himself and others throughout the 1970s. With hits like ""Wild World"" and ""Peace Train,"" he became a leading figure in the folk-rock scene of that era and has sold more than 15 million albums. In 1977, he made headlines by converting to Islam and changing his name to Yusuf Islam. He stepped away from the limelight of the music business for more than 20 years, before eventually returning to touring and recording. Daryl Hall and John Oates peppered the charts with hits during the 1970s and '80s, chalking up six number one singles and six platinum albums. The popularity of their blend of smooth R&B and punchy rock made them one of the most successful pop duos of all time, selling more than 13 million albums. The artists' induction ceremony into the Hall of Fame will take place April 10 at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York. Fans were able to participate in the selection of the inductees through voting. The top five artists from online public voting made it onto a ""fans' ballot"" that was tallied along with the other ballots for the Class of 2014. The inductees were chosen by a secret ballot of 600 voters, a group that includes previous inductees, music industry veterans, historians and critics. Of the five artists on the fans' ballot, three made the final cut of inductees, the Hall of Fame said. Some popular acts listed among the 16 nominees in October failed to find their way into the Hall of Fame this time around. Those who missed out include disco dynamos Chic, college radio heroes the Replacements, New Orleans funkmeisters the Meters and pioneering gangsta rappers N.W.A. Last year's class of inductees included Rush, Randy Newman, Public Enemy, Donna Summer and Quincy Jones. Alongside the six acts in the performer category for 2014, the work of Beatles manager Brian Epstein and Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham were selected for the Ahmet Ertegun Award, which recognizes recording industry professionals ""who have had a major influence on the development of rock and roll."" The Hall of Fame chose Bruce Springsteen's backup group The E Street Band for the Award for Musical Excellence. Springsteen was inducted in 1999.","The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame picks six performers as 2014 inductees .

"A man has been charged with a federal hate crime in connection with what authorities say was a racially motivated ""knockout"" assault against an elderly black man, the U.S. Justice Department said Thursday. Conrad Alvin Barrett, 27, of Katy, Texas, has been charged with one count of violating the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act. According to the federal complaint, Barrett attacked the 79-year-old man ""because of the man's race and color."" He will next appear in court Friday afternoon for a detention hearing. The suspect made a video of the attack November 24, the complaint said. In the video, he allegedly commented that ""the plan is to see if I were to hit a black person, would this be nationally televised?"" He then allegedly ""hit the man with such force that the man immediately fell to the ground. Barrett then laughed and said 'knockout,' as he ran to his vehicle and fled."" The victim suffered two jaw fractures and was hospitalized for several days, the complaint said. Barrett's attorney, George Parnham, told CNN the affidavit does not ""pull back the layers of mental health."" His client has bipolar disorder and takes medication, Parnham said in an earlier call. Parnham said he could not state whether his client carried out the attack, but, ""mental health issues definitely played a part in anything that occurred."" Barrett ""is very sorry for this person,"" Parnham said, adding that he and his client haven't had much opportunity to discuss the facts of the case. 'Knockout game' a national problem . The ""knockout game"" is an assault in which an assailant aims to knock out an unsuspecting victim with one punch. According to the Justice Department complaint, there have been ""knockout game"" incidents, some of which have been called other names, as long ago as 1992. New York police previously charged suspect Marajh Amrit with a hate crime in the alleged attack of a white Jewish man as part of a ""knockout"" game. Similar cases have been reported recently in several states, including Illinois, Missouri and Washington. ""Hate crimes tear at the fabric of entire communities,"" U.S. Acting Assistant Attorney General Jocelyn Samuels said Thursday in a Justice Department statement announcing the charge against Barrett. ""As always, the Civil Rights Division will work with our federal and state law enforcement partners to ensure that hate crimes are identified and prosecuted, and that justice is done."" Barrett, who is white, allegedly recorded himself on his cell phone attacking the man and showed the video to others, the department said. ""The complaint alleges Barrett made several videos, one in which he identifies himself and another in which he makes a racial slur. In addition, Barrett had allegedly been working up the 'courage' to play the 'knockout game' for approximately a week."" The victim's face was swollen on one side, and he has had to use a straw to drink, a nephew, Joseph Lewis, told CNN affiliate KTRK-TV in Houston. The station reported that Barrett faces up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted. Barrett told an off-duty police officer what happened and shared a video, saying he felt bad, the affidavit said. In other videos on his phone that police confiscated, Barrett used the N-word and said that African-Americans ""haven't fully experienced the blessing of evolution,"" according to the criminal complaint. ""It is unimaginable in this day and age that one could be drawn to violently attack another based on the color of their skin,"" said Special Agent in Charge Stephen Morris of the FBI's Houston office. ""We remind all citizens that we are protected under the law from such racially motivated attacks, and encourage everyone to report such crimes to the FBI."" New York case . In a separate case, New York City police on Wednesday searched for a man who allegedly punched a 33-year-old woman in the back of the head in Brooklyn in what may be a ""knockout"" assault. Despite that and other cases, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said last month that city officials haven't  seen evidence of a trend, though they are not ruling out the idea. ""The press has named it the so-called knockout game. We don't discount that that exists. It's a possibility. We've investigated and will continue to investigate,"" Kelly told reporters in late November.

"NATO's military chief warned Wednesday that Russian troops could begin moving on Ukraine within 12 hours of being given an order, amid fears that Moscow could seek to invade its eastern region. Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander Europe, also told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that with 40,000 troops massed near the border, Russia has all the components necessary to move on Ukraine. These forces are ""supported by fixed-wing aircraft, rotary aircraft, all of the logistics required in order to successfully make an incursion if they needed,"" he said. In terms of deterrence, Breedlove said NATO has a good air and sea plan and is working in the next several days on developing a land component to that reassurance. Ukraine is not a NATO member, but many countries that are members -- such Poland and the Baltic states -- have voiced their increasing anxiety about Russia's recent actions. NATO said on Tuesday that it would suspend ""all practical civilian and military cooperation"" with Russia in response to its annexation of Ukraine's southern Crimea region, which has triggered the worst East-West crisis since the Cold War. It also said it had seen no sign that Moscow is withdrawing some of its troops from the eastern Ukrainian border, as Russia has claimed. NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen, speaking in Brussels at the end of a two-day meeting of foreign ministers from the 28-member NATO bloc, said he shared Breedlove's concerns. He accused Russia of trying to intimidate Ukraine as part of an attempt to ""reestablish a Russian sphere of influence covering the former Soviet space."" Rasmussen again said Russia had a ""massive military buildup along Ukraine's borders,"" with troops in a high state of readiness, and that NATO had not seen signs of any significant reduction in that buildup. ""This is really a matter of grave concern. If Russia were to intervene further in Ukraine, I wouldn't hesitate to call it a historic mistake,"" he said. ""That would lead to further ... international isolation of Russia. It would have far-reaching consequences for relations between Russia and what we as a whole might call the Western world. It would be a miscalculation with huge strategic implications."" Urging Moscow to pull back its troops from the border, Rasmussen stressed that NATO wants to find a political and diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine. In an earlier media interview Wednesday, Breedlove said that Russia could ""roll across the country in three to five days if it wanted to,"" a NATO military official said. Russia dismisses 'Cold War' sparring . As the diplomatic back-and-forth continued Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry by phone. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Lavrov stressed the need for joint efforts to launch ""internal dialogue in Ukraine"" to reach national unity and raised concern about the decisions reached by NATO, ""which don't help the implementation of these tasks."" A senior State Department official said Kerry ""conveyed the strong support he was hearing for the people of Ukraine and the legitimate government of Ukraine"" from counterparts at the NATO meeting. He also reiterated the objective of de-escalating the crisis and called for Russian-Ukrainian government talks. A statement posted by Russia's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, quoting spokesman Aleksandr Lukashevich, dismissed NATO's words as rhetoric that harks back to the Cold War. ""The wording of the statement rather reminds us of verbal sparring of the Cold War times, while the decision itself brings us six years back, when Brussels 'froze' the work of the Russia-NATO Council,"" it said. ""It is well known how this 'freeze' ended up. NATO initiated a return to cooperation with Russia, stating an 'all-weather nature' of cooperation within the framework of the Russia-NATO Council."" The NATO ministers said on Tuesday that political dialogue in the NATO-Russia Council could continue, ""as necessary, at the ambassadorial level and above, to allow us to exchange views, first and foremost on this crisis."" They said they would review NATO's relations with Russia at their next meeting in June. Marine deployment . Within the next few days, 175 U.S. Marines from Camp Lejeune in North Carolina will begin deploying to Romania as part of an effort to beef up a Marine Corps presence in Europe for dealing with contingencies. The deployment to Romania was long planned, Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said. The Marines will become additional forces assigned to a so-called Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force headquartered in Moron, Spain. But additional forces in Romania will beef up the U.S. military presence in the region as tensions have risen over the Russian troop buildup along Ukraine's border. Romania has agreed to allow up to 600 U.S. forces on its soil at any one time. There are an additional 300 Marines in Romania as part of a longstanding bilateral training program. The Pentagon is also considering additional moves in Eastern Europe to beef up military deployment exercises. A Navy warship is expected to enter the Black Sea in the coming days for another round of port visits and exercises as part of the effort, Warren said. Kerry: Don't use energy as a weapon . Earlier Wednesday, Kerry said energy supplies must not be used as a political weapon, speaking at an EU-U.S. energy summit held in Brussels alongside the NATO talks. His remarks came after Russian energy giant Gazprom announced a hefty increase in the price of natural gas it supplies to Ukraine. Kerry, who spoke while flanked by EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton, said the European Union and United States were taking ""important steps"" to make it harder for one state to hold another hostage to energy supplies. ""No nation should use energy to stymie a people's aspirations,"" said Kerry, co-chairman of the EU-U.S. Energy Council. ""We cannot allow it to be used as a political weapon or an instrument of aggression."" Europe and the United States are working together to reduce Ukraine's reliance on Russian energy by developing alternative sources of natural gas, Kerry said. ""We're working in lockstep to help Ukraine bring natural gas in from Poland and Hungary and develop a route through Slovakia,"" he said, adding that the United States also hopes to export more natural gas in the future. At the same time, Kerry said Ukraine has committed to work to reduce consumer subsidies to make its energy market more efficient. The International Monetary Fund last week agreed to lend Ukraine up to $18 billion over the next two years in return for a package of reforms, including to its energy market. In the United States, the House of Representatives gave final congressional approval Tuesday to legislation that would provide $1 billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine and would impose sanctions on Russia for its actions in Ukraine. President Barack Obama is expected to sign the bill. ""Developments in Ukraine have brought energy security concerns to the fore and prove the need to reinforce energy security in Europe,"" said a joint statement issued by the EU-U.S. Energy Council. Kerry also spoke again Wednesday with his NATO counterparts, including Frank-Walter Steinmeier of Germany, Norway's Borge Brende, Poland's Radoslaw Sikorski and British Foreign Secretary William Hague. Gas price hike . After the increase in gas prices reported by Russian state media Tuesday, Ukraine will pay $385.50 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas, up from the previous rate of $268.50. The move, which is now in effect, ends a discount that was agreed to before Ukraine's pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted after months of street protests. Ukraine also owes $1.7 billion in unpaid natural gas bills, Gazprom chief executive Alexei Miller was quoted as saying by the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. In a move that may add to Ukraine's financial woes, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a bill Wednesday terminating Russian agreements with Ukraine over the lease of its Black Sea naval base in Crimea, RIA Novosti reported. Russia paid the Ukrainian government $530 million annually for use of the Sevastopol base, and it wrote off nearly $100 million of Kiev's debt for the right to use Ukrainian waters, according to the news agency. This deal will now come to an end. Also terminated was an agreement under which Russia gave Ukraine a $100 discount on natural gas, RIA Novosti said. This means that the price Ukraine pays is expected to rise to $485.50 per 1,000 cubic meters of gas once the Russian government issues an official resolution, it said. Far-right leader's death investigated . Separately, Ukraine's Interior Ministry released a statement about the death last month of prominent far-right activist Oleksandr Muzychko, better known as Sashko Biliy. The ministry has said that Muzychko, a leader of Right Sector, a far-right group prominent in the recent anti-government protests, had been killed in a shootout with police in the town of Rivne. Ukrainian lawmaker Oleksandr Doniy, whose constituency is in Rivne, gave a different version of events, saying the activist was dragged into a car and then shot. On Wednesday, the ministry said special forces had ""acted in accordance with the law and all their actions are concluded legitimate"" during his arrest. It said Muzychko was killed when he fired at himself. What do we know about Russia's troop buildup on Ukraine's border? Is Crimea gone? Annexation no longer the focus of Ukraine crisis .

"Mumbai's moviegoers are getting used to seeing a police-issued public service clip before the start of films, encouraging them to come forward to report crimes against women. It's a relevant message, given the regular reports of grisly gang rapes and murders roiling the nation. In the past few weeks, the north of India has experienced especially brutal violence, particularly in the state of Uttar Pradesh. On May 27, the alleged gang rape and hanging of two teenage girls, age 14 and 15, in Badaun district made headlines. Two weeks later, the body of a 45-year-old alleged gang rape victim was found hanging from a tree in Bahraich district. Since then, a 16-year-old girl was found hanged from a tree in Moradabad district, allegedly after having been raped. In Kushinagar, an 18-year-old was apparently raped by two people and dumped in a pond. And just days ago came news of another gang rape in Badaun, that of a 32-year-old woman. After the infamous December 2012 rape and death of a physiotherapy student in New Delhi, the rape of a photojournalist in Mumbai in August last year and the rapes of several foreign visitors to India, the specter of a crisis haunts India. ""Clearly, rape is nothing new,"" says Madhu Kishwar, a pioneering feminist and academic who founded Manushi, a journal on women's issues, more than 40 years ago. ""What's new is the increased brutalization of the rape victims. It's an epidemic of brutality."" Kishwar notes a heightened frustration and angst amongst young men facing limited options in life as a factor in the wave of sexual violence. Beyond that, she also points to general lawlessness in states like Uttar Pradesh, where politics is highly criminalized. Uttar Pradesh, with 200 million people, is India's most populous state and ranks fourth across all states and union territories in rape crimes. Although the number of rape cases registered in the state increased from 1563 in 2010 to 1963 in 2012, the state's conviction rate for such cases declined from 2010 to 2012, from 45.1 percent to 31.5 percent, according to data from the National Bureau of Crime Statistics (NBCS). This trend mirrors what's happening nationally. While the total number of rape cases in India registered a 12 percent increase between 2010 and 2012, the conviction rate declined from 17.1 percent to 14.3 percent, resulting in fewer convictions in 2012. (In the majority of these cases, the rape offenders were known to victims.) Yet domestic data belies this, given that in 2012, the latest year for which official data is available, 24,923 rape cases were registered nationally, according to the NBCS. This is almost certainly a reflection of the under-reporting of crimes of sexual violence. Political insensitivity is not helping to foster a climate in which victims of sexual violence feel safe coming forward. Mulayam Singh Yadav, the head of the Samajwadi Party, which governs Uttar Pradesh, courted controversy when he decried stricter punishments for rapists after laws were overhauled last year. He was quoted as suggesting that boys make such mistakes, and that rapists shouldn't be awarded the death penalty. His Australian educated son, Akhilesh Yadav, who is the state's chief minister, also misstepped. When probed by journalists about the increase in rapes in his state, he retorted in Hindi: ""It's not as though you faced danger."" The Samajwadi Party is hardly alone. Boorish politicians across party lines have made repugnant statements, including calling rape ""accidental"" and ""sometimes right, sometimes wrong."" Such thoughts reflect Indian society's deep-rooted patriarchy. We rank 132 out of 187 countries on gender inequality, according to the UNDP's Human Development Report, lower even than neighboring Pakistan. A 2014 report by Dasra, a Mumbai based philanthropic foundation says that almost 70 percent of women in India face some form of domestic violence. In their book ""An Uncertain Glory,"" economists Amartya Sen and Jean Dreze write that Indian women's participation in the workforce beyond the home ""remains extremely low by international standards, and shows little sign of increasing"" -- a situation attributed in part to ""negative social attitudes towards women's work outside the household."" Poverty and poor sanitation are a blight on India. Forty percent of schools in India do not have separate toilets for girls, leading to higher school drop out rates for girls as they attain puberty and perpetuating the cycle of low female literacy. Lack of access to toilets plays a role in making women vulnerable to assaults. The two teenage cousins killed in the Badaun assaults had stepped out to relieve themselves when they were abducted. Caste oppression also continues to be a real issue. In Uttar Pradesh, caste certainly played a factor in some of the crimes, which reflected a pattern of higher caste men feeling entitled to victimize lower caste victims with relative impunity. But, as is often the case with all things Indian, generalizations have their limits. The rape of a photojournalist in Mumbai last August had nothing to do with caste and everything to do with young men attacking a woman for sport. ""Each case has to be looked at individually,"" says Kishwar. ""It would be a mistake to lump them all into one group."" How, then, do we restore faith in our society and tackle this menace? For a start, Indians have to shift our cultural mindset. We must give women wider berth in employment opportunities to foster economic independence. The idea of woman as personal property, which leads to a sense of male entitlement, has to be eradicated. Marital rape, currently not legally recognized, must be criminalized. In the short-term, we need better law enforcement. The police need to step up their game nationally, but especially in places like beleaguered Uttar Pradesh. Victims should be encouraged to come forward to report crimes with the expectation they will be treated with care. More policewomen need to be recruited, and dedicated cells for violent sexual crimes must be the norm in police stations. Mandatory gender sensitivity training and quicker response times to crimes should be built into police performance evaluation. Conviction rates need to go up, but justice also needs to be timely. Indians recently took pride in peacefully electing a new government, one that took the reins in New Delhi promising change. A priority for them in delivering on that promise must be to ensure women's security.","Northern India has experienced especially brutal violence, with a spate of brutal rapes .

"Two Spanish journalists held more than six months in Syria arrived home Sunday, Spain's El Mundo newspaper reported. El Mundo staff correspondent Javier Espinosa and freelance photographer Ricardo Garcia Vilanova embraced family and friends during a joyous reunion on the tarmac of the Torrejon de Ardoz military airport in Madrid. ""We want to thank everyone who has worried about us and who has made it possible for us to return home, and as you can see, we are perfectly well,""  Espinosa told those gathered at the airport. They were later met with a standing ovation and tears by colleagues in the El Mundo newsroom, according to the newspaper. ""Thank you so much,"" Espinosa said. ""I'm sorry for what we have made you go through."" El Mundo reported early Sunday that the men had been handed over to authorities in Turkey, and showed a picture of them together in apparent good health and spirits at the airport in Beirut. It did not go into detail about how they were freed. The two journalists were kidnapped in September. Garcia was traveling with Espinosa but not on assignment for El Mundo. Espinosa, 49, and Garcia, 42, have made numerous trips to war-torn Syria, often together, and they organized their most recent visit together, foreign editor Ana Alonso earlier told CNN. Garcia has also worked with CNN's Nick Paton Walsh on a number of stories about Syria. Espinosa was previously kidnapped while covering a conflict in Sierra Leone, and Garcia was kidnapped in 2012 in Syria for about 12 days, said Gervasio Sanchez, a Spanish veteran war photographer who knows both men. The newspaper reported in December the men were kidnapped at the Tal Abyad checkpoint in Raqqa province, close to the Turkish border, as they prepared to leave Syria after two weeks of coverage. At the time, the paper said the journalists' captors were reported to be members of a group linked to the al Qaeda-backed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and had not revealed demands to free the two. Initially, the captors said they wanted to ensure the two journalists were not spies, El Mundo said. The journalists were traveling with four fighters from the Free Syrian Army, who were also kidnapped, but released 12 days later. The fighters were supposed to have provided protection to the Spaniards, the newspaper reported. In 2012, Espinosa was in the same makeshift press center in Baba Amr, Homs province, where correspondent Marie Colvin of The Sunday Times of London and French photographer Remi Ochlik were killed.","The two journalists embrace family and friends during a joyous reunion in Madrid .

"Four French journalists who had been held hostage in Syria for 10 months have been released, the French President's office said Saturday. Edouard Elias, Didier François, Nicolas Henin and Pierre Torres are in good health despite the tough conditions they endured during their captivity, the Elysee Palace said in a statement. Turkish broadcaster DHA aired video of the released journalists after they arrived in Turkey. They are expected to return to France in the coming hours, the Elysee Palace said. French President Francois Hollande learned of the journalists' release with ""great relief,"" the statement said. The four men had been held since June last year. Two of them, Francois, a reporter, and Elias, a photographer, were on assignment in Syria for French radio station Europe 1. The pair went missing on June 6 while en route to Aleppo, having crossed the border from Turkey, the station said at the time. Reporter Henin and photographer Torres were taken hostage a short time later, on June 22, the French Foreign Ministry said last October. Henin was working on assignment for Le Point magazine and the TV channel Arte, while Torres was there to cover municipal elections, the ministry said. Denis Olivennes, chief executive of Europe 1, tweeted Saturday of his ""immense joy"" at the release of all four journalists and thanked all those who had brought about their release from captivity. Syria remained the most deadly place for journalists on the job in 2013, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The conflict claimed the lives of at least 29 journalists in 2013, according to its annual report, taking the total number killed covering the war to at least 63, including some who died over the border in Lebanon or Turkey. ""The huge number of deaths in Syria does not tell the complete story of the danger there, given an unprecedented number of kidnappings,"" the group adds. ""About 60 journalists were abducted at least briefly during the year, according to CPJ research, and about 30 are currently missing."" 2 Spanish journalists kidnapped in Syria arrive home .","Four French journalists held in Syria since June are free, French President's office says .

"A 30-day rape sentence given to a teacher who admitted to raping his 14-year-old student may be illegal, according to the Montana judge who imposed it. The judge scheduled a new hearing for Friday. ""The Defendant shall be present at argument as the Court, if necessary and appropriate, will amend the mandatory minimum portion of the sentence,"" read a court order filed Tuesday. It appears the mandatory minimum is two years, not 30 days, the order said. ""In this Court's opinion, imposing a sentence which suspends more than the mandatory minimum would be an illegal sentence,"" it continued. The case drew widespread attention when District Judge G. Todd Baugh imposed the 30-day sentence on Stacey Dean Rambold and made controversial comments about the victim, saying she ""seemed older than her chronological age."" Scott Twito, a prosecutor with the Yellowstone County attorney's office, did not immediately return a call for comment. In a memo from his office to the Montana attorney general's office, attorneys had argued the relevant statute was ""misapplied and the minimum sentence that could be imposed in Rambold's case was two years"" -- anticipating the judge's Tuesday order. Rambold admitted to raping the girl while he was her teacher at her high school. Cherice Moralez was 14 at the time. She took her own life shortly before her 17th birthday. Who was Cherice Moralez? Case details . The case began in 2008 when Cherice was a student at Billings Senior High School and Rambold, then 49, was a teacher. School officials learned of the relationship, and Rambold resigned. Authorities charged Rambold with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent. As the case wound its way through the legal system, Cherice committed suicide. She was a few weeks shy of her 17th birthday. With her death, prosecutors entered into what is known as a ""deferred prosecution agreement"" with Rambold. This meant that all charges against Rambold would be dismissed if he completed a sex-offender treatment program and met other requirements. One of them was to have no contact with children. Rambold admitted to one of the rape charges. But the ex-teacher fell short of the agreement. ""He had some contacts with nieces and nephews in a family setting and other adults were present,"" Baugh said. He also had relationships with women that he didn't tell his counselors about. ""That is a violation from his deferred prosecution so he was dropped from the plan,"" said the judge. As a result, the case was revived in December 2012. Canadian teen commits suicide after alleged rape . The hearing . At a hearing last month, Baugh ruled that Rambold's infractions weren't serious enough. ""He made some violations of his treatment program,"" he said. ""They were more technical and not the kind you would send someone to prison for."" He sentenced Rambold to 15 years in prison. Then, he suspended all but 31 days of the sentence, according to the Yellowstone County District Court. The judge gave Rambold credit for one day he spent in jail. Incredulous at what had happened, the victim's mother, Auliea Hanlon, shouted at the court, ""You people suck."" ""She wasn't even old enough to get a driver's license,"" Hanlon said in a statement released by her attorney. ""But Judge Baugh, who never met our daughter, justified the paltry sentence saying she was older than her chronological age. I guess somehow it makes a rape more acceptable if you blame the victim, even if she was only 14."" NYC police: Teacher accused of raping 10-year-old student .","District Judge G.

"The law passed at the height of America's civil rights movement, when citizens in parts of the country were fighting each other and sometimes authorities over how skin color impacts a person's place in a democracy. Now, its present and future are in doubt after the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision Tuesday that key parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 are no longer valid. The prevailing opinion leaves it to a divided Congress to revise the law, so that it's constitutional in the minds of a majority of justices. The main reason for the ruling, Chief Justice John Roberts explained, was that ""our country has changed"" for the better. Deplorable conditions that spurred Congress five decades ago to require certain parts of the United States to ""preclear"" changes to voting laws ""no longer characterize voting in the covered jurisdictions."" The formula that Congress enacted as recently as 2006, to determine which areas are covered by the act, has ""no logical relation to the present day,"" Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. ""While any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy the problem speaks to the current conditions,"" he said. Read the ruling . Officials hailed the decision in places such as Selma and Shelby County, Alabama, which raised the case when it sued the federal government. But President Barack Obama did not, nor did civil rights leaders. John Lewis is one of them. Born to sharecroppers in Alabama in 1940, he became a leader in the civil rights movement, working with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and others. In March 1965, he led hundreds protesting voting rights in Alabama when they were confronted by Alabama authorities after crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma -- an incident that became known as ""Bloody Sunday."" Long a U.S. representative from Georgia, Lewis said what happened then is relevant now, and he claimed ""numerous attempts to impede voting rights"" nationwide still need to be addressed. To him, the high court decision -- which he said ""stuck a dagger into the heart of the Voting Rights Act"" -- is personal. ""These men never stood in unmovable lines,"" said Lewis of the justices, referring to voter registration ques that never moved. ""They were never denied the right to participate in the democratic process. They were never beaten, jailed, run off their farms or fired from their jobs. ""No one they knew died simply trying to register to vote. They are not the victims of gerrymandering or contemporary unjust schemes to maneuver them out of their constitutional rights."" What the ruling says . Tuesday's ruling doesn't change the fact it's still illegal to discriminate against a person when it comes to voting. But it does change how some governments have been singled out. Unlike the rest of the nation, these municipalities, counties and states have had to get the federal government's approval first before they made any changes to their voting laws and regulations. Civil rights groups say the Voting Rights Act -- specifically Section 5, the mechanism for the special treatment for some locales -- has been an important tool in protecting minority voters from governments with a history of setting unfair barriers to the polls. Lewis recalled some Tuesday, such as devious ""literacy tests"" or asking people to figure ""the number of jelly beans in a jar."" ""My own father, my own mother, my grandparents could not register to vote simply because of the color of their skin,"" he told CNN. In her dissenting opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out that Congress passed the latest installment of the Voting Rights Act with ""overwhelming bipartisan support,"" saying the representatives legitimately exercised their constitutional powers in doing so. ""The sad irony of today's decision lies in (the court's) utter failure to grasp why the (law) has proven effective,"" Ginsburg wrote. Opinion: How segregation got busted . But her view didn't rule the day. Instead, the ruling decision overturned critical aspects of the law. Specifically, Section 4 -- the formula  the federal government uses to determine which states and counties are subject to continued oversight -- was struck down. Roberts said that formula, which was devised in 1972 and later reauthorized by Congress, is outdated and unworkable. That means Section 5 effectively cannot be enforced. It relies heavily on the coverage formula to determine which governments must still run any changes by the U.S. Justice Department. In his ruling opinion, Roberts faulted Congress for not updating ""the coverage formula"" last decade to reflect changing times. ""Its failure leaves us today with no choice but to declare Section 4 unconstitutional,"" he wrote. ""The formula in that section can no longer be used as a basis for subjecting jurisdictions to preclearance."" As Roberts noted, this doesn't make discrimination against voters legal, all of a sudden. But it does lift a key barrier to authorities in some states to make changes independently. Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, for one, announced Tuesday that after the decision ""the state's voter ID law will take effect immediately (and) redistricting maps passed by the Llegislature may also take effect without approval from the federal government."" ""That basically gives a green light to these nine Southern states and a handful of other jurisdictions to change the law any way they want and basically say to the Justice Department, 'Catch me if you can,'"" explained CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""It looks like these Southern states are going to start making changes. And we'll see how that's going to affect the right to vote in the relatively near future."" Should every state, county be treated the same? The Obama administration points out some governments have gotten out of Section 5 under the now old rules. For example, 31 cities and counties and Virginia successfully petitioned to be exempt from the preclearance requirements in recent years, though the rest of the state remains under federal oversight. The law had been working in preventing ""discriminatory voting changes,"" Attorney General Eric Holder said. Specifically, he mentioned how it blocked Texas from adopting a new congressional redistricting map that would have ""discriminated against Latino voters."" Holder also said the Voting Rights Act changed how South Carolina will implement a law requiring photo identification before being allowed to vote. Those changes, he said, protected black voters who would have been ""disproportionately"" affected. Obama characterized Tuesday's ruling as a ""setback,"" even as he vowed his ""administration will continue to do everything in its power to ensure a fair and equal voting process."" Voting discrimination, he said, still exists, and the decision ""upsets decades of well-established practices that help make sure voting is fair."" Others offered even stronger language. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York called Tuesday's decision a ""devastating blow for civil rights and voting rights;"" New York  Gov. Andrew Cuomo described it as ""deeply troubling;"" and NAACP President Ben Jealous called the decision ""outrageous,"" because it makes minority voters ""more vulnerable to the flood of attacks we have seen in recent years."" Rep. Marcia Fudge, chairwoman of the Black Congressional Caucus -- in a statement that included remarks from the heads of Hispanic and Asian groups in Congress -- slammed the high court for its choice ""to ignore"" reports that"" racial discrimination in voting districts continues to exist."" But the sentiments were markedly different in Alabama, where Gov. Robert Bentley said the decision ""reflects how conditions have improved."" ""The justices correctly acknowledged that the covered jurisdictions should no longer be punished by the federal government for conditions that existed over 40 years ago,"" said Frank Ellis, the county attorney for Shelby County, where 11% of residents are African-American compared to 28% statewide. ""The South is an altogether different place than it was in 1965."" Edward Blum, a conservative and director of the Project on Fair Representation, said Tuesday he's happy that no government is now singled out. ""This decision restores an important constitutional order to our system of government,"" he said. ""And that requires that all 50 states and every jurisdiction have the laws applied equally to them.""

"A veteran Spanish war correspondent has been kidnapped by insurgents in Syria, his newspaper reported Tuesday. The reporter, Marc Marginedas, has been missing since Sept. 4, the last day that he contacted the newspaper, El Periodico de Catalunya, which is based in Barcelona. The newspaper reported that it appears that Marginedas, 46, was kidnapped by jihadi combatants near the city of Hama, in western Syria. ""According to various sources, Marginedas was traveling by car with his driver when they were intercepted by jihadi combatants,"" the newspaper said. ""Since then, it has not been possible to contact him."" No group in Syria has claimed responsibility for his kidnapping, it said. Marginedas has reported from conflict zones in Afghanistan, Iraq, Chechnya, Lebanon, Darfur and Algeria. This was his third trip to Syria since the civil war began there in 2011, the newspaper said. It is the first time in his long career as a war correspondent that he's been kidnapped, the newspaper's communications director, Montserrat Baldoma, said by phone from Barcelona. A dangerous place . An Amnesty International report published this year named Syria as the most dangerous place in the world for journalists. The report highlighted serious abuses committed by government and opposition forces against professional and citizen journalists, both Syrian and international. Marginedas entered Syria on Sept. 1 through Reyhanli, in southern Turkey, accompanied by fighters from the Free Syrian Army, who are trying to topple Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the newspaper said. He sent his last story to the paper on September 2 from Qasr ibn Wardan, near Hama, reporting on the disappointment among rebel fighters that a potential U.S. military strike on Syria -- in retaliation for the chemical weapons attack there on August 21 -- seemed to be growing more remote. Baldoma said the newspaper ""waited a prudent time"" before announcing Marginedas' kidnapping publicly on Tuesday. El Periodico de Catalunya has been working to secure his release, Baldoma said. Earlier this month, a veteran Italian war correspondent was released after being held captive in Syria for several months.","Marc Marginedas hasn't been in touch with his newspaper since Sept. 4 .

"(CNN) -- Watching the returns in key congressional and gubernatorial races on election night, you might be forgiven for thinking the 2014 midterm elections were a slam dunk for Republicans, with voters roundly endorsing not only conservative candidates but also conservative ideas. But that means you haven't paid attention to the ballot measures. In votes on everything from ""fetal personhood"" amendments to the minimum wage, voters even in the reddest of red states sided with the progressive camp. As Ben Casselman of FiveThirtyEight succinctly summed it up in an Election Night tweet: ""So voters want a higher minimum wage, legal pot, abortion access and GOP representation. Ok then."" Here's a look at the befuddling outcomes in ballot measure contests, contrasted with the other results on Election Night, and what they might portend for the future. Minimum wage . Voters in three states -- Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota -- voted to approve increases in their state minimum wage rates. In Nebraska, for instance, voters decided to raise the state minimum wage from the current federal minimum of just $7.25 an hour to $8.00 in 2015 and $9.00 in 2016. In South Dakota, voters approved a measure to raise the federal minimum wage up to $8.50 next year, and after that have their minimum wage increase with inflation. Voters in Alaska are also expected to approve a similar measure. And in Illinois, voters backed a nonbinding measure encouraging lawmakers to raise the minimum wage in that state. This happened even as the same voters chose to send Republicans to Washington and their state capitols -- the same Republicans who have been blocking minimum wage legislation. Confused? Perhaps the voters were, too. For instance, in Alaska, enthusiasm for raising the minimum wage was so strong going into the election that Republican Senate candidate Dan Sullivan reversed his previous position opposing the minimum wage hike and came out in support of the ballot measure. As Katrina vanden Heuvel wrote in the Washington Post, anticipating these votes, ""It shows, once again, that the American people want to see genuinely progressive reforms"" -- even when, vexingly, they aren't voting for progressive candidates. Marijuana legalization . Either because Snoop Dogg is the most influential political voice in America or because weed is really, really popular -- or maybe both -- Oregon and Washington, D.C., both passed ballot measures to legalize the use and possession of small amounts of marijuana. Voters in Alaska were expected to approve a similar measure. Meanwhile, voters in at least three Michigan cities backed measures to remove fines for small amounts of marijuana possession (as have other Michigan cities in past elections). And while voters in Lewiston, Maine, voted against pot legalization, the city of South Portland just down the road voted to endorse legalization. The main buzz kill was in Florida, where a constitutional amendment to legalize medical marijuana failed to garner the 60% of votes needed to pass. The measure got just 58% support. And finally in Washington state, where weed is already legal, voters debated the next burning topic: how to tax it. As of this writing, the results of the Washington measure were, let's just say, hazy. Restrictions on pregnant women . It's distinctly possible that conservatives in Colorado were high when the proposed a so-called ""fetal personhood"" ballot measure. Similar measures already failed on the ballot in 2008 and 2010 but that didn't stop extremists from trying again. They put a measure on the ballot to amend the Colorado state constitution to include fetuses in the definition of ""person"" and ""child"" in the state's criminal code, a change that would unleash all kinds of dangerous ramifications not only for reproductive freedom in the state, but for fertility treatments, birth control and the basic rights of pregnant women. Thankfully, yet again, Colorado's ""personhood"" amendment failed by an almost 2-to-1 margin. Oddly, Colorado voters elected Republican Cory Gardner, who co-sponsored and defended similar ""personhood"" legislation -- though Gardner tried to run away from his anti-abortion stance late in the race. Also Tuesday night, a similar measure to restrict the rights of pregnant women was struck down by a roughly 2-to-1 margin in North Dakota -- a state that Mitt Romney won in 2012 by a similar margin. In Tennessee, by a 54-46% margin, voters did approve a measure to modify the state's constitution to explicitly restrict abortion rights and give state legislators unfettered power to regulate -- and ban -- abortion services. There are already stringent restrictions on abortion in Tennessee but not codified in the state's constitution. Now the state constitution designed expressly to protect the rights and liberties of all Tennesseans has been severely altered to deny rights to women in the state and restrict the basic freedom to control their own bodies. Gun safety . A little over a week before the election, a student in Marysville, Washington, opened fire inside a high school, shooting five classmates. Three of the victims died, as did the shooter, who took his own life. This undoubtedly was fresh in the mind of Washington state voters as they considered two competing ballot measures in the election: one to require background checks on all gun sales, including those bought at gun shows and online, the other to prevent the state from passing any background checks measures unless or until the federal government does so first. Voters passed the first measure and rejected the second.  Polling before the vote found that support for expanding background checks increased following the shooting. Hopefully, other states won't wait for mass atrocities before enacting similar common-sense gun safety laws. Meanwhile, voters in Alabama and Mississippi passed constitutional amendments codifying the right of people in those states to ""hunt, fish and harvest wildlife."" As if doing so were somehow in jeopardy. But in the context of laws to promote safe access and ownership to guns, both measures were cast in a political context -- and both were supported by the National Rifle Association. Criminal justice reform . Voters in California backed a major change in the state's criminal justice code. Minor drug and theft charges will now be considered misdemeanors instead of felonies and come with shorter prison sentences -- a maximum of one year in jail instead of three years under current law. The change will affect 1 in 5 of those incarcerated in the state who are sentenced for minor drug possession or writing bad checks. Thousands will be able to petition to have their sentences immediately reduced. The ballot measure was supported by everyone from George Soros and his Open Society Institute to Jay Z to CNN's own Newt Gingrich, all of whom think California has better things to spend its money on than warehousing citizens for petty offenses. Gambling . Voters in Massachusetts voted not to repeal a 2011 law that allowed gambling in the state, in effect revoking the license of three already-operating casinos there. California voters looked likely to reject an off-reservation casino by one Indian tribe. And Colorado voters rejected a measure to allow expanded betting at horse tracks -- which is probably a good thing being that it's Colorado, the first state to legalize marijuana. Though it is presumably still legal for Coloradans to informally bet on whether the horses are high.","Sally Kohn: Results of ballot initiatives favored progressive outcomes,defied GOP sweep .

"The man wanted by the United States for leaking details of National Security Agency intelligence gathering says journalists have been misled into printing false claims about his legal situation, The Huffington Post reported Thursday. In an e-mailed statement to the news organization, Edward Snowden distanced himself from his father, Lon Snowden; his father's attorney, Bruce Fein; and Fein's associates, saying ""they do not possess any special knowledge regarding my situation."" ""None of them have been or are involved in my current situation, and this will not change in the future,"" the statement said. Snowden's father: 'I know my son' ""I ask journalists to understand that they do not possess any special knowledge regarding my situation or future plans, and not to exploit the tragic vacuum of my father's emotional compromise for the sake of tabloid news."" The statement was released the same day The Wall Street Journal reported that Lon Snowden's legal team does not trust his son's closest advisers: WikiLeaks and Guardian reporter Glenn Greenwald. ""I would like to correct the record: I've been fortunate to have legal advice from an international team of some of the finest lawyers in the world, and to work with journalists whose integrity and courage are beyond question,"" Snowden said in the statement. Snowden stepped forward publicly in June to claim responsibility for leaking to the media, including The Guardian, that the NSA had secretly collected and stored millions of phone records from accounts in the United States. The agency also collected information from U.S. companies on the Internet activity of overseas residents, he said. Snowden, a former NSA contractor, fled first to Hong Kong and then to Russia, where he was granted temporary asylum despite pressure from the Obama administration to return him to the United States to face charges. He has been charged with three felony counts, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act, for the leaks. The Huffington Post reported that the American Civil Liberties Union confirmed that the e-mailed statement was from Snowden. The ACLU has lauded Snowden's actions as a ""service"" to the country, and it reportedly is helping coordinate the former intelligence contractor's defense in the United States.","Edward Snowden emailed a statement to The Huffington Post .

"The West African nation of Senegal is free of Ebola, the World Health Organization declared Friday, congratulating the country on the diligence that enabled it to repel the threat. Senegal had only one case, a man who had entered the country by road from Guinea, where he'd had direct contact with an Ebola patient. The government's response included identifying and monitoring 74 close contacts made by the man for signs of infection. It also introduced prompt testing of all suspected cases, increased surveillance at entry points to Senegal and nationwide public awareness campaigns, the WHO statement said. The patient recovered from Ebola and tested negative for the virus on September 5, the statement said. He's since returned to Guinea. Since then, 42 days have passed -- double the maximum known incubation period for the virus -- without another case, allowing Senegal to be declared free of Ebola. When the case was first detected, WHO treated it as a public health emergency it said, sending a team of epidemiologists to help local health officials and international partners such as Doctors Without Borders manage the situation. ""The most important lesson for the world at large is this: An immediate, broad-based, and well-coordinated response can stop the Ebola virus, carried into a country in an infected traveler, dead in its tracks,"" WHO said. WHO sounded a note of caution, however, given that Senegal shares a border with Guinea, a hotspot for the disease along with Sierra Leone and Liberia. ""While the outbreak is now officially over, Senegal's geographical position makes the country vulnerable to additional imported cases of Ebola virus disease,"" it said.","The World Health Organization declares Senegal free from Ebola .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday revoked a permit for one of the nation's largest mountaintop removal mining projects, saying it would destroy water, wildlife and Appalachian communities in West Virginia. The controversial decision was condemned by the permit holder, Arch Coal Inc., and mining representatives, who said it would hurt industry investment and the economic recovery. But adversaries praised the ruling as ""a major victory"" for environmentalists opposed to surface -- or mountaintop-removal -- mining, which uses explosives on hilltops to expose underlying coal. The EPA invoked the Clean Water Act in killing a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for the Spruce No. 1 Mine project, proposed for a more than 2,200-acre area in Logan County, West Virginia. The agency has used that authority only 12 times since 1972. Coal industry representatives suggested politics was behind the ruling. Regulators under Republican President George W. Bush, viewed as friendly to the coal industry, approved the permit, but agencies under Democratic President Barack Obama's administration moved to veto it, prompting lawsuits. One industry leader called the ruling ""unprecedented."" The Sierra Club called it a ""historic step"" in dealing with ""this mother of all mountaintop removal coal mines."" A West Virginia mining historian, who opposes another hilltop mining project at a state historic site, said the decision could merely force the industry to deploy the more costly method of traditional shaft mining, instead of the cheaper mountaintop-removal technique. Despite industry objections, the EPA insisted ""coal and coal mining are part of our nation's energy future,"" one official said in a statement Thursday. St. Louis-based Arch Coal described the ruling as ""chilling"" to the industry and contended that the project would have infused the local economy with $250 million and 250 ""well-paying"" jobs. ""We believe this decision will have a chilling effect on future U.S. investment because every business possessing or requiring a permit under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act will fear similar overreaching by the EPA,"" Arch Coal spokeswoman Kim Link said in a statement. ""It's a risk many businesses cannot afford to take. ""We remain shocked and dismayed at EPA's continued onslaught with respect to this validly issued permit."" Arch will ""vigorously"" defend the permit, now in court, and assert its right to have a predictable regulatory environment, Link said. In response, the EPA said that 100,000 projects are approved by the corps every year, translating to millions of permits during the 39 years of the Clean Water Act. The EPA has only twice revoked a permit under the section cited by the coal firm and added in its statement that the large scale and nature of the Arch permit are issues ""unlikely to be repeated for other permitted Appalachian surface coal mining projects."" ""Despite EPA's willingness to consider alternatives, the company did not offer any new proposed mining configurations in response to EPA's concerns based on science and the law,"" the agency statement said. ""We don't think people in West Virginia have to make the false choice between healthy waters and a healthy economy. They can have both."" The plaintiff who began the fight to stop the mine, 70-year-old Jimmy Weekley, told CNN on Thursday that he was elated at the decision. Weekley sued the government in 1998 for issuing the permit, saying Pigeonroost Hollow, where he lives, would be obliterated by the mine. ""They did the right thing, the EPA did. Thank God for that,"" Weekley told CNN, whose news crew was interviewing him when he received word of the ruling. Weekley became tearful. ""This is another victory. They were fixing to destroy this,"" he said, referring to his property in Blair, West Virginia. ""I hope it's considered that all mountaintop removal permits will now stop,"" he said. That hope is what triggers fear among industry leaders and the coal-mining families of West Virginia. ""It's absolutely mind-boggling to grasp,"" said Linda Dials, 51, of Clothier, West Virginia. Her husband, James Dials, 48, is a surface miner, and his job is now in jeopardy, she said. The Dials are three-generation mining family. James Dials' father and grandfather were traditional underground miners, and Linda Dials' grandfather was a similar miner, she said. Her family lives seven miles from the Spruce No. 1 Mine project, she said. ""This is just one permit. What's going to stop them from taking back the rest of them,"" Linda Dials told CNN. ""Right now, the thought that goes through your head is what job in coal mining is safe at this point, as far as your permits and stuff go. If they can take one, they can take them all."" Bill Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Association, said he found the decision ""absolutely awful news from an American standpoint and a mining standpoint."" ""This is an example of arrogance on the part of the federal government,"" Raney said. ""This permit was issued with all agencies agreeing on it four years ago, including the EPA. Then today they come in and say we're not going to have that permit. It's not right. It's like revoking a driver's license after it's issued."" Karen Harbert, president and CEO of the Institute for 21st Century Energy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said the EPA decision ""sends a very unsettling message to American businesses."" ""EPA's unprecedented action to retroactively deny a permit changes the rules not just in the middle of the game, but at the end of it,"" Harbert said in a statement. ""This is exactly the kind of practice that will keep capital on the sidelines and slow our economic recovery. The negative impact of this decision will be felt not only by West Virginians and the energy industry but across all sectors of our economy."" C. Belmont Keeney, a history instructor at Southern West Virginia Community and Technical College in Logan, said the decision was ""a major victory for environmentalists,"" but ""it's not going to end coal mining,"" as some might suggest. Hilltop mining is cheaper because it employs fewer miners, and the EPA decision may force the industry to deploy traditional underground methods, which are more labor-intensive, Keeney said. ""It's going to affect profits because mountaintop removal is the cheapest way to get coal,"" Keeney told CNN. A historian of West Virginia coal mining, he's a member of Friends of Blair Mountain, which opposes any surface mining at the site of 15,000-miner revolt in 1921 that included his great-grandfather, who was charged with treason, which was later dropped. ""It's very difficult to prophesize what will happen,"" Keeney said. ""It depends on how the coal companies will react. Will they be more conciliatory and willing to work with environmental groups or are they going to entrench themselves and draw battle lines?"" In its decision, the EPA acted under the law and used ""the best science"" in determining that the mine ""would use destructive and unsustainable mining practices that jeopardize the health of Appalachian communities and clean water on which they depend,"" EPA Assistant Administrator for Water Peter S. Silva said in a statement. ""Coal and coal mining are part of our nation's energy future, and EPA has worked with companies to design mining operations that adequately protect our nation's waters,"" Silva said. ""We have a responsibility under the law to protect water quality and safeguard the people who rely on clean water."" The EPA said it believes that mining companies can design their operations to make them more sustainable and compliant with the law. The agency cited as an example a mining company it worked closely with last year to eliminate nearly 50 percent of its water impacts and reduce contamination while increasing coal production. In vetoing the permit, the agency said the mine would have created 110 million cubic yards of waste from blasting more than 2,200 acres of mountains and forests. The waste would have buried more than six miles of high-quality streams in Logan County, killing fish, small invertebrates, salamanders and other wildlife, the agency said. The mining operation would have tainted downstream waters with toxic levels of selenium, which turn fresh water into salty water, the EPA said. The agency also said the mining plan ""inadequately mitigated"" environmental impacts by attempting to use storm water ditches as compensation for natural stream losses, the agency said. CNN's Robert Howell and Dave Timko contributed to this report.","An angry industry leader calls the decision ""unprecedented""

"Nutritionists have long touted the heart-healthy benefits of extra-virgin olive oil. Recently, researchers found that consuming a Mediterranean diet heavy in olive oil can help lower some heart risks. Consuming more than four tablespoons a day can significantly lower your risk of having a heart attack, suffering from a stroke or dying of heart disease, according to the recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Olive oil is high in a type of fat known as monounsaturated fat, according to the Mayo Clinic. MUFAs, as they're commonly called, can help lower your cholesterol and control insulin levels in the body. In addition to olive oil, they can be found in avocados, nuts and fatty fish. Of course, that doesn't mean you can go overboard. Even though it's made of ""healthy fats,"" olive oil is still high in calories and should be used in moderation. Here are five things you might not know about this Mediterranean staple: . It helps more than your heart. Olive oil is full of polyphenols, a type of antioxidant that helps protect your cells from damage. Certain polyphenols also have anti-inflammatory properties. Scientists have been exploring the effects these polyphenols may have on bone and digestive health as well as looking into how they could help prevent cancer. Other researchers are looking into olive oil's potential for improving cognitive function and memory. Fish oil helped save our son . Your oil may not be extra-virgin. In 2011, reporter Tom Mueller released his book ""Extra Virginity: The Sublime and Scandalous World of Olive Oil."" In it, he revealed a world of deception where low quality oils and artificial coloring were being passed off as extra-virgin olive oils to the American public. ""Virgin means made with physical processes, not with chemistry,"" Mueller told NPR. ""Essentially, you crush an olive and out drops the oil in extreme synthesis."" There are laws in Europe monitoring the use of an ""extra-virgin"" label, but the United States does not have strict regulations, according to Mueller. And when companies taint the oil, Mueller said consumers lose ""that wonderful cocktail of anti-inflammatories and antioxidants."" How you store it matters. When you're at the grocery store, look for olive oil that comes in a bottle made from dark green glass or another material that protects it from light, says Dr. John La Puma, founder of ChefMD.com. Heat and light can damage the oil by creating oxidation, which changes the beneficial chemical compounds. Store your olive oil in a room-temperature cupboard or in the refrigerator to keep it cool. A bottle of oil will last about a year on your shelf, according to the Stillwater Olive Oil Co. ""After this time, the taste and health benefits, such as Vitamin E, beta-carotene, and other phenol levels decrease dramatically,"" the company's website states. Americans buy a lot of it. Olive oil is one of the fastest-growing global industries, according to a report from Research and Markets, an international market research and data site. While Spain and Italy top the list of both producers and consumers, Americans seem to have jumped on the Mediterranean diet bandwagon in full force. The United States ranks third on the list of the world's largest olive oil consumers. But the U.S. may not be there for long, according to the report. ""It is expected that in the near future, India and China will be on the list of largest consumers of olive oil, as people have started recognizing the health benefits of olive oil and have accepted it as cooking oil,"" a release from the site says. You don't have to eat it. Olive oil beauty products are a multibillion dollar business, according to the industry website Olive Oil Source. ""What many consumers don't realize is something that people living millennia ago in ancient Greece took for granted; that extra virgin olive oil, all by itself, is one of the best beauty secrets,"" the site says. The same antioxidants that heal your internal cells may help protect your outer layer from damage. Olive oil can now be found in everything from skin moisturizers to nail care kits. If you're not ready to spring for the professional products, you can use olive oil at home to create a hair mask or as a cheap eye makeup remover.","Olive oil contains monounsaturated fats, which may help your heart .

"Pilots will need more cockpit training to become fully certified first officers for U.S. passenger and cargo airlines. The safety change ordered by Congress and imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday mainly grew out of a 2009 commuter plane crash and takes effect as attention focuses on pilot training issues around Saturday's Asiana Airlines crash in San Francisco. Co-pilots must complete 1,500 hours total time as a pilot under the new rules, which take effect August 1. Previously, first officers were required to have only a commercial pilot certificate, which requires 250 hours of flight time. The rule also requires first officers to undergo new training and testing specific to the planes they fly. ""The rule gives first officers a stronger foundation of aeronautical knowledge and experience before they fly for an air carrier,"" FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a statement. FAA to pilots: Turn off those electronic devices . Newer pilots for U.S. airlines today typically fly for regional carriers, which operate smaller jets domestically and feed bigger airlines at their hubs. Most airline cockpit crews are comprised of two pilots -- a captain and a first officer. The crash of a Colgan Air commuter plane in February 2009 outside Buffalo that killed 49 people prompted Congress to order the new rule change as well as updated regulations on crew scheduling and rest. Families of Colgan crash victims pushed hard for lawmakers to act. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) blamed pilot error and inadequate training for that accident. Questions around pilot training are also at the center of the first major U.S. airline accident since the Colgan tragedy -- the one on Saturday involving an Asiana Boeing 777 that crash-landed at San Francisco International Airport. Did Asiana pilot have enough 777 experience? The pilot at the controls, a captain, had only limited time in 777s although he was experienced at flying other Boeing and Airbus jetliners, the NTSB said, adding that it would review training and other records as part of its probe. Pilots of international airlines are not required to follow FAA training standards.","New FAA  rule will require more cockpit time and other training for first officers .

"A man charged in the ""Fast and Furious"" death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry has been extradited to the United States from Mexico, the Justice Department said. Lionel Portillo Meza was extradited Tuesday. What was 'Fast and Furious,' and what went wrong? At his arraignment in federal court in Tucson, Arizona, on Wednesday, he pleaded not guilty to a litany of charges, including first-degree murder. He is also charged with second-degree murder, conspiracy to interfere with commerce by robbery, attempted interference with commerce by robbery, using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, assault on a federal officer and possession of a firearm by a prohibited person. The ""Fast and Furious"" operation of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives began in 2009 with the purpose of tracking around 2,000 weapons intended for drug cartels. But officials couldn't track the firearms, and most are believed to have ended up with cartels and gangsters in Mexico. ""This development brings us one step closer to achieving justice for a beloved agent who paid the highest price in protecting this country,"" U.S. Attorney Laura E. Duffy of the Southern District of California said in a news release. Terry was killed in a confrontation with Portillo Meza and four others along Arizona's border with Mexico on December 14, 2010. The Terry case has been controversial because two rifles from the ""Fast and Furious"" operation were found at the scene of his death. But U.S. officials have not produced evidence proving that Terry was killed with either of those guns. In February, another man charged in the incident, Manuel Osorio-Arellanes, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He had pleaded guilty to first-degree murder.","Border Patrol agent Brian Terry was killed in 2010 .

"How terrible is it to be born a girl in the world today? The almost daily headlines about another cruel act of violence and discrimination against women -- from the kidnapping of nearly 300 school girls in Nigeria last month, to the latest gruesome stoning of a woman in Pakistan -- provide plenty of reasons to be pessimistic about women's equality and safety in today's world. The recent case of ""misogynist extremism"" in California, where a young man killed six people in ""retribution"" for all the girls who had rejected him, underscores the fact that all societies suffer from violence against women. Indeed, the World Health Organization estimates that 35% of women worldwide experience intimate-partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. A new World Bank report estimates that in some countries, the economic toll of violence against women exceeds a staggering 3% of GDP. Also shocking in the 21st century is that the leading cause of death worldwide for girls ages 15 to 19 is complication related to pregnancy and childbirth, in many cases because girls are married and bearing children before their young bodies are ready. High rates of child marriage in some countries also limit the educational opportunities and economic independence of girls. Add in a persistent preference for sons in South, East and Central Asia that has resulted in millions of ""missing girls,"" and the picture for girls today seems pretty grim. But these challenges, as daunting as they are, should not obscure the important gains that women and girls have made in recent decades -- gains that point to a much brighter future. First, the global gender gap in education has been shrinking: Between 1999 and 2009, the number of girls out of school dropped from nearly 61 million to 35 million, and equal numbers of girls and boys now complete primary school in Latin America and East Asia. In fact, around the world, women are beginning to outnumber men at the university level -- in some cases by a wide margin. Women's political participation worldwide also continues to grow. As of July 2013, 35 countries, including nine in Africa, had national parliaments with at least 30% female representatives and several countries now include quotas to ensure women's political participation. Examples of women rising to the top of their fields -- just think of Hillary Clinton, Janet Yellen, Angela Merkel, Sheryl Sandberg and others -- and on their own terms, are increasingly more common. The dire statistics we hear today about violence against women have a silver lining -- that violence is being counted -- and quantified -- which is a huge leap forward from centuries of silence and acceptance of the oppression of women. Honor crimes and sexual violence have long gone unrecorded because such behavior is tolerated, ignored, or conveniently covered up in mostly rural communities. Survivors often remain silent for fear their attackers will take revenge if they report the crime. But national and international media coverage and popular outrage are beginning to shift the dynamic. The proliferation of mobile phones and use of social media mean that violence and discrimination against women are increasingly reported. In the aftermath of the 2012 gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old female student in New Delhi, India, journalists called me asking why are we seeing such an uptick in sexual violence against women now -- is it somehow related to globalization? My response is that we simply have no data to conclude that the incidence of sexual violence in India is actually increasing -- reported incidents may be on the rise, but that could be because women, supported by male family members, are finally breaking the code of silence to denounce and prosecute their attackers. The outrage in the New Delhi case forced the Indian government to strengthen its sexual assault laws -- including making rape in some cases punishable by life in prison or the death penalty and increasing the minimum sentence for gang rape to 20 years. As depressing and disturbing as the headlines can be, news of violence, hatred, and discrimination against women is beginning to catalyze powerful change. So too is the growing body of evidence that disempowering women poses an enormous economic cost on society. There will inevitably be backlash against that change -- backlash that will take the form of deranged extremists from California to Nigeria to Pakistan -- but the momentum of positive change for women and girls in the world today is undeniable.","A woman in Pakistan was stoned to death, nearly 300 girls in Nigeria were kidnapped .

"(CNN) -- Bahrain on Tuesday warned against anti-government activity one day ahead of its plans to lift emergency laws that had allowed for a crackdown on opposition leaders, journalists and other activists. The country's Ministry of Justice warned against ""any type of activities that could affect the security or harm the national peace and safety,"" Bahrain's official news agency reported. The lifting of the emergency laws, imposed in mid-March, is thought to be an effort to signal an end to months of civil unrest stemming from the Arab Spring, a wave of anti-government demonstrations that started in Tunisia and have since roiled several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, including Egypt, Syria, Yemen and Bahrain. On Tuesday, Bahrain King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa appealed for dialogue, saying that talks with opposition groups are scheduled to begin in July. The U.S. pulled its human rights officer from the U.S. embassy in Bahrain after he became the target of a harassment campaign that senior U.S. officials say appears to have been fanned by some hard-line members of the government. Ludovic Hood, who left the country last Thursday, was for months the subject of threats and anti-Semitic slurs on a pro-government website and officially sanctioned newspapers, the officials said. Hood was scheduled to leave the country this summer, as his tour of duty was coming to a close. But senor U.S. officials said the embassy sent him home several weeks early over concern for his safety. Last week, Bahrain said it had released 515 detainees imprisoned since the state of emergency went into effect, though it is unclear how many people are in custody. The country is also set to hold parliamentary elections in September, filling seats vacated by members of the Wefaq party, Bahrain's largest Shiite opposition group, which left in protest over the crackdown. The government has since come under intense criticism by human rights groups over its detentions, including the arrest of at least two Wefaq lawmakers. It is not clear whether those opposition leaders will be permitted to take part in the September elections, though Bahrain has said in the past that all accusations about detainees will be investigated. Protesters initially took to the streets of Manama, the capital, to demand reform and the introduction of a constitutional monarchy. But some have called for the removal of the royal family, which has led the Persian Gulf state since the 18th century. Young members of the country's Shiite majority have staged protests in recent years to complain about discrimination, unemployment and corruption, issues they say the country's Sunni rulers have done little to address.","The country plans to lift emergency laws imposed since mid-March .

Authorities would say only that the Thursday afternoon holdup of the First National Bank was still under investigation a day later. But a suspect, identified by the Department of Justice as James N. Watts, was taken into custody following a high-speed chase after the robbery, and he was charged with a federal offense for possession of a firearm. According to the Illinois sex offender registry, Watts was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual abuse of an 11-year-old in 2006 and is a registered sex offender in the state, which could prohibit his possession of a firearm. Watts was arrested after abandoning a car during the chase, then being surrounded by police while he was on a railroad trestle, local authorities said.

"The December gang-rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi has stirred consciences in India in a way I have never before experienced: It has forced Indians to confront a terrible truth that for our girls and women, violence and discrimination are facts of daily life, an epidemic that, researchers say, claims nearly 2 million lives in India each year. But now the real work begins for each of us who took to the streets in protest. How do we channel the energy of those demonstrations into real solutions for our communities? I got a taste of the challenge earlier this month, when officials from the Barabanki district in Uttar Pradesh, a state adjoining New Delhi, asked if I would lead a workshop promoting teen safety and gender sensitivity for the government schools. I was disappointed to see they had invited only the heads of girls' schools. And so I accepted under one condition: that the principals of the district's boys' schools attend as well. Because if there's one thing I'm certain of it's that all the candlelight vigils, passion and protests will be in vain if we don't figure out how to make men and boys part of this growing movement to transform gender relations in my country. For more than a decade I've worked for the poverty-fighting group CARE as a community educator on health and gender issues. I've seen how the deep inequalities between women and men trap millions of Indian families in cycle of poverty. But along the way, I've also met countless men who, given an opportunity, were willing to examine and improve their behavior towards the girls and women in their lives. The fact is most people want what is best for their loved ones. Aggressive behavior toward women isn't innate. It's learned and can be unlearned. When prompted to reflect on their attitudes towards women's education, sharing domestic tasks, having girl children, and even violence, the boys and men I work with every day can and do change. Opinion: Misogyny in India: We are all guilty . Often it starts with something simple, like the laundry. I think of Ram, a man I worked with in the village of Pavaiya Viran. A husband and father with a macho job -- he drills underground pumps -- Ram attended sessions where he was given a chance to analyze gender roles in his life. He understood that men and boys are under pressure to express power and that when they feel weak or frustrated, their gut reaction is often to demonstrate power, even if that means violent or abusive behavior. Ram eventually adopted a new outlook; that truly strong men don't show power, they show care. ""Let the other men laugh at me for cooking and washing clothes,"" he told me. ""Why should my wife alone do all things?"" Now I'm not saying men doing laundry is the solution. But each time he folds the linens, Ram shows his children he respects his wife and treats her as an equal, not someone subservient. And so I kept thinking of Ram as I gathered with the group of 53 principals from boys and girls schools earlier this month. We addressed the importance of installing security cameras at school gates, assuring a woman driver or conductor is on every school bus, and having clean, working toilets at schools so girls and boys are not forced to go outside to relieve themselves. This was all necessary. But it felt like we were playing defense. Only when the educators were forced to hold a mirror up to their own lives did it feel like we were playing offense, too. Opinion: End global rape culture . Many acknowledged that it's their duty as parents and community leaders to lead the next generation by example. One principal realized he'd never even considered doing household chores, not as a boy or, now, as a husband and a father. Another vowed to make gender equity a required part of parent-teacher conferences. By the end of the session, every man and woman in the room was thinking about changing not only others but also him or herself. We have a long way to go, and not just in India. A World Health Organization global survey found that 59% of women in rural Ethiopia report being subjected to sexual violence from their intimate partner, 62% of women in Peru report physical violence at the hands of their partners and 30% of women in rural Bangladesh say their first sexual experience was forced.  The problem is not confined to the developing world either. Nearly one in five women in the United States has been raped or has experienced attempted rape. Even so, I'm confident that the Indian people can demonstrate to the world that we're not powerless in the face of some global epidemic. We can change. That starts by treating this moment not as some global airing of our dirty laundry but rather a national awakening to the reality that all of us -- girls and boys, women and men -- must do our part in cleaning it.","Suniti Neogy: Gang-rape, murder in New Delhi has forced many Indians to confront truth .

"Astronomers have found a deep azure blue planet orbiting a star 63 light years away -- the first time they've been able to determine the actual color of a planet outside our solar system, NASA and the European Space Agency said Thursday. The planet, known as HD 189733b, is a gas giant with a daytime temperature of 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit where it possibly rains liquid glass sideways amid 4,500 mph winds, NASA says. The blue color comes not from the reflection of an ocean, as on Earth, ""but rather a hazy, blow-torched atmosphere containing high clouds laced with silicate particles,"" NASA says. ""Silicates condensing in the heat could form very small drops of glass that scatter blue light more than red light."" The space agencies said astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope discovered the planet in 2005 but only now have they been able to use Hubble's observations to determine the deep blue color. The findings are in the August 1 issue of The Astrophysical Journal Letters. To deduce the planet's color, astronomers measured how much light was reflected off its surface. They used the Hubble's Space Telescope to look at the planet before, during and after it passed behind its star as it orbited. ""We saw the brightness of the whole system drop in the blue part of the spectrum when the planet passed behinds its star,"" said Tom Evans of the University of Oxford, the first author of the paper. ""From this, we can gather that the planet is blue, because the signal remained constant at the other colors we measured."" The planet is only 2.9 million miles from its parent star, so close that it is gravitationally locked, NASA says. One side always faces the star and the other side is always dark. By contrast, Mercury, the closest planet in our solar system to the sun, is 29 million miles away from the sun at its closest. In 2007, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope measured the infrared light, or heat, from the HD 189733b. It showed day side and night side temperatures differ by about 500 degrees Fahrenheit, which should cause fierce winds to roar from the day side to the night side, NASA said. The atmosphere, the space agencies say, is changeable and exotic. HD 189733b is in a class of planets called ""hot Jupiters,"" which are similar in size to the gas giants in our solar system but instead lie very close to their parent star, the European Space Agency says. ""We know that hot Jupiters are numerous throughout the universe,"" the ESA said in a statement. ""As we do not have one close to home in our own solar system, studies of planets like HD 189733b are important to help us understand these dramatic objects.""

"(CNN)Boko Haram's murderous tactics have descended to a new barbaric low. Last Saturday, a bomb strapped to a schoolgirl exploded in the center of Maiduguri in Borno state, killing at least 20 people. Then, on Sunday, two girls simultaneously blew themselves up in a market in Potiskum in Yobe state, killing three and injuring more than 40. It is clear that girls as young as 10 ​are being lined up as suicide bombers to further Boko Haram's cause. And these new bombings come as Boko Haram has also caused outrage around the  world with its indiscriminate massacre of innocent men, women and children in the towns of Baga and Doron Baga. Indeed, new photographs obtained by Amnesty International show the devastation of more than 3,​700 homes, local shops, local churches and their local schools.​ Nothing, it seems, is sacrosanct.​ Daniel Eyre, Nigeria researcher for Amnesty International, said this was the ""largest and most destructive"" Boko Haram assault his organization has ever seen. The Nigerian government estimated 150 people were killed, but some widely reported private estimates put the figure as high as 2,000. Days earlier, on January 4, 40 boys and young men, ages 10 to 23, were abducted from a village in the Nigerian state of Borno. This willful destruction of even the most innocent of lives destroys any illusion that Boko Haram will try to shield any civilian, however young or however frail, from its​ attacks and killings. As a result, this year is poised to be a year of infamy that could exceed the horrors of the last one. In November, for example, at least 120 people were killed in a bomb attack on a central mosque in Kano, the principal city of northern Nigeria. A few weeks earlier, the terror group kidnapped at least 97 people, including many children, during raids on villages in Borno state. When earlier in the year they invaded the northern village of Izghe, Boko Haram militants went door-to-door, killing any man, woman or child they came across. ​And perhaps most infamously, last year some 220 girls were abducted from Chibok by Boko Haram. Sadly, there has been no news on their whereabouts, meaning none of these families know whether their daughters are safe.​ No one knows if his or her daughter has been married off, raped, violated or even whether she is alive or dead. Every waking hour remains a nightmare for these families. Boko Haram's ever more violent and ever more vicious abuse of children as weapons of war -- as victims, as slaves and as suicide bombers -- must be addressed, because the threat is only likely to grow. After all, the group's leader, Abubakar Shekau​, who has a  $7 million ​bounty on his head​, was seen last week in a video praising the jihadists who killed 17 people in the Paris attacks.​ The Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium has described Shekau as a ""religious intellectual, yet also a gangster and vigilante as well as a mad leader."" With all this in mind, I am urging the international community to step up its pursuit, exposure and surveillance of Boko Haram and to do more to coordinate action against their cross-border incursions into Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and other countries. Following the kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls in Chibok, a special initiative for children was launched -- the safe schools ​plan. It was in response to the news that children, fearful of further terrorist attacks,​ had been staying away from school. The idea behind this is admirable -- the notion of safe schools and a universal call for every child to have the right to education, free of fear and intimidation. This plan is being put into place, and steps are being taken to fortify and guard schools, to improve security and to create a line of communication between schools and police and army. These new initiatives are backed by the Safe School Guidelines, passed by the United Nations to stop the use of schools as military targets and to ensure that they are havens free from exploitation by terrorist groups. Just as hospitals are regarded as protected under international law, so should schools.  While better fortifications will of course not ultimately stop the carnage if a terrorist group is hellbent on an attack, the deterrent effect​ of enhanced security measures offers at least a first line of defense. And it also sends the important message to parents that everything possible is being done to make schools safer for their children. Over the last few weeks, $23 million has been raised for safe schools from the international community, and in the last few days the United States and Britain have announced further help for the initiative. But we are calling on all aid agencies to support this innovative plan, one that could, if applied round the world, help children worried about the threat to their schools, in countries from Pakistan to Lebanon. It is hard for many of us in the West to imagine what it is like to be scared even to travel to school, yet too many children around the world confront that fear every day. It is time for that to change.","Gordon Brown: Boko Haram's tactics have hit a new barbaric low .

"Wednesday was a dark day for the future of books. The Department of Justice charged Apple and five large book publishers with conspiring to raise e-book prices. Three of the five publishers quickly capitulated rather than face the risk and expense of a protracted legal battle. Much of the case revolves around the decision of five of the largest six publishers to simultaneously adopt the agency pricing model immediately before Apple launched the iPad and iBookstore in April 2010. At that time, Amazon commanded about 90% of the e-book market. Amazon priced many books at $9.99 -- which was below the cost at which Amazon was paying the publisher -- in an effort to drive e-book adoption among consumers and capture market share. Publishers balked at Amazon's strategy out of concern that low prices could cannibalize their print sales, set unrealistic expectations in the minds of consumers, and lead Amazon to demand e-book price concessions from publishers. When Steve Jobs offered Apple's proposed agency pricing model to publishers, large publishers welcomed Apple's market entry because they wanted a strong counterbalance to Amazon's market dominance. Under the agency model, publishers set the prices and retailers don't discount. Critics of the agency model viewed it as an attempt to raise e-book prices. They believe retailer discounting serves an important public service. I see it differently. While I'm a big fan of discounting and price competition, I think the responsibility for pricing decisions should rest with authors and publishers. If they price fairly and competitively, customers will reward them. If they price too high, customers will migrate to lower-cost books. Most important, the agency pricing model levels the playing field for e-book retailers. It prevents deep-pocketed retailers or device makers from engaging in predatory price wars to harm competitors or discourage formation of new competitors. It would enable the marketplace to support more retailers, which would mean more bookstores promoting the joys of reading to more readers. And it would force retailers to compete on customer experience rather than price. Customers are best served when we have a vibrant e-book retailing ecosystem. For authors and publishers, the agency model provides them with greater control over the timing of their promotions and higher per-unit earnings of 70% of the list price as opposed to 50% for the conventional wholesale pricing model. It allows publishers to price their books lower -- to the benefit of customers -- and yet earn the same or greater profit. There's already indication that some publishers and authors who use the agency model are dropping prices as they compete for customers. At my company, where we distribute over 100,000 e-books on behalf of 40,000 self-published authors and small publishers, the average price of our books is about $3.41, a drop of 25% over the last 18 months. If the Justice Department prevails with its antitrust lawsuit, the decision might have unintended negative consequences for those who write, publish, sell and enjoy e-books. The government's intention to protect consumers could end up backfiring on consumers by harming retailers, authors and publishers. It could inadvertently hasten the downfall of the world's largest book publishers by forcing them to comply with onerous conditions outlined in the Justice Department's Competitive Impact Statement.  These conditions -- including restrictions on collaboration with fellow publishers and increased federal auditing and reporting requirements -- will increase publisher expenses and slow their business decisions at the very time when publishers need to become faster, nimbler competitors. I'm not normally a defender of big publishers. They price their books too high, while most of their authors earn poverty wages. They take 12 to 18 months to publish a book -- an anachronism in today's world of instant self-publishing. They often reject talented writers who don't offer the celebrity platforms of more marketable ""authors"" such as Snooki or Justin Bieber. Despite the mistakes of the largest publishers, I don't want them to go away. I want them to thrive by becoming more responsive to their customers and authors. Unfortunately, the self-inflicted wounds of large publishers have already begun to render their businesses less relevant to the future of publishing. Authors are beginning to turn their backs on traditional publishers in favor of self-publishing. Authors are now hiring their own editors, cover designers and marketing consultants. By assuming responsibility for the roles once played by publishers, authors are earning up to 70% of the list price as their e-book royalty versus the 17.5% paid by traditional publishers. They're publishing low-cost e-books that are hitting all the bestseller lists. The all-important access to distribution -- once exclusively controlled by publishers -- is now available to all self-publishing authors. The next time you see an overpriced e-book, blame the publisher but not the agency pricing model.","The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Apple and five publishers .

"A Maine judge on Friday ruled in favor of a nurse who defied a quarantine in a tense standoff with state authorities, saying local health officials failed to prove the need for a stricter order enforcing an Ebola quarantine. District Court Chief Judge Charles LaVerdiere ordered nurse Kaci Hickox, who recently returned to the United States after treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, to submit to ""direct active monitoring,"" coordinate travel with public health officials and immediately notify health authorities should symptoms appear. Another hearing is scheduled for Tuesday. Standing with her boyfriend Ted Wilbur, outside their home in Maine, Hickox told reporters the decision was a ""good compromise"" and that she would continue to comply with direct active monitoring. Ebola outbreak: Get up to speed . ""I know that Ebola is a scary disease,"" she said. ""I have seen it face-to-face. I know we are nowhere near winning this battle. We'll only win this battle as we continue this discussion, as we gain a better collective understanding about Ebola and public health, as we overcome the fear and, most importantly, as we end the outbreak that is still ongoing in West Africa today."" In a news conference with her lawyers Friday, Hickox, via Skype, expressed her support with the army of U.S. health care professionals battling the outbreak in West Africa. ""They are why I'm here,"" she said, acknowledging that she will work in Africa again. ""I hope that one day I can meet some of them at the airport and give them a big hug and let them know that we're in this together ... This is important day for public health."" Her attorney, Norman Siegel, earlier called the decision a victory. ""She won,"" he said. ""She is not quarantined. She can go out in the public. ... (The judge) got the understanding of what liberty is about and how the government can't restrict your liberty unless there is compelling justification."" At the news conference, another lawyer for Hickox, Steve Hyman, called the decision ""an indication of thoughtfulness versus irrationality"" and said his client had become ""a prisoner because of misconceptions and a whole host of irrational arguments."" Hyman said he hoped politicians applied ""the same kind of thinking and rationality"" as LaVerdiere did when dealing with Ebola. Late Thursday, the judge had ordered stricter limits on Hickox, requiring that she ""not to be present in public places,"" such as shopping centers or movie theaters, except to receive necessary health care. The temporary order permitted her to engage in ""non-congregate public activities,"" such as walking or jogging, but said she had to maintain a 3-foot distance from people. And it forbade her from leaving the municipality of Fort Kent without consulting local health authorities. In Friday's ruling, LaVerdiere praised Hickox for lending her skills ""generously, kindly and with compassion"" to ""aid, comfort and care"" for Ebola patients. ""We owe her and all professionals who give of themselves in this way a debt of gratitude,"" he wrote. While many people were acting out of fear that is not entirely rational when it comes to the deadly Ebola outbreak, the judge said that fear was present and real. The actions of Hickox, as a health professional, ""need to demonstrate her full understanding of human nature and the real fear that exist,"" LaVerdiere wrote. ""She should guide herself accordingly."" Hickox said she has been sensitive to those fears. ""This is one of the reasons I am saying this battle isn't over,"" she said. ""We need to continue this discussion. We need to continue educating ourselves and I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable. I think so far Ted and I have shown a lot of respect to this community. We care about the community."" Maine authorities wanted Hickox to stay home for 21 days -- the incubation period for the deadly virus -- although she has tested negative for the disease and has shown no symptoms. Hickox says that she is healthy and that forcing her to stay home is unconstitutional. Wilbur said isolating medical professionals returning from West Africa, the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak, affects their partners as well. ""This thing doesn't just affect Kaci,"" Wilbur told CNN affiliate WCHS. ""And when people are going to be coming home from different parts of the world and West Africa, it's just not affecting the aid workers and what not. It's affecting their partners."" 'We're not trying to push any limits' The two went out on a bike ride Thursday, trailed by a police cruiser and journalists. ""If anyone in the community might have noticed, we went bicycling that way. We did not go into town,"" Wilbur told the affiliate. He said they are not trying to cause trouble and want the community to feel at ease. ""We did not go into the grocery store. We are not trying to get anyone sick,"" he said. ""We don't believe that we can get anyone sick. We're not trying to push any limits here. We're members of this community too, and we want to make everyone feel comfortable."" Hickox's quarantine was scheduled to end on November 10. Governor: Her safety is a concern . Maine Gov. Paul LePage said venturing away from her house jeopardizes Hickox's safety. ""The reason there's a police car there when she does that is to protect her, more than anybody. 'Cause the last thing I want is for her to get hurt,"" he said. ""But at the same token, her behavior is really riling a lot of people up, and I can only do what I can do. And we're trying to protect her, but she's not acting as smart as she probably should."" At first, Maine officials said they wanted her to remain at home for 21 days. Then, they've said they wanted Hickox -- who has twice tested negative for Ebola and says she feels healthy -- to avoid public places during that time. Making a point with bike ride . Hickox has said state officials are the ones being unreasonable. She contends the U.S. Constitution and science are on her side. ""I'm fighting for something much more than myself,"" she said. ""There are so many aid workers coming back. It scares me to think how they're going to be treated and how they're going to feel."" Hickox has said she's willing to compromise with the state, and she's open to restrictions barring her from public transportation and limiting her to Fort Kent, a town of 4,000 on the Canadian border. Siegel, her attorney, said the couple went for the bike ride to highlight that she could be out in public without interacting with people. New Jersey incident . When she returned from a month working with Doctors Without Borders in Sierra Leone last week, Hickox had an elevated temperature at an airport in Newark, New Jersey, officials said. She was put into an isolation tent. She blasted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for enforcing a new policy that required anyone showing symptoms of Ebola, including an elevated temperature, to be isolated.

"An Associated Press photographer was shot to death on the eve of Afghanistan's elections in an attack that wounded the news agency's long-time reporter in the region. Anja Niedringhaus, 48, a Pulitzer Prize-winning German photographer, died in the shooting on Friday in Afghanistan's eastern Khost province, the AP said. The attack injured Kathy Gannon, a Canadian reporter based in Islamabad, who was in stable condition and getting medical treatment, according to the AP. Gannon, 60, has reported on Pakistan and Afghanistan since the 1980s. ""Anja and Kathy together have spent years in Afghanistan covering the conflict and the people there,"" said AP executive editor Kathleen Carroll, speaking in New York. ""Anja was a vibrant, dynamic journalist well-loved for her insightful photographs, her warm heart and joy for life. We are heartbroken at her loss."" In a letter to AP staff Friday morning, chief executive Gary Pruitt also praised the courage and skill of Niedringhaus, describing her as ""spirited, intrepid and fearless, with a raucous laugh that we will always remember."" White House comment . At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest said Friday that the thoughts and prayers of President Barack Obama and the first lady went out to the family of Niedringhaus. He praised the efforts of journalists from Afghanistan and around the world who risked their own safety to cover Saturday's election, the third since the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. The two women were traveling in their own vehicle in a convoy of election workers delivering ballots in Khost province, protected by the Afghan National Army and Afghan police, according to the AP. A unit commander walked up to their car at one point, yelled ""Allahu akbar"" -- ""God is great"" -- and opened fire on them in the back seat, the AP said. The attacker then surrendered to the other police present. The reason for the attack was unclear, but police have arrested the suspected shooter and the case was under investigation, said Baryalay Rawan, a spokesman for the Khost provincial governor. Hours later, a bomb exploded in a polling center in the province's Tanai district, about 15 kilometers (9 miles) from where the attack on the journalists occurred, Rawan said. Two people died in the bombing, including Tanai district's deputy police chief, and three were injured, he said. The attacks came amid heightened security for the nation's presidential and provincial elections on Saturday. Afghanistan's election marks the first democratic handover of power in the fragile country, with current President Hamid Karzai -- who is term-limited by the constitution -- handing over the reins. Karzai was chosen by Afghan leaders to head the country after the fall of the Taliban, and won two subsequent presidential elections in 2004 and 2009. Taliban disruption . The Taliban have vowed to disrupt the elections and punish anyone involved in them. A series of attacks in the capital, Kabul, and elsewhere has marred the run-up to voting. Pakistan's military said Friday that all border crossing points with Afghanistan were closed for Saturday's election. Taliban militants in the mountainous border region have launched attacks in Afghanistan. On Wednesday, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance gate to the Interior Ministry in Kabul, killing six Afghan police officers, Interior Ministry spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. A day earlier, a provincial council candidate and nine of his supporters were killed by the Taliban in northern Sar-e-Pul province, said the province's deputy police chief, Sakhidad Haidari. Last month, Sardar Ahmad, one of Afghanistan's most prominent journalists and a senior reporter for Agence France-Presse, was among nine people killed in an attack on the Serena Hotel in central Kabul. Less than two weeks earlier, Swedish Radio correspondent Nils Horner was shot dead in broad daylight on a Kabul street. In his letter to AP staff, Pruitt said: ""As conflict spreads throughout regions of the world, journalism has become more dangerous. Where once reporters and photographers were seen as the impartial eyes and ears of crucial information, today they are often targets."" The Committee to Protect Journalists highlighted the risks faced by journalists in Afghanistan, particularly women, in a piece published in February. Some fear those risks may increase with the planned withdrawal of NATO combat forces, including U.S. troops, by the end of the year. Changed mission? The NATO-led International Security Assistance Force had just over 51,000 troops, from 48 different countries, in Afghanistan as of Tuesday. The majority -- about 33,500 -- are from the United States. Karzai has refused to sign an agreement to keep foreign security troops in the country after 2014. But Gen. Philip Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander Europe, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour this week that he anticipates international forces will remain in Afghanistan after the currently scheduled withdrawal. ""I think you will see a very large ISAF combat mission changed to a smaller but continued resolute support, train, advise and assist mission at the end of the year,"" he said. ""NATO's mission doesn't end (after 2014); NATO's combat mission ends, but our train, advise, assist mission begins, and this is very important to remember."" The three leading presidential candidates -- Abdullah Abdullah, Zalmai Rassoul and Ashraf Ghani -- have told CNN that they are in favor of signing a security agreement. Abdullah, who was a vocal critic of the Taliban during their years in power, was a previous Karzai ally and served in his government as foreign minister. Contenders . In later years, he has been a thorn in the side of the outgoing President. He is seen as a relatively liberal candidate and advocate of women's engagement in public life. Rassoul is seen as the establishment candidate. A Karzai ally, he received the backing of the current President's brother, Qayum, who withdrew his candidacy and endorsed the former foreign minister. Rassoul has a reputation for honesty, despite his years in an administration plagued with accusations of graft. The third key contender, Ghani, is a former U.S. citizen and academic who gave up his passport to run for the Afghan presidency in 2009. He is seen as a moderate, with experience in development, but his past links to the United States may lessen his chances if voters consider him an outsider. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen, speaking Wednesday in Belgium, said the latest briefings from NATO commanders show that despite the Taliban's threats, overall violence across Afghanistan ""is lower now than at any time during the last two years."" Rasmussen praised the work of Afghan security forces, which have taken over many responsibilities from ISAF, saying they had ""demonstrated commitment, courage and professionalism"" during preparations for the elections.","Pakistan military increases border security with Afghanistan for election .

"Coronado, California  (CNN)Rick Perry used his final public address as Texas governor on Friday to sharply criticize President Barack Obama's stewardship of the country and called on fellow Republicans to articulate a plan to voters explaining how the GOP will turn the country around. ""What is needed at this time in history is a clear vision for the world with America leading again, and freedom on the march again,"" Perry said Friday afternoon in a speech to the Republican National Committee. ""What is on the ballot in 2016 is a choice whether we are going to ... rise to the challenge of defending Western values or accept the decline of Western civilization, because those who had the most to lose did the least to preserve freedom."" Perry, who delivered his remarks from behind a podium, reading from prepared notes, was at times halting in his speech. But he delivered heaps of political red meat to the state party leaders and activists sitting in the audience. Not once did Perry, who is considering a possible White House run, mention any of his possible opponents for the Republican nomination during his speech, and he refrained from doing so when he spoke afterward to reporters. ""I'm not going to go back and rehash the 2012 campaign,"" Perry said when asked what was Mitt Romney's biggest mistake as presidential nominee. ""I am not sure that is particularly of great utility. We need to be talking about the future and laying out a good bright vision for this country and how to get people back working again, how to get Washington to focus on the few things it needs to do and do rather well. Get our foreign policy back to where our allies know we are going to be standing with them and our enemies fear us. That is what we need to focus on."" Perry sidestepped a direct question about what type of candidate Romney would be if he decided to seek the GOP nomination again. ""Whenever someone becomes a certified official candidate I'd be more comfortable making a statement about him,"" Perry said. ""I think whether it is Jeb [Bush], or it is Mitt or whoever it might be, adding quality people to the field raises the level."" In his speech, Perry did not necessarily present policy solutions, but rather critiques of Obama on everything from the President's handling of the economy and energy policy to foreign affairs. The Texas governor specifically chastised Obama for failing to travel to France for a unity march that drew leaders from around the world, who came come together to condemn the slaying of 12 people by terrorists at Charlie Hebdo magazine. ""When leaders of the world gather to stand against terrorism, the president of the United States needs to be there and he needs to be standing in the front of that march,"" Perry said. Perry did highlight the Texas economy and held it up as an example of how jobs should be created and copied throughout the nation. ""Our formula for success is simple: Keep taxes low, implement smart regulations,"" he said. ""You have an educated workforce and stop lawsuit abuse at the courthouse. That is the formula. It is simple."" Before heading into a private reception to meet people attending the RNC's Winter Meeting, Perry, who is leaving office in a few days, was asked what his next job would be. ""I will call you when I get that all figured out,"" he said.","Outgoing Texas Gov. Rick Perry speaks to the Republican National Committee .

"Almost half of boys and one in five girls in Jordan's capital city, Amman, believe that killing a woman who has ""dishonored,"" or shamed, her family is justifiable, a study of teenagers' attitudes published Thursday revealed. A third of all teenagers involved in the study by researchers at Britain's Cambridge University advocated so-called honor murders. Exclusive: How my brother tried to kill me in 'honor attack' A key finding was that support for honor crimes was not connected to religious beliefs, but is far more likely in adolescent boys with low education backgrounds from traditional families. Professor Manuel Eisner and Cambridge graduate student Lana Ghuneim interviewed more than 850 teenagers, with an average age of 15, for the study, published in the journal Aggressive Behavior. Disappearance, then discovery leads to 'honor killing' outrage . Honor crimes can include physical assaults, rape, acid attacks and disfigurement, as well as murder. They can be triggered by a range of acts thought to bring shame on the family, from premarital sex to adultery to pregnancy outside marriage, or even contact by the woman with a man who is not a relation. The researchers say their study is one of the first to attempt to gauge cultural attitudes about honor murders in the region. It found that attitudes in support of honor murders ""are anchored in a broader system of beliefs about patriarchal authority and dominance, and assumptions about female virginity and chastity."" This means that any attempt to change views would probably need to tackle the broader cultural support for patriarchal dominance, it said. 'Honor' crime: Why just kissing a boy can trigger murder . In total, 33.4% of all those surveyed either ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" with situations depicting honor killings. Boys were more than twice as likely to support honor killings: 46.1% of boys and 22.1% of girls agreed with at least two honor killing situations in the questionnaire. About six in 10 teenagers from the lowest level of educational background showed supportive attitudes towards honor killing, as opposed to about one in five where at least one family member has a university degree. Teenagers who had a large number of siblings were more likely to condone honor killings than those from smaller families, the study found. Belief Blog: Islam doesn't justify 'honor murders,' experts insist . ""While we found the main demographic in support of HKA (honor killing attitudes) to be boys in traditional families with low levels of education, we noted substantial minorities of girls, well-educated and even irreligious teenagers who consider honor killing morally right, suggesting a persisting society-wide support for the tradition,"" said Eisner. ""Any meaningful attempt to reduce attitudes in support of such practices requires a broader societal commitment, including coherent messages against honor-related violence from political and religious elites, and decisive action by the criminal justice system."" Jordan has a long traditional of honor crimes, the researchers note, although it has taken steps in recent years to pass stricter laws against the practice. Until 2001, an article of the Jordanian Penal Code stated that a man who ""catches his wife, or one of his female close relatives committing adultery with another, and he kills wounds or injures one or both of them, is exempt from any penalty."" In line with new legislation passed since then, a special court was set up in 2009 to prosecute honor crimes, the researchers say. But their study indicates attitudes are not necessarily changing in line with new legislation, even in a younger generation.","Researchers look at attitudes about ""honor"" murders among teenagers in Amman, Jordan .

"The curtain hasn't even opened on Netflix's new DVD-by-mail spin-off company Qwikster, and many customers are already walking out. The company recently revised its quarterly projections of net subscribers to show 1 million fewer customers than it had previously expected. Much to Netflix's chagrin, folks are realizing that the king of mail-away media isn't the only game in town. We've taken a look at some of Netflix's (and Qwikster's) main competitors, and judged each service accordingly. Do the rest offer enough to stand up to the best? Netflix/Qwikster . Also known as Netflix: Redux. It's the same service we know and love, only completely different. Faced with massive customer backlash in the wake of a price hike, Netflix split itself into two separate companies this week. The streaming service will retain the Netflix branding while the DVD-by-mail service will be named Qwikster. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said the split will better serve customers in the long run because each company will be able to better focus on one type of service. Netflix pioneered the DVD-by-mail service, creating an entire industry where one did not exist previously. But after serious flux in Netflix's new pricing system — which split the streaming and DVD mailing services into two separate plans starting at $8 a month minimum — there's no guarantee the company's customers will continue to stick around. WIRED: It's been around the longest, and is the most familiar service. Massive offering of physical mail-away media. New game rental service sounds intriguing. Streaming to all iOS devices and Android smartphones. TIRED: Can you say price increase? We don't like paying more money for the same service, and we're failing to see how splitting the companies in twain is going to benefit consumers. Streaming-only service still lacks selection compared to DVD catalog. Amazon Prime . Amazon's elite-level service launched in 2005, offering two-day shipping on any of its products to members anywhere in the continental United States and other select countries for a reasonable $80 a year. Originally meant for those who couldn't wait more than 48 hours for their tangible goods, Prime expanded in February to offer instant, streaming movie and TV show access to existing Prime customers at no added cost. WIRED: Fast shipping on everything Amazon! What other movie service offers that? Lower yearly rate than Netflix and Qwikster. Works with over 100 different web-connected set-top boxes, including the ever-popular Roku. TIRED: Smaller media selection compared to other existing services. Lacks the DVD rental option that made Netflix famous. Redbox . Redbox made it possible for legions of supermarket shoppers to pick up a movie on the cheap, without having to make multiple stops. Instead of leaving the grocery store (or 7-11, Walgreens or what have you) with only a TV dinner and a Mountain Dew in tow, Redbox's 30,000-plus DVD-rental kiosks make sure you won't go home alone on a Friday night again. WIRED: Cheap, cheap, cheap. DVD rentals average two bucks a pop, with anywhere from 50 to 200 recent titles to select from in each kiosk, updated weekly. Game rentals to roll out this year. TIRED: No streaming service? Bummer. Blockbuster . Once the dominant force in the media-rental industry, Blockbuster has fared horribly over the past few years. After scoffing at Netflix's business model years ago, the big blue-and-gold company filed for bankruptcy last September. However late, Blockbuster jumped on the bandwagon with its own Netflix clone mail-away service, but with the added advantage of allowing customers to return DVDs to brick-and-mortar Blockbuster stores. And finally, Blockbuster Express is a blue-and-gold Redbox rip, with kiosks placed in grocery stores and Kwik-E-Mart's across the country. WIRED: The Dish Network acquisition could mean big things for Blockbuster when (or if) the companies get a game plan up and running. TIRED: Brick and mortar is slowly dying, so the leg-up Blockbuster has on Netflix with in-store DVD exchange may soon be moot. Ripping off its two major competitors shows a lack of ability to innovate, possibly signifying that the company is still behind the times. Hulu Plus . At $8 a month, Hulu Plus offers instant streaming access to a wealth of TV shows only a day or so after they've originally aired. But seriously, if you're paying a monthly fee, you shouldn't have to deal with mid-show commercial breaks. That's the whole point of paying for streaming service, right? Still, I challenge you to find a more comprehensive archive of Hell's Kitchen reruns on the web. WIRED: Streaming to all iOS devices and some Android smartphones and tablets. Tons of TV shows that aren't out to rent on DVD. TIRED: Despite taking your $8 monthly fee, you still have to sit through asinine commercials. ""Hundreds,"" not thousands, of movies to choose from. Again, no physical media. Rights agreements sometimes complicate how many episodes are available for viewing on the site. Android Market . Google has struggled to keep up with Apple in its media service offerings, only recently debuting its movie rental service on the Android Market in conjunction with a complete interface makeover. Fortunately, renting flicks from Google is available on all Android devices running version 2.2 and up — that's something even Hulu can't say. WIRED: Rental ain't pricey, averaging around two to five bucks a pop. Streaming to Android phones is nice. Compatible with PCs. TIRED: No physical media. Not functional across all Android tablets. iTunes and Apple TV . There's a down-payment to get Apple TV up and running in your home, and it's in the form of a small, sleek set-top box. Fortunately, it's only $100. Along with Netflix compatibility, Apple lets you purchase and rent movies from its iTunes media store, along with the ability to buy TV shows (due to lack of customer demand, Apple discontinued TV show rentals last month).

"South Africa may be the dominant force in Africa's wine economy, but as the continent's middle class emerges and disposable incomes increase, entrepreneurs in some unlikely destinations are making inroads in the fine wine industry. As the world's eighth largest wine producer, South Africa's wine trade contributed 26.2 billion rand ($2.4 billion) to the country's economy with exports increasing by more than a quarter in 2013, according to the South African Wine Industry Information and Systems. Matome Mbatha, market manager at Wines of South Africa, said that wine is becoming increasingly popular on the continent but the industry is still in its infancy outside South Africa. He added: ""The process of production and sustainability of wine in African nations, other than South Africa, still has a long way to go in order to be competitive in the global market. We are still to see another African country produce wine at the level and quality of South Africa."" By opening vineyards and chateaus across the continent, some of Africa's lesser known winemakers are hoping to challenge that assertion and South Africa's 350-year dominance of the region's wine business. From fruity Chenin Blancs to rich-berry Cabernet Sauvignons, CNN takes a look at the next generation of ""New World"" wines from some of Africa's lesser-known producers. Charlevale (Zimbabwe) Nestled in a plush Zimbabwean valley on the Nyamasanga River, the Bushman Rock Estate is one of the country's most prominent vineyards, producing a range of fine wines. The Charlevale is the winery's flagship tipple. A dry, oaked white wine blend of Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Muscat, the Charlevale has hints of fresh gooseberry and an acidic, lemony finish. Bushman Rock manager Jonathan Passaportis said a combination of high-altitude vineyards, hot summers and cool nights make land-locked Zimbabwe an ideal location for wine growing. He added: ""Whilst great wines are being made from Zimbabwean vineyards, some of which have received awards in international competitions, there is still room for growth in both quality and quantity."" Passaportis said that Zimbabwean wines are gaining recognition on the international stage as tourists visit the country's vineyards. ""Our wines have more in common with traditional European wines and yet, as is the way with our wonderful continent, the old world grape varieties have been altered by our conditions, resulting in a truly Zimbabwean wine."" Visitors to the Bushman Rock chateaux can take away a case of Charlevale and Stellagalen, a classic red Bordeaux, for $25. Leleshwa Sauvignon Blanc (Kenya) A light and tropical blend with a summery aroma, the Leleshwa Sauvignon Blanc is the Rift Valley Winery's flagship vintage. The wine is produced high up in Kenya's Rift Valley, thousands of meters above sea level, and is owned by the Kenya Nut Company. Emma Nderitu, a spokesman for the winery, said: Leleshwa is ""unique in the sense that it is thought impossible to grow vines in this region. More than that it is thought that it can't be a good quality wine."" With a growing consumer base and plans to expand around Africa, the Rift Valley Winery, which sits on the equator, is proving that good quality wine can be produced in extreme climates, according to Nderitu. But she added that the winery does not have enough volume to export to European and U.S. markets yet: ""We are currently intensively expanding our vineyards to cover 250 hectares ... we have received requests to export here but we are still at our expansion phase."" A Leleshwa Sauvignon Blanc retails in local supermarkets for about $6 and the brand's red wine for $7. Dodoma wine (Tanzania) Tanazania's Dodoma region produces three wines -- dry white, red and ""natural sweet."" Khadija Madawili, technical manager at SABMiller Tanzania, said the red wine has a smooth, rounded taste and is best with ""Nyama Choma,"" a local delicacy of roasted spiced meat, while the ""natural sweet"" wine is the perfect complement for light salads or simply enjoyed as an aperitif. The Dodoma region is home to a number of varieties including Chenin Blanc, Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon and Makutupora, a local dry red. Madawili added that the dry earth and sandy soil, combined with low humidity, is perfect for producing dry white and red wines in Dodoma. She said: ""We have two harvests seasons a year, in March and August/September. After harvest the farmers leave the plants to rest for only one month."" Ifrikia Rouge Reserve (Tunisia) With a deep maroon color and sweet aroma similar to port, Ifrikia Rouge Reserve is a Cabernet blend with a smooth flavor and a rich tangy aftertaste with hints of raspberry. Ifrikia Rouge Reserve, made by Domaine Atlas in Tunisia, is produced in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains, a series of peaks that run through northwest Africa. Just 10 kilometers from the sea, the vineyards are located in the middle of Cap Bon, a peninsula in the northeast of the country, which boasts a Mediterranean climate with wine-growing conditions similar to parts of Spain and Italy. And at $7 dollars a bottle, Ifrikia competes on cost with many of its European counterparts. Tej (Ethiopia) For something very different, but very traditional, Tej is an East African honey wine, primarily consumed in Ethiopia. The white wine, which can be either sweet or dry depending on the amount of honey used, also includes Gesho, which is a buckthorn shrub native to the Horn of Africa nation. Harry Kloman, an expert on Tej and Ethiopian cuisine, said that there are very few, if any, wineries that produce Tej as the wine tends to be homemade or served in a ""Tej Bet,"" a bar that specializes in the wine. Araya Selassie Yibrehu is one of the producers to have mastered the art of Tej brewing over the years. He said: ""Unlike other wines my Tej and Tej-based wines are all 'happy drinks' that have a delicate taste and are thirst quenching. It's a great stimulating aperitif and complement to most dishes or desserts."" Yibrehu added that sales of Tej wine are increasing internationally as social media and international wine competitions raise awareness of alternative African wines. He said: ""It has also taken tremendous effort to bring these ethnic, but ancient wines to the 21st century recognition ... Obviously, my goal is to keep producing these delicious Tej wines."" Tej costs between five to 15 Ethiopian birr (26 cents to 78 cents) locally.","South Africa is continent's biggest wine producer, but other countries also make wine .

"(CNN) -- Sorry seems to be the hardest word. The latest Ferguson confrontation isn't taking place on the streets of the beleaguered city, but between the St. Louis County Police Department and the St. Louis Rams football team -- over an apology, or lack thereof. The brouhaha started silently when five Rams players took to the field Sunday with their palms in the air -- showing the ""hands up, don't shoot"" gesture used by protesters decrying the police shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown. The St. Louis Police Officers Association was furious, saying the players ""chose to ignore the mountains of evidence released from the St. Louis County Grand Jury"" after the jurors decided not to indict former Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson. A Rams official spoke with police Monday. And that's when the he-said, he-said started. St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar sent an e-mail to his staff saying the Rams' chief operating officer called him Monday to apologize. ""I received a very nice call this morning from Mr. Kevin Demoff of the St. Louis Rams who wanted to take the opportunity to apologize to our department on behalf of the Rams for the ""Hands Up"" gesture that some players took the field with yesterday,"" Belmar wrote in the e-mail, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. But the Rams said that's just not true. ""We did not apologize,"" Rams spokesman Artis Twyman told CNN. The team issued a statement saying the organization had ""positive discussions"" Monday with Belmar and other police officials ""during which we expressed our respect for their concerns surrounding yesterday's game."" Police took issue with the Rams' saying they didn't apologize and aired their grievances on Twitter. ""Apology: 'expression of regret for not being able to do something"" @kdemoff: ""I regretted any offense their officers may have taken,'"" St. Louis County Police tweeted Monday night. The Rams didn't respond to the digital jab. But others sure did. ""You guys should be more petty,"" one person tweeted. ""You're acting like five year olds. Grow up,"" another wrote. Police leaders meet with Rams officials . Aside from the semantics of the phone call, leaders from the St. Louis Police Officers Association and the St. Louis County Police Association met with team officials Monday. The talks were ""productive but very preliminary,"" police said. They are expected to continue later in the week. ""We made some progress today and we had a healthy interaction with the Rams,"" SLPOA business manager Jeff Roorda said in a statement after the meeting. ""We feel strongly that they better understand our perspective and the perspective of the law-abiding citizens that support law enforcement."" The Rams also issued a statement, saying the team will ""continue to build on what have always been strong and valued relationships with local law enforcement and the greater St. Louis community as we come together to help heal our region."" The SLPOA had called for the five Rams to be disciplined, but both the NFL and the team's head coach said that won't happen. ""They are exercising their right to free speech,"" Rams Head Coach Jeff Fisher said. Share your view . What the Rams players said . The five Rams players who quietly protested on the field -- Stedman Bailey, Tavon Austin, Jared Cook, Chris Givens and Kenny Britt -- faced a barrage of questions after their gesture. They told CNN affiliate KSDK that they came up with the idea just before the game and wanted to show solidarity with the St. Louis area community. ""We wanted to do something. ... This is our community,"" Cook said. The tight end said he hasn't had time to go to Ferguson because he's been busy with the season and because the area is dangerous and he doesn't want to get caught up in the violence. But at some point, ""definitely I will be making my trip to Ferguson,"" Cook said. Bailey stressed that the players' move was just a way to show support for their community. ""The violence should stop,"" he told KSDK. ""We just want it to stop."" Austin said Brown's death and the ensuing violence was ""a tragedy, period."" ""There are things out there bigger than football,"" he said. ""And we notice that."" Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson .

"Texas authorities toughened their security to thwart illegal immigration along the Mexican border, an operation they call a ""surge."" ""Texas can't afford to wait for Washington to act on this crisis, and we will not sit idly by while the safety and security of our citizens are threatened,"" Gov. Rick Perry said in a statement. The announcement was made in a statement by Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and state House Speaker Joe Straus. The state Department of Public Safety has been authorized to fund operations at about $1.3 million a week. ""Until the federal government recognizes the danger it's putting our citizens in by its inaction to secure the border, Texas law enforcement must do everything they can to keep our citizens and communities safe,"" Perry said. The so-called surge will continue at least through the end of the calendar year to combat a ""flood"" of illegal immigrants, the statement said. ""The federal government has abdicated its responsibility to secure the border and protect this country from the consequences of illegal immigration, but as Texans we know how to lead in areas where Washington has failed,"" Dewhurst said. ""Last year DPS conducted Operation Strong Safety and achieved astounding results.  Crime rates related to drugs, cartels, transnational gangs, and illegal border activity plummeted because of the resources we allocated to stop illegal entry at the border. It's time to make this type of presence on the border permanent."" More children crossing U.S.-Mexico border alone .","Gov. Rick Perry: ""Texas can't afford to wait for Washington""

"The Senate on Thursday night easily approved a $16 billion bill to overhaul the Department of Veterans Affairs. The measure that won overwhelming House approval a day earlier now goes to President Barack Obama for his signature. It is a response to the scandal over delayed care at medical facilities and allegations of alarming management shortcomings at the sprawling federal agency that serves millions of veterans. A CNN investigation dating to November revealed key details of the crisis at VA facilities. The legislation would provide money for new medical facilities, more doctors and nurses, and a new program that will allow some veterans to seek health care outside the VA system. On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Robert McDonald as the new VA secretary. He replaced Eric Shinseki, who resigned in May over the scandal. McDonald has promised to swiftly carry out reforms intended to speed up care for returning soldiers entering the VA system and eliminate bogus record-keeping and other problems that resulted in some veterans dying while waiting months or even years for appointments. More VA employees said they were told to falsify data . Passage of the VA bill was a rare example of swift bipartisan action in the days leading up to the congressional August recess, which is set to begin on Friday.","The $16 billion measure provides money for new medical facilities and doctors .

"(CNN)Like so many other Muslims during Ramadan, Mohammed Abu Khdeir woke up early to recharge, physically and spiritually. His first order of business was to eat a big meal, to sustain him through the day until he could break the seasonal Muslim fast at sunset. The next was to head to a mosque in his middle-class Palestinian neighborhood of Shuafat in Jerusalem for prayers. But he never made it. Three people in a car came upon the 16-year-old as Abu Khdeir walked between his home and mosque around 4 a.m. Wednesday, then forced him inside, according to authorities and family members. About an hour after his abduction, the teen's body was discovered in a forest elsewhere in Jerusalem. The Palestinian state news agency WAFA blamed the kidnapping and killing on ""settlers,"" saying Abu Khdeir's body ""was charred and bore signs of violence."" Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told the Jerusalem Post the teen had significant burn marks. Abduction, killing heightens tensions .

"Most of the Syrian fighters waging a guerrilla war against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad are ill equipped -- short on guns, ammunition and with no heavy weapons. But while peaceful opposition to the government has grown in the city of Homs since the summer, military defectors, who call themselves the Free Syrian Army, have now managed to kick al-Assad's forces out of one neighborhood and hold the area. Baba Amr is now possibly the first place in Syria beyond government control. One freelance journalist and filmmaker -- who is not named for his own security -- has just left Homs, and CNN is showcasing what he saw on the front lines of a city at war. View his images in high-res . He said fighters opposed to al-Assad took him into a house, where their men -- one of whom had managed to take a rifle with a precision scope with him when he defected -- were engaged in a shootout with snipers from the Syrian military. Read how snipers rule the streets . They told him what was motivating them in their struggle against overwhelming force. ""We might not have much ammunition,"" one fighter said. ""But we are fighting for our liberty and those guys are fighting for money."" The men introduced him to one of their leaders, Abdul Razzaq Tlas, who was one of the few willing to be identified. He was a first lieutenant in al-Assad's army before defecting and his uncle is a former Syrian defense minister. He described why he decided to join the defectors. ""We got orders in the army that went against my oath as a soldier. I had sworn to protect civilians. But when I saw what the government forces were doing to the people I defected, on June 2."" People like Abdul Razzaq Tlas are heroes for the people of Baba Amr and he was cheered at a recent anti-government demonstration. But Baba Amr is surrounded by the Syrian military, and constantly shelled by tanks and artillery. At a meeting in a safe house Abdul Razzaq Tlas insists that even though al-Assad has not used his air force against the uprising, only a no-fly zone imposed by the international community could help the rebels win. ""We are in contact with soldiers who are in the army."" They say ""a no fly zone is essential to prevent them from getting bombed if they defect."" For now the men of the Free Syrian army smuggle fighters in and out of the neighborhood they control, evading government checkpoints. At night, they search everyone entering and leaving their area to stop government death squads, the so-called Shabiyah, from entering. ""The street you see over there is controlled by the Shabiya,"" said one militia member. ""They are known to kidnap our woman and childen. We try to prevent this. When strangers come here we stop and search them."" The people of this part of Homs are not afraid to take to the streets -- there are regular night-time rallies -- but after months of casualties, they have long lost their faith in non-violent protest. In Baba Amr, many believe that real change in Syria will only come from the barrel of a gun.","Syrian defectors kick President al-Assad's forces out of one neighborhood in Homs .

"Ahead of a town hall meeting Tuesday night, Ferguson's mayor said the aftermath of the shooting death of Michael Brown helped open the eyes of city officials to the town's racial divide. ""I think what it showed was ... even though I always knew again that African-Americans had experiences that were frustrating, definitely frustrating, many of that never bubbled to the surface. So I think what really opened my eyes was how significant that can be for many people,"" Mayor James Knowles said. Police Chief Thomas Jackson echoed the mayor's sentiment. ""The things that have bubbled up since the shooting have really made us sit up and take notice and realize that there is a lot more work to be done,"" Jackson said. One of those things that need to be done is community outreach, Jackson said; it's one of the steps that the police department and the local government need to take for Ferguson to be more cohesive. Protests erupted last month after Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson's fatal shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown. They devolved into nights of looting, vandalism and violence before the tenor of the protests eventually calmed. Jackson has tried to reach out more to residents, sometimes going to the daily protests in the city streets. One of those trips didn't go well. After issuing an apology Thursday, Jackson went to dialogue with demonstrators, but not everyone was eager to hear from him. ""If you are not resigning tonight, go home,"" said one man on a bullhorn. It was shortly after Jackson agreed to walk and talk with the demonstrators that a scuffle broke out somewhere behind the chief, and officers moved in to make arrests. There was no indication that Jackson was threatened, but he was quickly escorted inside a building. For several hours, police officers stood shoulder to shoulder in front of the police department with protesters a short distance away, some milling about and others chanting. On Tuesday, Jackson said he'll still go down to the protests. ""I don't think it's ever a mistake for me to engage people are trying to talk to me and my police department and my city,"" he said.  ""I think it's important to keep those lines of communication open.  So if some people want to turn it into a hostile situation, that's their fault, not mine. But I wish it would have turned out better than it did."" The chief blamed outsiders for the trouble. Last week, Jackson said he wouldn't resign, and the mayor, who was re-elected in April, said Tuesday that now is not the time for that kind of change. ""We're moving forward as a community. If we change up now, I don't know that that is going to help us down the road,"" he said. The town hall meeting, which is closed to the media, comes two nights after the most recent violent protests. Protests come to the police station . Eight people were arrested outside the police department on Sunday night when demonstrations grew violent again, police say. Each was charged with failure to disperse and resisting arrest, Lt. Ron Miesner of the Missouri State Highway Patrol said. Only one of those arrested was from Ferguson; the others were from elsewhere in the St. Louis metropolitan area. Three were from St. Louis, one was from Richmond Heights, one was from Florissant, one was from Bridgeton, and one was homeless, he said. Last week, the burning of a memorial near the site where Brown was killed reignited the demonstrations. Sunday night's protests unfolded in front of the police station, about 2 miles from the five-lane drag that typically plays host to the demonstrations. Although previous protests at the police station have been largely peaceful, some demonstrators among a crowd of about 150 people began throwing rocks and bottles at officers about 10 p.m., according to CNN affiliate KTVI. No injuries were reported. The eight people arrested were taken to a nearby jail, booked and released, KTVI reported.","Ferguson mayor: Shooting aftermath revealed the racial divide in the city .

"(CNN)Bill Cosby's lawyer has denied the latest sexual assault allegation against the comedian. Cosby was not in California on the day in 2008 when Chloe Goins alleges the comedian sexually assaulted her at a Playboy Mansion party, Martin Singer, Cosby's lawyer, said Friday in a statement. ""On Wednesday, Chloe Goins and her attorney publicly accused Bill Cosby of assaulting Ms. Goins in 2008 at the 'Midsummer Night's Party' held at the Playboy Mansion in California,"" the statement said. ""The party took place on August 9, 2008. Mr. Cosby was in New York on that date. We will be providing documentary evidence to the appropriate authorities which conclusively establishes Mr. Cosby's whereabouts on August 9 and for the preceding and succeeding days."" Goins, now 24, told her story to investigating officers of the Los Angeles Police Department on Wednesday. Like other women who have accused Cosby, Goins said she was drugged and woke up undressed, said her lawyer, Spencer Kuvin. More than 20 women have come forward with claims of sexual assault against the comedian. Many of the accusations date back decades. Kuvin issued his own statement in response to Singer's statement, saying: . ""The press should be asking Mr. Singer if Mr. Cosby was at the mansion at 'any' time during the summer of 2008.  If he has proof of his whereabouts during that entire summer then we would like to see it.  If he is willing to prove it, then I can comment.  Otherwise it is just a lawyer talking, which is not evidence.""

"Los Angeles (CNN)Hours after California Attorney General Kamala Harris began raising money for a bid to replace Barbara Boxer in the U.S. Senate, billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer outlined the case for his own run Tuesday and said he would decide soon -- setting up the likelihood of an exorbitantly expensive contest that could have two Democrats facing off in November of 2016. California's two Senate seats have been locked down by Boxer and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein since 1992, closing off statewide opportunities for the next generation of politicians. Under California's new top-two primary system, the top two candidates in the first round will advance to the general election, regardless of their party. In a column on the Huffington Post website, Steyer said he was intrigued by the opportunity of taking on interests in Washington that ""oppose recognizing global warming and fight against the rights and futures of average Americans."" ""Washington needs to be shaken up and we need climate champions who will fight for the next generation,"" Steyer said. ""California Democrats are blessed to have a deep bench of talent, and I will decide soon based on what I think is the best way to continue the hard work we have already started together to prevent climate disaster and preserve American prosperity."" Steyer and Harris would be among the most formidable contenders for Boxer's seat, along with former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who has said he is ""seriously considering"" a run. Several members of the California congressional delegation and of the state leadership have signaled interest, including Rep. Loretta Sanchez, Rep. John Garamendi, and state Treasurer John Chiang. In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Sanchez touted her focus on working families, immigration reform and affordable healthcare: "" I have advocated for policies that give all families the same access to the American Dream,"" she said. ""Californians deserve a strong voice in Washington and I have never been afraid to speak up, which is why I am seriously considering running for the United States Senate in 2016."" But lesser-known candidates could face great difficulty raising the money needed to run. Boxer raised some $35 million in conjunction with party committees for her 2010 race against former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina. Steyer, a former hedge fund manager from San Francisco whose net worth has been estimated at $1.6 billion by Forbes, has pledged to give away the bulk of his fortune to public interest and philanthropic causes during his lifetime. He has been a vocal opponent of the Keystone XL pipeline and a free-spending advocate for California environmental causes. His NextGen Climate Action Committee spent more than $74 million in the midterm elections -- much of it Steyer's money -- trying to defeat candidates who had expressed doubt about climate change, but they had little demonstrable success in a Republican wave year. As a candidate, Steyer's investments throughout his business career are also likely to come under uncomfortable scrutiny. Last year, for example, the New York Times examined lucrative investments by Steyer's former fund, Farallon Capital Management in companies across the globe that own coal-fired power plants. Harris, the former district attorney of San Francisco who was just re-elected to her second term as attorney general, was the first to formally declare her candidacy since Boxer announced last week that she would not run for re-election in 2016. While Villaraigosa could build a strong Southern California base, and draw on his support from California's growing Latino community,  Harris also has a solid fundraising base in California from her two statewide runs and her close alliance with President Barack Obama. She has won praise as attorney general for pursuing banks that did not follow proper procedures when they foreclosed on the properties of California homeowners and she has kept a steady focus on reducing recidivism and truancy. ""From my first days as a prosecutor in Alameda County, to my work as San Francisco District Attorney to my current service as California Attorney General, I have worked to bring smart, innovative and effective approaches to fighting crime, fighting for consumers and fighting for equal rights for all,"" Harris said in a statement on her new campaign web page Tuesday. ""I will be a fighter for the next generation on the critical issues facing our country. I will be a fighter for middle class families who are feeling the pinch of stagnant wages and diminishing opportunity,"" she continued. ""I will be a fighter for our children who deserve a world-class education, and for students burdened by predatory lenders and skyrocketing tuition. And I will fight relentlessly to protect our coast, our immigrant communities and our seniors."" Gavin Newsom passes on bid for Boxer's seat . Harris' position was strengthened on Monday when Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom bowed out of contention. Speculation had swirled around the possibility of a heated race between Harris, 50, and Newsom, 47, who could have potentially split the Northern California vote, clearing the way for a Southern California candidate like Villaraigosa. Newsom has told many confidantes that he is interested in running for governor when Jerry Brown faces term limits in 2018, and he and Harris share the same political consultants. In a statement on his Facebook page, Newsom said it was better ""to be candid than be coy"" and noted that it would be better for his three children, Montana, Hunter and Brooklynn, if he stayed in California. ""While I am humbled by the widespread encouragement of so many and hold in the highest esteem those who serve us in federal office, I know that my head and my heart, my young family's future and our unfinished work all remain firmly in the state of California -- not Washington, D.C. Therefore I will not seek election to the U.S. Senate in 2016,"" Newsom said. Hinting at his potential alliance with Harris, he added that in the months to come, he looked ""forward to doing whatever I can to help elect California's next great Democratic senator -- one worthy of succeeding Barbara Boxer and serving this remarkable state of dreamers and doers in the United States Senate."" Shortly after Boxer announced that she would retire from the Senate in 2016, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he would not run for the seat.","Billionaire Tom Steyer exploring run for Barbara Boxer's seat .

"News alert: Some things you read on the Internet are not true. As obvious as that may seem, and as savvy as you'd think we'd be a decade after deposed Nigerian princes began e-mailing us with the promise of vast riches, 2013 has turned out to be the Year of the Online Hoax.

So, when a pastor claims to teach his congregation a lesson by disguising himself as a homeless man, or a pistol-packing granny unloads on young punks playing ""The Knockout Game,"" some of us are so enamored of what the tale says about our world that we miss the warning signs. But there's more to it than that. Fun little Internet stories, it turns out, have become big business. ""There really is a virality industry, with websites that are in the business of finding these things and blowing them up with slide shows and stories,"" Stelter told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. He named Buzzfeed, Huffington Post and Upworthy as just a few of the many sites that thrive, at least in part, on that model. Many news sites seek to verify viral content before publishing it, although some of us occasionally get burned. In September CNN and other sites published a video of a girl appearing to catch on fire during a twerking mishap before the clip was revealed as a prank by Jimmy Kimmel's talk show. There's obviously an appetite for these sorts of viral stories. So finding them, pulling them together quickly and relaunching them on social media within minutes equals page views. And online, page views make advertisers happy. And advertisers mean money. ""There's a million-clicks reward for being the first to pick up on it,"" wrote TIME's James Poniewozik, referring to Elan Gale's live-tweeting of his Thanksgiving Day airplane ""feud."" ""And hundreds of follow-up, aggregations, commentaries and counter-commentaries get posted before anyone gets around to seeing if the flight data added up."" Here are just some of the fake viral tales that have swept the Web so far this year. We're willing to bet they won't be the last. Manti Te'o's ""girlfriend"" This one's almost a year old and still kind of confusing. As his Notre Dame Fighting Irish were playing their way into the BCS national championship game, All-American linebacker Manti Te'o broke hearts when he told reporters his girlfriend, a 22-year-old Stanford University student, had died of leukemia within hours of his grandmother's death. ""I miss 'em, but I know that I'll see them again one day,"" he told ESPN after leading the Irish to an improbable 20-3 victory over Michigan State. Except, the girlfriend never existed. Te'o would later say he'd never met Lennay Kekua in person, that their relationship had formed online and that he was the victim of what he called a ""sick joke"" and what Notre Dame dubbed ""an elaborate hoax."" The homophobic non-tip . It had all the right ingredients to stir up Web outrage. It wasn't enough for customers to refuse to tip waitress Dayna Morales, a 22-year-old Marine Corps veteran, who describes herself as ""out, open and proud."" Someone in the family of four also had to leave a note saying ""I'm sorry but I cannot tip because I do not agree with ... your lifestyle and how you live your life."" That's the story Morales told media outlets, including CNN, last month, and the Web responded in kind. More than $2,000 flowed in to a PayPal account set up by her employer, Gallop Asian Bistro in Bridgewater, New Jersey. She said she'd donate the gifts to the Wounded Warrior Project and the restaurant planned to match the donations, giving to a local gay-and-lesbian support group. But then, a local television station displayed a receipt from a family showing an $18 tip on a bill of $93.55 -- the same amount on the one Morales had originally shared on the Facebook Have a Gay Day group, and a credit card statement with the same total value, $111.55, to back it up. This week, Morales was suspended at the restaurant, while it completes an investigation of exactly what happened. The poverty blogger . Give Linda Walther Tirado this: she can write. ""You have to understand that we know that we will never not feel tired,"" she wrote in one of many heartbreaking blog posts about living in poverty that were picked up by the Huffington Post and others. ""We will never feel hopeful. We will never get a vacation. Ever. We know that the very act of being poor guarantees that we will never not be poor. It doesn't give us much reason to improve ourselves."" But here's the problem. She's apparently not all that poor. A Houston Press investigation last week revealed that Tirado owns her home, has worked as a political consultant, attended a private boarding school and is married to a U.S. Marine. But by the time that story was out, Tirado had already raised more than $61,000 in donations via GoFundMe. In an update on the GoFundMe page, Tirado wrote, ""You have to understand that the piece you read was taken out of context, that I never meant to say that all of these things were happening to me right now, or that I was still quite so abject. I am not. I am reasonably normally lower working class ..."" She says she'll use the money to collect her writing into a book and maintains that her writing was misinterpreted by readers who thought she was always describing her current living conditions. #RIP celebrity-who-is-still-alive . It's been more than four years since Jeff Goldblum ""died"" on Twitter. But, in 2013, the social media platform was still killing off celebrities with regularity. Celine Dion. Tom Cruise. Cher. Chloe Moretz. All, to the best of our knowledge, still alive. But all mourned this year on Twitter where bad information, whether planted intentionally or accidentally, can spread fast. It's gotten so bad that when word of actor Paul Walker's death in a car crash broke late Saturday, many fans remained skeptical even after legitimate news sources were reporting it. Diane in 7A . A reality TV producer just made something up. Who would have thought? Elan Gale, a producer on ABC's ""The Bachelor,"" captivated Twitter with his Thanksgiving Day story about a fellow passenger who was rude to flight attendants on his flight to Phoenix. Gale came to the rescue with a cheeky note, a glass of wine and, ultimately, some lowbrow insults. Within a day, the Web had split into two camps. Team Elan cheered a champion who delivered instant karma to someone being nasty to hapless service-industry folk. Team Diane declared Gale just as bad, if not worse, for preying upon someone clearly in distress and insulting her in crude language. Gale declared both teams losers a couple of days later when he returned to Twitter to share a ""photo of Diane"" -- an empty chair. Comedian vs. salsa . Fresh on the heels of Elan vs. Diane, comedian Kyle Kinane over the weekend started poking fun at what looked like an automated Twitter feed for Pace Picante Sauce that would ""favorite"" anything he wrote about the salsa -- no matter how derogatory or crude. What followed was a hilarious and cringe-worthy back-and-forth in which Pace employees offered Kinane free salsa to stop writing bad things about them, argued amongst themselves and generally made a mess of things. The main problem being that Pace Picante Sauce doesn't have a Twitter feed, says its owner, the Campbell Soup Co. Kinane says he was himself pranked by other comedians who created the fake account.","Viral hoaxes hit the Internet big in 2013 .

"(CNN)Joe Paterno could soon regain his title as the winningest coach in major college football history. The 112 Penn State victories that the NCAA voided -- 111 of them Paterno's -- when it sanctioned Penn State University following the Jerry Sandusky scandal are likely being restored as part of a proposed settlement with the NCAA. Penn State's board of trustees unanimously approved it, and now the NCAA and a judge will have to accept the settlement. The settlement is part of a lawsuit filed by Pennsylvania state Sen. Jake Corman. The suit began as a way to force the $60 million fine money the NCAA levied on Penn State to stay within the state of Pennsylvania, but it became a way to give Penn State supporters a place to legally challenge the validity of the sanctions. Among them, the most controversial, was the loss of Paterno's wins between 1998, when the first report of abuse against then-assistant coach Sandusky was made, to 2011, when Sandusky was charged with abusing 10 boys, many of them on campus. Sandusky was convicted in 2012 of abusing the victims and is serving a 30- to 60-year sentence, which means he will probably spend the rest of his life behind bars. The same year, Paterno died at age 85. Penn State paid Paterno's estate $5.76 million after his death . ""Today is a great victory for everyone who has fought for the truth in the Sandusky tragedy,"" the Paterno family said Friday in a statement. ""The repeal of the consent decree and the return of the wins to the University and Joe Paterno confirm that the NCAA and the Board of Trustees acted prematurely and irresponsibly in the unprecedented sanctions the NCAA imposed on the University, the players, coaches and the community."" Paterno, who was fired days after Sandusky was charged, still has many supporters who believe he was wronged by the university's harsh reaction to the allegations against Sandusky. But at least some of Sandusky's victims disagree. Marci Hamilton, a Philadelphia attorney who represents some of them, said it's another example of protecting the powerful over the vulnerable. ""At least the money is still going to be used for the benefit of survivors in Pennsylvania.  Powerful institutions involved in child sex abuse scandals are typically more concerned about their leaders' pristine reputations (regardless of what they have done) than money.  This settlement follows the trend,"" she said in an email to CNN. Howard Janet, lawyer for another victim, said in a statement: ""Any effort by Penn State officials or others that implies the NCAA's action suggests the University had no responsibility for the molestation of adolescent boys by the defensive coordinator of its football team -- which often took place in team showers --  is ludicrous."" According to a statement from the Penn State board of trustees, in addition to restoring 112 wins the proposed settlement would dedicate the $60 million to helping victims of child abuse and to preventing such abuse. Another Philadelphia attorney, Tom Kline, who represented victims including one who was assaulted after administrators were informed of allegations in 2001, said: ""Penn State institutionally has demonstrated significant good faith in the past two and half years, and deserved real relief from the overbearing sanctions to which it previously agreed -- especially relating to the $60 million fine. ""But, we must not lose sight -- in between the chants of 'restore the wins' and 'restore the statute' pertaining to strong feeling relating to (the late) Joe Paterno, that the remaining issue is the individual accountability of the administrators in charge when Jerry Sandusky was enable to commit his horrible acts on young boys."" Three administrators, including the former president and former athletic director, have been charged with covering up some of Sandusky's crimes. Prosecutors allege they knew about at least two incidents reported to the university, but lied about it before a grand jury. When Penn State hired an independent investigator to look into what happened, the investigator found that Paterno was also part of a coverup, creating a divide among Pennsylvanians and provoking a visceral response from his family and supporters who maintain he was not aware that Sandusky was a pedophile. That independent report, done by former FBI director Louis Freeh, was what the NCAA relied on when it sanctioned the university. Dottie Sandusky, Jerry Sandusky's wife, issued her own statement, again insisting her husband was innocent. ""I am thankful that a small but significant part of this great injustice has been rectified with the restoration of Joe Paterno's win record. Joe and Penn State did not cover anything up because there was simply nothing to cover up,"" she said. ""Hopefully, as the media's false narrative continues to unravel, more people will realize this obvious reality."" The 112 victories include all of Paterno's 111 wins at the school in those 14 seasons, plus the team's last victory of 2011, by which time Paterno had been fired over the Sandusky scandal. Before those wins were vacated, Paterno had amassed 409 victories in 46 seasons at Penn State, the most of any major college head coach.

"In a stunning reversal, the VA's acting inspector general now says that long wait times at VA health care facilities in Phoenix did contribute to a number of veterans' deaths. In a hearing before the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs Wednesday, Acting Inspector General Richard Griffin was grilled by lawmakers about the findings of his office's August report, which stated that while the investigation into 40 veterans' deaths found ""poor quality of care,"" the office was ""unable to conclusively assert that the absence of timely care caused the death of these veterans."" Rep. David Jolly, R-Florida, insisted that Griffin answer his questions in simple terms. ""Would you agree that wait lists contributed to the deaths of veterans?  Yes or no?"" he asked. ""Yes, they do,"" Griffin replied. ""I would say that it may have contributed to their death, but we can't say conclusively it caused their death."" Committee chairman Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida, said the report actually shows that 83 vets died while waiting for care, either on a hidden wait list or a scheduling wait list. Additional information provided by the inspector general's office to the committee shows ""an astonishing 293 total veteran deaths on all of the lists provided from multiple sources throughout this review,"" Miller said. For more than a year, CNN has been investigating and reporting on veterans' deaths and delays at VA facilities all across the country, including detailed investigations in November and January 2013 examining deaths at two VA facilities in South Carolina and Georgia. Whistleblowers have their say . Griffin's testimony confirms and even goes beyond the original allegations brought forth by Dr. Sam Foote, a retired Phoenix VA doctor, who first appeared on CNN in April with detailed allegations that as many as 40 American veterans had died in Phoenix, waiting for care at the VA. After Foote's revelations, several other whistleblowers stepped forward with similar accounts of veterans waiting for care and possible deaths due to the delays. In testimony before the committee Wednesday, Foote accused the inspector general of stalling the investigation and protecting the senior officials responsible for perpetuating and hiding health care delays. Foote also alleged that the inspector general deliberately used confusing language and suppressed the finding that 293 veterans died waiting for care, a figure that was not included in the report. ""This report is at best a whitewash and at worst a feeble attempt at a cover-up,"" Foote testified. He also faulted VA Secretary Bob McDonald for not increasing transparency at the agency, as he promised he would, and for his vow to not tolerate whistleblower retaliation. ""This report fails miserably in those areas with a transparency equivalent to a lead-line, 4-foot-thick concrete wall,"" Foote said. Another whistleblower from the Phoenix VA also testified, charging that the inspector general downplayed evidence of harm to veterans and minimized the effects of medical administrators manipulating patient data and scheduling. Whistleblower says investigation has been a 'whitewash' Dr. Katherine Mitchell, medical director of the Phoenix VA's Post-Deployment Clinic, critiqued the inspector general's review of patient cases and said delays potentially caused two deaths and others significantly shortened the lifespan of some terminally ill veterans. ""Death is death, and there is no way to get those veterans back,"" Mitchell said. Wait times contributed to deaths . Lawmakers also heard from Dr. John Daigh, an assistant inspector general who helped investigate the Phoenix VA, in Wednesday's hearing. Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tennessee, challenged the IG's report finding that patient wait times couldn't conclusively be linked to deaths. ""To draw the conclusion, Dr. Daigh, that you did ... that it had no effect on the outcome of those patients, is outrageous,"" Roe said angrily.  ""If this were your family member, would you be happy with the explanation you just gave of his death? My suspicion is no."" From the other side of the aisle, Rep. Beto O'Rourke, D-Texas, charged that ""common sense tells you"" delays in care could certainly be linked to deaths of patients. Daigh also answered affirmatively to Jolly's questioning about the relationship between wait lists and veterans' deaths. ""Would you be willing to say that wait lists contributed to the deaths?"" Rep. David Jolly, R-Florida, asked. ""Yes. No problem with that. The issue is cause,"" Daigh said. VA inspectors say Phoenix was in total 'chaos' Problems at Phoenix VA . In a document dated October 2013 that was recently obtained by CNN, the Phoenix VA conducted its own investigation into allegations that administrators incorrectly scheduled appointments and that senior officials discouraged the reporting of related problems.  It issued a report saying many of the claims could not be substantiated. But when the VA's Office of Inspector General later investigated the same charges, it found that Phoenix VA staff members manipulated appointment data and that senior officials were aware of the inappropriate practices. The Phoenix VA did confirm in its 2013 internal report that the wait times for mental health appointments were ""extremely long,"" and that administrators discouraged patients from scheduling follow-up visits when they left the medical center. The VA's 2013 report also found the process of hiring staff took too long, in some cases taking more than 60 days. But the Phoenix VA reportedly rejected the majority of allegations, which were raised by Dr. Mitchell, the whistleblower who testified before Congress Wednesday. On Mitchell's charge that Phoenix VA officials actively discouraged the reporting of scheduling problems, the VA report found, ""There have been no findings ... that substantiate these allegations."" Many of Mitchell's allegations in 2013 centered on inappropriate use of the Phoenix VA's electronic wait list, a process for scheduling patients for next-available appointments. She charged that Phoenix VA administrators were not correctly trained on how to use this wait list and that they failed to appropriately track appointments, claims the inspector general later substantiated. At Wednesday's hearing, congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle repeatedly criticized and chastised Griffin and his team of experts who examined what happened in Phoenix, with many lawmakers expressing exasperation and frustration that they were not getting truthful or clear answers. During the proceedings, Foote and Mitchell provided the committee with detailed reports containing allegations and information about what they see as a cover-up and conspiracy. Committee members will be going through these documents in coming days.","Richard Griffin, the VA's acting inspector general, spars with committee .

"San Diego, California (CNN)Political attacks have really gone to the dogs. They used to have more style and substance. It was considered bad form to just weave an attack out of whole cloth, counting on the fact that the mark was so despised by a segment of society that people would be anxious to believe the worst. It used to be that when you wanted to sling mud at someone whose politics you didn't agree with -- chiefly as a way of making them look bad and yourself look good by comparison -- you'd try to dig up dirt, find a skeleton in a closet or challenge the person's integrity. These days, you don't have to work that hard. The whole process is do-it-yourself. You just go to Facebook and see what embarrassing family photos can be linked to the person you intend to slime. The target doesn't even have to be in the photo. Just the fact that they posted it, or thought it was humorous, or in any way condoned the act is good enough. In our narcissistic look-at-me-and-mine culture, social media networks are veritable treasure chests of blunders, blushes and blemishes. Even with our best efforts to use these sites to showcase our best features, there is plenty of embarrassment to go around. Once you find the photos, you do a little cut and paste. Then you can scribble a few sentences about how shocked -- shocked! -- you are that people could behave in such a manner. Be sure to include a line from the head of some nonprofit that raises funds by advancing the idea that, without a group like theirs, our entire society would be in dire straits. If you're attacking someone on the left, you might hunt around on social media for a photo where they're not wearing a flag pin and accuse them of being unpatriotic. If you're trying to smear someone on the right, you can fall back on the old standby and accuse them of being uncaring. How uncaring? Enough to use a dog as a food stool. The offender in question is 6-year-old Trig Palin, who became an instant target of supposedly tolerant liberals when he wound up being born to mother Sarah, one of the most popular political figures for conservatives and a constant thorn in the side of liberals. This time, what put Trig in the liberal's version of ""timeout"" is a photo on his mom's Facebook page of him standing barefoot on his new pet dog -- a black labrador oddly named Jill Hadassah -- so he could reach the kitchen sink and wash his dish. The liberal organization, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, was not amused. PETA blasted Palin in a statement, calling her ""hard-hearted"" and ""bizarrely callous."" The statement read, ""It's odd that anyone -- let alone a mother -- would find it appropriate to post such a thing, with no apparent sympathy for the dog in the photo."" You know who deserves sympathy? The journalists who got that statement and had to whip up a story based on faux outrage. Palin struck back by zeroing in with the real reason that groups like PETA have lost influence and credibility: the double standard they employ, denouncing certain behavior by the people they oppose while excusing the same behavior by people they support. Where was the organization last year, she asked, when the liberal talk show hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, posted a similar photo of a girl standing on a dog? Back then, PETA was AWOL. She is right about the double standard. And I admire her spunk. In a world of politicians and even former politicians who are so careful about what they say and do that they don't say or do anything, Palin unplugged is a refreshing exception. There is more to the story. According to media reports, the canine is a service dog that was trained to care for Trig, who has Down syndrome. The little guy doesn't just need special care. It seems that he also needs constant protection -- from liberals who hate his mommy. Trig was first targeted by the left in February 2010, when he was just shy of 2 years old. That's when Seth MacFarlane, creator of the Fox animated comedy, ""Family Guy,"" thought it would be a hoot to air an episode that demolished all the preaching that liberals have done over the years about tolerance and the importance of defending those with special needs. In the episode, the character Chris is dating a teenage girl with Down syndrome, and when he asks her what her parents do, she says, ""My dad's an accountant, and my mom is the former governor of Alaska."" David Tolleson, head of the Atlanta-based National Down Syndrome Congress, called the gag ""hurtful and stereotypical.""  And Palin's daughter Bristol wrote on her mom's Facebook page that the joke was especially cruel given that her brother already faces a life filled with intolerance and prejudice. On the defensive, MacFarlane claimed at the time that he was ""an equal opportunity offender."" Sure. In 2008, the comedian had spoken at an Obama-Biden rally at a university in Ohio, where he took potshots at Republicans and touted the Democratic ticket. As all this unfolded, we learned -- thanks to Trig -- a valuable lesson about how the tolerant left has a much stronger stomach for intolerance if its aimed at one of its enemies. Now the little guy is at it again, teaching us that liberals are creative enough to make smears out of thin air. In a perfect world, I'd prefer that children not mistake their household pets for a step ladder. But whatever else can be said about the world that Trig Palin is likely to face in the years to come, this much we know: It won't be perfect.","PETA criticized posting of photo of Sarah Palin's child standing on a dog .

"U.S. President Barack Obama spoke by telephone Friday with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani -- the first direct conversation between leaders in Washington and Tehran since 1979 -- raising the possibility a deal can be reached over Iran's controversial nuclear program. Describing the conversation as a starting point, Obama said he believes an agreement is possible regarding Iran's nuclear ambitions that could lead to better relations. ""While there will surely be important obstacles to moving forward and success is by no means guaranteed, I believe we can reach a comprehensive solution,"" Obama told reporters during a White House briefing. Western leaders have expressed cautious optimism about Iran's more moderate tone under Rouhani, whose recent comments have raised hopes that a deal could be struck over the Middle Eastern nation's nuclear program. Obama said he reiterated to Rouhani statements he made earlier in the week during the United Nations General Assembly, where he signaled the United States was open to negotiations with Iran provided real action is taken. Report: Shoe thrown at Rouhani . ""So the test will be meaningful, transparent, and verifiable actions, which can also bring relief from the comprehensive international sanctions that are currently in place,"" he said Friday. The conversation between the two men came at the end of the General Assembly, where conjecture abounded over whether Obama and Rouhani would meet in person and what that might mean for U.S.-Iranian relations. Rouhani told reporters Friday that there wasn't enough time to plan such a face-to-face meeting. The last time a U.S. president spoke with an Iranian leader was in 1979, when Jimmy Carter talked by telephone with Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi before Pahlavi was overthrown. National Security Advisor Susan Rice told CNN's Fareed Zakaria that the administration was contacted by the Iranian delegation. ""Today, somewhat surprisingly, we were contacted by them to say that President Rouhani would like to speak to President Obama on the telephone on his way out of town, and we were able to make that call come together and it was a constructive conversation,"" she said. The call lasted about 15 minutes, with translation, Rice said. Rice characterized the call as ""cordial and constructive."" 2,700-year-old Persian artifact heads back to Iran . The news of the conversation played out on Twitter in posts by Rouhani, who recounted his conversation with Obama just minutes before the American president spoke with reporters at a White House briefing. A senior Obama administration official said Rouhani's tweets reflected the tone of the telepone conversation between the two leaders. ""We'll continue to watch his Twitter feed,"" the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. According to Rouhani's posts, Obama told the Iranian president that he was ""convinced relations between Iran and US will greatly affect the region."" ""@BarackObama to @HassanRouhani If we can make progress on #nuclear file, other issues such as #Syria will certainly be positively affected,"" the president said in a follow-up message. Rouhani responded, according to his tweet: ""In regards to #nuclear issue, with political #will, there is a way to rapidly solve the matter."" Opinion: Why Rouhani deserves praise . He also told Obama, according to his Twitter post, he was hopeful about upcoming meetings on the issue between representatives of Iran and the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- the U.S., China, Russia, Britain and France -- as well as Germany. ""@HassanRouhani to @BarackObama: I express my gratitude for your #hospitality and your phone call. Have a good day Mr President,"" Rouhani said in post on Twitter. Earlier, Rouhani told reporters he was heartened by Thursday's meeting between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as part of a meeting between Iran and the six countries trying to tackle international concerns about Iran's nuclear program. It was the first face-to-face meeting between such high-level officials of the two countries in more than 30 years. Obama and Rouhani both indicated that the talks between Kerry and Zarif will continue at the so-called P5+1 meeting, which brings together representatives of the five permanent member states of the United Nations and Germany with emissaries from Iran over Tehran's nuclear program. U.S. official: Obama, Rouhani discussed fate of three Americans . ""Throughout this process, we will stay in close touch with our friends and allies in the region, including Israel,"" Obama told reporters, acknowledging concerns such talks are likely to raise with Israeli leaders. Obama acknowledged that after 35 years of mistrust, ""a path to a meaningful agreement will be difficult and at this point both sides have significant concerns that will have to be overcome."" ""But I believe we have a responsibility to pursue diplomacy, and that we have a unique opportunity to make progress with the new leadership in Tehran,"" he said. Western leaders have said Iran seems to sound different under the leadership of Rouhani, who replaced Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as president this summer. On Friday, it was Rouhani's turn to return the compliment, saying European Union officials and Obama sound ""different compared to the past."" Rouhani told reporters Friday his election helped pave the way for better relations between the Iran and the West, which has imposed heavy sanctions on the country. He also said Iran wants quick resolution to the nuclear issue. Western leaders believe the country's nuclear program is designed to produce weapons. Iranian leaders have said it is purely peaceful. ""I assure you that on the Iranian side, this will is there fully, 100%, that within a very short period of time, there will be a settlement on the nuclear issue,"" he told reporters.","The call lasted 15 minutes, Susan Rice tells CNN .

"(CNN) -- Obviously, we're kidding with the headline, but President Barack Obama spent the bulk of his wedding anniversary apart from the first lady this year â€” and his motorcade nearly ruined another couple's big day, too. Speaking at a campaign rally on Friday for Massachusetts gubernatorial hopeful Martha Coakley, Michelle Obama said she may not get to see her husband on their anniversary because they're both traveling. ""It just happens to be our 22nd anniversary today,"" Michelle Obama told the audience. ""This is how important these elections are to us, because I might not even see him today because I'm on the road and he's on the road."" It's not the first time their anniversary fell on a less-than-perfect date. Two years ago, they had their 20th on the same day Obama was roundly criticized for his performance in the first presidential debate with GOP nominee Mitt Romney. Last year, the couple's special date came amid the government shutdown and as the Obamacare website was making headlines for its massive glitches. The President, who was speaking Friday at a steel factory in Indiana, was congratulated by an audience member after his speech. ""Thank you,"" Obama said. ""Twenty-two years she's been putting up with me."" Obama, who flies back to Washington on Friday night, went on to spell out some advice he recently gave to a young newlywed couple. ""I said, 'It takes about 10 years to train a man properly, so you got to be patient with him because he will screw up a bunch, but eventually we learn, it just takes a little longer. We are not as smart'. So, Michelle has been very patient with me,"" he said. Speaking of patience, a groom in Chicago on Thursday waited anxiously at the altar as his bride was stuck in traffic caused by the President's motorcade. The bride-to-be, Debra-Ann Robinson, was stuck on Lake Shore Drive for half an hour, Robinson told Fox 32. Her groom waited at Cook County's Marriage Court, worried they would miss their slotted wedding time. Meanwhile, Robinson stood outside her car with other halted commuters, at least one of whom tweeted a photo of the stranded bride in traffic. The couple eventually got married Thursday, and their dramatic wedding story was featured on the local news that night. .

"Why is Vladimir Putin scared of 24-year-old Nadya Tolokonnikova? What have his people done to her? Why won't they let her family contact her? Nadezhda (Nadya) Tolokonnikova, the Russian artist and activist who leads the provocatively named punk rock band Pussy Riot, was thrown into a car by Russian prison authorities three weeks ago, according to Amnesty International. After an international campaign, including an Amnesty International petition, the office of the Russian ombudsman now says that authorities have confirmed suspicions that she is on her way to a prison camp in Siberia, thousands of miles away from her husband and her small daughter, with an Orwellian claim that the move aims to ""promote her resocialization."" Tolokonnikova and Pussy Riot became a thorn in Putin's side with their performance pieces, when they wore the colorful face-covering balaclavas that became their trademark, and launched into routines that were clearly meant to outrage. Their work had a cutting political message. Imprisoned Pussy Riot band member transferred to another prison . She and her band, you may remember, got into serious legal trouble early last year after they staged a flash-mob style performance of their ""Punk Prayer"" at Moscow's main Russian Orthodox cathedral, chanting ""Virgin Mary, mother of God, put Putin away."" It was a protest against the church's support for Putin's increasingly controversial rule. The video quickly had millions of viewings. Within days, the performers were arrested and charged with ""hooliganism motivated by religious hatred."" Tolokonnikova, along with her Pussy Riot colleague Maria Alyokhina, was sentenced to two years in prison. She is scheduled to be released in March, but experience has shown that in Russia, the government can find ways to delay a prisoner's release practically forever, if that is what it chooses. Just ask Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the once-wealthy businessman who became a Putin critic. While he was already imprisoned in Siberia, the government brought new charges against him, piling more years to his incarceration. As with Khodorkovsky, Putin's Russia has turned Tolokonnikova into a symbol of state repression and proof that the government cannot tolerate dissent or criticism. Every day she is out of sight, the Russian government looks more frightened of its own people, more eager to suppress freedom of expression and more comfortable violating human rights. That is definitely not a good look for a country preparing to host the world in the Winter Olympics. Clearly, the tactics of Tolokonnikova's Pussy Riot are not to everyone's taste. Some find them deeply offensive. But the state's ferocious response to the actions of a group of young activists was hardly warranted by the scale of their transgressions. Authorities started by holding them without bail and compiling an indictment  that ran almost 3,000 pages. Their lawyers were given two days to review the material, prompting the defendants to go on hunger strike to protest the unfairness of the proceedings. Tolokonnikova is a political prisoner. And now, in the worst tradition of Soviet Russia, Tolokonnikova, a musician, wife and mother, has been thrown into Russia's Gulag system. The timing of Tolokonnikova's disappearance helps explain its motivation. The government is punishing her and her family and trying to intimidate her because, incredibly, even in prison she has not stopped pointing out the excesses of the regime. On September 23, she went on a hunger strike to protest the brutal conditions experienced by her and her fellow prisoners at the infamous women's prison camp in Mordovia. Before she started her hunger strike, she wrote a letter explaining the reasons for her protest. ""When they send you off to Mordovia,"" she wrote, ""it is as though you're headed to the scaffold."" She described the sadistic punishments, the unceasing slave labor; the horrors of daily life.  She told the story of a woman who was beaten to death in the third unit, ""the third,"" she explained, ""is the pressure unit where they put prisoners that need to undergo daily beatings."" The women, she said, work 17 hours a day with four hours of sleep and a day off every month and a half. The administration views the prisoners as free labor for the mass manufacturing of police uniforms, she noted, asking pointedly, ""Where does the money they get for them go?"" Even from prison Tolokonnikova was able to rattle the system. Her critique of the prison system made waves, even as her health declined. After 10 days on hunger strike she was transferred to the prison hospital.  When she stopped the strike, expecting to be moved to a more humane prison, she was returned  to the same labor camp and she restarted her hunger strike. Then she vanished. In Russia's dismal prison system, the family's material and psychological support can make the difference between life and death. But while a prisoner is being transferred, the government has no responsibility to inform relatives of their whereabouts. Prison authorities say Tolokonnikova is in transit, on her way to a new facility. Her husband, Peter Verzilov, says he had good reason to believe his wife is being sent to a prison colony deep inside Siberia, probably the worst place on Earth to spend the winter. B . There is reason to fear for her health, after her lengthy hunger strike, and to worry about how she is being treated by correctional authorities. The country's human rights ombudsman, Vladimir Lukin, says he has been told by prison officials that she is in ""satisfactory"" health, in transit to a new prison. By its vindictive treatment of Nadya Tolokonnikova and its efforts to frighten her into submission, the Russian government is turning someone who would have been a fairly obscure activist into a major international figure, and in the process it is shining a light on the very abuses to which she wants to draw attention. This may be ultimately good for the Russian people, but it is exceedingly dangerous for Tolokonnikova. Russia is a place where government critics have faced mysterious and tragic endings. It is not a moment too soon for the Putin government to show Tolokonnikova, to show it is treating her humanely, and to make good on its word to release her as soon as her current sentence expires.","Frida Ghitis: Nadya Tolokonnikova, jailed Pussy Riot activist, has vanished .

"North Koreans' ability to surf the Internet -- for the few in the isolated nation who could ever really go online anyway -- is rockier than ever. Dyn Research reported on Monday that the country's Internet was down, after 24 hours of ""increasing instability."" It stayed dead for more than nine hours, then came back to life -- but not for long. Half a day later Dyn said it was down again. Then it was back up, at about 1 a.m. Wednesday Pyongyang time (11 a.m. Tuesday ET), the company said. But the assessment of Dyn, a company that monitors Internet performance worldwide, made earlier Tuesday, did not change: ""North Korea continues its struggles to stay online."" The timing of North Korea's latest Internet issues makes them significant. They come days after the U.S. government blamed Pyongyang for being behind the hacking of Sony Pictures over that company's production of ""The Interview"" -- a comedy depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un -- as well as threats against anyone who dared watch the movie. North Korea denied any responsibility, even as it blamed the U.S. government for being behind the making of the Seth Rogen-James Franco film. Its totalitarian government went on to officially make its own threat, warning the United States that its ""citadels"" will be attacked, dwarfing the hacking attack on Sony. Pyongyang hasn't leveled any blame or threats about its latest Internet outage. But experts are skeptical that the American government had any involvement. That's almost irrelevant, said Mike Chinoy, a frequent traveler to North Korea and former CNN correspondent. ""The issue ... is not whether it was or it wasn't (the United States that knocked out North Korea's Internet). The issue is what the North Koreans think it was,"" said Chinoy, a U.S.-China Institute senior fellow. ""And I think it's safe to assume -- unless they themselves took their system offline for their own security, which is not impossible -- they'll be looking to respond."" Cyber conflict with North Korea is 'dangerous uncharted territory' Expert: Could be 'a 15-year-old in a Guy Fawkes mask' So who is behind North Korea's Internet problems? Unlike the Sony cyberattack and threats, which were linked to a group called ""Guardians of Peace,"" the latest issues haven't been tied to any group or government. It's possible they have nothing to do with the Sony dust-up and are simply an internal matter. Another possibility: North Korea's Internet traffic is routed through China, so issues or officials there may be to blame. Another option: it could be a deliberate move by the country's own government. ""North Korea may have disconnected themselves, either preemptively to prevent that movie from being distributed, but also, probably more likely, in a defensive posture,"" said Shawn Henry, a cybersecurity expert and former executive assistant director of the FBI. Talking when North Korea's Internet was totally down, Dyn Research's Doug Madory said ""usually there are isolated blips"" anyway in the country's service. But he thinks what happened here was different. ""I wouldn't be surprised if they are absorbing some sort of attack,"" Madory said. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf deflected a question about the disruption. ""We aren't going to discuss -- you know -- publicly, operational details about the possible response options or comment on those kind of reports in any way, except to say that as we implement our responses, some will be seen, some may not be seen,"" she said. No one is saying the U.S. government couldn't have carried out such an attack. But tech experts say it might not have needed to, given the ability of anyone, anywhere to do something like this. What happened with Sony, especially the studio's decision to shelve -- at least temporarily -- the release of  ""The Interview,"" got a lot of people upset. Matthew Prince, president of the performance and security company CloudFlare, told CNN he couldn't say definitively that there was an attack at all. But if there was, he said it's possible a lone individual, not an entire government, was behind it. ""If it is an attack, it's highly unlikely it's the United States. More likely it's a 15-year-old in a Guy Fawkes mask,"" said Prince, tying the prospective attackers to those connected to or inspired by the hacktivist movement Anonymous. Limited technology, but not when it comes to hacking . Do these outages equal outrage, leaving North Koreans unable to view ""Gangnam Style"" for the 2-billionth-plus time? Have they been frustrated when they tried to check on the latest NBA results for their fantasy teams or engage in heated debates about local, national and international politics? No. There's a reason the Committee to Protect Journalists ranks North Korea second on its list of ""Most Censored Countries."" Only a smattering of ""ruling elites"" can go online freely, leaving the public limited to a ""heavily monitored and censored (intranet) network with no connections to the outside world,"" according to the advocacy group. Widespread computer technology overall isn't a reality in one of the world's poorest and, according to many outsiders, most antiquated countries. A 2012 report from KISA, South Korea's Internet development agency, noted North Korea then had only 1,024 IP addresses -- unique numbers assigned to every device that logs on to the Internet -- in a country of about 25 million people. That figure may not exactly reflect the current usage since, for example, people can use one IP address for several items, but it's still paltry by any modern measure. The United States has more than 1.5 billion IP addresses. Still, even if most North Koreans aren't Web-savvy by design, a dangerous handful of them may be. Jang Se-yul, who claims he worked as a computer expert for North Korea's government before defecting seven years ago, told CNN he thinks that Pyongyang has 1,800 cyberwarriors stationed around the world. He says even the agents themselves don't know how many others work for the secretive group -- called Bureau 121 -- whose mission is to ""conduct cyberattacks against overseas and enemy states."" An FBI investigation linked the malware, infrastructure and techniques used by the Guardians of Peace in the Sony attack to previous North Korean cyberattacks. After that, U.S. President Barack Obama called the hack ""an act of cybervandalism that was very costly, very expensive,"" though he stopped sort of calling it an act of war. The next question is: Will Kim, in Pyongyang, say the same about his country's Internet issues?","Cybersecurity expert: North Korea ""may have disconnected themselves""

"No matter who did it, shooting down a commercial airliner with almost 300 people aboard gravely escalated an already dangerous conflict in eastern Ukraine. The airline disaster Thursday turned what had been regional unrest into a full-blown international conflict, with questions of responsibility, motive and reparations for the families of victims who might come from all over the world. More than that, the tragedy appeared certain to worsen a so-far diplomatic showdown regarding Ukraine with Russia on one side and the United States and the European Union on the other. Already, hawkish Sen. John McCain of Arizona called for a bigger U.S. role if Russia was involved. ""This is a major catastrophe that could potentially have very, very far-reaching implications and geo-strategic meaning right now,"" said CNN Chief International Correspondent Christiane Amanpour. What happened? U.S. intelligence concluded the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down over Ukraine, a senior U.S. official told CNN, adding it wasn't yet clear who did it. Finger-pointing began almost immediately. Ukraine blamed Russian-backed separatists fighting the Ukrainian military in the Donetsk region where the plane went down. The separatists said they lacked the firepower to hit a plane flying at more than 30,000 feet and accused Ukraine of doing it. Military experts noted Russia's military, with forces again massing at the Ukraine border, has the missile systems capable of such a strike. They pointed out that separatist forces recently shot down a Ukrainian transport plane at 21,000 feet, which was out of range of known separatist weaponry. After a classified briefing later Thursday, McCain told reporters that ""the separatists could have only gotten that capability from Russia."" Huge repercussions . Does it matter who did it? Yes and no. The repercussions are huge in any case, but will differ depending on what happened. Regardless of who fired the missile, the impact of such an air disaster means investigations, reports, lawsuits and other bureaucratic responses that continue for years. The international component of passengers potentially hailing from multiple countries adds further complexity, along with the location in a region of low-level warfare in recent months. Already, some international airlines announced they would avoid Ukrainian air space for now, and U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for a ""full and transparent international investigation."" ""If it transpires that the plane was indeed shot down, we insist that the perpetrators must swiftly be brought to justice"" Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said. U.S. response . President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden spoke by phone with Ukrainian President  Petro Poroshenko to offer assistance, and Biden said a team of U.S. aviation experts would head there right away. In language that seemed intended to stoke an emotional response, Biden said that while ""we don't have all the details,"" the plane ""apparently had been shot down. Shot down. Not an accident. Blown out of the sky."" If separatists using Russian firepower or Russian forces did it, the United States and European Union would come under pressure to take tougher steps against Moscow. So far, they have imposed sanctions on Russia and provided economic help and other aid to Ukraine. On Wednesday, Obama announced further sanctions due to Russia's failure to take steps to end the Ukraine conflict. ""This would have the most profound repercussions,"" McCain told CNN of possible Russian responsibility. Later, he told reporters the United States should ""arm the Ukrainian military, which we have shamefully not done, increase sanctions to a dramatic degree"" and treat President Vladimir Putin and Russia ""as a pariah nation, which if, they are responsible for this, they deserve.""

"(CNN) -- Kaci Hickox, a nurse who worked with Doctors Without Borders to treat Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, was placed under mandatory quarantine in New Jersey for three days even though she tested negative for Ebola and is asymptomatic. After much protest, she was finally released on Monday. In her opinion, her ""basic human rights have been violated."" She appeared on CNN and criticized politicians' reactions to Ebola and the lack of forethought and plan. This newest quarantine has us wondering again how far the government can restrain individuals for the common good. No doubt, being physically confined by the government feels like a fundamental violation. But it's rarely a legal violation. For over a hundred years, the Supreme Court and other tribunals have upheld the right of states to enact compulsory laws related to health care issues such as vaccination. The seminal case, Jacobson v. Massachusetts, recognized ""manifold restraints to which every person is necessarily subject for the common good."" So how far does this power to regulate for the public health go? Consider the infamous 1927 case of Buck v. Bell -- a cautionary tale for all medical students -- in which the court upheld a state's involuntary sterilization of ""feebleminded"" persons in state institutions. The court broadened state power drastically to allow forcing unwanted surgery on a female for the express purpose of neutering her. Perhaps most shocking to modern sensibilities was the court's use of the Jacobson logic of contagious diseases. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes stated in a judicial opinion that the ""principle that sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the fallopian tubes"" to avoid further generations of ""imbeciles."" Yes. The Supreme Court actually said that. Since then, the court has specifically recognized that the general health and welfare of the public may require adults be dealt with by compulsory treatment including quarantine, confinement or sequestration. Along with many other cases echoing similar sentiments, little doubt remains about the matter. State governments have historically enjoyed nearly unfettered power to restrain our liberty in the name of public health. These cases were decided in times when crowded urban conditions, less-advanced medicine, and lack of public education required drastic measures to avoid the scourge of disease infection. But times have changed, and the collective views of citizens and governments today bear little resemblance to those of centuries past. Thanks to the dizzying advances in medical sciences and education, the citizen-patient is more informed and empowered. Of course, the unintended side effect of patient autonomy is overreaction. In researching rashes on WebMD, a simple poison ivy may become the bubonic plague in the minds of some. While the Internet unquestionably contributes to quicker and bigger waves of panic, make no mistake -- the connectivity of communication is a boon to, as well as bane of, public health. For example, most of us are aware on some level of the individual right to refuse medical treatment. And most of us have a general understanding of the right to privacy preventing undue interference with a woman's ""right to choose"" abortion. The court cases that protect these liberties may leave the public with a strong and perhaps unrealistic impression about what constitute unassailable, bedrock ""rights."" However, these are actually narrowly defined liberties that affect only one patient's life (and, depending on your view of abortion, the life of a fetus). By contrast, it appears little has changed in the jurisprudence of outbreaks and communicable diseases. The courts continue to recognize the government's broad ""police power"" to legislate for its citizens' health, safety and morals. But state authority is not without limit. States seeking to take your personal liberty with a quarantine must establish necessity, reasonable means, proportionality, and seek to avoid harm. What those concepts actually mean is surely a case-by-case analysis, because it's impossible to know what's reasonable until a medical expert tells us what's reasonable. Hickox's allegation, for example, was that there was no intelligible plan, and therefore no reasonable tailoring of the government intrusion into her liberty. She may be right if the medical evidence supports her view. Still, it's an uphill battle for the nurse-as-plaintiff. It's exceedingly difficult to sue state agencies to begin with. Moreover, courts have upheld compulsory measures on numerous occasions involving vaccinations or quarantines, and even jailing those with serious cases of tuberculosis. Ultimately, other than reproductive freedoms and end-of-life decisions, courts have not recognized a fundamental ""freedom of the body."" What undoubtedly feels to Hickox like a violation of ""basic human rights"" may not automatically be the same as the ""fundamental rights"" closely guarded and scrutinized by the Supreme Court. When it comes to infectious diseases, the collective jurisprudential message is as clear today as it was in centuries past: Public health concerns can warrant the state's intrusion on personal freedoms. The individual's liberty can still theoretically outweigh public safety, but practically, you're talking about convincing a court that your right to walk to the corner store outweighs the risk of an epidemic. Better fire up the Netflix and iTunes, and get comfortable with a couple weeks' house arrest.","Kaci Hickox, who tested negative for Ebola but was quarantined, was finally released .

"(CNN)Zarine and Shafi Khan saw their son growing distant for months. But they say they didn't realize what was happening -- until it was too late. ""For the past few months, he was very quiet and he wanted isolation because he was watching or doing something on social media. And that's why he was brainwashed,"" Zarine Khan said in an exclusive interview with CNN's ""AC360"" Thursday. Now Mohammed Hamzah Khan, 19, is accused of trying to support ISIS. This week he pleaded not guilty to a federal charge of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Outside the courtroom in Chicago, his mother told reporters she had a message for the terror group's leader: ""Leave our children alone."" ""They're misusing the children's innocence,"" Zarine Khan told CNN's Anderson Cooper Thursday. ""The children are gullible. They're vulnerable. Their thinking skills have not completely developed and these people are preying on that."" ISIS, an extremist Islamist group, has been fighting to take over a swath of territory in Iraq and Syria, where it wants to establish a caliphate or Islamic state. The group regularly uses social media to promote its goals, posting videos of brutal violence and using hashtags for other stories in the news to disseminate its message. Authorities arrested Mohammed Khan at O'Hare International Airport in October as he was about to embark on a flight to Istanbul. In a letter he left behind for his parents, he wrote that he was leaving the United States and on his way to join ISIS, according to a criminal complaint. He invited them to join him in the ""Islamic State,"" but he warned them not to tell anyone about his travel plans. The letter shocked them, his mother said. ""The things in those letters did not reflect the upbringing they got. Those values, they don't come from us. It was so out of sync. It was so out of place,"" she said. Thomas Durkin, the teen's attorney, said the case was a sign of ""nothing but immaturity."" ""There are thousands of kids doing this, and I think that's part of the point, what's causing them to do it? I don't believe, in my client's case, it's because he's a violent person and wants to go kill people,"" Durkin said. ""I think he was a misguided young man who got manipulated by social media."" During questioning at the airport, Mohammed Khan told FBI agents that a person he met online had given him the phone number of a person to call once he arrived in Istanbul, federal authorities said in October. That person, Khan allegedly told the agents, was to take him to ISIS territory. According to the complaint, Khan told authorities he was planning on being in some type of public service -- like a police force -- or providing humanitarian work or in a combat role. ISIS has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe, including from the United States and Western Europe. Turkey, the complaint notes, is a common transit point for foreign fighters from Western countries who travel to join ISIS. If it weren't for the Internet, his mother now says, ""he would never be in the situation he is in today."" So what's her message for other parents? ""Maybe the mistake we made was maybe we protected our children. We were trying to protect our culture or values. Maybe that was a mistake,"" Zarine Khan said. ""I would tell them to expose their children more to what's going on in the world, help them develop critical thinking skills to differentiate between the good and the bad guys."" CNN's Michael Martinez and George Howell contributed to this report.","Mohammed Hamzah Khan is accused of trying to support ISIS .

"Prominent Saudi activist Raif Badawi on Wednesday was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes by a Saudi court for insulting Islam, said his wife and a source who followed the case closely. Badawi had appealed his original 2013 conviction, which carried a sentence of seven years in prison and 600 lashes, for insulting Islam and violating the Kingdom's anti-cybercrime laws. That verdict was overturned by an appeals court and a retrial was ordered. Badawi plans to appeal this new decision, said the source, who wished to remain anonymous. ""This is terrible news and I'm absolutely shocked and devastated by it,"" said Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haider. ""How is it possible they could take a sentence that was already so harsh and make it even harsher? Ten years in jail and 1,000 lashes? That's unimaginable. I'm extremely scared for my husband."" The judgment also included a 1 million riyal fine, which is equal to about $267,000. Despite repeated attempts, CNN was unable to reach Saudi Arabia's Justice Ministry for comment. Badawi, a respected rights activist in Saudi Arabia, first got into legal hot water with the Saudi government after starting a liberal website and forum where users could discuss religion. His trial, guilty verdict, sentence and imprisonment has caused immense outrage among international rights groups like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, who accused Saudi authorities of cracking down on activism and attempting to quell dissent in the ultraconservative nation. Amnesty International called Wednesday's judgment outrageous and called for the conviction to be overturned. ""He is a prisoner of conscience who is guilty of nothing more than daring to create a public forum for discussion and peacefully exercising the right to freedom of expression.,"" said Philip Luther, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Amnesty International. In the last few months, the Saudi government has passed a series of very strong anti-terror laws that many rights groups fear will be used, among other things, as a way to quash dissent . Last year, prominent rights and reform activists Mohammed Al-Qahtani and Abdullah Al-Hamid were each sentenced to 10 years in prison. Badawi's appeal will be complicated because his attorney and brother-in-law, Waleed Abulkhair, recently was put on trial for undermining the image of the kingdom and breaking allegiance with the King. Last month, he was detained without explanation during his trial and has been jailed since, according to numerous rights activists and his wife, Samar Badawi.

"Nine Air Force commanders lost their jobs in the wake of a cheating scandal involving systemic cheating on tests by officers in the U.S. nuclear missile program, officials from that military branch said Thursday. The fired officers were in ""leadership positions"" at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana, Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said.  Though not directly involved in cheating, ""they failed to provide adequate oversight of their crew force,"" according to James. In addition, Col. Robert Stanley -- head of the 341st Missile Wing and a 25-year veteran -- ""relinquished command"" and submitted his resignation Thursday morning, said Lt. Gen. Stephen Wilson, the commander of the Air Force's Global Strike Command. ""Leadership's focus on perfection led commanders to micromanage their people,"" said Wilson, pointing to pressure to get 100% scores on monthly proficiency exams when only 90% was necessary to pass. ""... Leaders lost sight of the fact that execution in the field is more important than what happens in the classroom."" James said Thursday that 100 lower-level officers were at one point implicated in the ordeal -- having either been accused directly of cheating or having looked the other way. Nine of those have been cleared and will be allowed to return to duty, while others could face punishments ranging from letters of counseling to courts-martial on various charges. These disciplinary measures are only part of the response, however. James and Wilson both referred to a number of changes to address this incident as well as far-reaching issues with morale, micromanagement and more among those in the Air Force's intercontinental ballistic missile program. ""The issues that we have before us today are tough, and they didn't come overnight,"" said James. ""... While we have progress in certain areas in recent years, there is more work to be done."" Military investigators stumbled into the cheating scandal while looking into alleged drug activity involving airmen. Three of their targets in the drug probe happened to work as missile crew members at Malmstrom, which is how investigators got access to their cell phones -- and ""found test material on them,"" according to Wilson. Authorities previously said the cheating took place last August and September at the Montana base, with officers using texts and pictures to cheat on their proficiency exams. But Wilson said Thursday that such behavior actually went well beyond that, having occurred as far back as November 2011 and as recently as November 2013. The whole Malmstrom scheme centered on four individuals, three of whom were being investigated in the drug probe, according to Wilson. ""If we would have removed those, then this incident probably would never have happened,"" he added. About 190 officers oversee the readiness of nuclear weapons systems at the Montana base, meaning the episode tainted a large percentage of that force in some way. James said she found worrisome not just that airmen cheated directly, but that no one -- whether or not they were directly involved -- spoke up. The Air Force officials said investigators didn't find any indication of similar cheating on other bases tied to the missile program, though they pointed to common issues elsewhere when it comes to the program's management. To that end, Wilson said he has a list of ""400 action items"" to possible address those issues. Some are simple, like grading the monthly proficiency on a simple pass/fail metric. Others are more complicated, though all have a common aim of ensuring the nuclear weapons program is run smartly and effectively by satisfied, capable military personnel with high integrity. ""Our nation demands and deserves the higher standards of accountability from the force entrusted with the most powerful weapon on the planet,"" Wilson said.

"(CNN)Enjoying the first bite of a fresh juicy plum may well be described as a simple pleasure, but the process from farm to mouth involves careful planning and precision. In South Africa, the journey for many plums starts in the picturesque Franschhoek Valley in the Western Cape, where the climate is well-suited for growing the stone fruit. ""We've got a slightly cooler summer than the rest of the area,"" explains Jan Hoon Marketing Manager at Franschhoek Fruit Packers. ""Plums prefer cooler temperatures during the growing area of the plum, from after flowering until harvesting. So the time of the fruit on the tree is more, compared to other areas."" And it is plums that are the most important stone fruit to the South African economy, making up a bigger share of both production and exports than peaches and apricots. According to horticultural experts Hortgro, almost 16 million cartons of stone fruit were exported during the 2013-14 season, of which 10.5 million cartons were plums. Tight timing . Hoon and his team are focused on getting the stone fruit out of the orchard, into the pack shed and off to market -- largely in Europe and the Middle East. In fact, approximately 70% of plums grown in South Africa are destined to be sold overseas. ""They must be shipped for four weeks,"" explains technical and quality assistant Ilse Botha. ""By the time they reach the market they [must be] completely edible and sweet."" Fortune Plums are a red variety with yellow flesh, but Hoon and Botha must pack the stone fruit before they are fully ripe and colored. ""If you don't pick it at the right maturity, then it doesn't get overseas at the right eating quality,"" explains fruit farmer Tol Malherbe. ""We do [check] pressures to see that the maturity is right,"" he continues. ""As soon as we do that it will go into the cold room for a day to cool it down after we pick it...Then we take it out and pack it and we ship it."" According to the National Agricultural Marketing Council, plum production in South Africa has increased from 60,000 tons in 2009/2010 to nearly 80,000 tons in 2013/2014.  And Hortgro is expecting  plum shipments to increase by around 10% this year. But to ensure these forecasts are met, farmers like Malherbe need the right climatic conditions. ""Weather is quite a big factor for the plum industry,"" Malherbe explains. ""If it rains, then we don't have fruit on the trees or very little and if the weather is too dry or too hot then we've got smaller fruit...This year we are seven to 10 days earlier than last year, so the fruit is much smaller than the previous year."" Meeting standards . In order to export fruit, certain criteria need to be met. Essential for plum producers is the Global Gap food safety certification, which gives shop customers and retailers in 118 countries the ability to trace a product right back to the farm. Fruit producers must also comply with standards set by the Sustainability Initiative of South Africa, which was established by the South African fruit industry to make sure labor practices in orchards and pack sheds are ethical. ""They've got eight minimum steps; forced labor, child labor, hours working of the laborers,"" explains Malherbe. ""All that stuff needs to be in place on the farm and that's quite a lot of paperwork that needs to be done."" But, for a company focused on selling abroad, the challenges don't stop with paperwork. As the African market for stone fruit grows by 100 per cent year on year, the growers and producers need to adapt to the market. ""The infrastructure in Africa is very limited at the moment,"" says Hoon. ""Not a lot of cold storages around in Africa. There are only a certain amount of plum varieties we are capable of exporting into Africa, but definitely Africa is a growing market."" But Hoon is also clear that the current established markets will continue to be important for the South African stone fruit industry. ""Our advantage is that we are almost 10 days quicker on transit time from South Africa into the European markets so in general in the stone fruit season in we produce about 60/70% of the out of season stone fruit production for Europe,"" he explains. ""We need to be better than our competition, which is mainly South America, so we just need to outperform them and deliver better quality for the markets.""

"New Zealand is set to become the one of the latest nations to allow same-sex marriage after the country's Parliament passed a bill legalizing the practice Wednesday. Parliament voted 77-44 on the bill's third reading, which is the penultimate step to enact laws in New Zealand. The final step, in which the governor-general gives royal assent, is generally a given. Local media report that the law is expected to take effect in four months. The bill's sponsor, Louisa Wall, released a statement saying she was ""very proud to be a member of a Parliament that has voted overwhelmingly to give New Zealanders, regardless of their sex, sexual orientation or gender, the right to marry."" New Zealand's move comes a week after Uruguayan lawmakers approved a measure legalizing same-sex marriage. The measure awaits the signature of Uruguay's president, who has indicated he supports it. If the laws in New Zealand and Uruguay are enacted, the count of nations allowing same-sex marriage would rise to 13. Lawmakers in a few other nations, including the United Kingdom and France, also are considering whether to allow same-sex couples to marry. The Supreme Court of Nepal ruled in favor of legalization in 2008, but those rights haven't been put into effect because the country's new constitution has been stuck in limbo for years. Of the 11 countries in which same-sex marriage is legal, eight are in Europe. The Netherlands was the first, in 2001, and it was later joined by Belgium, Spain, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Portugal and Denmark. Argentina, Canada and South Africa are the three non-European countries in the group.","Parliament votes 77-44 on bill's third reading .

"South Africans turned out Wednesday for their country's first elections since the death of Nelson Mandela, a process that's expected to dent but not end the hold of the party to which he'd long been associated. The party Mandela once led, the governing African National Congress, held an advantage based on very early results around midnight on Wednesday, according to the South African Press Association. Once all of the votes are counted, the ANC is expected to hold onto power. But it may have its grip weakened amid growing discontent, particularly among urban voters. The ANC, which has governed for the past 20 years, still enjoys widespread support as the party that represents the defeat of the apartheid system and the beginning of democracy in South Afprica. But with President Jacob Zuma dogged by scandals, economic difficulties and concerns over reports of rising corruption, the ANC could see its share of the vote fall from the 65.9% it won in the 2009 elections. ""Many are hoping that the ANC will get a scare in these elections and begin to reflect on some of its failures,"" wrote South African political commentator Justice Malala in an opinion article for CNN. If the party's share of the vote drops to 63% or below, Malala said, it will mean that ""the party is experiencing its second significant decline in two successive elections."" Elections called 'a resounding success' At the forefront of the issues that have blighted Zuma's presidency is a scandal over his rural homestead in Nkandla, in the province of KwaZulu Natal. The state watchdog has alleged that more than $20 million of public money was misused in improvements to the sprawling complex. Zuma has denied any wrongdoing. But among Zuma's support base in areas like KwaZulu Natal, many people remain loyal. ""Frankly they do not see a problem with him having let his home in Nkandla be refurbished at such a high price. In fact they see it as part of the perks of being a ruler,"" said Achille Mbembe, a professor at the Wits Institute for Social and Economic Research in Johannesburg. Voting began Wednesday at 7 a.m at more than 22,000 polling stations across the country and finished at 9 p.m., the press association reported. The millions of voters were charged with electing 400 members of Parliament, as well as representatives in new legislatures in South Africa's nine provinces, SAPA said. While it didn't provide specifics, South Africa's Government Communication and Information System reported ""great turnout of voters, in particular first-time voters."" The same agency added late Wednesday that security forces were on ""high alert"" throughout the day, arresting 97 people for election-related offenses. The GCIS didn't report any violence, but noted the deaths of four people: two who died while waiting to vote, plus two party agents killed in a car accident. ""Government wishes to commend all South Africans for the part they have played in making our elections a resounding success,"" the agency said. ""... The nation's fifth democratic elections have undoubtedly added to our legacy of regular and peaceful elections."" SAPA reported that the Economic Freedom Fighters party had contested that account, claiming the process was flawed and that some people were allowed to vote more than once. Past and future . The ANC is facing its biggest challenges in cities, where analysts say discontent is on the rise, notably among young people, over a lack of quality education and jobs. ""Increasingly, South Africa feels like a country caught between its past and its future,"" Malala said. The situation is compounded by the fact that many disillusioned young people aren't registered to vote. Opposition leaders like Mmuse Maimane of the Democratic Alliance are seeking to connect with younger voters. ""It's key that they establish their own future, their new freedom, their new South Africa,"" he said ahead of the election. The Economic Freedom Fighters, a young party formed a few months ago by expelled former ANC Youth leader Julius Malema, is also trying to loosen the governing party's grip on power. The Democratic Alliance is quickly adapting itself from its reputation as a ""white party,"" and the EFF is fast becoming a player on the national stage, Malala said, but ""both parties are only likely to give the ANC a real run for its money in the 2019 and 2024 elections.""","The Economic Freedom Fighters party says vote was not fair .

"(CNN)The difference between the scale of the European terrorist threat and the threat in the United States was underlined by Wednesday's arrest of Christopher Lee Cornell, a 20-year-old Ohio resident, who had been monitored by an FBI informant and was allegedly plotting an attack, inspired by ISIS, against the U.S. Capitol. One day after Cornell's arrest Belgian authorities took down a group they believed was plotting imminent attacks, resulting in a battle with the suspects who opened fire with military weaponry and handguns. Two of the suspects were killed. Some members of the group had reportedly returned from fighting in Syria with ISIS. The two cases could hardly be more different. In Ohio, we saw the arrest of a classic lone wolf allegedly inspired by ISIS with aspirations to carry out an attack but scant capabilities, while in Belgium we saw the takedown of what appears to have been an ISIS cell with serious capacities for attack. This contrast can also be seen if we carefully analyze the tactics and characteristics of last week's Paris attacks and compare them with the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013. In Paris jihadist terrorists killed 17 people in a series of attacks, beginning with the assault on the offices of Charlie Hebdo, followed by the killing of a policewoman and a hostage-taking in a kosher grocery. The attacks received sustained global media coverage throughout the three days that they unfolded. In addition to the three shooters, at least a dozen others are suspected of some kind of involvement in the Paris attacks. The attackers had a substantial weapons cache, including assault rifles, Molotov cocktails, a grenade and even a rocket-propelled grenade. They also had bulletproof vests. Two of the attackers had traveled to Yemen, where they received training from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The attacks in Paris were the most deadly by jihadists in Europe in a decade. The terrorists adopted so-called Fedayeen -- ""those who sacrifice themselves"" -- tactics in which armed men assault targets with the intention of fighting to the death to prolong the battle as long as possible, thereby maximizing media coverage and the number of casualties. The most deadly example of such an attack were the assaults in Mumbai, India, in 2008 by 10 Pakistani Lashkar-e-Taiba operatives, which killed 166 people. Similar to those in Paris, the Mumbai attacks involved multiple targets, the operatives were armed with assault rifles, and the men had received training from a terrorist organization. The Mumbai attacks lasted four days, and they were intensively covered by media from around the world. On the other end of the spectrum, the Boston Marathon bombing provides an example of a less sophisticated attempt at a Fedayeen-style attack. On April 15, 2013, Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated two bombs along the route of the Boston Marathon, killing three people. Three days later the Tsarnaevs allegedly shot and killed a police officer at the campus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and in the early morning of April 19 the Tsarnaevs had an intense firefight with police in which Tamerlan was killed and Dzhokhar was wounded and later taken into custody. As was the case in Paris, the Boston bombers had multiple targets, and the attackers appear to have intended to conduct attacks until they died. However, the bombers were not trained abroad by a terrorist group; they were not part of a larger group of conspirators, and they were not as well-armed as the Paris conspirators. The Paris terrorists were more sophisticated in their tactics and training than the Boston bombers, but the Paris attacks were far less sophisticated than the attacks in Mumbai. The terrorists in Mumbai received direction on their cell phones throughout their assault from their commanders who were manning a control room in Pakistan. The Mumbai attacks also involved a larger number of people  -- the 10 gunmen who infiltrated India as well as many others who provided training and support from Pakistan during the attack. The Paris attacks were, in short, a hybrid of the terrorist tactics that we saw in Boston with the tactics we saw in Mumbai. U.S. security officials warn that the United States is at risk of similar attacks to those that occurred in Paris. Attorney General Eric Holder told CNN's State of the Union, ""What we saw in France over the course of this last week is unfortunately what we're going to have to confront in the future."" The United States is certainly at risk of some version of a Paris-like attack using Fedayeen-style tactics. After all, a much-less sophisticated version -- the Boston attacks in 2013 -- has already happened. However, the history of jihadist plots inside the United States since 9/11 suggests that the combination of terrorist characteristics and tactics that we saw in the Paris attacks would be unusual in the United States. In none of the deadly attacks conducted in the United States since 9/11 have the participants received training from terrorist organizations abroad. Carlos Bledsoe, who killed a U.S. soldier in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 2009; Maj. Nidal Hasan, who killed 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, the same year; and the Boston bombers were all so-called lone wolves, none of whom had training or direction from a terrorist organization. These are in marked contrast with France. As The New York Times notes thousands of French citizens have traveled to fight in Syria or Iraq and 200 have returned, a far less manageable challenge than the 150 or so Americans who have reportedly gone or attempted to go to fight in the Syrian conflict. Of those Americans, only about a dozen have joined jihadist groups, according to FBI Director James Comey. This is not to say that Holder's warnings should be dismissed. Firearms are, of course, widely available in the United States, and one can certainly imagine a jihadist group forming to conduct an armed assault. A few such plots involving more than one or two lone wolves have been foiled in the United States -- although none in the past few years. In 2009, for instance, the FBI arrested a group of seven men in North Carolina led by Daniel Boyd, who had amassed firearms and plotted attacks in the United States. The plot was foiled because informants had long monitored it after Boyd's activities came to the FBI's attention in 2005. Perhaps the closest the United States came to seeing an armed assault similar to the one in Paris was in 2005 when Kevin James, Levar Washington, Hammad Riaz Samana and Gregory Patterson plotted attacks on a number of locations in California, including synagogues. The group was arrested after law enforcement linked the members to a robbery. The militants had no links to foreign terrorist organizations. Nor is the United States immune to plotting by individuals with training by terrorist groups abroad. In 2009, three men -- Najibullah Zazi, Zarein Ahmedzay and Adis Medunjanin -- all of whom received weapons training in Pakistan's tribal areas, plotted to bomb the New York subway but were arrested before they could do so. Similarly, in 2010, Faisal Shahzad, who was trained in Pakistan, tried to blow up an SUV in Times Square. The bomb failed to detonate properly. Given this history, it would be unwise to ignore Holder's warnings of the potential of Paris-like attacks inside the United States. However, there are real differences between the scale of the threat from terrorists in the United States compared with the scale of the threat in France, and American policymakers and commentators should be careful to make those differences clear when speaking to the public.","Attorney General Eric Holder has warned of Paris-like attacks in the United States .
Peter Bergen says so far attacks have been less sophisticated domestically than in Europe ."
"(CNN)As police across the South search for a teenage couple on the run, a mother in Kentucky has a message for her son. ""We know they've done wrong but you need to step up and take the consequences of what you done and come home before someone is really, really hurt,"" Tammy Martin, mother of Dalton Hayes, told CNN affiliate WAVE. Hayes, 18, and Cheyenne Phillips, 13, are suspected of stealing three cars -- two with guns inside -- and are the subject of a law enforcement search that stretches from Kentucky to Georgia -- and maybe on to Florida. ""I don't know why they're doing it,"" Martin said. ""I just wish they would turn themselves in."" Martin said that until recently she and her son thought Phillips was much older than 13, WAVE reported. The couple had not been dating long, she said. Phillips' mother, Sherry Peters, says she, too, wants her child to come home. ""I really want them to just turn themselves in,"" she said. ""I haven't been sleeping very well lately."" Hayes and Phillips are ""increasingly brazen and dangerous,"" Sheriff Norman Chaffins of Grayson County, Kentucky, said in a press release. ""I know Dalton and he has a history of making bad, bad decisions,"" said Chaffins, sheriff for the county of about 25,000 people in central Kentucky. ""I was the school resource officer before I was elected sheriff. Dalton is known to have disciplinary and defiance issues at the high school with authority."" Hayes was recently charged with burglary and was out on bond, the sheriff said. He's worried things will end badly as the two get farther and farther from home. ""They are in strange territory,"" Chaffins said. ""We are a local, tight-knit community here, we just want them home ... other agencies see them as criminals stealing cars. They would be treated differently than they would be in our county."" It was not clear whether any formal charges have been filed against either teen. The sheriff has referred to them several times as ""suspects."" Cheyenne's father reported her missing January 3 from Clarkson, Kentucky. Chaffins said she was thought to be in the company of Hayes. Chaffins said the couple first stole a truck in Clarkson. Jim McGrew, its owner, told WAVE the teens took the truck out of his garage and sped down the road before crashing into a fence and fleeing on foot. Police searched and McGrew said he flew his private plane to look for the couple. The wreck caused about $7,100 in damage to the truck, McGrew told WAVE. An hour later, the couple stole a 2006 Toyota Tacoma pickup truck with a firearm inside, Chaffins said. Both teens are suspects in the two felony auto thefts and Hayes is wanted for custodial interference. ""It is imperative that these two be located and apprehended as their behavior is becoming increasingly brazen and dangerous,"" the sheriff said in a press release. On Wednesday, the sheriff's department said the couple was spotted on security-camera video at a Walmart store in Manning, South Carolina. The girl was wearing pink cowboy boots, and the man with her was dressed in a dark-colored University of Kentucky T-shirt, the department said. On Thursday, authorities said the Toyota Tacoma pickup stolen in Kentucky was recovered in Henry County, Georgia, just south of Atlanta. A silver 2001 Toyota Tundra pickup with a Georgia certified firefighter license plate was reported stolen from the area around the same time. That truck had two handguns -- a .38-caliber and .a 45-caliber -- inside, the sheriff's department said. The sheriff said the two teens may be headed to Florida. ""They are becoming increasingly desperate and we just hope they have enough sense to do the right thing,"" he said. Martin told WAVE she last heard from her son in a January 6 text message. ""It says 'Mommy, don't worry. I'm fine, okay -- plenty of money and food. Love you, good night, sweet dreams,'"" Martin said.

"(CNN)Thailand could soon recognize a third gender category for the first time in the country's constitution. ""It is a human right if you were born a male or female and you want to have a sex change or lead a life of a different gender,"" said Kamnoon Sittisamarn, the spokesperson of Constitution Drafting Committee, which is working on a new draft of the country's constitution. ""People should have [that] freedom to change sex and they should be equally protected by the Constitution and the law and treated fairly."" Third gender means that an individual does not have to identify as either male or female, and gives their right to self-identify. If enacted, Thailand would join several Asian countries, including India, Pakistan and Nepal, that have recently moved to recognize third gender. This week, the Constitution Drafting Committee, a panel tapped by the current Thai military junta, started work on a new draft. The junta, which calls itself the National Council for Peace and Order, took power in May after a military coup. The old constitution recognizes people of different religion, age, gender -- but had not extended to transgender people. ""It is now time to recognize the existence of the third gender in Thai society,"" said Sittisamarn. ""So we expand the region of protection as well."" ""Hopefully introducing third gender will help reduce discrimination in society."" The Constitution Drafting Committee is expected to consider various components of Thai law and submit it to review by April. The decision to legalize the Constitution will be made on August 6. Acceptance in Thailand . There's a perception that transgender people are well accepted in Thailand, due to the availability of gender reassignment surgery. But challenges still exist, several transgender people living in Bangkok told CNN. ""First of all in Thailand, we're pretty well-accepted, we can walk in the street and we don't have to fear that someone's going to shoot you in the head. At the same time, the most difficult thing is at a professional level, that people don't accept people like us,"" said Jenisa Limpanilchart, a businessperson. It's difficult for transgender people, despite their education level, to get hired and accepted by companies, she added. And matters like which locker room or bathroom to use become a human resources issue. And there is no legal recourse when discrimination occurs, because there have been no laws to protect them, said Kath Khangpiboon, a transgender activist with the Thai Transgender Alliance in Bangkok. Another problem is that the gender marked on government documents doesn't match how individuals identify their gender. When Khangpiboon travels, she gets pulled out of immigration lines for questioning by officials because of the gender marked on her passport. ""For trans people, we cannot change our title name. I'm still a 'mister' in my country. I cannot change my title. My name is Mr. Kath,"" said Khangpiboon, a transgender woman. While recognizing the third gender would not resolve all the challenges, it would be ""history"" for our advocacy work, she added. More nations recognize third gender . Earlier last year, India's Supreme Court granted the country's transsexual and transgender individuals the right to self-identify their gender. Asian countries including Nepal, Pakistan and Bangladesh have implemented policies recognizing third gender in recent years. Australia started allowing a third gender option in passports in 2011.  According to a 2012 report by the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, 20 countries have passed progressive legislation on the issue, including Argentina, Uruguay, and Portugal. Even as transgender people are no longer forced to conform to specific genders in certain countries, they are still denied acceptance in many societies. Same-sex marriage remains illegal in countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Bhutan. And Thailand does not have plans to legalize same sex marriages in its constitution, said Sittisamarn.","Thailand constitution looks to recognize third gender .

"(CNN)The popular Pope Francis is taking some hits himself after some lighthearted comments that included a pretend punch to a colleague. The comments came while trying to make the point that free speech should have some limits, including on the right to insult another's faith. Speaking Thursday to reporters on the plane ride to the Philippines, the Pope gestured with a fake punch to demonstrate what he would do if someone were to say ""a swear word against my mother."" Most journalists interpreted it as a joke, not a justification of violence, especially since the Pope had also just forcefully stated that ""one cannot kill in the name of God."" Still, the Vatican felt the need to clarify, in response to a later CNN question about the punch, that his words were ""spoken colloquially"" and consistent with the Pope's ""free style of speech."" I don't for one minute think the Pope is advocating for any type of violence, whether religiously motivated murder or sparring among friends who dis each other's mamas. What concerns me is his apparent belief that religion should have special protection when it comes to free speech. ""One cannot provoke, one cannot insult other people's faith, one cannot make fun of faith,"" he said. ""There is a limit. Every religion has its dignity. ... In freedom of expression there are limits."" The Pope, responding to a general question about the interplay between religious liberty and free expression, was clearly referencing the massacre of journalists at Charlie Hebdo magazine by Islamist militants in Paris last week. Although he did not say the slain cartoonists brought the attack upon themselves because of their satirical criticism of Islam, it's not a huge logical leap to that conclusion and raises the likelihood of such a misinterpretation. Let's just say it's not what most public relations professionals would advise. And while the Pope has been known to talk more informally with reporters on the papal plane (his ""Who am I to judge?"" comment about gay Catholics came on the return flight from Brazil in 2013), he's still on the record and obviously aware that his words will be reported and analyzed. The Pope is not the only prominent Catholic raising the issue. Bill Donahue, a self-appointed spokesman fighting ""anti-Catholicism"" as the president of the New York-based Catholic League, released a statement with the headline, ""Muslims have a right to be angry,"" on the day of the killings. On Thursday, his statement was headlined: ""Pope sides with Catholic League."" Such chutzpah. While no one can match the offensive tone of Donahue, who actually said Charlie Hebdo's Stephane Charbonnier ""didn't understand the role he played in his own death,"" the gist of the Pope's message was the same: Criticism of religion is problematic. As an aside, I'll be curious to see if those who slammed Donahue have the same harsh words for the Pope. Perhaps both of them should take a lesson from the response of another Christian, Jim Wallis, president of Sojourners, a progressive, evangelical community and publication. He had a different suggestion for how people of faith should respond to the Paris attacks: . ""Jesus tells us to bless those who persecute us, to return love for hate and good for evil, and even to love our enemies,"" Wallis wrote. ""Loving your enemies certainly includes supporting the foundational commitment to free speech, and defending the right of free speech, even, or especially, for those who offend you."" I think most American Catholics agree that while blasphemy -- offensive speech against God or religion -- is not particularly nice, it does not follow that it can or should be regulated or outlawed. In the United States, the Supreme Court outlawed blasphemy laws in 1952. I'm hoping the Pope was only offering counsel to his followers, rather than advocating for any sort of legal position. No one has the right not to be offended. Even the Pope.","Heidi Schlumpf: Pope told reporters one can't insult others' faith, expression must have limits .

"The smallest boat moored at the Hemingway Marina in Havana may hold the most intrigue. Hunkered down inside a blue, 25-foot sailboat named Salty are Josh Hakken and his wife, Sharyn, and their two boys, 2-year-old Chase and 4-year-old Cole. Theirs is no ordinary visit to the historic port, where they have eluded capture but where CNN found them Tuesday. The Hakkens have been on the lam after they allegedly snatched the two boys from their grandmother's home in Florida. The couple lost custody of their children last year. There is an international manhunt for this family, and here they are, blending in among the other boats. But their stop appears likely to be temporary, as Cuban officials announced Tuesday afternoon that they plan to turn the family over to U.S. authorities. Josh Hakken glared through his sunglasses at the CNN reporter who found him and said nothing beyond confirming his identity. The two boys are OK, said a woman matching the description of his wife, and she left it at that. Josh and Sharyn Hakken are wanted by U.S. authorities and were not in custody in Cuba. But that doesn't mean they aren't being watched. Cuban security officials wearing sidearms appeared as the CNN video crew was filming and ordered them to stop. At the security guards' request, CNN stepped away from the boat, which looked just like the photo that Florida law enforcement officials had circulated, except more battered. A statement from the Cuban foreign ministry said the boat put in to the marina, located a few miles west of Havana, in bad weather on Sunday. ""From the first moment, diplomatic notes were exchanged and a permanent and professional communication has been maintained between MINREX"" -- Cuba's foreign ministry -- ""and the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, with the goal of guaranteeing the integrity and well-being of the minors,"" the statement said. Joshua Hakken: Libertarian washed ashore in the worker's paradise . U.S. government officials have told the sheriff's office in Hillsborough County, Florida -- which includes the city of Tampa from which the boys went missing -- that ""they are receiving exceptional cooperation from the Cuban government,"" the sheriff's office said Tuesday afternoon. Earlier in the day, U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said the State Department is aware of the case, though it could not provide additional information because of privacy concerns. ""But what I do want to say, more broadly speaking, is that one of the  department's highest priorities is the welfare of U.S. citizens overseas, and this is particularly true for children who are our most vulnerable citizens,"" Ventrell said. Some worried that recovering the children will be difficult. ""Unfortunately, these parents and these poor children, these innocent ones, will now be in a country where there are no laws, there is no redress, and that has been a refuge for fugitives and wanted criminals for many years,"" Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R- Florida, told CNN. The boys had been removed from the care of the Florida couple last year, and on April 2, the couple's parental rights were terminated in Louisiana, investigators say. The Hillsborough County sheriff's office described Josh Hakken as an anti-government protester, and he was believed to be armed, according to the Hillsborough County sheriff's office. There is no extradition treaty between Cuba and the United States, although there have been recent cases in which Americans sought for crimes in the United States and discovered in Havana have been sent back by the Cubans. The FBI currently estimates there are around 70 fugitives from U.S. justice in Cuba, which is one of the reasons Cuba remains on the U.S. list of countries that support state terrorism. Most of the American fugitives in Cuba have been there for decades and have ties to revolutionary movements or radical groups. Last week, the police department in Slidell, Louisiana, issued its own statement offering background on the Hakkens and why the boys were taken from the parents last year. In June of 2012, Slidell police responded to a disturbance report at a hotel where Josh and Sharyn Hakken were staying with their sons, the police statement said. ""When police arrived, both Mr. and Mrs. Hakken were acting in a bizarre manner that alarmed officers. They were talking about 'completing their ultimate journey' and were traveling across the country to 'take a journey to the Armageddon',"" the Slidell police statement said, adding, ""Let it be noted that both of their children were present in the hotel room at the time."" Because of the parents' behavior and ""the fact that narcotics and weapons were located inside of the hotel room,"" the children were taken by child welfare officers, and Joshua Hakken was arrested on drug charges, the statement said. ""Approximately two weeks later, Slidell Police were notified that Mr. Hakken had shown up to the foster family home ... with a firearm demanding the return of his children,"" the Slidell police statement continued. ""The foster parents called 911, and Mr. Hakken fled without his children. We have heard nothing until (Wednesday)."" At some point over the past few months, the children were sent to live with their grandmother, Patricia Hauser, the mother of Sharyn Hakken. Sheriff's investigators say Josh Hakken entered Hauser's home at 6:30 a.m. last Wednesday. She told police that he tied her up and fled with the children in her silver 2009 Toyota Camry. That vehicle was found later that day just a couple of blocks away from the home.

"Moscow (CNN) -- Russian investigators said Wednesday they had found narcotics on a Greenpeace ship whose crew was detained in the Arctic last month -- an allegation quickly disputed by Greenpeace as a smear. Some of the 30 people who were aboard the icebreaker Arctic Sunrise are likely to face additional charges, the Russian Investigative Committee said. Authorities say they think the narcotics include opium. The 28 Greenpeace activists and two journalists who were arrested on the ship as they protested Arctic drilling already face piracy charges. All 30 pleaded not guilty in court last week. The Investigative Committee said Russian experts were looking into the ""origin and purpose"" of the drugs seized, which it described as ""presumably opium straw and morphine."" Greenpeace said the claim that Russian authorities had found drugs on the vessel ""is a smear, it's a fabrication, pure and simple."" ""We assume this announcement is designed to deflect attention from the growing global outrage over the continued imprisonment of the detainees,"" it said in a written statement. The environmental campaign group has repeatedly condemned the detention of its activists, saying they were taking part in a peaceful protest against the ""slow but unrelenting destruction of the Arctic."" Russian authorities made the arrests after two of the activists left the Arctic Sunrise and tried to climb the side of an oil platform owned by the Russian energy giant Gazprom in the Barents Sea. The government in the Netherlands -- where the Arctic Sunrise is registered -- wrote to the Dutch parliament Friday to say it has launched legal action aimed at freeing the 30 under the U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea. Two of those detained are Dutch citizens. Greenpeace holds vigil, Dutch launch legal action . The defendants also include Americans Peter Wilcox, who is the captain of the Arctic Sunrise, and Dmitry Litvinov, who Greenpeace says also holds Swedish citizenship. The other detainees are from Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Britain, New Zealand, Ukraine, Russia, France, Italy, Turkey, Finland, Switzerland, Poland, the United States and Sweden, the group said. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison. Greenpeace ship captain defies orders, Russians resort to towing . Lawyers acting on Greenpeace's behalf have filed appeals in court seeking the defendants' release, Greenpeace said. Russian authorities accuse the defendants of trying to commandeer the platform.

"(CNN) -- Downpours subsided temporarily in the Philippines on Sunday, a day after Tropical Storm Ketsana pummeled the capital Manila with its heaviest rainfall in more than 40 years. Filipino pedestrians in Quezon City, a suburb of Manila, brave Tropical Storm Ketsana's floodwaters. Flood spawned by the rainfall killed at least 75 people with at least 21 others missing, the government said. More than 80 percent of the capital was under water that swallowed whole houses and buses. Manila, in the island of Luzon, and the nearby province of Rizal bore the brunt of the storm. People huddled on rooftops Sunday waiting on army helicopters to pluck them to safety. Others used ropes to wade through waist-deep muddy waters. Power and water supply failed in some areas. Roads were rendered impassable, making rescue efforts challenging. Are you there? Share your story or pictures . ""Right now the challenge is to find out how many people have actually died and how many people we have to take care of in terms of people who've been displaced,"" said Richard Gordon, the chairman of the Philippines National Red Cross. ""We're really talking about maybe hundreds of thousands of people,"" with about 280,000 to 300,000 displaced in the island of Luzon alone, he said. Though the Philippines is no stranger to floods, Saturday's downpours approached a record, with a month's worth of rain falling within six hours. The average rainfall for the entire month of September is 391 mm (15.4 inches), said Gilberto Teodoro, secretary of national defense and chairman of the National Disaster Coordinating Council. The capital experienced 341 mm (13.4 inches) between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., he said. Officials worried that if the rains return, they could bring more floods if reservoirs burst. ""We're hoping that there will be no more breaching of the dams,"" Gordon said. ""That's one of the things that are very disconcerting to many people right now."" Mike Anthony Catuira spent Sunday retrieving valuable belongings and seeking cover on higher ground.

""He informed them that he was a Russian diplomat but they proceeded anyway,"" she said. She said the men used physical force against the diplomat before handcuffing him and taking him to the police station, where he was kept for several hours without the chance to call the embassy, Sarenkova said.

"Washington (CNN)A key staffer for former Rep. Michele Bachmann's ill-fated 2012 presidential campaign in Iowa has signed on to retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson's developing shadow campaign. Ryan Rhodes, who served as Bachmann's tea party outreach director in the state, told CNN in an interview he's joining the American Legacy Center, a conservative policy group that would likely form the basis for a Carson campaign if he decides to run. ""Iowa's obviously very important as it goes on the national stage and as it relates to the presidential. That's where the action is,"" Rhodes said. Rhodes said in his new role for the group he would be connecting Carson with activists when the retired neurosurgeon visits the key early-caucus state, and spreading Carson's message to potential supporters there. ""As [Carson's] preparing to make his decision, we're going to be out here advocating for the issues that are important to him,"" he said. ""Everybody is looking for the candidates to come through. A lot of people don't really make their decision until after they've gotten to talk to the candidates."" Rhodes told Real Clear Politics, which first reported the news of his hiring, that he was contacted by multiple potential presidential contenders and chose to go with Carson because ""he is the embodiment of the American dream and there's no better person to advocate restoring the American dream than Ben."" The tea party activist endorsed Bachmann shortly before her unexpected win of the Ames Straw Poll in 2011, and later joined her campaign. Bachmann, however, ultimately came in sixth in the 2012 Iowa caucuses, a finish that doomed her candidacy early on. But Rhodes remains a prominent figure in conservative circles in the state, and his hiring by a group linked to Carson suggests the rising conservative star is getting serious about a potential run. Carson makes case for White House bid . A strong finish in this year's Ames Straw Poll could put Carson on the map in the race, much as it did for Bachmann. And his growing following has forced establishment Republicans to get serious about him. Carson polled third in a CNN/ORC survey of the potential presidential field conducted late last month, and was invited to speak at the Republican National Committee's winter meeting this week. While there, however, he displayed the very penchant for off-the-cuff controversial remarks that has establishment Republicans still wary of him, suggesting ISIS offers an example of an admirable commitment to principles that the U.S. lacks.","Ryan Rhodes, who served as Bachmann's tea party outreach director in Iowa, has joined a pro-Ben Carson group .

"No troops to Iraq, but other options are being considered. That was President Barack Obama's message Friday in response to the lightning advance by Sunni militant fighters in Iraq that could threaten the government of Shiite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. In a statement delivered from the White House South Lawn, Obama said the United States ""will not be sending U.S. troops back into combat in Iraq,"" but that he would be reviewing a range of other options in coming days. ""This is not going to happen overnight,"" the President said, adding that unless Iraq fixes its internal political problems, short-term military help from the United States won't make much difference. Critics blame Obama for Iraq crisis . Pressure for the United States to provide military support to Iraq's struggling government has increased, with conservative Republicans blaming Obama for creating a security vacuum in 2011 by pulling out U.S. troops. GOP critics also say that Obama's unwillingness to provide significant military backing to opposition forces in Syria's civil war has contributed to the ability of the militant Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, to attack in Iraq. Obama, however, resists getting drawn into another military engagement there after the ending the nine-year conflict started by his predecessor. Now the conflict threatens to widen. Iranian officials denied reports Friday that some of its elite forces were in Iraq to help bolster al-Maliki, a fellow Shiite. Syria connection . Taking questions from reporters after his statement, Obama acknowledged that the Syrian civil war has been spilling over into Iraq ""for some time now,"" adding that the regional conflict ""is going to be a long-term problem."" Perhaps sensitive to the criticism over the Syrian link, Obama and other government officials referred to the Sunni militant group by the acronym ISIL, which stands for Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. The President called on Iraq's neighbors to help out, too, but made clear the only guarantee of success involved political reforms by al-Maliki that promoted cooperation with Sunnis. ""In the absence of this type of political effort, short-term military action, including any assistance we might provide won't succeed,"" Obama said. Obama also blamed Iraq's political dysfunction for the failure of its troops to fight off the ISIS advance from the north to within about 60 miles of Baghdad on Friday. He noted the United States has given plenty of aid and training to Iraqi forces -- including $15 billion for items such as Hellfire missiles, assault rifles and helicopters, not to mention another $1 billion in arms now in a 30-day review period in Congress. ""The fact that they are not willing to stand and fight and defend their posts against admittedly hardened terrorists, but not terrorists who are overwhelming in numbers, indicates that there is a problem with morale, a problem in terms of commitment, and ultimately that is rooted in the political problems that have plagued the country for a very long time,"" Obama said. Shia-Sunni divisions . James Rubin, a former senior State Department official in the Clinton administration, told CNN that ""it's up to Maliki to change policy on how he treats with, how he deals with the Sunni community."" ""I'm skeptical, because right now he's in a fight for his life,"" Rubin said. Underlying the U.S. concern is the potential threat of an ISIS-controlled stronghold in the region that could serve as a staging ground for terrorist activity against American interests. ISIS fighters already have seized Iraq's second-largest city, Mosul, while gaining control of large parts of the country's north. Rubin warned the conflict could result in Iraq dividing into three pieces -- a Sunni-controlled north, a Shia-controlled south and a Kurdish region. Bob Baer, a former CIA official who is CNN's national security analyst, said ISIS could ""sow chaos through the Middle East,"" and was ""definitely"" a threat to the United States. Surprising speed . The speed of the deterioration of the situation in Iraq surprised even U.S. officials closely monitoring the country, a U.S. official closely involved with military decision-making told CNN's Kyra Phillips. ""We've been watching the intelligence continually and the fractures in Iraq that have grown as a result of the underlying political environment and lack of inclusive governance,"" the U.S. official said.  ""If anything was surprising, it's only the speed at which the situation continued to deteriorate over the past few days and the apparent ease at which the (Iraqi security forces) abandoned their units and positions."" Meanwhile, a U.S. counterterrorism official noted the intelligence community had warned of a growing ISIS threat to Mosul and Baghdad. The official told CNN that the group, consisting of a few thousand fighters, ""couldn't have moved as rapidly as it has without the support of some nationalist Sunni groups and sympathetic tribes."" ""As long as the support of these Sunni elements holds, ISIL looks well-positioned to keep the territory it has captured, absent a major counteroffensive,"" the official said, using the same acronym for the group as Obama. The Pentagon is preparing options for Obama to consider that would halt the momentum of the ISIS advance, Defense Department spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told reporters. Preparations? A U.S. official told CNN on Friday that the United States plans to move the aircraft carrier George H.W. Bush into the Persian Gulf to provide Obama with options for possible airstrikes. Calls for American airstrikes have increased in Washington, but U.S. military planners trying to find a way to help Iraq fend off the militant fighters are worried that such attacks could prove futile, several officials told CNN. Among other complications, U.S. officials don't have good intelligence about where militants are. Even if they did, the militants don't have the type of targets -- command and control centers, air defense sites, military bases -- that lend themselves to aerial attacks, the officials said on condition of not being identified. They also noted that ISIS fighters may be spread out inside population centers, which means airstrikes could risk civilian casualties and property destruction at the hands of the U.S. military. So even if Obama decides on airstrikes, the U.S. doesn't currently have targets to hit, administration sources told CNN's Jake Tapper. Figuring out what to go after will take time. The President appeared to allude to such challenges when he said: ""We want to make sure that we've gathered all the intelligence that's necessary so that if, in fact, I do direct an order, any actions there (are) targeted, they're precise, and they're going to have an effect."" Air strikes 'not easy' Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a war veteran and critic of Obama administration policy in Iraq, also spoke to this point Friday, telling CNN that air strikes ""are certainly something that should be considered, but I would point out that air strikes are not easy."" ""You just don't say, 'hey, let's go hit something,'"" said McCain, who lost to Obama in the 2008 presidential election. ""It requires coordination, it requires intelligence; it requires a whole lot of things."" One U.S. official told CNN that short of sending ground troops, options under consideration included increasing U.S. surveillance flights over ISIS areas and potential airstrikes. At the Pentagon, Kirby said the United States already had intensified its intelligence support in Iraq at the request of al-Maliki's government. However, James Jeffrey, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq from 2010 to 2012 who is now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, characterized Iraq's military as ""ill-trained, badly led and not particularly competent."" ""They clearly cannot fire and maneuver,"" said Jeffrey, a U.S. Army veteran. McCain called for Obama to fire his national security team, saying the decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Iraq created a predictable vacuum that led to the current crisis. To McCain, a residual force of U.S. troops should have remained in Iraq to provide stability, ""the same kind of residual force that we have now in Bosnia, that we have in Germany, we have in Japan."" ""That doesn't mean we're in combat. It means we are there as a stabilizing force,"" he said, adding that the ISIS advance represents ""an existential threat"" to America. He linked the Iraq situation to the administration's reluctance to strongly support opposition forces in Syria's civil war, a policy he called ""one of the causative factors"" for the Iraq crisis. Secretary of State John Kerry, however, cited differences in U.S. relations and obligations with Iraq compared to Syria. The Iraq war that began with the 2003 invasion to oust Saddam Hussein eventually led to elections that brought al-Maliki to power, followed by the 2011 departure of U.S. forces. ""In Iraq, there is a government that we have been deeply involved in, that we support, that we have a military relationship with, that we have an ongoing memorandum of understanding regarding the military relationship which has invited us, asked us for help,"" he said.

"Joselyn Martinez was 9 when her father was shot and killed outside his New York City restaurant in 1986. Nearly three decades later, she may finally see justice for his death. And she has herself to thank. Her family's tragedy started on November 22 1986, when her father, Jose Martinez, had an altercation with a few customers at a restaurant he owned with his wife. The fight moved outside the restaurant and got physical, according to the New York Police Department. One of the customers, then 16-year-old Justo Santos, allegedly produced a firearm and shot Martinez in the chest. When Joselyn awoke the next morning, her father was dead. ""Reading the paper for him in Spanish,"" Joselyn said of her favorite memories of her father. ""He would tell me to read the paper for him, and I would sit with him and read the paper in Spanish."" Case closed . After the killing, the NYPD received information that Santos had run to the Dominican Republic and was incarcerated there for murder, and the case was closed in 1988,  NYPD Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne said. A year after Santos was imprisoned, he was released from the Dominican Republic prison. But the New York case remained closed. ""They should not have closed the case,"" NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly said Tuesday. ""(It) should have been looked at to see if there was additional information as to whether or not he was out of jail."" Martinez grew up and eventually went to school to study law and Latin American studies, a path she later left for a career as a singer and actress, she says. Law lessons . In one of her law classes, she learned that there were no statutes of limitation on homicides. She decided to take another look at her father's case. About 10 years after the shooting, she said, she went to the NYPD's 34th precinct. But she was told that the case was closed and the suspect had fled. ""You let it go, but not really,"" she said. ""Because November comes around, when is the anniversary of his death, and I just get upset."" In 2006, inspired by a book, Martinez wrote down a list of things that were bothering her. ""I said well, I put that in there,"" she said about never finding her father's killer. ""And I was nervous about it because I was like, 'wow, once I write it I have to admit it.' And I hated admitting it because that meant that I was going to have to live with the possibility of this not coming about."" 'Don't ever forget that name' But Martinez scoured the Internet, reading stories and using MySpace, among other sites, to look for Santos. She saved pictures and information she thought could lead to Santos' discovery. Martinez said she spent less than $300 on sites that conduct background checks to find his current location. ""My family told me, don't ever forget that name,"" she said. In November last year, Martinez went looking for her father's file in the 34th precinct cold case division. And in January, she went back to the police chief at the precinct and presented her case. She worked with police and they eventually located Santos in Miami. He was arrested and detained by Miami-Dade Police on Thursday, and police sources said he confessed to Jose Martinez's slaying. New York detectives are in Miami and plan to bring Santos back to New York on Friday. The arrest would never have happened without her, according to the NYPD. ""She's the person most responsible for finding her father's killer,""  Browne said. ""She did outstanding work."" Martinez said the police were quick to respond to the information she gathered and were extremely helpful when she went to them. ""It took a team effort,"" Martinez said. Her mother, Idalia Martinez, beamed with pride after the arrest. ""I am thankful to God and to my daughter for never resting and didn't care for how many years,"" she said.

"Pope Francis has expressed his intention to visit the United States next year for a major meeting of the Roman Catholic Church, CNN Vatican analyst John Allen said Friday, citing Vatican sources. The pope would attend the eighth World Meeting of Families, which has been held every three years since the late Pope John Paul II convened the first such gathering in 1994. The Vatican announced in February that the meeting will be held September 22-27, 2015, in Philadelphia. ""The World Meeting of Families has traditionally been attended by the Holy Father,"" Kenneth Gavin, a spokesman for the Philadelphia Archdiocese, said in a statement. ""We are planning as if Pope Francis will be with us and have no indication that he will not attend. It is important to note that reports circulating widely today regarding the Holy Father's presence are not official."" A visit by Francis, the first pope from Latin America, would resonate with the nation's growing Latin American population. ""The Hispanic population is growing in the United States, and with the vast majority being Catholic, having the first pope from Latin America come to visit will be very exciting,"" said Bishop Thomas Paprocki of Springfield, Illinois. Roberto Suro, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California, said a U.S. visit by the Argentinian pope would be symbolically powerful for Latinos -- many of whom have slipped away from the Catholic church for evangelical sects. ""Latino Catholics have probably seen themselves less reflected in the hierarchy than their numbers might mirror,"" Suro told CNN. ""There are more Latino bishops now than a few years ago, but the American hierarchy still reflects the old Catholic church dominated by the Irish and, to a certain extent, Italians and other people of European origins,"" he said. ""Having a Latin American pope who is going to be speaking native Spanish to Latinos in the United States will be the first time they see themselves reflected so powerfully in the church hierarchy."" Allen told CNN that the idea of the family has been a major concern for the church around the world, especially in light of the growing push for legal recognition of same-sex marriage. After Pope Francis met with French President François Hollande Friday, a Vatican statement said the two leaders discussed ""the family"" and ""bioethical issues."" Hollande signed a gay marriage law in May 2013. In July, Pope Francis said he will not ""judge"" gays and lesbians, including gay priests, signaling a shift from his predecessor and hinting at a possible change in the Church's approach to historically marginalized groups. ""If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?"" Francis said in a wide-ranging news conference aboard the papal plane. The General Assembly of the United Nations generally meets in September, leading to speculation that Francis might combine the Philadelphia trip with a stop in New York to address the U.N., according to Allen, a correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter. ""As far as I know, he's never visited the United States, and as shepherd of the universal church it will really be beneficial for him to have a greater understanding of the flock here, and for people here to get to know our Holy Father,"" Paprocki said. While Vatican officials told Allen that Francis has expressed a desire to attend the Philadelphia meeting, no firm plans have been made. The Vatican does not confirm the dates of papal trips until shortly before they happen. ""One of his challenges is that he doesn't speak as many languages as his predecessors,"" Paprocki said. ""Blessed John Paul II and Pope Benedict could come to the United States and quite easily speak in English. Pope Francis is not quite as comfortable or proficient in the language."" In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI indicated that he planned to attend the 2015 meeting in Philadelphia, which at the time was hosting a high-profile church sex abuse trial. President Obama is planning to meet the Pope on March 27 at the Vatican. Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI visited the U.S. for the first time in April 2008, when he held a Mass at Nationals Park in Washington with an estimated 46,000 in attendance. He also met with Bernie McDaid, Olan Horne, and Faith Johnston, three victims of sexual abuse by clergymen. During the five-day visit, the pope also delivered a speech at United Nations General Assembly, celebrated Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and prayed at ground zero in lower Manhattan before leading a Mass at Yankee Stadium in front of 60,000 people. The late Pope John Paul II also visited the United States, including speeches before the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York in 1979 and 1995. Obama to visit Pope Francis in March .

"(CNN)Turns out the Beagle had landed, after all. The 11-year-old mystery of what happened to the UK-sponsored Beagle 2 Mars lander on its trip to the red planet's surface appeared to be mostly solved Friday with the announcement the craft had been spotted in high-resolution NASA images taken from orbit. The lander -- crammed with devices to look for signs of life on Mars -- never radioed home after hitching a ride aboard the European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter and dropping into the atmosphere on December 25, 2003. The images appear to show that the lander's solar panels didn't fully open after landing, preventing the craft from getting power and exposing the antenna it would have used to communicate with controllers on Earth, according to the space agency. While the reasons for that failure remain unknown, the discovery of the lander helps solve one of the most enduring mysteries in Martian exploration, said Mark Sims, a Beagle 2 team member from the University of Leicester. ""Every Christmas Day since 2003 I have wondered what happened to Beagle 2,"" he said, adding that he'd almost given up hope of ever knowing what had come of the lander. ""The highly complex entry, descent and landing sequence seems to have worked perfectly and only during the final phases of deployment did Beagle 2 unfortunately run into problems,"" he said. The lander, which is less than 2 meters (6.56 feet) across when fully deployed, was first spotted in the NASA images by Michael Croon of Trier, Germany -- a former member of the European Space Agency's Mars Express operations team, the UK Space Agency said. Croon is among a group of Beagle 2 team members who have spent years combing through images from NASA's HiRISE camera, which is on the agency's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, looking for signs of the missing craft, the agency said. He found it in an area near the planned landing zone, an impact basin called Isidis Planitia close to the Martian equator. The grainy images appear to show the lander resting on the surface, its solar panels only partially deployed. The craft's rear cover and parachutes are nearby. Had the lander deployed properly, a suite of onboard tools would have been used to analyze rocks, soil and atmosphere for signs of life. The lander -- the first European craft sent to the Martian surface -- was named after the HMS Beagle, the ship that carried Charles Darwin on a groundbreaking 5-year scientific survey. While its namesake resulted in no such breakthroughs, David Parker, chief executive of the UK Space Agency, said the discovery proves the Beagle 2 had its successes. ""The history of space exploration is marked by both success and failure,"" he said. ""This finding makes the case that Beagle 2 was more of a success than we previously knew and undoubtedly an important step in Europe's continuing exploration of Mars.""","A missing UK lander is spotted on the surface of Mars .

"A Utah couple is facing a $3,500 fine and a damaged credit score for doing what many people do after a bad purchasing experience:  posting an online review. Their story -- first reported by CNN's affiliate in Salt Lake City KUTV -- started in 2008 when John Palmer bought his wife Christmas gifts off KlearGear.com.  The items never arrived and the Palmers said the transaction was automatically canceled. ""After 30 days, PayPal said 'Hey, there's no activity here' and they turned around and gave the money back into my husband's account and effectively canceled the sale,"" Jen Palmer told CNN. After repeated calls to KlearGear.com to find out what happened, Jen Palmer posted a review of the company on ripoffreport.com saying in part,""There is absolutely no way to get in touch with a physical human being. No extensions work."" Web's black market peddles drugs, guns . More than three years later, the Palmers received an e-mail appearing to be from KlearGear.com stating that they would be fined $3,500 if the negative review posted on ripoffreport.com wasn't taken down within 72 hours. ""We were shocked that someone would attempt to do this because it's ridiculous that anyone would turn around and try to extort us like this,"" Jen Palmer said. Button lets kids remove online posts they regret . The e-mail cited an obscure non-disparagement clause in the terms of use contract that states: ""Your acceptance of this sales contract prohibits you from taking any action that negatively impacts KlearGear.com."" The Palmers say this clause was added after they purchased the items, citing their 2008 customer agreement which they found. Legal experts warn that more and more companies are adding this type of language in the fine print as protection. ""The First Amendment does not protect certain kinds of free speech and you can sign a contract giving away your free speech,"" according to CNN legal analyst Paul Callan. He said he believes KlearGear.com's terms of use contract is not fair and would likely be thrown out by the court. Study: 15% of American adults are not online . The Palmers tried to take down their online review, but couldn't because ripoffreport.com requires the company to enter into arbitration to have a post removed, which would cost $2,000, and KlearGear.com refused. So KlearGear.com reported the Palmers' $3,500 unpaid fine to a collections company.  After that, Jen Palmer said the couple had trouble getting approved for financing because their credit score took a huge hit. CNN e-mailed KlearGear.com and tried multiple phone numbers listed on its website.  No one responded back and all the numbers were disconnected. KlearGear.com did respond via e-mail to KUTV, defending its actions, referring to its ""terms of sale,"" and saying its request that Jen Palmer remove her post was not blackmail but a ""diligent effort to help them avoid (the fine)."" Holiday shoppers pledge to buy American . The Better Business Bureau is investigating KlearGear.com separately and has put the company on alert. KlearGear.com isn't the only company with a so-called non-disparagement clause in its customer agreement terms.  CNN found a similar clause on a vacation rental company, shoredreams.net, that threatens a charge of up to $10,000 for online reviews containing ""unreasonable negative sentiment.""  After a CNN report about the clause aired, the company removed it from its terms and conditions, citing customer feedback. A spokeswoman for shoredreams.net explained that the non-disparagement clause was intended to provide protection against customers who demand compensation by threatening unreasonable negative reviews after leaving a unit. The company adds it has never imposed a fine on a customer for violating the clause. Since the Palmers' story first surfaced, a wave of outrage has made its way across the Internet against KlearGear.com and as a result, the company has since protected its Twitter account and shut down its Facebook page, according to Techcrunch.com. The Palmers say they're taking their fight all the way to court. ""We don't want them to get away with this,"" Jen Palmer said.  ""We are apparently not the only ones that they have done this to, but we are the only ones who are fighting back.  And we're not giving up.""

"(CNN)Six people, including five foreigners, face execution by firing squad in coming days in Indonesia, as the country's new president upholds a hard line on drug offenders. The executions were announced Thursday by Indonesia's recently appointed Attorney General HM Prasetyo, who said in a statement that preparations for the executions were almost complete. He said the executions had been scheduled after petitions for clemency to Indonesian President Joko Widodo were rejected late last month. Widodo had previously told a university audience he planned to reject the 64 appeals for clemency he had received from drug offenders on death row. The four men and two women to be executed hailed from Brazil, Malawi, Nigeria, the Netherlands, Vietnam and Indonesia, said Prasetyo. Among them is Brazilian Marco Archer Cardoso Moreira, 53, who would be the first of his countrymen ever to be legally executed abroad, said Leonardo Monteiro, counselor at the Embassy of Brazil in Jakarta. ""The embassy of Brazil is doing its best to try to postpone the execution,"" he told CNN, saying it was scheduled for this weekend. ""We are trying everything we can through the proper channels."" Brazil does not have the death penalty on its books, he said. The condemned man had been in jail since 2003, after having been caught at Jakarta airport with 13 kilograms of cocaine, he said. Sentenced to death in 2004, he lodged a petition for clemency in 2010, according to a statement from the Attorney General's office. The government of the Netherlands is also protesting the planned execution of Indonesian-born Dutch citizen Ang Kiem Soei, who was condemned to death in 2003 for drug trafficking. ""The Netherlands resolutely condemns the planned execution,"" Friso Wijnen, spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Ministry of the Netherlands, told CNN, adding that his government was making ""every effort to the highest level"" to prevent it. Also sentenced to death and facing likely execution this year are the two Australian ringleaders of the so-called ""Bali Nine"" ring, arrested in 2005 with more than 8 kg of heroin. Human rights groups have slammed the executions, calling for them to be stopped. ""Tackling rising crime rates is a legitimate goal of President Widodo's administration, but the death penalty is not the answer and does not work as a deterrent to crime,"" said Rupert Abbott, Amnesty International's research director for Southeast Asia and the Pacific. Phelim Kine, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, accused Indonesia of double standards in lobbying to prevent the execution of its nationals overseas, but refusing requests by the Brazilian government to extradite Moreira to serve out his sentence in his home country. Indonesia, which has extremely strict drug laws, carries out executions by firing squad. The country resumed executions in 2013 after a four year break, but no executions were carried out in 2014.","Six people convicted of drug offenses face imminent execution, says Indonesian official .

"(CNN)Boxing legend Muhammad Ali is back at home following several days in the hospital, a family spokesman said Friday. Ali, who has Parkinson's disease and received follow-up care for a urinary tract infection this week at an undisclosed hospital, was released as expected Friday, the day before his 73rd birthday. Bob Gunnell said Ali is looking forward to gathering with family and friends to watch a college basketball game Saturday between the Duke Blue Devils and his hometown team, the Louisville Cardinals. His family thanked fans in a written statement for ""the outpouring of support and continued well wishes."" Ali was initially released from the hospital on January 7 after an 18-day stay. Born Cassius Clay, the fighter won an Olympic gold medal as a light-heavyweight at 18. In 1964, he became world heavyweight champion in an upset victory over Sonny Liston. Shortly thereafter, he changed his name to Muhammad Ali to reflect his conversion to Islam. The boxer was also known for his protest against the Vietnam War and refusing to be drafted on religious grounds. He won his first 31 professional fights before losing to Joe Frazier in 1971, a bout hailed by some boxing experts as one of the greatest of all time. He retired from boxing in 1981 as a three-time heavyweight champion and announced his diagnosis with Parkinson's three years later.","Muhammad Ali was getting follow-up care for a urinary tract infection, a spokesman says .

"(CNN)An Ohio federal judge on Friday ordered Christopher Lee Cornell, charged with planning a bomb-and-shoot attack on the U.S. Capitol, held in jail without bond. Magistrate Judge Stephanie K. Bowman issued the ruling at a detention hearing in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati. An FBI agent said Cornell, 20, planned to set off pipe bombs at the U.S. Capitol to put lawmakers and employees in panicked flight and then gun them down with an assault rifle as they ran across his path and that of an accomplice. Agents said they arrested Cornell on Wednesday before he could put his plot into action. The man Cornell believed was his partner was actually an FBI informant. Cornell had researched bomb-making instructions and by Wednesday, agents said, had bought two M-15 rifles with 600 rounds of ammunition.

"(CNN)From Denali to Mount Rainier to Mount Washington, the U.S. is full of majestic, towering peaks that have long challenged people to climb them. This story is not about those. This story is about humbler summits -- some of them aren't even hills -- that beckon hikers in largely flat, low-lying parts of the country. They have modest names like Charles Mound and Hoosier Hill, and you can climb some of them in your slippers without breaking a sweat. Why would you? Well, these summits are all notable for one thing: They're the highest points in their states. And a certain variety of mountaineer -- peak baggers, they're called -- will seek them out just for that reason. ""If you're a true peak bagger ... if that's your mindset, then getting a state high point is a worthy goal,"" said Greg Slayden, who runs Peakbagger.com, a mountaineering site. ""Whether it's Denali (the Alaska peak known officially as Mount McKinley) or the Florida high point, they all count equally the same."" Well, maybe not exactly. Denali is 20,320 feet high and requires weeks of planning to summit. Britton Hill, in Florida's Panhandle, is a short stroll from your car. But if you want to climb all 50 state high points, as Slayden has done, you need to bag the baby peaks along with the big ones. Consider Driskill Mountain -- a misnomer for sure -- a wooded bump in northern Louisiana that's a short scramble from a church parking lot. Or Iowa's Hawkeye Point, which sits on the flatlands of a former farm that is barely higher than the surrounding prairie. Mount Hood it ain't. ""There are a lot of states where the actual high point is less than a 10-minute walk from your car,"" Slayden said. Perhaps the least rugged of them all is 442-foot high Ebright Azimuth, basically just a monument sign beside a road in suburban Wilmington, Delaware. A woman lives in a house across the street and sometimes greets visiting ""hikers."" Slayden, whose website keeps records of this stuff, estimates that fewer than 300 people have summited all 50 U.S. high points. But while all the highest and most challenging peaks are in Western states, Slayden has a soft spot for many of the little ones in the Midwest and coastal states of the South. ""If you're into travel and exploring nooks and crannies of the country, it's always fun to go to places you've never been before,"" he said. ""Sure, there may not be a lot to the actual hike. But the overall experience is definitely worthwhile.""","Some ""peak baggers"" try to summit the highest point in all 50 U.S. states .

"No new gun laws. The National Rifle Association has made its position clear, even amid America's most recent gun debate. It says enforce the gun laws already on the books. It's well-known that the organization has actively lobbied to prevent new legislation limiting guns. But making this happen is more nuanced than just rallying its supporters and lobbyists every time a new law is proposed. Since the 1990s, the powerful pro-gun NRA has targeted the heart of what most legislation is based on: studies about the effects of gun violence. Last year, the NRA used its influence in Florida to push through legislation that would punish doctors if they asked patients whether they owned a gun. And buried inside President Barack Obama's signature health care legislation is a little-known provision that prevents the government and health insurers from asking about gun ownership. The NRA says it is simply ensuring that taxpayer money isn't being used to promote a political agenda. ""If gun control groups ... (and) individuals want to further their research, we're not saying they shouldn't be able to do it,"" NRA spokesman Andrew Arulanandam told CNN. ""We're just saying they shouldn't be using public funds to do it."" But public health experts say it's all part of an attempt by the NRA-led pro-gun lobby to hamstring lawmakers. ""If a bunch of people do research and generate solid evidence that suggests firearms policy should be reformed and either firearms or people who used them should be regulated in new ways, (if I'm a gun-rights advocate,) I'm not going to like that,"" said Dr. Garen Wintemute, head of the violence prevention research program at the University of California at Davis. ""So, I'll simply prevent the evidence from being collected in the first place. It's a brilliant strategy, and (the gun lobby) succeeded."" A lightning bolt and a chilling effect . It wasn't a lot of money -- $2.6 million -- but it represented the bulk of the nation's research on firearms safety in the mid-1990s. ""With regards to gun research, it was enormous,"" said Stephen Teret, the founding director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. In the 1990s, this small portion of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's budget went to a program headed by Dr. Mark Rosenberg that funded two high-profile studies that concluded the risks of having a loaded gun in the home outweigh the benefits. ""That was demonstrated if you counted dead bodies; it was demonstrated if you counted individuals shot but not killed; and tallied up the good guys versus the bad guys,"" said Dr. Arthur Kellermann, who led the research teams under Rosenberg's National Center for Injury Prevention program. Opinion: Let's take politics out of gun research . Kellermann said the studies were not politically motivated but simply a way to give homeowners information to make informed choices. But the studies created what Teret described as ""the lightning rod that started the bolts of lightning from the pro-gun side."" In 1996, it all ended. Flexing its political muscle on Capitol Hill, the NRA successfully pushed for legislation that effectively ended Rosenberg's program. To underscore its point, Congress -- in a move led by Jay Dickey, a former gun-rights advocate and Republican legislator from Arkansas -- added this language to the agency's appropriation: ""None of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control."" At the time, critics in Congress accused the researchers of pursuing an anti-gun agenda and said the CDC's work was redundant. The provision remains in place today. The language created what Teret called ""a chilling effect"" for nearly all gun-related work at the CDC. Though the agency continues to track gun deaths and injuries, it does little work on how to prevent them. Many years later, the National Institutes of Health funded a similar study that triggered the same lightning-bolt response. In 2009, the NIH study concluded that a person carrying a gun was nearly 4.5 times more likely to be shot in an assault than someone who is unarmed. Two years later, Congress added the same restrictive language it had imposed on the CDC to all agencies of the Department of Health and Human Services, including the NIH. Today, the NRA maintains its position that government research into gun violence is not necessary. ""What works to reduce gun violence is to make sure that criminals are prosecuted and those who have been found to be a danger to themselves or others don't have access to firearms,"" the NRA's Arulanandam said, ""not to carry out more studies."" Unanswered questions . So why are government studies on gun violence necessary? Rosenberg, who left the CDC in 1999, explained that many of the questions that his group was seeking to answer remain open. For example, he said, it's not clear whether registering and licensing firearms lowers gun violence; whether allowing people to carry concealed weapons increases or lowers the risk of gun deaths; or how letting people carry weapons in places such as shopping malls or schools or bars or parks affects the number of deaths. ""These are very big questions that we need to know the answer to,"" said Rosenberg, who is now president and CEO of The Task Force for Global Health. There are other private agencies and even partly federally funded programs that have researched these issues. But none was as far-reaching as what Rosenberg's program did in the 1990s. The CDC's website still keeps track of the toll of gun violence -- or, as the CDC sometimes calls it, ""lethal means.""  Yet, the federal agency does little of the epidemiological research it once did that might offer guidance to lawmakers. Now that gun violence has been thrust into the forefront of issues on Capitol Hill after last month's mass shooting at a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school, the focus has turned to the medical community's role in the debate. Last week, The Washington Post reported on a little-known provision added to the 2010 Affordable Care Act -- better known as Obamacare -- limiting what doctors can ask their patients about firearms in the home. While the provision doesn't forbid doctors from asking about guns, it prohibits health care workers from collecting that information, documenting it and using it for research. Democratic leader behind Obamacare gun provision . A similar law in Florida went a step further and would actually penalize doctors if they ask their patients about whether they own a gun, in most cases. A federal judge overturned the law, but Gov. Rick Scott has vowed to appeal. Gun-rights advocates, including the NRA, have raised concerns about tracking this data, including the possibility that acknowledging legal gun ownership could bring higher insurance premiums. With these restrictions and the revived gun debate, doctors should become active participants in the discussion about gun violence and gun policy in this country, according to the American College of Physicians. After all, the group said in a recent publication, physicians take a stand on other public health issues, such as smoking, air pollution, drunk driving and vaccinations. Examining gun violence isn't a political issue to most physicians, one Florida doctor said. ""Physicians basically want two things: They want continued research so we can find out what is happening along the lines of firearms and health care,"" Dr. Carolyn McClanahan told CNN's Sanjay Gupta. ""And the second thing, though, is we want to provide basic gun education. Studies have shown if you ask parents, especially pediatricians ask parents, 'Do you keep your gun locked, unloaded, keep the ammunition separate from the gun?' that decreases the chance of a death from a firearm."" Where things stand now . When Adam Lanza unleashed a hail of bullets inside an elementary school on December 14, ending the lives of 20 young children and six staff members,  the debate over America's gun laws reopened. Days later, Obama announced that a task force led by Vice President Joe Biden would create ""real reforms right now."" That could include a revival of the assault weapons ban, something that Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, has said she plans to introduce. It could also result in executive orders that would bypass the legislative process, Biden said Wednesday. The NRA will participate in the task force meetings this week, mostly to ""hear what they have to say,"" Arulanandam said. Whether the effort in Washington results in significant changes to America's gun laws isn't clear. What is clear, according to Kellermann -- who led research with the now defunct CDC program -- is that the nation has lost valuable time. ""Democracy is not served by ignorance and by excluding certain topics,"" he said. ""I think that's been the real loss in this case.""","In the 1990s, the NRA actively quashed a federal program to research firearms safety .

"(CNN) -- Within minutes of the news of his death, the backlash started. In the comments section of his CNN.com obituary, on Twitter feeds, in blog posts. Nelson Mandela shouldn't be revered as a civil rights icon, the statements screamed: He should be exposed for what he is: A communist. A terrorist. A racist. To be sure, Mandela can't be neatly grouped with Mahatma Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr. Unlike them, he wasn't always the pacifist he was known for in his later life. But should that be grounds for such bile-spewing vitriol? We take a look at the three most common sentiments in these online accusations and put them in context. CONTENTION 1: . Nelson Mandela was a communist . What they're saying: . ""Before you go all wet and runny over Mandela, remember he was a communist, and he never changed his views."" ""So Nelson Mandela was a communist who supported Saddam Hussein and befriended Gadaffi apparently...."" What's the basis: . Mandela was branded a communist by the white apartheid government, which made it a crime to be one. And it was a label the United States was all too content to accept. The Cold War between the United States and the Russian Soviet Union was in full swing. The Soviets had constructed the Berlin Wall just months before, and the world was dividing up into opposing camps -- allies of the United States or allies of the Soviet Union and China. This included many African nations. South Africa's government came down on the side of the West -- and communist or not, Mandela was squarely on the other side. What's the truth: . Mandela's close association with Marxists goes back at least to the 1940s, when he was enrolled in law school. He began a life-long friendship with Joe Slovo, ""an ardent communist,"" the anti-apartheid icon wrote in his autobiography ""Long Walk to Freedom."" Mandela described Slovo as of the people, ""without whom I would have accomplished very little."" A watershed moment tightly bonded Mandela to Slovo and other communist allies. Police gunned down 69 unarmed protesters in the town of Sharpville in March 1960. Then the government banned the communist party and the African National Congress, which fought for the freedom of black South Africans. With Slovo and other Marxists, he co-founded the militia movement Umkhonto we Sizwe. It's meaning: ""Spear of the Nation."" On December 16, 1961, the group carried out its first attacks on government installations and handed out leaflets announcing its existence. But was Mandela a dyed-in-the-wool communist? Not really, believes South African historian Sampie Terreblanche. ""You must understand it all against the apartheid struggle."" Mandela found the ANC too tame and had begun to push for a violent struggle in the 1940s, when he headed its youth league, the former professor of economics at Stellenbosch University said. The communists were for the use of violence, and Terreblanche believes it led to the alliance. After his release from prison, Mandela made some high-profile appearances with communist leaders. He visited Fidel Castro in Cuba. And to commemorate the relaunch of South Africa's communist party in 1990, he gave a speech. But he also made a point of distancing his own party. ""The ANC is not a communist Party,"" he said. CONTENTION 2: . Nelson Mandela was a terrorist . What they're saying: . ""It's amazing we forget he was a terrorist"" ""Please explain how it is racist to point out that biographical articles about Mandela are leaving out his terrorist actions pre-1991."" What's the basis: . The United States government placed Mandela on a terror watch list, where he stayed until 2008 -- long after his term as President of South Africa, and even longer after his receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. He was placed on it because of his group's militant fight against apartheid. At the time that Umkhonto we Sizwe carried out its first attacks, Mandela was at its helm. The next year, in 1962, he left for Morocco and Ethiopia, where he secretly studied guerrilla warfare. When Mandela returned home later that year, he was arrested and charged with illegal exit of the country and incitement to strike. Undeterred, Umkhonto we Sizwe built a militia and in 1963 made plans to start a civil war. Police intercepted the plan and arrested Mandela and other ANC leaders. Mandela received a sentence of life in prison. What's the truth: . It's true that Mandela once believed that civil disobedience was not enough to vanquish racism and apartheid. He felt he had to decide between the better of two evils -- submit or fight. He may not have been directly behind the attacks, said Hermann Giliomee, a historian from South Africa. ""He was on the run, so I don't think he had time for the planning on this."" Giliomee finds the 1963 plan amateurish, not exactly the design of a master terrorist. ""I think it's a very naÃ¯ve plan with very little outlook for success,"" the former professor of political science at the University of Cape Town said. Mandela changed his views on violence during his 27 years of incarceration. The rebel transformed into a pacifist. ""As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn't leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I'd still be in prison,"" Mandela said after he was freed. CONTENTION 3: . Nelson Mandela was a racist . What they're saying: . ""How convenient that we choose to ignore that he once sang, 'Kill white people'"" ""If apartheid was racist toward blacks, Mandela was equally racist towards whites"" What's the basis: . Umkhonto we Sizwe beat the war drum against the ""white supremacy"" and ""the white state."" Its members often sang a song called ""Bring Me My Machine Gun."" What's the truth: . Though he despised white minority rule that kept the black majority down, he didn't dislike whites. ""He was rather strong against racism,"" Terreblanche said. ""The day before he was sent to Robben Island, he made a speech in parliament that he was against all forms of racism."" He was prepared to die for non-racialism, the historian said. Joe Slovo, one of Mandela's best friends, was white -- as were many other revolutionaries who joined him in the militant group. ""Umkhonto we Sizwe is a new, independent body, formed by Africans, It includes in its ranks South Africans of all races,"" the group said in its manifesto. Mandela has long espoused the way of reconciliation and called for there to be no racial violence in retribution for apartheid. In transitioning from the segregationist regime to a non-racial democracy, he partnered closely with his white predecessor, former President Frederik Willem de Klerk, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with him. At a sports match in 1995, as President, Mandela made a gesture of support to white South Africans that drew gasps. Rugby was the dominant sport of white South Africans of Dutch heritage -- Afrikaners -- and was reviled by blacks. During a world championship match against New Zealand, Mandela walked onto the pitch wearing the jersey of his team's captain. The scene inspired the 2009 Hollywood movie ""Invictus"" directed by Clint Eastwood. The crowd began chanting his name. They were almost all white.","A backlash poured in against Mandela's positive eulogies .
Detractors accused him of being a Communist, terrorist, racist .
There is some truth to some of the claims .
Mandela had a close association with Communists and cofounded a militant group ."
"BriGette McCoy described how she was raped on her first military assignment, two weeks before her 19th birthday.  She described how, later that year, she was raped by another soldier in her unit. Then came sexual harassment by two officers -- including one who requested that she be moved to work directly for him, she said Wednesday. Testifying before lawmakers, the former Army specialist described the ""anguish"" and ""entrapment"" she felt, and the horror of the ordeal that followed. ""I no longer have any faith or hope that the military chain of command will consistently prosecute, convict, sentence and carry out the sentencing of sexual predators in uniform without absconding justice somehow,"" she told the Senate Armed Services Committee's subcommittee on personnel. ""It even starts at recruitment,"" she said.  ""We have quite a few of our men and women that are being raped and sexually harassed during the recruitment process."" McCoy was one of four alleged victims who testified Wednesday about a problem the military has acknowledged. About 19,000 men and women suffer sexual assault each year in the military, former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said, though he noted that only about 3,200 assaults were reported.  About 10,700 of those cases -- 56% -- involved male victims in 2010, based on anonymous reporting collected by the military. In painful, dramatic testimony, three women and one man, all of whom have left the military, described their suffering -- and explained why, in some cases, they never filed reports. They helped paint a picture of the military as a place where victims are often pressured to remain quiet or endure having their reputations and careers tarnished for coming forward. High-ranking representatives from each military branch also gave statements, each one saying how brave they thought those troops had been in telling their stories openly. They stressed that special victims' units have been established along with training to recognize, investigate and prosecute cases involving rape. Maj. Gen. Gary Patton, the director of the Pentagon's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, said that in his five decades of service, he's seen massive cultural change in the military, including racial tolerance and increasing acceptance of gay and lesbian troops. Changing attitudes toward sexual assault will be no different. Only when rape within the military is treated with the same revulsion as friendly-fire will he believe a shift has actually occurred, he said. 'Chaplain told me the rape was God's will' Rebekhah Havrilla was sexually harassed by a team leader to such an extent that she needed mental health care and medication, she said. ""One week before my unit was scheduled to return back to the United States, I was raped by another service member that had worked with our team. ""Initially, I chose not to do a report of any kind because I had no faith in my chain of command, as my first sergeant previously had sexual harassment accusations against him, and the unit climate was extremely sexist and hostile in nature towards women,"" she said. Later, she filed a restricted report against her rapist and the team leader. A year later, the former sergeant testified, she bumped into her rapist in a store, who told her he had been moved to her new location. ""I was so re-traumatized from the unexpectedness of seeing him that I removed myself from training and immediately sought out the assistance from an Army chaplain who told me, among other things, that the rape was God's will and that God was trying to get my attention so that I would go back to church,"" she testified. ""Again, I did not file an unrestricted report against my rapist."" ""Six months later, a friend called me and told me they had found pictures of me online that my perpetrator had taken during my rape."" So she turned to the Army Investigation Division, which carried out a full investigation, she said.  An investigator had her describe in detail what was happening in each of the photos. After months passed, she said, she was told that her rapist had told investigators that he had had consensual sex with Havrilla.  The command did not pursue adultery charges, and the case was closed. ""The military criminal justice system is broken,"" Havrilla said. Later, after the hearing, Havrilla posted a message on Twitter: ""I have your name, Chaplain. Sweat in your britches."" Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut told military leaders that he appreciated their comments but criticized them for giving ""lawyer-like"" statements. The problem of sexual assault in the military is a problem that demands a more immediate response. He called ""sexual assault"" as an ""immensely destructive force,"" likening the assaults to the problem the military first  grappled with years ago over strengthening its insufficient body armor so that the armor could withstand IED blasts. Male victim: 'The culture of victim blaming must end' Male service members are victims, of course, and Brian Lewis reminded senators of that Wednesday. Lewis told senators he felt ""humbled"" to be ""the first male survivor to testify in front of Congress on this very important issue."" After enlisting in the Navy in 1997, he was raped by a superior officer during his first tour, he said. ""I was ordered by my command not to report this crime."" Then, he said, ""I was misdiagnosed with a personality disorder"" and was discharged. That remains on his record, he said. ""The military has shoved many survivors out the back door with inaccurate, misleading, and very harmful, almost weaponized, medical diagnoses like personality disorders that affect their benefits and future employment opportunities,"" he said. McCoy also said many victims are let go with ""less than honorable discharges and personality disorders on their records, further hindering them from applying for medical treatment and medical claims."" ""The culture of victim blaming and retaliation while failing to punish the perpetrator must end,"" Lewis said. ""We also need to ensure that prevention efforts are inclusive of male service members. ... We cannot marginalize male survivors and send a message that men cannot be raped, and, therefore, are not real survivors,"" the former officer said. But, as senators pointed out, there are few convictions made in the military. According to a 2010 Defense Department study, only 8% of sexual assailants are referred to military court, compared with 40% of similar offenders prosecuted in the civilian court system. Military 'desperately needs to be shown the next steps' Anu Bhagwati, director of the Service Women's Action Network, was the fourth victim who testified. She said that in her years as a Marine officer, she ""experienced daily discrimination and sexual harassment,"" which included rape jokes and ""commercial sexual exploitation of women and girls."" While stationed at an infantry school, ""I witnessed reports of rape, sexual assault and sexual harassment swept under the rug by a handful of field grade officers. ""Perpetrators were promoted, were transferred to other units without punishment, while victims were accused of lying or exaggerating their claims in order to ruin men's reputations."" She called on Congress to grant ""convening authority over criminal cases to trained, professional, disinterested prosecutors.  Commanding officers cannot make truly impartial decisions because of their professional affiliation with the accused, and oftentimes with the victim as well."" She also called for civil courts to be opened to military victims. ""Congress must ensure that men and women in uniform can access the remedies available to all other aggrieved individuals under the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Civil Rights Act.   Given the prevalence of retaliation against service members who report incidents of sexual assault and harassment, the absence of these remedies for military personnel is especially shameful."" ""We are looking,"" she said, ""at an institution that desperately needs to be shown the next steps forward.""","Army specialist testified she was raped several times .

"London, England (CNN) -- Thousands of people tuned in to watch the CNN/YouTube climate change debate, which took place Tuesday at the COP15 climate conference in Copenhagen, Denmark. CNN's Becky Anderson was joined by a distinguished panel of guests who answered questions posted on YouTube in the weeks leading up to the debate. The panel included Yvo de Boer, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; U.S. journalist and author Thomas L. Friedman; Bjorn Lomborg, author of the ""The Skeptical Environmentalist;"" Hollywood actress and environmental activist Daryl Hannah and former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The panel tackled a range of climate change issues head on, addressing some of the major concerns of YouTube's users. John from the Republic of Ireland wanted to know whether the panel thought that world leaders were taking climate change seriously enough. The message from Yvo de Boer was clear. Watch the debate: Part 1 I 2 I3 I4 I5 I6 . ""I've never seen a moment in history when so many world leaders have taken an interest in this topic,"" de Boer said. ""We have 115 coming on Friday to get a strong resounding result out of this week."" Daryl Hannah agreed: ""This is definitely a defining moment for our politicians and world leaders to take a stand to make real change from a fossil fuel economy to a new energy independent economy."" But Bjorn Lomborg questioned whether world leaders would sign an agreement. ""One-hundred-and-fifteen leaders are coming to Copenhagen but what are they going to agree on?"" he said. ""Don't they want to do something smarter that will actually work this time."" Thomas Friedman urged the United States to take a lead on climate change. ""Right now,"" he said, ""that is very much up in the air. The uncertainties surrounding climate change are not a reason for inaction. They are a reason to act."" The panel answered a range of questions from YouTube users all over the world from the United States to Bangladesh and Brazil. A questioner from Morocco wanted to know if African countries had a loud enough voice at the climate talks. Kofi Annan was in no doubt that the continent did not. ""What is clear,"" he said, ""is that Africa and the least developed countries, which are not so much responsible for the problem of climate change, are bearing the greatest brunt."" Annan, who joined the debate via a live satellite link from Geneva, Switzerland, said the whole world was in the same boat. ""We must come together to protect the planet,"" he said. ""It is our collective responsibility. We cannot resolve climate change in one nation, or one continent ND not in another,"" he continued. The Web broadcast was attended by an audience of delegates who are attending the U.N. climate conference at the Bella Center.

"(CNN) -- If you haven't been under a rock the past 24 hours (and if you have been, you have other things to worry about), you know that a certain Cupertino-based fruit company has finally unveiled its entry into the smartwatch sweepstakes, and, as expected from the house that the late Steve Jobs built, the new Apple Watch is a bushel of insanely geektastic features wrapped up in a sleek and eminently gorgeous package. You can get the scoop on what it actually does (and whether you should drop your hard-earned $349 ""to start"" on it) elsewhere. The question I'm interested in is whether Apple's long-awaited arrival in the buzzy wearables category finally means that people -- regular people, that is, not pixel-pushing pundits and Tesla-driving tech titans -- are ready to wear them. The fact is, while wearables have generated a lot of attention, they're being used a lot less than the fanfare might suggest. According to the NPD Group and Strategy Analytics, only about 14 million fitness bands and activity trackers and about 2 million smartwatches were sold globally over the 12 months ending this past March. (Everything else -- Google Glass, cloud cameras, digital jewelry, wi-fi socks, connected underwear -- basically represents a rounding error.) Compare that with the number of smartphones sold around the world: 964 million. That's the difference between a niche product and an emerging necessity. Now, there are pretty good reasons why people have so far failed to adopt wearables in droves. The first is that this first generation of devices have been, in the larger scheme of things, pretty useless. Or single use, at most: Fitness trackers may be invaluable for dedicated dieters and exercise junkies, but most people don't have room in their personal digital portfolios for another device that does nothing but count steps and calories. It's one more thing to update, charge, sync and misplace. (I had a Fitbit when it first came out -- accent on the ""had."" It's currently counting turbulence jolts on a plane somewhere between here and Shanghai.) Hands-on with the new Apple Watch . But the second and most critical reason is that technology needs to reflect demand, not supply. Are consumers actually hungry for what you're cooking? If they aren't, your smart [insert device category here] is an interesting idea, not a product. It's an answer looking for a question. And it is designed to make nerd fanboys and technology columnists wet their pants, not to change the way ordinary people live. Every game-changing innovation, from the horseless carriage to the first cell phone to streaming video on Netflix, is one that fulfills a fundamental need so well that it's hard to imagine what it was like before that innovation arrived. Of course, you often don't realize this until well after the innovation in question has been released. Apple's original iPhone, with its featureless oblong form factor and touchscreen-based UI, was derided as an expensive, keyboardless toy. The iPad was dismissed as an oversized iPhone with a feminine-hygiene inspired name. Both of these ended up completely reinventing their categories and earning Apple billions. The Apple Watch, meanwhile, received a standing ovation when it was unveiled Tuesday as the ""One More Thing"" behind Apple's new supersized iPhone 6, and has been generating a near-universal stream of acclaim from the digerati ever since. People across my social network have been focusing their lust on different aspects of the device -- from its fashion-focused interchangeable bands to its ability to serve as a wave-and-enter key for rooms at Starwood hotels, to perhaps the weirdest feature it offers: Its ability to send a real-time pulsing display of your heartbeat to any contact on your paired iPhone. (At the very least, that's going to change the face of action cinema.) Which may answer my original question: While other companies are trying to figure out how to respond to need, Apple, more so than any other company, has figured out how to create it. Just now, my mom called me to ask if I thought she needed an Apple Watch, to go along with her new iPhone 5c. If you needed an indicator as to whether the wearable revolution is finally here, that's as good as any.","Apple unveiled the long-awaited Apple Watch .

"Now that the trailer for the seventh ""Star Wars"" movie is out, you can imagine the anticipation among the millions of fans of the film franchise. And why not? The six ""Star Wars"" films have been enormous successes: they have grossed over $2 billion domestically at the box office, spawned scores of books, comic books and merchandise (how many kids have their own light saber?) and made household names of characters like Darth Vader, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker. They've also been the worst thing ever for the science fiction genre. I say this as someone who has been a devoted sci-fi reader since childhood. I was so blown away by the first ""Star Wars"" film when I saw it in 1977, I went back two more times the same week to wallow in its space age fantasy. But here's the thing:  George Lucas' creation, basically a blown-up Flash Gordon adventure with better special effects, has left all too many people thinking science fiction is some computer graphics-laden space opera/western filled with shootouts, territorial disputes, evil patriarchs and trusty mounts (like the Millennium Falcon). ""Star Wars"" has corrupted people's notion of a literary genre full of ideas, turning it into a Saturday afternoon serial. And that's more than a shame -- it's an obscenity. Science fiction is in fact one of the most creative literary genres around. The best of sci-fi is filled with meditations on what's ""out there,"" what makes us human, how technology is used and how it is changing us. It takes up issues of race, sexuality and quite literally everything else under the sun. It is essentially about ideas, not action, and that's the problem, as far as Hollywood is concerned. There are, for example, no light sabers, spaceships or Death Stars in the 1979 novel ""Kindred,"" by Octavia Butler, who won the Hugo and Nebula, sci-fi's top awards, and was also awarded a MacArthur Foundation ""Genius"" Grant. Butler's main themes are race and sex, and in ""Kindred"" she wrote about a modern black woman who travels back in time to the antebellum South, where she is enslaved.  The novel is regularly taught in classrooms and has made at least one list of  ""Great Books By Women."" But Hollywood has yet to adapt it for the screen. Maybe if the lead character had a Wookiee by her side... Many of the great works of sci-fi have not been made into films -- The Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov, Joe Haldeman's ""The Forever War,"" William Gibson's ""Neuromancer,"" among others -- partially because they are too smart, too dense and too thoughtful. Sure, some classics have made the transition, but the track record is spotty: David Lynch's ""Dune"" was a disaster, for example, and the recent ""Ender's Game"" was  a mixed bag that was not successful at the box office. Francois Truffaut's ""Fahrenheit 451,"" although stylish and intellectual, was a bit too frigid for a mass audience. Which means that Hollywood studios, not known for thinking outside the box, opt for the ""Star Wars"" template -- lots of whiz bang, plenty of quirky alien characters, CGI to the max, plenty of explosions and little thought of any kind. To be sure, the first ""Star Wars"" was a breath of fresh air, a fun flick for sci-fi geeks. But the series quickly ossified, a victim of its own success. Only two of the films -- ""Star Wars"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back"" -- show any originality. The rest tread water, give the hardcore fans the same old, same old. I mean, how many light sabre duels can you sit through before you're bored out of your skull? How many outer space dogfights? How many seemingly profound Yoda-esque thoughts? Me, I'm giving up on the whole thing. I don't care that J.J. Abrams, a director with talent, is helming the new flick. He's hemmed in by audience expectations -- like casting the stars of the original in this film -- and recycling stale material. I'll pass. Instead, I'll queue up ""The Matrix,"" and enjoy the most original sci-fi movie of the past 25 years. I recommend ""Star Wars"" fans do the same. They need to be reminded what real creativity is all about.","Lewis Beale: People thrilled about seventh ""Star Wars movie"" don't get it's bad sci-fi .

"Beijing (CNN) -- China has arrested a pro-democracy activist, the latest detention in the government's effort to prevent the Arab world's ""Jasmine Revolution"" from spreading into China, a human rights group said Wednesday. Zhu Yufu, a longtime activist and a founder of the China Democracy Party, is accused of ""inciting subversion of state power,"" the group Chinese Human Rights Defenders said. Zhu is at least the fourth activist reported to be arrested and accused of that crime in recent weeks. Amnesty International said Ding Mao, Ran Yunfei and Chen Wei were formally arrested between March 25 and March 28 ""and could face lengthy prison terms."" ""Since an anonymous online call on 17 February to stage a 'Jasmine Revolution' in China more than a hundred activists, many of them active on Twitter and blogs, have been detained, put under surveillance or illegal house arrest, or have simply gone missing,"" Amnesty said in a report this week. ""Moreover, at least a dozen lawyers say they have been briefly detained and pressured by the authorities not to take up cases defending those detained, and even told by police to stop tweeting about the detained people."" CNN's call to China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday evening was not immediately returned. ""China is a country ruled by law, and Chinese citizens are supposed to conduct their businesses within the framework of China's constitution and laws,"" much like the United States, Wang Baodong, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, wrote in an e-mail.. ""No one is allowed to enjoy privileged rights above the law, no matter who you are and what high positions you hold."" In recent years, he said, about a dozen high-ranking Chinese government officials per year have been prosecuted and punished ""because of their unlawful activities such as corruption and election manipulations, which rarely catches the attention of the American media. We hope that the Western media will take an objective and fair attitude toward China's human rights situation, which has been constantly improving."" Last week, China denied reports that a dissident artist was being held due to his calls for reform. The government insisted that Ai Weiwei was being investigated for economic crimes. ""It has nothing to do with human rights or freedom of expression,"" ministry spokesman Hong Lei told reporters during a regular weekly briefing. Gao Ying, Ai's mother, told CNN that she is very worried. ""There is nowhere I can ask about his whereabouts,"" she said. ""I would sell my house (for the money) to go to court if necessary ... I will go to the prison with him. I would die there with him. ""If this is an economic crime case, why did it need so many policemen?"" she asked. ""Why did they raid his studio, why everyone is now under close supervision? Is it worthwhile? This is very stupid."" Ai, one of the country's best-known artists, helped design the Bird's Nest stadium for the Beijing Olympics, but he later called for a boycott of the 2008 games because, he said, China was using them as propaganda. He has also accused the Chinese government of trying to silence dissidents. Zhu Yufu is ""the first individual outside of Sichuan Province to be formally arrested as part of the 'Jasmine Revolution' crackdown,"" Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) said. He previously spent seven years in prison for ""subversion of state power"" following a 1998 crackdown on the China Democracy Party, and he was imprisoned again between 2007 and 2009, the China-based group said. CHRD also said Beijing-based housing rights activist Ni Yulan and her husband Dong Jiqin, missing since April 7, had been detained. The U.S. State Department Human Rights Report on China for 2010, published last week, says, ""A negative trend in key areas of the country's human rights record continued, as the government took additional steps to rein in civil society, particularly organizations and individuals involved in rights advocacy and public interest issues, and increased attempts to limit freedom of speech and to control the press, the Internet and Internet access. ""Efforts to silence political activists and public interest lawyers were stepped up, and increasingly the government resorted to extralegal measures including enforced disappearance, 'soft detention,' and strict house arrest, including house arrest of family members, to prevent the public voicing of independent opinions. Public interest law firms that took on sensitive cases also continued to face harassment, disbarment of legal staff, and closure."" During a visit to Washington in January. Chinese President Hu Jintao acknowledged that ""a lot still needs to be done"" about human rights in his country. He added, ""China also respects the universality of human rights, but at the same time we also believe we need to take into account the differences in culture when talking about human rights.""","Activist Zhu Yufu is accused of ""subversion of state power,"" human rights groups say .

"Manchester, New Hampshire (CNN)New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie dominates almost any room he enters but is suddenly facing questions about his relevance in the 2016 presidential race. The surprisingly fast-moving Republican presidential contest, kicked off by Jeb Bush shortly after the New Year and accelerated by the unexpected re-emergence of Mitt Romney, is putting pressure on Christie, who was once the Republican establishment's favorite. The big-check GOP contributors that were once assumed to be Christie's for the taking — in particular the Wall Street financiers just across the Hudson River from New Jersey — are now being courted aggressively by Bush and Romney as they ramp up their campaigns. ""There is big advantage to moving first, and when you're a whale like both Jeb and Romney are, and you jump into that pool first, its hard for anyone else to squeeze in,"" said B. Wayne Hughes, a California billionaire and Republican donor who has not committed to supporting a candidate. ""They have the same donor base, so they have to go after those guys."" Bush has been a well-liked figure in the center-right donor set for years, thanks to his widespread family connections and the perks and ambassadorships doled out by two previous Bush White Houses. The former Florida governor has also been a champion of immigration reform, a precious issue for the business community and Republicans who want to grow the party's appeal among Hispanics, even as conservatives bristle at the idea. Romney, meanwhile, built an impressive financial network during his 2012 campaign, and many of those donors are waiting to see what he does before committing to another candidate. His surprising decision last week at a New York donor meeting to ""show some 2016 leg,"" as one attendee put it, was designed to keep Bush at bay as he mulls a third presidential bid. But their moves are also complicating things for Christie, who is still expected to launch a presidential bid but is moving at a much slower place than Bush or Romney. All three Republicans will be competing for a similar slice of establishment-friendly financial backers and voters should they each seek the GOP nomination. Christie, already hamstrung on fundraising by strict pay-to-play laws that prohibit Wall Street employees from from contributing to governors seeking federal office, was further diminished in the eyes of some donors last year by the ""Bridgegate"" scandal and its subsequent investigations. Christie's record as governor has also been met with some skepticism by the business community: New Jersey has seen eight credit downgrades and continues to have some of the highest taxes in the country. His fading star opened the door last year for Bush to start making calls to potential supporters who might have previously been with with Christie. Christie's team insists the Romney and Bush developments have had little bearing on his decision-making process — or his ability to fund a potential campaign. ""The last couple of weeks actually had no impact,"" said one Christie confidante, granted anonymity to discuss the 2016 machinations with some candor. ""He is not changing his plans. He is not moving up any schedule. He is attending a bunch of inaugurals. He has a bunch of speeches coming up. He feels he is in good position and he feels like he has time to decide to want to do more."" The adviser pointed out that Christie is fresh off an impressive tenure as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, a post that put him in regular touch with some of the party's biggest contributors. He remains on the RGA's executive committee, and plans to connect with many of the same donors at February gathering of the RGA in Washington. No candidate — even ones with the names Bush and Romney — can take the donor world for granted, the Christie adviser insisted. ""I think all three of them, Romney, Bush, Gov. Christie, have a leg up on donor world,"" the source said. ""But you take those people for granted at your own peril. Everybody will be courting those folks, but I think the smart folks will take their time."" To most Americans, the donor courtship now underway is hidden from view and largely meaningless. But in the early stages of a presidential primary, the whims of big donors have outsized importance, especially in a post-Citizens United world where a single rich person can prop up a candidate with a well-funded super PAC. As the costs of running a presidential campaign skyrocket, landing the support of a major bundler can bring instant credibility to a candidate even before the campaign begins in earnest. Early signals indicate that Christie might not be hard up for cash should he decide to run. Already he has secured the backing of Texas bundler Ray Washburne, a recently-departed Republican National Committee finance chairman, two GOP sources confirmed to CNN. And The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Ken Langone, the Home Depot founder and prominent Republican donor, is organizing a dinner for Christie and potential supporters in New York later this month. Once the donor primary ends and the actual primary begins, Christie may be on better footing in a race against Bush and Romney. ""There is room in the primary for anyone who has enough resources,"" said Tom Rath, a longtime New Hampshire power broker and Romney ally. ""Look, it's a little different talking about how you connect with voters, and it's another story talking about how you connect with the large scale fundraisers. But the fact is, New Hampshire will give every candidate a fair shot. There is not home court advantage here for anyone at all."" Though both of Christie's potential rivals in the establishment lane have big networks and deep experience in national politics, both of them are older than than the 52-year old Christie. Romney is 67 and Bush is 61, and both could be tagged as stale emblems of the past. Christie, too, is a natural retail campaigner and perhaps the best political performer of anyone in the Republican field. The contrast could be stark against the buttoned-up, bespectacled Bush and the notoriously awkward Romney. ""He is kind of a hell-raiser, and nobody is going to say that about Jeb Bush or Mitt Romney,"" said Leighton Lord, a South Carolina attorney who hosted a reception for Christie in the early primary state this week. ""He is not like a lot of the other folks that are running that are more cautious and calculating. Folks are getting tired of that. They like his authenticity, which he has got all day long. That's sort of a counter to Romney. With Romney, you're never sure if you're getting the real Mitt Romney or the Romney he thinks you want."" Though he's been slower than Bush or Romney when it comes to hiring staff and building out a campaign, Christie is still looking and sounding very much like a candidate-in-waiting. He is likely to launch a political action committee in the coming weeks, multiple GOP sources said, and he is heading to a big conservative gathering in Iowa after this week's excursion to South Carolina. Christie can afford to wait longer than other candidates, his supporters said, in part because of his fame. He doesn't need to introduce himself to voters in the way Bush will, for instance. ""So much of politics these days is celebrity,"" Lord said. ""We have got to find somebody who has the substance and the integrity, but is also a celebrity. And Chris has got that."" In South Carolina, where he attended the inauguration of Gov. Nikki Haley, Christie posed for selfies with top elected officials, including the Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, before dropping by a crowded GOP meet-and-greet arranged by Lord and other Republicans. The reception was a positive one. Christie's speech to the audience was ""short on conservative red meat, but long on how he's the guy that can win,"" said one Republican who attended the afternoon session, held at a Columbia law firm. ""He said something to the effect of, 'Today is Nikki Haley's day, but maybe it will be Chris Christie's day in South Carolina soon,"" the source told CNN. ""You couldn't walk away from that thinking anything other than he's going to run."" After the event, Matt Moore, the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, posted photos of the event on Facebook. ""My honor to introduce Chris Christie in South Carolina today,"" he wrote. ""The man tells it like it is...we like that in S.C.!""","Chris Christie was once the Republican establishment's favorite heading into 2016 .
But he could face challenges if Romney and Bush enter the race ."
"The Senate voted Wednesday to avert at least one chronic Washington political crisis for more than a year. With a snowstorm bearing down on the capital, it approved a House-passed measure that allows the government to borrow more money to pay its bills through March 2015. President Barack Obama signaled that he would sign the legislation, so the Senate vote was the last hurdle to resolving the debt ceiling issue until after the November congressional elections. ""I'm pleased that Republicans and Democrats in Congress have come together to pay for what they've already spent, and remove the threat of default from our economy once and for all,"" Obama said in a statement, adding that he hoped ""this puts an end to politics by brinkmanship."" Wednesday's result was a blow to tea party conservatives who oppose any kind of increase in federal borrowing. Filibuster denied . Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a leader of the GOP tea party wing, mounted a filibuster attempt to force a 60-vote threshold for proceeding on the debt ceiling measure. However, a dozen Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, joined Democrats to overcome the filibuster on a 67-31 procedural vote that avoided another politically damaging legislative impasse over spending. The Democratic-controlled Senate then gave final approval by a 55-43 margin on strict party lines, with McConnell and the other Republicans who helped overcome the filibuster voting against the measure to reduce their political risk. ""We got a good outcome,"" said GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, one of the 12 who helped defeat the filibuster but then opposed the measure on the final vote. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew said last week the debt ceiling must be raised by February 27, or the nation would risk a technical default. After Wednesday's Senate votes, Lew said the debt ceiling plan along with a recent budget agreement and spending bill ""will provide certainty and stability to businesses and financial markets and should add momentum to the economic growth forecasted in 2014."" To Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the defeat of the filibuster bid by Cruz signaled that ""the American political world is moving in our direction."" ""Republicans are trying to put tea party politics in the rear view mirror,"" he said. After the House and Senate consideration of the politically charged matter, Obama added that the        ""full faith and credit of the United States is too important to use as leverage or a tool for extortion."" Cruz sticks to his guns . Cruz, however, was unapologetic. ""Today's vote is yet another example that establishment politicians from both parties are simply not listening to the American people,"" he said. ""Outside the beltway, Americans of all political stripes understand that we cannot keep spending money we don't have."" With Congress on break next week for the President's Day holiday, failure to pass the debt ceiling measure Wednesday would have brought the nation close enough to the deadline to possibly shake financial markets. On Tuesday, the GOP-controlled House passed the debt-ceiling measure on a 221-201 vote, with only 28 Republicans supporting it compared to the 199 who opposed it. Meanwhile, 193 Democrats backed the measure with only two voting ""no."" The House vote followed an internal Republican fight over efforts to attach deficit reduction provisions to the debt-limit legislation. Obama and Democrats rejected any attempt to negotiate on the issue, which previously led to political brinkmanship that caused the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating in 2011. In the end, House Speaker John Boehner gave up efforts to link the measure to a provision repealing a cut in some military pension benefits. The Ohio Republican allowed a vote on a ""clean"" bill demanded by Democrats and despised by conservatives. The shift by Boehner evoked rare praise for the speaker from the Senate's top Democrat. ""It is encouraging that some of my Republican colleagues seem to be regaining their grip on sanity this week,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Wednesday before the Senate vote. GOP change in tactics . Until it happened, House Republicans insisted that any increase in the borrowing limit had to come attached to deficit-reduction provisions. At a closed-door meeting on Monday, they discussed a plan to increase the debt ceiling until March 2015 -- past the upcoming congressional elections in November -- while also repealing cuts to military pensions that were part of the recently passed federal budget. Less than 18 hours later, though, Boehner told reporters the GOP proposal couldn't pass because ""we don't have 218 votes."" Some conservatives oppose raising the debt ceiling under any circumstance, while Democrats had made it clear they would unanimously reject any measure that tacked other provisions onto an increase in the borrowing limit. Without a purely Republican majority, Boehner decided to split up the GOP plan by holding separate votes on repealing the military pension cuts and a clean debt ceiling increase. The House easily passed the military pension measure earlier on Tuesday, then passed the clean debt ceiling legislation. Both Boehner and his top deputy -- House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia -- were among the 28 Republicans who supported the measure. On Wednesday, the Senate also passed the military pension measure after the votes on the debt ceiling legislation. Republicans facing pressure from conservatives ahead of the November vote were reluctant to back any kind of hike in the borrowing limit, a core issue for the political right because it represents rising federal debt. Boehner blames Obama . Despite his support for the proposal, Boehner put the blame for needing a ""clean"" debt-ceiling bill with no deficit reduction provisions on Obama, saying the rising federal debt was his fault. ""It's the President driving up the debt and the President wanted to do nothing about the debt that's occurring, will not engage in our long-term spending problem,"" Boehner said. ""And so, let his party give him the debt ceiling increase that he wants."" At the same time, Boehner declared himself disappointed about what he called a ""lost opportunity"" to address unsustainable federal spending. Republicans across the ideological spectrum agree that another round of political brinkmanship could harm their party after it got blamed for October's federal government shutdown. A recent CNN/ORC International poll found that 54% of respondents would blame congressional Republicans for a failure to raise the debt ceiling, while 29% would blame Obama and 12% would blame both.","Senate also approves measure to repeal cuts to military pension benefits .

"(CNN)You'd expect a conversation with Mulatu Astatke to be about music. He is, after all, the father of a musical genre: Ethio-jazz. But when he talks about the art form, he tends to focus on its scientific merits. ""When you start talking about jazz, they're usually telling us that Africans contributed to the rhythm parts of jazz music, but it's not only the rhythms. We have contributed to the science of jazz as well,"" he says. While innovators like Charlie Parker may get credit for the creation of modern jazz music by using diminished scales (as done in classical music by composers like Claude Debussy), Astake offers an alternative view: . ""In southern Ethiopia, there are tribes called the Derashe -- I call them the scientists of music. By cutting different size bamboos, [they] have been playing this diminished scale [for centuries]. So who first created it? Debussy, Charlie Parker, or the Derashe tribes?"" Unsurprisingly, I'm not the only one who's been presented with such questions by Astatke, whose passion about Africa's contribution to music extends back to the 1960s when he went on to fuse the traditional Ethiopian five-tone scales with western 12-note harmonies to give life to a whole new music genre: the hypnotizing and eerily seductive soundscape of ethio-jazz. Music pioneer . Astatke, whose performance Saturday at Africa Utopia was one of the highlights of the London-based festival, has been outspoken about his country's cultural heritage throughout his five-decade career. Yet, the father of ethio-jazz first had to go outside Ethiopia to find his musical calling. Born in Jimma, southwestern Ethiopia, in 1943, Astatke was sent to Wales as a teenager to further his high school studies, with the goal of studying aeronautical engineering. It was there where his fascination with music began, after being encouraged by his teachers to pick up various musical instruments. Astatke quickly discovered his natural musical talent -- and has never looked back. After shelving plans to study engineering, he moved to London to study classical music at Trinity College. During those years, he also started performing live, playing congas and timpani in various clubs across the London capital. Keen to explore jazz, Astatke then decided to enroll at Boston's Berklee College of Music, becoming the famed institution's first African student. At Berklee, Astatke analyzed the work of jazz giants -- anyone from Duke Ellington and Count Basie to Gil Evans and John Coltrane -- but was also encouraged to explore his own musical vision. ""I remember at Berklee we had a fantastic teacher who always used to tell us, 'guys, be yourselves,'"" says Astatke. ""So I started concentrating, working things out my own way and experimenting."" The result was a captivating musical fusion of the four pentatonic Ethiopian modes with western jazz. ""I started combining the five notes against the 12 notes, and it's not easy,"" recalls the multi-instrumentalist, who after Berklee moved to New York and recorded three albums with the Ethiopian Quintet. ""It's so difficult because it can easily lose the beauty, the character and the feel of the Ethiopian modes and scales,"" he continues. ""I really had to think and work out how to combine it both and come up with something beautiful and very interesting -- that's how Ethio-jazz was created, in New York."" Cultural ambassador . By the late 1960s, Astatke had returned to Ethiopia, bringing his electrifying new sounds with him. At first, his radical approach was met with some resistance, especially his use of instruments like vibraphones, electric pianos, trumpets and wah wah pedals. Yet, he eventually managed to win the hearts and minds of his co-patriots and became a leading figure in the ""Swinging Addis"" era of the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa became famous for its experimental music scene and vibrant nightlife. During that period Astatke also got to work with one of his heroes, Duke Ellington, escorting the great American jazz composer during his visit to Ethiopia in 1973. ""We talked about Ethiopian music and the great African contribution -- especially the tribes in Ethiopia,"" recalls Astatke, ""and I made him listen to our great traditional music players."" Astatke enjoyed a successful career in the last years of Haile Selassie's reign and continued making music after the Ethiopian emperor got deposed in 1974 by the Derg military regime, which lasted until the early 1990s. But his big break -- at least for the wide public -- came in 2005, when award-winning director Jim Jarmusch decided to use Astatke's music for his bittersweet masterpiece ""Broken Flowers."" ""Jim helped so much for my success, he's a great man,"" says Astatke, recalling his first ever encounter with the American filmmaker. ""I was playing in New York and his secretary called up one afternoon and said Jim Jarmusch would love to come to your concert,"" says Astatke. ""I said OK, you're welcome... We met backstage after the concert and I remember him telling me, 'Mulatu I've been a fan of your music for a long time, do you mind if I use your pieces in my film?  I said, 'great, just go ahead, there's no problem.'"" Jarmusch used Astatke's music as the soundtrack to the travels of Bill Murray's character, and even included an Ethiopian character in the story. The film was widely successful, and helped to introduce Astatke's music to a large and diverse audience -- from jazz and funk enthusiasts to hip-hop and rap fans. Several successful tours, collaborations and recordings have since followed, as well as a number of academic accolades -- in recent years Astatke has been awarded an honorary doctorate from Berklee, has completed a Radcliffe Institute Fellowship at Harvard and is working with MIT on creating modern versions of traditional Ethiopian instruments. ""Sometimes I just don't believe myself,"" says Astatke. ""I am really so surprised when I see that we play for 120,000 people in Japan; in Glastonbury I played twice for 140,000 people,"" he continues. ""There are some great people who created something and probably died before seeing the fruit [of their work]. But I'm still alive, seeing my music being played all over the world. I'm very happy and very pleased to see this thing happening while I'm alive.""","Mulatu Astatke is the creator of ethio-jazz .

"Jamal Lewis, Dorsey Levens and two other former NFL players have filed a lawsuit accusing the National Football League of misleading them and failing to protect them against on-the-field brain injuries they say caused health problems years after they retired. Lewis and Levens, as well as Fulton Kuykendall and Ryan Stewart, filed the lawsuit Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, according to four separate player statements. ""Despite overwhelming medical evidence ... the NFL not only failed to take effective action in an attempt to protect players from suffering, but failed to inform players of the true risks associated with concussions,"" the statements said. The men accused the NFL of using a ""hand-picked committee of physicians"" to misrepresent evidence of the effects of head trauma, particularly concussions, which were later more publicly linked to heightened risks of long-term brain injury. ""We do believe the NFL knew and had that available information with them for many years now,"" said attorney Mike McGlamry. ""Only recently had they come and acknowledged that concussions and multiple concussions do have this effect."" The four men said that since their playing days they've suffered from a range of symptoms, including headaches, sleeplessness and dementia. Still, McGlamry acknowledged the difficulty of targeting the NFL, particularly when most players voluntarily engaged in similar conduct during their time at the collegiate and high school levels. It's also unclear whether players' claims can be considered outside their current collective bargaining agreements, and whether the allegations are subject to a statute of limitations, most notable for players like Kuykendall, 53, who played for the Atlanta Falcons during the 1970s. The league responded Thursday to the lawsuit, saying it ""has long made player safety a priority and continues to do so."" ""Any allegation that the NFL intentionally sought to mislead players has no merit,"" the statement added. ""It stands in contrast to the league's actions to better protect players and advance the science and medical understanding of the management and treatment of concussions."" Lewis, 32, played for the Baltimore Ravens and the Cleveland Browns, ending his career in 2009. Levens, 41, played for the Philadelphia Eagles, New York Giants and the Green Bay Packers. Stewart, 38, who played as a safety for the Detroit Lions, said that since his retirement, he's experienced frequent headaches, difficulty sleeping and tingling sensations in his arms and hands. Knowing the risks associated with head trauma ""probably would have made me at least play a little bit different,"" Stewart told CNN. ""I would have used my head a whole lot less, or not at all, when it came to trying to make plays. But I was coached to do that. I did what I was coached to do, not knowing the ramifications that I'd be dealing with today."" Part of the problem, said former Atlanta Falcons linebacker Coy Wire, is a sports culture that encourages behavior largely out of step with the now recognized risks associated with head trauma. Head trauma injuries are exacerbated when coaches, even at the high school level say, "" 'Oh, you just got your bell rung. Get back out there and play,' "" said Wire. This can contribute, he added, to the danger of long-term brain damage. Later on Thursday, the NFL Players Association announced in a statement that it's ""not a party to this lawsuit and has no comment at this time."" In recent years, the NFL has attempted to strengthen rules that govern player conduct on the field, adding sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- in an effort to more independently evaluate injured players. In 2005, the league banned the practice of tackling a player by using his shoulder pads, a move commonly referred to as a ""horse-collar"" tackle, after concluding it commonly resulted in injury. It also recently strengthened a 1979 rule that prohibits players from using their helmets to butt, or ""spear"" players during a tackle -- a rule that critics had often complained lacked official enforcement. Players like Steelers' linebacker James Harrison have since faced hefty and repeated fines for helmet-first tackles. Still, others have called for added protections following a series of high-profile incidents involving former players' health. In May, scientists announced that an autopsy of the brain of former Chicago Bears safety David Duerson, 50, who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, showed evidence of ""moderately advanced"" chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a dementia-like brain disease afflicting athletes exposed to repeated brain trauma. CTE has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former NFL players studied at Boston University's Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy.  Their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions, sub-concussive blows to the head, or both. John Grimsley, who died in 2008 at the age of 45, also from a gunshot wound, was the first deceased athlete studied for the disease at the Boston University center, according to its website. ""Examination of Mr. Grimsley's brain confirmed extensive CTE,"" the website said. Mike Webster, an offensive lineman with the Pittsburgh Steelers who died at the age of 50, was also diagnosed posthumously with CTE. Scientists at Boston University say they have found evidence of CTE in the brain of an athlete as young as 18 years old.","Four former NFL players are suing the league .

"London (CNN)Want to get the latest issue of the world's most controversial magazine but can't get your hands on a paper copy? Don't worry, there's an app for that. The Charlie Hebdo app features the so-called ""survivors' issue"" of the satirical magazine, which sold out within minutes in France and across Europe this week. Versions are available for iOS, Android and Windows Phone. Once downloaded, users can purchase the latest edition for $2.99. Twelve people, including several of France's most famous cartoonists, were massacred at Charlie Hebdo's Paris office last week by gunmen who claimed the attack was retribution for the magazine's notorious cartoon caricatures of Islam and the Prophet Mohammed. Thousands of people waited outside newsstands on Wednesday -- some lining up before dawn -- to buy the new issue in a show of solidarity with the surviving members of Charlie Hebdo's staff. The magazine initially planned to publish 3 million copies of the issue -- 50 times the magazine's typical weekly circulation of 60,000 -- but upped it to 5 million as demand outstripped supply at stores across Europe. As shops ran out of copies, Charlie Hebdo columnist Patrick Pelloux wrote on Twitter, ""Thank you, and rest assured we will reprint and redistribute."" On Friday, hundreds of people still hoping to get their hands on a copy waited outside The French Bookshop in west London, which had limited sales of the in-demand issue to one copy per person. One customer, who identified herself as Ashley, had arrived at the shop at 6:30 a.m. She told CNN: ""I'm an artist and a musician, so freedom of expression and speech is very vital to me."" ""I'm going to get my French flatmate to translate it for me and I'm probably going to keep it as a keepsake,"" another customer, who identified herself as Emily, told CNN as she left the shop with her copy. The cover of the latest edition features a cartoon of a tearful Prophet Mohammed holding a banner that says ""Je Suis Charlie"" -- a message of support for those killed that spread from social media to the streets of Europe last week -- and a headline that declared ""All is forgiven."" Any depiction of Islam's prophet is considered blasphemy by many Muslims, and the latest edition received mixed reviews from the Muslim community. ""My initial thought is that the cover is a near perfect response to the tragedy,"" said Hussein Rashid, a professor of Islamic thought at Hofstra University in New York. ""They are not backing down from the depiction of Mohammed, exercising their free speech rights. At the same time, the message is conciliatory, humble, and will hopefully reduce the anger directed to the Muslim communities of France."" Yahya Adel Ibrahim, an imam in Australia, took a dim view of the latest cover but urged his 100,000 Facebook followers to follow the example of Mohammed. ""As it is clear that the cartoons are to be published again, Muslims will inevitably be hurt and angered, but our reaction must be a reflection of the teachings of the one we love & are angered for,"" Ibrahim said. ""Enduring patience, tolerance, gentleness and mercy was the character of our beloved Prophet."" Charlie Hebdo is no stranger to controversy. In November 2011 the magazine's office was burned down on the same day it was due to release an issue with a cover that appeared to poke fun at Islamic law. The cover cartoon depicted a bearded and turbaned cartoon figure of the Prophet Mohammed with a bubble saying, ""100 lashes if you're not dying of laughter."" In September 2012, despite the ongoing global furor over the anti-Islam film ""Innocence of Muslims,"" the magazine published an issue featuring a cartoon that appeared to depict a naked Mohammed, along with a cover that appeared to depict a Muslim man being pushed in a wheelchair by an Orthodox Jew. French and American officials expressed dismay with the decision, and France closed embassies and schools in about 20 countries temporarily as a precaution. Charlie Hebdo journalist Laurent Leger -- who survived last week's deadly attack -- defended the magazine at the time, saying the cartoons were not intended to provoke anger or violence. ""The aim is to laugh,"" Leger told BFM-TV in 2012. ""We want to laugh at the extremists -- every extremist. They can be Muslim, Jewish, Catholic. Everyone can be religious, but extremist thoughts and acts we cannot accept."" ""In France, we always have the right to write and draw. And if some people are not happy with this, they can sue us and we can defend ourselves. That's democracy,"" Leger said. ""You don't throw bombs, you discuss, you debate. But you don't act violently. We have to stand and resist pressure from extremism."" CNN's Daniel Burke and Brian Stelter contributed to this report.","Charlie Hebdo releases app in wake of massive demand for latest issue .

"(CNN)Are you stoned? That's the message Pope Francis seemed to be sending lawmakers Friday, saying the growing worldwide trend toward legalizing recreational drugs is a very, very bad idea. ""Drug addiction is an evil, and with evil there can be no yielding or compromise,"" he told participants at the International Drug Enforcement Conference in Rome. The Pope's call isn't shocking. Francis has spoken of the dangers of drug use before. But it lends his voice and the authority of the Catholic Church to the growing worldwide debate over legalizing or at least decriminalizing some recreational drugs, most notably marijuana. Two U.S. states -- Colorado and Washington -- have made marijuana use legal, and several other states, cities and countries have decriminalized its use or have announced plans to do so. Uruguay passed a law in December to create a regulated marijuana marketplace. Jamaican officials said this month that they plan to modify that nation's laws to decriminalize pot use and possession. And public opinion has rapidly shifted toward softer policies on marijuana use, particularly. In January, a CNN/ORC International survey found that 55% of respondents wanted to see marijuana made legal. That's up from 16% in 1987, according to the CNN poll and numbers from the General Social Survey. But Francis said such policies are ""not only highly questionable from a legislative standpoint, but they fail to produce the desired effects."" ""To think that harm can be reduced by permitting drug addicts to use narcotics in no way resolves the problem,"" he said. Could pot push voters to the polls this fall?

"(CNN)Best known for launching the 1970's all-girl punk rock band the Runaways, producer and manager Kim Fowley has died.  He was 75. ""It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Kim Fowley,"" independent music publisher Peer Music announced on its website Thursday. ""With a career in the music business spanning over fifty years, Fowley was a singularly unique figure in the realms of rock history."" Fowley worked with a wide range of artists, including Paul Revere and the Raiders, the Modern Lovers, Blue Cheer, Kiss and Helen Reddy. But he will be remembered in the rock and roll history books for helping form the California punk band, the Runaways. That all-female group, which featured Joan Jett, released four albums in the late 1970s. One of their hit songs was ""Cherry Bomb."" The band, which became an overnight sensation, broke up in 1979. ""There was a lurid quality to what he was trying to do"" with ""The Runaways,"" Rolling Stone contributing editor Anthony DeCurtis told CNN. He said Fowley's group of ""the teenage girls being dangled out there as jailbait turned out to be really inspiring. What started out as a joke, became really serious."" Jett and her post-Runaways group, the Blackhearts, are being inducted in to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year. Remembrances started pouring in on Twitter. Joan Jett tweeted ""Kim was a friend, he taught me so much. I am very sad."" Heavy metal singer Sebastian Bach tweeted ""RIP my friend Kim Fowley the King of the Night Time World, a true Rock and Roll character."" Ariel Pink, a singer-songwriter, tweeted ""rip Kim Fowley. No words. Prayers go out to his wife, kara. His music, life, and spirit will continue to be an inspiration."" British actor and musician Michael Des Barres tweeted ""Kim Fowley -- magician, manipulator & lover of rock 'n roll. I learned & laughed & was in awe of him for over 40 years."" In recent times, Billboard Magazine reported that Fowley was suffering from bladder cancer and ""in an interesting turn of events, former Runaways singer Cherie Curie cared for Fowley during his fight with cancer."" Billboard reported ""their reconciliation came in 2008 following years of legal battles over royalties and harsh verbal tirades in the press."" Fowley was known as a Los Angeles Sunset Strip character, often dressing in outrageous suits and pitching his latest project. ""He would do anything to seize the moment, he was kind of indestructible and you have to admire that,"" said DeCurtis. ""It's necessary for a band to have charisma, and it's necessary for a band to have a Kim Fowley in there someplace. The behind-the-scenes people are as much a part of rock 'n' roll as the guys onstage ... Kim Fowley is a necessary evil"" he told the San Diego Reader in 2012. People we've lost in 2015 .","Kim Fowley is perhaps best know for his work with ""The Runaways""

"It was a staggering sight, even in a Mexican city that has seen its share of violence in recent years as drug-related crimes surged. Seven bodies sat slumped in white plastic chairs placed near a central plaza in Uruapan, Mexico. Local media reported messages were left behind, written on poster board and pinned to some of the victims' bodies with icepicks. The men appeared to have been killed by gunfire, and investigators believe organized crime groups are to blame, Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency said. Investigators haven't provided details about who they suspect was responsible or why they targeted the men -- windshield washers and farm workers, according to Notimex. Uruapan, a city of a quarter million people in the western state of Michoacan, made headlines in 2006 when members of a drug cartel -- La Familia Michoacana -- hurled five decapitated heads of rival gang members onto a dance floor there. That cartel has since fractured, but violence in the region has remained a grisly reality. The seven corpses found in Uruapan last weekend were among at least 30 killed nationwide -- a high death toll that once again drew attention toward drug-related violence in Mexico, where more than 60,000 people were killed in drug-related violence from 2006 to 2012, according to Human Rights Watch. Read more: Rape case in Mexican resort city puts violence back into the spotlight . The violence comes as Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto pushes a new strategy aimed at focusing more on dealing with social and economic issues that fuel the drug trade and less on combating cartels head-on. Uruapan is among the metropolitan areas in Mexico tapped for the president's new program, which aims to prevent violence, school dropouts, addiction and domestic violence, and also to better detect problems in Mexico's education system. Without jobs and social programs, Pena Nieto told CNN last year, millions of Mexicans ""have no other option than to dedicate themselves sometimes to criminal activity."" The goal of the government's new strategy, Interior Minister Miguel Angel Osorio Chong said last month, is creating a ""culture of peace and respecting the law."" Mexico reports more than 26,000 missing . ""It is the responsibility of the state to pursue criminals and punish them to preserve peace and harmony,"" he said, ""but we are convinced that fighting and punishment alone do not resolve the problem."" Some analysts have praised the new government approach. ""The cartels have been able to recruit tens of thousands of killers in part because poor neighborhoods have been systematically abandoned over decades and lack sufficient schools, community centers and security -- in short they lack opportunity,"" the International Crisis Group said in a recent report on Mexico's cartel violence. ""There are many dedicated Mexican social workers with the experience and ability to reach the vulnerable groups if they are given resources. If they succeed in reducing violence, theirs can become a security model to follow instead of one to fear."" Will the new strategy work? Is this past weekend's violence in Uruapan and elsewhere a sign that the new tack isn't working? It's soon to tell, less than four month's into Pena Nieto's presidency, one analyst told CNN en Español this week. ""In politics, there are no miracles, in economics, there are no miracles, and in security even less so,"" said Jose Carreno, a Mexican journalist who has covered the government's security strategy. ""They are things that happen little by little, gaining ground piece by piece."" It could be up to a year before any significant changes show up in statistics, he said. And it's likely Mexican military troops deployed by former President Felipe Calderon to fight cartels will remain in the streets for another year as well, he said. ""I do not see any immediate substitute for them,"" he said. Some Mexicans have said they aren't ready to wait for a change in the government's approach. Self-defense groups have started forming in some areas where government troops haven't been able to put a stop to cartel violence. ""We think the government is very timid, very slow,"" Sergio Mejia, the head of an association of restaurant and business owners in Acapulco, told CNN last month. ""If there is no immediate response, it leaves us no choice but to join the fight."" Authorities are investigating the emerging defense groups, a top Mexican official told CNN en Español this week. ""It is an investigation to find out who they are, what weapons they have, how many of them there are, what they are pursuing, etc. We have them located, mapped, all of them. We are busy resolving the issue,"" said Manuel Mondragon, Mexico's national security commissioner. ""What are we going to do? Well, this is an issue that I can't reveal openly, but what I can say is that we have them precisely located and identified."" 13-year-old assassin murdered in Mexico . U.S. approach also shifting . In a report to Congress this month, the U.S. State Department said some efforts to combat cartels in Mexico have paid off. Major cartel leaders have been captured, the report says, and the number of annual deaths because of drug-related violence declined from 2011 to 2012. The United States and Mexico's cooperation to fight cartels is ""unprecedented,"" according to the State Department's 2013 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, which says the United States has provided $1.1 billion in security aid to Mexico since 2008 through the Merida Initiative. More leaders of criminal organizations have been brought to justice as a result, the report says. ""That success, however, has also resulted in smaller, fractured organizations that have violently attempted to consolidate their power,"" the report says. And with profits from the drug trade dropping, cartels have turned to other activities, such as kidnapping, extortion and human trafficking. The report suggests that for the United States, too, it's time for a new approach. ""The focus of U.S.-Mexico cooperation has shifted from providing large-scale equipment to engaging in training and capacity building, and from focusing on the federal-level to building state- and municipal-level capabilities. Accordingly, justice sector reforms, drug demand reduction, and culture of lawfulness initiatives should play a larger role,"" the report said. ""The United States should also continue programs to curb its domestic drug demand and inhibit the illegal flow of arms and cash into Mexico."" Pena Nieto has been pushing for ties for the neighboring nations to go beyond the drug war. And security issues received only a slight mention in statements from both governments Wednesday announcing President Barack Obama's plans to visit Mexico in May. As officials change their tones and tactics, authorities in Uruapan also will be trying a new approach, Mexico's state-run Notimex news agency reported Wednesday. Next month, officials will open trade-in centers there and elsewhere in Michoacan state where residents can receive tablets, netbooks or money. In exchange, they'll have to hand in their guns.

"(OPRAH.com) -- For more than 20 years, actress Christina Applegate has kept audiences laughing. ""It doesn't feel the same, and it's hard to carry your purse,"" Christina Applegate says. ""I cry at least once a day."" During her teenage years, she lit up the small screen as Kelly Bundy on the hit sitcom ""Married with Children."" After 11 hilarious seasons, Christina's career branched out to the big screen and Broadway. In 2007, Christina landed the starring role on ""Samantha Who?"" an acclaimed comedy series. After receiving Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for her performance, it seemed that nothing could stop Christina's triumphant return to TV. Then, in April 2008, shocking news silenced the laughter. At 36 years old, Christina was diagnosed with breast cancer. At first, Christina says she lived quietly with the disease. ""It's hard to live quietly,"" she says. ""I went through five weeks of work without telling anyone that this was going on in my life."" Now, Christina is going public with her personal battle to raise awareness among young women who may not think they're at risk. As the daughter of a breast cancer survivor, Christina says she's been vigilant about getting regular mammograms since she was 30 years old. In 2007, doctors recommended extra precautions. ""My doctor said that the mammograms weren't enough for me because of the denseness of my breasts,"" she says. ""He suggested that I get an MRI."" Christina went in for her first MRI screening, which produced disturbing results. ""They found some funky things going on [in one breast],"" she says. Doctors told her they needed to perform a biopsy. Then, the excruciating waiting game began. Christina continued to work and promote her sitcom, but the impending results were never far from her mind. A week later she says she got the phone call every woman dreads. ""[The doctor said], 'It came back positive,'"" she says. ""Right now I'm sitting here shaking remembering that moment."" Doctors explained that the cancer was only in her left breast, and thankfully, they caught it at an early stage. Christina says she held back her tears and immediately went into survival mode. The day after her diagnosis, Christina says she went in to see an oncologist and a surgeon. ""I'm a Sagittarius,"" she says. ""We need things done now. So, for me, I had to get in now, and I wanted to have my surgery now."" Within a week, Christina had her first lumpectomy. Doctors also did a biopsy of her lymph nodes to make sure the cancer hadn't spread. Since the cancer was caught early on, Christina was told she'd need six weeks of radiation instead of chemotherapy. Then, she received more life-changing news. A test for the BRCA gene -- also known as the ""breast cancer gene"" -- came back positive.  Oprah.com: Should you get tested for the gene? ""That sort of changed everything for me,"" she says. ""Radiation was something temporary, and it wasn't addressing the issue of this coming back or the chance of it coming back in my left breast. I sort of had to kind of weigh all my options at that point."" Christina was given two options... go forward with the radiation treatments and continue testing for the rest of her life or have both breasts removed. Christina made the dramatic decision to have a bilateral mastectomy. ""It came on really fast. It was one of those things that I woke up and it felt so right,"" she says. ""It just seemed like, 'I don't want to have to deal with this again. I don't want to keep putting that stuff in my body. I just want to be done with this.' & I was just going to let them go."" Before she went in for her surgery, Christina says she staged her first -- and last -- nude photo shoot. ""I made sure that I have close-up photographs of them from every angle so I can kind of remember them,"" she says. Christina's tears finally spilled over the day she met her surgeon. ""I met with my doctor, and I told him that was my decision,"" she says. ""He brought the surgeon in, and it was like it was the floodgates just opened up and I lost it."" Oprah.com: Going through a double mastectomy surgery . In July 2008, Christina went through with the surgery, which has left physical and emotional scars. ""It can be very painful,"" she says. ""It's also a part of you that's gone, so you go through a grieving process and a mourning process."" Before she went under the knife, Christina says the only mastectomy she'd ever seen was the one her mother received. ""[Her surgery] was in the '70s, and they didn't do a very good job back then,"" she says. ""So in my own mind I'm thinking, 'My God, I'm going to be butchered, and it's going to be horrible. I'm never going to love that part of me again.' & But I did a lot of research, and they can make some pretty boobies."" Currently, Christina says she has saline expanders in her body, which will make way for the new implants. Though she's proud of her proactive decision, she says she's reminded of her loss every day. ""It doesn't feel the same, and it's hard to carry your purse,"" she says. ""I cry at least once a day about it because it's hard to overlook it when you're standing there in the mirror. When you look down, it's the first thing you see... So you're reminded constantly of this thing -- this cancer thing that you had."" On the bright side, Christina says she won't have to wear a bra ever again. She also feels victorious in the fight against breast cancer. ""I have taken a very progressive stance in the rest of my life,"" she says. ""For that, I'm really grateful."" Days after her diagnosis, Christina says she reached out to family and friends, including Melissa Etheridge, a Grammy winner and breast cancer survivor. Melissa shared the lessons she learned during the fight for her own life. ""The first thing she said to me is: 'Christina, this is a blessing that's happened to you in your life. Right now, you get to start over, and right now you get to change everything -- the way that you deal with things in life, the way that you react to things. Fear can hurt you. Stress can hurt you. This is the time that you have this opportunity to change the way you eat... everything you do,'"" Christina says. Christina now looks at her health scare as a blessing. ""I am a 36-year-old person with breast cancer, and not many people know that that happens to women my age or women in their 20s,"" she says. ""This is my opportunity now to go out and fight as hard as I can for early detection."" As she's learned, early detection may not come from a mammogram. Christina says she will fight for women to have access to MRIs and genetic testing, which many insurance companies won't pay for. Christina says her health scare has shifted her priorities completely. ""[There's] this need and this desire to make every single day count,"" she says. ""I used to say...  'Don't sweat the small stuff -- not even the big stuff.' At the end of the day, none of it matters but your own joy, your own spiritual journey that you go on, God, your loved ones, your friends, your animals. These are the things you've got to cherish and love and embrace."" From ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" ""Christina Applegate: Why She Had a Double Mastectomy"" © 2008 .

"Hong Kong police plan to step up efforts against vice operations in the city following a massive crackdown on prostitution last week across the Chinese border, where police in Dongguan raided 2000 establishments and detained more than 900 people. Senior Hong Kong police expressed fears that the Special Administrative Zone could fill the vice vacuum left after the raids by more than 6000 police on the Chinese industrial city just 60 miles (100km) to the north. Commissioner of Police Andy Tsang Wai-hung told local media that police would be stepping up operations against the sex trade, adding that proliferation of vice in the territory was a concern following the crackdown. ""There is definitely potential for the sex trade to suddenly grow quickly here but it won't just be confined to a rise in prostitution,"" a senior Hong Kong police office told the South China Morning Post. ""It will bring with it all the usual vice that goes with it: narcotics, money laundering, triad protection."" The Chinese Ministry of Public Security on Sunday ordered police across China to step up efforts to tackle the ""three vices"" -- prostitution, gambling and drug trafficking -- warning officials they would be held accountable for illegal activities. While Dongguan, situated between the large population zones of Shenzhen and Guangzhou, has long been associated with prostitution -- it is known as China's ""sin city"" -- China's Ministry of Public Security has indicated it will not limit the crackdown to the city, and that the operations will also target officials benefiting from the trade. ""Be resolute with the crackdown no matter who is involved, and regardless of what official ranks they are at, with no leniency or soft-heartedness,"" the ministry said in a post on its website over the weekend. Dongguan deputy mayor and police chief Yan Xiaokang was fired from his post last week and ten other senior police officers have been subject to a range punishments in the wake of the raids, state media reported. Other provinces including Zhejiang, Gansu, Shandong, Guangxi and Heilongjiang have conducted their own vice raids in recent days, indicating that the campaign has been directed from the central government. Dubbed the ""exterminate yellow"" campaign -- the color in China associated with prostitution -- the crackdown comes after a report by the national broadcaster CCTV on the sex industry in Dongguan. According to media reports cited by the English-language China Daily,  Dongguan -- with a large and shifting migrant population from across China -- could have as many as 300,000 working in the illegal industry, despite harsh penalties for involvement. The nationwide clampdown on the three vices is the latest target for the government of President Xi Jinping, which promised a widescale crackdown on rampant graft when it came to power in 2012. Xi has also been behind an austerity drive to rein in extravagant spending, banning officials from serving exotic dishes such as shark fin soup at banquets. Anger over corruption has prompted a raft of ""mass incidents,"" an official euphemism for protests, worrying officials defending one-party rule. Last year, Xi vowed to crack down on both ""tigers"" and ""flies"" -- powerful leaders and lowly bureaucrats -- in his campaign against corruption and petty officialdom.","Hong Kong police plan to step up operations against vice operations .

"While Rafael Nadal was celebrating his 26th birthday, the two biggest threats to his hopes of a record seventh French Open title were battling to stay in the tournament. World No. 1 Novak Djokovic came from two sets down on Court Philippe Chatrier on Sunday to salvage his hopes of becoming the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four grand slam titles. On Court Suzanne Langlen, 16-time grand slam champion Roger Federer fought back after losing the first set to a player who idolized him as a child and only gained entry into the main draw as a lucky loser from qualifying. Both advanced to the quarterfinals ahead of Nadal, who will take on Argentine 13th seed Juan Monaco on Monday. Jaded No. 1 Azarenka crashes out in Paris . The last time Djokovic came from two sets down was against Federer in the U.S. Open semifinals in September, when the Serbian won his fourth major title. Since then he has added a third Australian Open to his collection, but his form in 2012 has not reached the stunning heights of last year -- when his 43-match winning run was ended by the Swiss veteran in the semifinals at Roland Garros. ""I played very badly, but I won thanks to my fighting spirit,"" Djokovic said after struggling to beat Italy's world No. 25 Andreas Seppi 4-6 6-7 (5-7) 6-3 7-5  6-3 in more than four hours on Sunday. ""He was the better player for the first two sets and I was fortunate to  come through. But even at two sets down I still believed I could do it, and  that's about the only positive I can take. It was one of those days when  nothing worked."" Seppi, appearing in the fourth round of a major for the first time, had won only two sets in losing their seven previous meetings. Nadal ready for first real test at Roland Garros . Djokovic will next take on either French fifth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga or Swiss No. 18 Stanislas  Wawrinka, having reached the last eight of a grand slam for the 12th consecutive time. Tsonga led 6-4 7-6 (8-6) 3-6 3-6 4-2 in a virtual repeat of his clash with Wawrinka last year when play was suspended due to fading light. Federer is through to his 32nd successive quarterfinal after beating 21-year-old Belgian debutant David Goffin 5-7 7-5 6-2 6-4. The 30-year-old is now tied with American Andre Agassi on 36 last-eight appearances, leaving them second equal overall behind Jimmy Connors' record of 41. He will next take on either Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych or 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro of Argentina -- who led 7-6 (8-6) 1-6 6-3 when play was halted long before the Tsonga-Wawrinka match, despite appearing to struggle with a strapped-up knee. ""I thought he played really well. Great impression,"" Federer said of his young opponent. ""He took the ball early every time. ""He's got great potential in terms of his touch and the way he reads the game. I thought it was an interesting match."" Goffin, who told the crowd after the match that he had pictures of Federer on his wall as a child, was ranked 109th in the world when the clay-court tournament started but he will be up to 68th when it ends next Sunday. He won his first two qualifiers but was beaten in the third before a late reprieve after home hope Gael Monfils pulled out due to injury. ""I came out of the qualifiers and I played my best tennis in my first three matches. Then playing Roger was the cherry on the cake,"" Goffin said. ""I won't hide the fact that I had photos of Roger everywhere on the walls  of my bedroom. It was like a dream for me playing him here."" Goffin stunned Czech 23rd seed Radek Stepanek in the first round proper, then beat more experienced opposition in veteran Frenchman Arnaud Clement -- playing his home tournament for the last time -- and Poland's Lukasz Kubot. He was the first lucky loser to reach the last 16 of a grand slam since compatriot Dick Norman did so at Wimbledon in 1995.","World No. 1 Novak Djokovic rallies from 2-0 down to reach French Open quarterfinals .

"In 1974, Charles Koch started the Charles Koch Foundation. In 1976, the foundation was renamed Cato Institute, with Koch as one of the co-founders.  His vision was to build a nonpartisan organization that would advance ideas that enable all people to prosper by promoting liberty, limited government, free markets and peace.  That vision has remained a constant since the beginning. I currently serve on the board of Cato, and have worked with libertarian organizations for more than 20 years, including Mercatus Center and the Institute for Humane Studies.  I have worked closely with Charles Koch and his brother David on numerous libertarian endeavors. In each instance, these two men have consistently championed libertarian principles, even in the face of unfair and inaccurate criticism. Robert Levy, Cato's current chairman, would have you believe otherwise.  According to his April 2 op-ed, Charles and David Koch seek to turn Cato into a ""policy shop for the Kochs' political operations.""  This is patently false. David, who has been a director of Cato since 1987 and serves on its executive committee, and Charles have consistently supported a nonpartisan Cato. In 1980, Charles brought a resolution before the Cato board confirming that Cato should be nonpartisan. Together, they have contributed approximately $40 million to the institute. Cato's independence has never been in question in the 37 years the Kochs have been involved with the organization, and there is nothing real to suggest it will be an issue going forward. In bringing up previous conversations that he had with David Koch, Levy is distorting the record in order to support his position. I attended the November 2011 meeting where Levy spoke with David. Subsequent conversations with Levy confirmed that the Kochs have never proposed that Cato cooperate with only one group, or work exclusively with Koch-affiliated groups or groups affiliated with one political party. David reiterated this point publicly in a statement on March 22. Levy wrote that the Kochs seek to ""get (their) way"" or ""take control"" of Cato. This is misleading. Ed Crane, who is the president of Cato, wants to maintain control of the institute by circumventing Cato's shareholders' agreement. All that the Kochs seek is for the parties to Cato's shareholders' agreement (which has been in place since 1985) to be bound by that agreement. Crane and Levy do not want this because, with the recent death of one of Cato's shareholders, they are concerned that they will lose control of Cato. We should ask why self-professed libertarians would seek to abrogate voluntary agreements -- a key tenet of libertarian thought. Crane and Levy have talked about seeking a board of independent directors, but every action by them suggests they want the opposite -- a board that is responsive to and dependent upon them, as well as donors they view as acceptable. When I was unanimously elected to the Cato board in 2010, I was excited about the prospect of working with an organization of Cato's reputation. I had also previously been offered a job by Crane in 2002.  I expected an organization where people would be free to engage in constructive debates -- where differing points of view would be acknowledged and respected. What I found was something very different. What is most upsetting is that all of this public battle could have been avoided. Charles and David Koch were willing to keep the 2011 Cato board in place without making any changes, but Crane and Levy demanded an immediate vote on directors. The Kochs have also proposed third-party mediation, but Crane and Levy refused that as well, calling mediation a delay tactic. It is Crane and Levy's concern about their control of Cato, rather than concern for the good of the organization, that is driving the dispute. Cato is losing its voice and focus, at a time when the debate over the role of the government in our society is more needed than ever. If Cato's board members truly care about the institute's future, they should demand that Crane and Levy stop this scorched-earth public relations fight, which is weakening the organization and harming its reputation, and force immediate negotiations. Just last week, Charles Koch again proposed that the parties choose a third-party mediator in hopes of reaching an agreement.  Cato's management continues to refuse it. They show no desire to end this state of affairs short of capitulation to Crane and Levy's demands.  If Cato is truly to become independent, then it needs to become independent from all of its shareholders -- first and foremost, Crane.","Kevin Gentry: Charles Koch has consistently championed libertarian ideas .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Los Angeles' Interstate 405 will reopen as soon as 11:30 a.m. (2:30 p.m. ET) Sunday, more than 17 hours ahead of schedule, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said Sunday. The freeway has been closed since Friday night to allow crews to demolish a section of bridge to make way for a car pool lane. The anticipated gloom and doom didn't produce gridlock. In fact, rather heavenly highway conditions were reported despite the closing of the major freeway for an expansion project. Southern California residents were heeding an unprecedented local public awareness campaign urging drivers to stay home while Interstate 405 was closed in the heart of the city, the nation's second-largest. But officials still weren't taking chances early in the weekend. ""So far, so good,"" California Department of Transportation spokeswoman Judy Gish told CNN early Saturday afternoon. She acknowledged Californians have now coined a new word to replace the ""Carmageddon"" buzzword. ""Carmaheaven, I've heard that,"" Gish said. ""Well, you know, I think what's important to address is if people start driving as usual, we will have Carmaggedon. ""It's been relatively light because people have been listening to the message, and they are not out on the road. We want to make sure they don't get complacent and say, 'There's nothing to get alarmed about and I may as well go out.' And if they do, we may see those delays that we warned them about,"" Gish said. Traffic was also unusually light on Pacific Coast Highway, a recommended alternative route for motorists traveling to Los Angeles International Airport. And parking lots at Santa Monica Beach, typically packed on a sunny Saturday, were relatively empty. The closure of the 405 is being deemed such a potentially calamitous event that locals called it ""Carmaggedon."" That's because southern California is notorious for its love affair with the car and its reluctance to embrace public transportation. One of the busiest freeways in the country, the 405 is one of two mountain passes in the heart of Los Angeles and is the major coastal artery connecting southern California with the rest of the state. ""We are the car capital of the United States of America and the single-passenger-car capital,"" Villaraigosa told CNN. A 10-mile stretch of 10-lane I-405 closed for the demolition of a bridge section made for a surreal scene overnight -- a stretch of freeway without any traffic. It is expected to remain that way for about 53 hours. Crews closed ramps late Friday on the 405, where it passes over the Santa Monica Mountains, California Department of Transportation officials said. The $1.2 billion construction project calls for replacing a portion of a bridge at Mulholland Drive, a mountain summit road that is featured in many Hollywood films, authorities said. A year from now, crews will have to shut down the 405 again to replace a final portion of the Mulholland Drive bridge, officials said. Villaraigosa said officials carried out ""an unprecedented"" campaign urging motorists to stay put or use public transportation. ""It doesn't have to be 'Carmageddon.' That's why we have done so much outreach to the public,"" the mayor said. The weekend construction project should be completed by 5 a.m. Monday to accommodate the morning rush hour, officials said. The project also calls for adding a car-pool lane in each direction, creating ""the largest HOV system in the world"" at 48.6 miles in length between the San Fernando Valley and Orange County, said Mike Miles, the California Department of Transportation's director for Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The two-year project will replace two more bridges, also to accommodate the widening of the 405, and will improve about two dozen on-off ramps and add 18 miles of sound-deadening walls for nearby residents, Miles said. ""This is a big project that is much needed, and it will be a great benefit to the public,"" Miles said. The 405 is usually one of the busiest freeways in the country, carrying about 500,000 cars a day through the Sepulveda Pass, a critical artery connecting Californians along the coast. The 405 achieved notoriety on national television as the corridor that former NFL player O.J. Simpson used as he was being slowly chased by police in 1994. The highway also cuts through the west side of Los Angeles, an area that includes the high-status communities of Bel Air, Brentwood, Beverly Hills and Santa Monica. The four-mile southbound section is closed between U.S. 101 and Getty Center Drive ramps. The 10-mile northbound section is closed between U.S. 101 and Interstate 10. Los Angeles International Airport is urging travelers to get there by public transit, especially rail, or to stay at nearby hotels for early morning flights. There is an app, or several, for ""Carmageddon."" KABC has partnered with Waze, the mobile social traffic and navigation app, to help navigate the traffic. ""The app provides free turn-by-turn GPS navigation based on the live conditions of the road,"" the station said. Celebrities are even tweeting -- cheekily -- about this weekend's affront to the Los Angeles driving experience. Twitter titan and actor Ashton Kutcher has gotten into the act: ""LAPD askd me 2tweet: 405fwy btwn 10 & 101 will b closed July16-17. In xchange I would like a free pass on that stoplight tickt IT WAS YELLOW."" When shown a copy of the tweet while he was being interviewed on CNN, the mayor laughed about the request to fix the ticket. ""No, thank you, Ashton,"" Villaraigosa said. CNN's Sonya Hamasaki and Zohreen Adamjee contributed to this report.","NEW: Interstate 405 expected to open ahead of schedule, Villaraigosa says .

"When the tearful broadcaster broke the news to North Koreans that their leader, Kim Jong Il, had died, the audience in the hall gasped. Then the hysterics began, along with the bawling and sobbing. ""Father!"" mourners cried. A wailing woman pounded her fist against her chest to signify heartache. Some appeared to go into physical convulsions. Other North Koreans sobbed so hard, they barely maintained their balance. ""Our leader endured all the hardships,"" one mourner told state-run Korean Central News Agency in a televised interview. ""I can't believe it. Our leader, he's still with us."" Even the reporter holding KCNA's microphone bowed his head and trembled. In North Korean media videos viewed by CNN, people wept in fitful, theatrical proportions. Whether the mass grieving was genuine is up to debate. Cultures grieve differently. For instance, in South Korea, it's acceptable to express sorrow vocally, said Sung-Yoon Lee, a research fellow at the National Asia Research Program. But North Korea presents a unique case. ""It's such a regimented, uniform society, people are conditioned from their early years to praise and adore their leader,"" he said. ""The passing of their leader would be an indication to grieve properly so they are not to be stigmatized by failing to grieve properly. There are always people watching you -- if you are not devastated by the news, you may get in trouble."" While some may exaggerate, for others the grief is authentic, Lee said. ""I think there would be great deal of sincerity, because they're so programmed and conditioned and have an incentive to outperform their families, neighbors in grieving properly,"" he said. ""North Koreans are raised to praise their leader, as are Christians for God. For North Koreans, it's part of the rhetoric to thank the fatherly leader. For them to learn the death of a near God-like leader, it certainly has an emotional reaction."" When TV cameras approached the North Korean grievers, some of them were so overwhelmed they could barely utter coherent sentences. ""If it's a public figure that has died, everybody has the illusion that they know that person or were at some point connected to them,"" said Darcie Sims, a grief management specialist and director of the American Grief Academy in Seattle. ""Mass hysteria soon occurs and is very contagious. When we see people do things in large groups, it spreads like wildfire. It only takes a few people, and the reactions spread amongst the population."" North Koreans interviewed on state television thanked Kim for everything, including trains, theaters and even their warm homes. Many seemed to refuse to believe he was dead. The public mourning illustrates the grip of Kim's power, said Scott Atran, director of research and anthropology at the French National Center for Scientific Research and psychology professor at the University of Michigan. To stay in power, many dictators identify and play upon their people's fears. After a history of occupation by other Asian powers, Kim and his father relied on their motto of self-sufficiency, called ""juche,"" to justify the country's reclusive nature. Because of this philosophy, which barred outside perspectives, Atran said people in North Korea ""had no alternative view of reality."" It also helped that the Kims controlled the police and military. Atran said he believes North Koreans' weeping is ""absolutely sincere. They're clearly emotionally tied up with the dictator."" ""We're used to some extent of institutionalized criticism, an opposition, and in these countries, there isn't anything. There is uniform control of information. The only information comes from the political leadership in ways it desires. That's your world -- you see the world of threat and fear, and the dictator poses as the way out of it."" Atran compared the reaction to Kim's death to Spanish dictator Francisco Franco's passing in 1975. ""The place where his support was, there was mass mourning and hysteria at his death,"" he said. Drawing another historical comparison, Lee said he recalled when Kim's father,  Kim Il Sung, died in 1994. ""The level of grief, we hear from North Korean defectors, was that the North Korean people had general admiration for the father because he had revolutionary credentials,"" Lee said.  ""The North Koreans did not go through a famine under the elder Kim."" Nevertheless, mourners were effusive in their praise for Kim Jong Il on the state-run television station. ""He has loved us so much. We weren't able to repay him,"" one mourner said. Another said, ""It's too much!  It's too much! Leader, please come back. ... You cannot leave us. We will always wait for you, leader.""","North Korean TV shows hysterical reaction to Kim Jong Il's death .

"Ours is a culture that loves to celebrate youth, but there are those 30 and older who will tell you that leaving one's 20s behind is like a revelation. Growing out of that decade often means growing out of bad decision-making, frustrated searching and feeling generally as though life's a pinball machine -- and you're the ball. As you age, hopefully you realize that what you've lost in youthfulness you've gained in wisdom. In the best scenarios, you know how to bounce back from bumps and are better at avoiding valleys. You appreciate your mistakes, but you'll be damned if you'll repeat them. As much as we'd hoped she would, Amy Winehouse never got that far. When she died at 27 last July, few truly knew the intimate details of her personal life. The public could really know only what we'd read about, seen and heard -- that she was a troubled young woman struggling with drug and alcohol abuse and that whatever was plaguing her threatened to overshadow a superb talent. Ahead of her standout performance via satellite at the 2008 Grammy Awards, the singer was enmeshed in negative press and a few in the media openly questioned how long she'd survive. She went on to win five awards that night, including best new artist. She owned that evening and touched hearts with her look of utter amazement and how she fled into the arms of one of her back-up singers when she bested artists such as Beyonce and Rihanna for record of the year. The tragedy of Winehouse's passing wasn't just that the predictions came true, or that we'd lost an undeniably great talent, but also that she lost a fight so early in life. This was an artist who was blessed with the presence of someone who'd seen it all and a voice from another lifetime, a woman who could write about and then sing to life some of love's darkest sides. She sang us through our own rough spots and regrets, but couldn't seem, in the public's eye, anyway, to do the same for herself. Mitch Winehouse on losing Amy: 'You take every day as it comes' ""I don't write songs because I want my voice to be heard or I want to be famous or any of that stuff,"" Winehouse told CNN in a 2007 interview. ""I write songs about things I have problems with and I have to get past them and I have to make something good out of something bad."" We can't pretend to know her struggle with alcohol or substance abuse, but we've all felt some variant of the longing, loneliness, hurt and infatuation she put into her music. Winehouse presented those emotions in a visceral way with which we could connect. She could take a personal experience and strike a note of universal truth. Take, for example, ""Rehab,"" her Grammy-winning but controversial track from her autobiographical second album ""Back to Black."" It's about the time her management tried to get her sober and she refused. But it was the smirking wisecracks and stubborn defiance that had us singing along. On her jazzy 2003 debut ""Frank,"" it was the beautifully sung, detailed story of wounded pride on ""You Sent Me Flying,"" and the tsk'ing, sneering disappointment in a lover on ""Stronger Than Me."" Winehouse scores posthumous No.1 . ""You Know I'm No Good"" provided a sultry soundtrack for the flawed and self-critical while ""Tears Dry on Their Own"" is an anthem of resolve. The album's title track, Winehouse explained in that 2007 interview, the aftermath of a broken love. Her massive appeal was backed by strong production on both albums, thanks to collaborations with producers Salaam Remi and Mark Ronson, and of course that voice -- rich, evocative and captivating. Those elements helped her songs' content to shine; everything's discussed with brash honesty and often a sense of humor. ""There's no point in saying anything but the truth,"" Winehouse told the Guardian in 2004. ""Because, at the end of the day, I don't have to answer to you, or my ex, or ... I shouldn't say God ... or a man in a suit from the record company. I have to answer to myself."" That frankness and headstrong independence is what we loved about her and could relate to. Although some talked callously about her struggles, there was still an underlying hope that she'd push past her problems. So when she couldn't, her July 23 death felt to many like a sucker punch. At the time of her death, it appeared that Winehouse was focused on recovery. An inquest last fall ruled that she'd died of alcohol poisoning and a family spokesman said at the time that ""Amy was battling hard to conquer her problems with alcohol, and it is a source of great pain that she could not win in time."" Who knows what the next few years of her life could have brought. That question will always linger and is the difficulty of watching someone pass on so young -- those of us left living know just how much more life can bring. Perhaps she would have found, as Slate wrote in 2008, that ""there are other, better things to romanticize than hard times and hard booze."" Instead, we're left to hope that when she died, she still felt the same way as she did when she spoke to Harper's Bazaar in 2010. Holding on to nary an unfulfilled goal, she said, ""If I died tomorrow, I would be a happy girl."" Winehouse producer: I still hear her voice .","Amy Winehouse died a year ago today at 27 .
Fans and fellow stars were rooting for her to continue to find success .
The tragedy of her death was to watch a woman lose a battle so early in life ."
"I pump the gas to the crest of the muddy hill, engine roaring. A sharp hairpin bend immediately requires a swift swing of the wheel, but the tires keep their grip and I bump my way down a steep incline of mud, rocks and tree roots. At the bottom I'm greeted with a deep flooded section of track and as the vehicle plows through, a colossal splash of muddy water swamps the hood. Through the swampy greenery of reeds and ferns, I feel, for a moment, like a khaki-clad explorer of the Empire, navigating the jungles of British East India. In fact I'm cruising in a brand new Land Rover Discovery, from London to Eastnor Castle in the Malvern Hills, on day two of Land Rover's ""Best of British"" tour, having kicked off in style with a night of world class luxury at the legendary Savoy Hotel. My mission is to become even more British than I already am, delving into my own culture with abandon, discovering the land and its history, in order that one day I might be able to order a ""Gee 'n' Tee,"" play a game of croquet and use the word ""chap"" in a dozen different ways without sounding like a charlatan. If my lunch stop is anything to go by, it won't be long before I'm ordering that quintessential Brit drink from a butler too -- after a pass of Windsor Castle and the Chiltern Hills we pull up at the gilded gates of Blenheim Palace. 5 must-play golf courses in the Canadian Rockies . Blenheim Palace . ""Welcome to the birthplace of Winston Churchill and residence of the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough,"" announces our host in a cut-glass accent. This 18th century Baroque masterpiece is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and despite a recent land-selling controversy, it remains a day trip destination that'll tire the kids out nicely, with an adventure playground, maze and mini-train just some of the attractions besides the house tour and grounds. Quickly, we're whisked off for our victuals in the Indian Room, its colonial furniture and tropical decor harking back to a time when Britain really did rule the waves. A retired army colonel gazes at the exotic milieu, ""Ah, could be Bombay 1895,"" he muses wistfully. The days of the Raj live on in this corner of England. Strolling around the gardens, I do a mental check of my kit list for the next few days. Green wellies -- yep. Barbour jacket -- yep. Trusty hound and a tweed deerstalker cap? Er... well, maybe that would be taking this whole aristocracy fantasy a bit far but it's easy to get carried away on this trip. This is the England of Downton Abbey and Gosford Park -- an exclusive tour through our green and pleasant land, staying in historic palaces, ancient manor houses and chocolate box villages along the route. Traditional country pursuits are all part of the fun too, although nothing as contentious as fox hunting. And though I'm doing this tour in that icon of British motoring, the Land Rover, it of course doesn't take a 4WD vehicle to negotiate the tarmac roads of southern England. Which is why we are heading for Eastnor Castle, Land Rover's training and testing ground since 1962. The sumptuous castle will be our home for the next two days and when we're not bouncing around on our antique four-poster beds or rubbing shoulders with suits of armor we'll be out in the 5,000-acre estate, putting our off-road driving skills to the test on a private network of forest tracks, steep hills, deep water and of course, this being England, plenty of mud. Having ""done the practical,"" later we'll find out how this car favored by England's land-owning elite is actually put together too. Driving and discovery . The Barbour jacket and green wellies come into their own the following day as we stride out across the castle's grounds, shotguns over our shoulders for our own version of the legendary hunting parties of the Victorian and Edwardian age when shooting skills were considered the mark of a man, alongside horsemanship and a stiff upper lip. While no feathered friends are bagged (just pigeons of the clay variety), we do get to hang with some top birds -- falcons. ""Now, this is real hunting,"" says the falconer with pride. ""People have been hunting with birds of prey in England for 1,200 years, since the Saxon times."" Never mind the history; seeing these predators in action gives you a sense of the wild like few other things and its popularity is booming in the country. But we mustn't dither, for after heading across country, stopping for a proper English cream tea and a night in the honey-stone village of Lower Slaughter (it really deserves a nicer name) we arrive in Gaydon, the home of Land Rover. This is where we get our petrol head on for the engineering tour of the plant plus a chance to drive some of the vintage vehicles, harking back to a time when men were men and Land Rovers were workhorses. We'd already run these machines through their paces at Eastnor, careering through flooded fields and up and down muddy hillocks on the test track -- and now we got to see how all that engineering was put together. From what was simply a riveted steel utility vehicle to today's air-conditioned dream machine with computerized terrain response, the Land Rover really has come a long way since the first Series 1 model rolled off the production line back in 1948. Take it from me -- the men on the trip found it fascinating. Shaking it all off . Of course, this being the Best of British tour means it can end only one way -- with Shakey. We're off to Stratford-Upon-Avon to experience the genius of the Bard at the Royal Shakespeare Company with the added bonus of dinner on the theater's rooftop restaurant and Champagne and petit-fours during the interval. And did I mention that we have the best seats in the house? A final day in the luxurious surroundings of the William Cecil Hotel on the Burghley Estate sees some of the group attend the famous Burghley Horse Trials. But for me, the fantasy is over. The last six days have been an immersion in elegance, excellence and impeccable good taste -- and a unique window into the grandeur of Britain's past. I hand over the keys to my Land Rover with a farewell pat, as I know it is unlikely we'll ever be reacquainted, and make my way back to real life. Now. Where can one find a decent ""Gee 'n' Tee""?

"The Ohio man who confessed in a viral video that he killed a man while driving drunk was sentenced Wednesday to six-and-a-half years in prison and a lifetime suspension of his driver's license. Dressed in a green prison uniform, 22-year-old Matthew Cordle addressed the Columbus, Ohio, courtroom before Judge David Fais handed down his sentence. ""Whatever my sentence may be, the true punishment is living,"" Cordle said. He was also ordered to pay court costs and a $1,075 fine. Cordle pleaded guilty in September to aggravated vehicular homicide and operating a vehicle while impaired. He made headlines when he posted a YouTube video on September 3 confessing to driving while drunk and killing 61-year old Vincent Canzani on June 22. Several days after the video appeared online, Cordle surrendered to authorities and was charged for his involvement in the wrong-way crash. Cordle told a judge at a September hearing that he did not remember the night of June 22 because he ""blacked out"" from drinking too much. He also told the judge that he had not had any alcohol since the night of the accident, and that he had attended a two-week alcohol rehabilitation program. Wednesday morning, Cordle's confession video was played in the courtroom. Fais said he felt it would be beneficial for the video to be viewed because it was about ""more than Mr. Cordle."" He said it was about society and the ""epidemic"" of drugs and alcohol problems he sees in his courtroom. After the video was shown, the judge read two letters aloud. The first was from the victim's ex-wife, Cheryl Canzani Oates. In her letter, Oates said her former husband would not want to see two lives lost as a result of this incident. She said she didn't believe Canzani would want to see Cordle receive the maximum sentence and that she believes Cordle was ""sincere in admitting he was sorry"" that he took another man's life. ""Nothing will bring Vincent back,"" Oates said in the letter. ""I know what pain Matthew feels. The pain will stay with him until his death."" The second letter was from Herald Dennis, Jr., who survived what's called the nation's worst drunken driving crash in the spring of 1988 in Carrollton, Kentucky. Dennis said he lost several friends and suffered third-degree burns on his body ""as a result of one man's decision to drive drunk."" In his letter, Dennis said he has waited 25 years for a ""simple acknowledgment or remorse"" from the man who caused his accident. Dennis said Cordle showed ""courage to surrender and take responsibility for his actions and show contrition to the family of his victim."" Rising to speak on behalf of her father was the victim's daughter, Angela Canzani. Addressing the video, she said, ""I've heard about a message. The message we don't want to hear is that if you hit and kill someone -- and admit to it -- you get away with it."" ""My father got a death sentence. Eight-and-a-half years is nothing,"" she told the judge, referring to the maximum sentence Cordle could have received.  ""After eight-and-a-half years, Matthew Cordle will have his life back -- my father is never coming back."" Cordle was the last to speak at the hearing. He offered another apology to the victim's family. ""It should have been me instead of an innocent man. I vow that I'll do everything I can to prevent it from happening again and his memory from fading."" Asked Thursday what he thought about the sentence, Cordle told CNN's ""New Day"" from jail that ""there is really no fair sentence when it comes to the loss of life."" ""It's just time, and time won't bring back the victim, unfortunately,"" Cordle told CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""I'm just glad that the family can have some measure of closure, and I hope that they find peace throughout this."" Cordle said he was ""going to do everything I can to walk out of prison a better man than I walked in."" He said he struggled with drinking, and had been a drunken driver before the night of the fatal crash. ""I think the bad statistic is that first-time DUI offenders drink and drive 80 times before they get caught, and that is definitely a category I fall under,"" he said. ""I can't believe I didn't see something like this coming. That was one of the biggest emotions that I had throughout this, was frustration with myself."" Asked about Angela Canzani's feelings about him and his video, Cordle said he understands, and he doesn't want to cause her pain. But his message -- pleading with people not to drink and drive -- is ""one that is very necessary,"" he said. ""The whole point of it is so people don't have to feel the pain that she's feeling, and I hope to prevent that,"" he said. Opinion: Online confessions -- morally admirable, legally damaging .

"(CNN)The Grateful Dead is planning on making one final splash -- or should that be ""Ripple""? The venerable San Francisco band is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its formation with a three-day stand at Chicago's Soldier Field on July 3, 4 and 5, it said in a news release. The band's last concert took place there 20 years ago. The four original surviving members -- Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh and Bob Weir -- will take part, along with Phish's Trey Anastasio and longtime Dead pal Bruce Hornsby. Keyboardist Jeff Chimenti is also participating. Guitarist Jerry Garcia died in 1995. The band has also lost other members, including Ron ""Pigpen"" McKernan, a singer, organist and harmonica player who died in 1973, and keyboardist Keith Godchaux, who died in 1980. The band, commonly known as ""the Dead,"" formed in San Francisco in 1965, part of that city's growing rock 'n' roll counterculture scene along with Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company and the Charlatans. It developed a hardcore fanbase of Deadheads thanks to tireless touring and a close-knit, open-minded culture. Its songs include ""Ripple,"" ""Uncle John's Band,"" ""Truckin',"" ""Box of Rain"" and ""Touch of Grey."" The latter is the Dead's only Top 10 hit. ""It is with respect and gratitude that we reconvene the Dead one last time to celebrate -- not merely the band's legacy, but also the community that we've been playing to, and with, for 50 years,"" Lesh said in the news release.

"The worlds of politics and arts mingled Sunday at the annual Kennedy Center Honors, with President Barack Obama among those toasting five stars of stage, screen and music. ""Each of them has been blessed with an extraordinary gift,"" the president said of the night's honorees. ""Tonight, we thank them for sharing that gift with us."" The festivities in Washington began with a White House reception, where Obama made his remarks flanked by the honorees. People moved from there across town to The Kennedy Center overlooking the Potomac River for a gala performance. The performing arts space, named in honor of the late President John F. Kennedy, is marking its 40th anniversary this year, and this is the 34th time that it has honored individuals in a ""celebration of the arts."" Past honorees run an entertainment gamut -- from the likes of Clint Eastwood and Sean Connery in the movie world, to Aretha Franklin and Bob Dylan in music, to Ginger Rogers and Mikhail Baryshnikov in dance, among dozens of others. This year's slate of honorees are similarly eclectic, though with a distinctly musical bent. Singer-songwriter Neil Diamond has sold more than 125 million records and scored 39 top-10 singles -- including ""Cracklin' Rosie,"" ""Sweet Caroline"" and ""America"" -- according to a biography posted on the Kennedy Center's website. Legendary saxophonist and composer Sonny Rollins has long stood out on the jazz scene even while playing alongside luminaries such as Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie. Atlanta-bred musical theater star Barbara Cook made her mark on Broadway. She's also toured the world and produced several studio albums. Yo-Yo Ma -- described in his biography as the nation's ""cellist-in-chief"" -- has won 16 Grammy awards over his illustrious career and last year was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom. Sunday night's only non-musical winner is actress Meryl Streep. She burst on the movie scene in 1978 in ""The Deer Hunter"" and ""Kramer vs. Kramer,"" later winning plaudits for her roles in films such as ""Sophie's Choice,"" ""Out of Africa"" and more recently ""Julie & Julia."" ""We're just over the moon about this,"" Cook said of her conversations with the four others about being celebrated Sunday. ""It's once in a lifetime -- there's nothing else like this."" Others attending Sunday's events included actors Stanley Tucci, Robert DeNiro, Sarah Jessica Parker and Emily Blunt, and musician Smokey Robinson. They were joined by political players including Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, GOP presidential contender Newt Gingrich, and U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Several of them -- including DeNiro, Tucci and Robinson -- took the Kennedy Center on Sunday night to celebrate the honorees. Others who spoke included Bill Cosby on behalf of Rollins, Jennifer Nettles and Lionel Ritchie for Diamond, and Stephen Colbert toasting Yo-Yo Ma. A two-hour recap of the gala will air the night of December 27 on CBS. Obama ended his lighthearted remarks Sunday evening with a call for people to support the arts, ideally helping a future Kennedy Center honoree and many others have the tools and opportunities they need to excel. ""Let's make sure that our young people can dream big dreams and follow them as long as they can go,"" the president said. That sentiment was seconded on the red carpet by, among others, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. ""The arts are a very good investment because they're about the spirit of America (and) they encourage children to learn, to gain confidence through exercising their creativity,"" the California Democrat said. ""Imagination is what keeps us number one.""","""We're just over the moon about this,"" one honoree says .

"(CNN)An AIG insurance company executive who'd been missing for a week is dead, his family said on a Facebook page Thursday evening. Omar Meza went missing after a company dinner last Thursday at the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort & Spa in Palm Desert, California. The 33-year-old was last seen around 11 p.m. on January 8. He did not show up to meetings the next day and was reported missing. ""I spoke to him. ... I was the last conversation per his telephone records ... on Thursday night around 11:20 p.m.,"" said his wife, Diane. ""It was late on a work night. I told him, 'Head to your hotel and call me when you get there.' I never got that call,"" she said. ""I tried calling him, but he didn't answer. I just went to bed. Didn't think too much of it."" She said her husband suffered short-term memory loss from a traffic accident last year. It's uncertain whether that had any effect on his disappearance. Meza's jacket and wallet were found on the resort's golf course, CNN affiliates KESQ and KMIR reported. A man's body was found in the 74800 block of Country Club Drive, a tweet from the Riverside County Sheriff's Office said. Investigators have not confirmed the identity of the body. However, it was found in a body of water and appears to be male, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said in a news release. The body was taken to the Coroner's Office, which will determine the cause of death. On the Facebook page dedicated to ""Find Omar Meza,"" the family asked for privacy, saying, ""we are with heavy hearts tonight as we announce the passing of Omar Meza.

"Kanye West and the Confederate battle flag. That's the discussion. It's not about race relations or a relic's true meaning. It's not about whether a group can co-opt a pejorative of which they've historically been the butt and make it their own, much like the gay community did with ""queer"" or African-Americans did with the n-word. No, the conversation is about West and that flag. The rapper thrust himself into the spotlight, yet again, with news that several pieces of merchandise from his Yeezus tour are emblazoned with the controversial Southern Cross. At his tour store in Los Angeles, a replica of the flag is affixed to the wall with red tape and adorned with the words, ""I ain't coming down."" Twitter exploded after word got out, and while West saw some support, including a fellow who called him a ""pro-black genius,"" others called him a disgrace. Read one tweet, ""Ye - THATS STUPID! Brother I marched to have that vile rag torn down from the state house grounds."" Asked to explain the rationale for including the controversial symbol on his clothing, West told AMP Radio, ""The Confederate flag represented slavery in a way. That's my abstract take on what I know about it, right? So I wrote the song, 'New Slaves.' So I took the Confederate flag and made it my flag. It's my flag now. Now what you gonna do?"" He added later in the interview, ""It's colorless also. It's super-'hood and super-white-boy-approved at the same time."" Those aren't the words of someone seeking to further dialogue, said hip-hop historian and San Francisco State adjunct professor Dave ""Davey D"" Cook. It sounds more like a man courting controversy, especially when you consider the source. ""Kanye doesn't move by accident. There's definitely a level of publicity involved in this,"" Cook said, adding that while West ""built his career around controversy,"" no one should begrudge him selling anything that people are buying. Green-lighting racism? There are dangers, though, and Cook worries that West has missed an opportunity to educate people on the flag's symbolism. There's also the chance he could embolden those who fly the flag with ill will toward blacks. ""Kanye runs the risk of green-lighting something that is overtly racist, and I don't think he has any plan in mind on how to educate people,"" Cook said. ""The opportunity to educate people on the symbolism of that flag and the racism attached to it is there."" Not everyone is holding West to such a standard. ""He is an entertainer, for God's sake. Surprise, surprise. Of course, it's part of a publicity thing,"" said Harvard University law professor Randall Kennedy, adding that that doesn't preclude it from being useful, interesting or justifiable. Kennedy, whose half dozen books on race include ""Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word,"" said there are parallels between groups co-opting epithets and West co-opting the flag, ""But listen, n----r is still a term of abuse used to terrify people and hurt people."" There are both positive and negative potential upshots to West's campaign, Kennedy said. If it lessens someone's anxiety about seeing the flag or diminishes the symbol's ""power to intimidate,"" it's a win, but if people forget what the flag stood for or become too ignorant about its meaning to counter claims that it's merely a symbol of state's rights, there could be detriment. ""Here were people who were willing to fight and die in order to enslave people, and that shouldn't be forgotten,"" Kennedy said. Cook said that if West wanted to meaningfully take on a hot-button social issue, there are more effective ways of doing it. He pointed to numerous examples in hip-hop: Talib Kweli has been outspoken on New York's stop-and-frisk policy and Florida's ""stand your ground"" law; Rhymefest and Immortal Technique visited Alabama in protest of the state's immigration law; and several rappers have penned thoughtful lyrics admonishing the prison-industrial complex. ""It'd be nice if Kanye was doing town halls while he was on tour,"" Cook said. ""He's in a position to do that. I'm not sure if he really realizes it or wanted to go in that direction."" Not a trailblazer . Whatever West's true intention, it's worth noting, as Kennedy pointed out, that West isn't the first person to do this. About a decade ago, a Charleston, South Carolina, clothing company called Nu South featured designs with the Southern Cross in red, black and green, the colors of the Pan-African flag. Several rappers have also used the flag, including Ludacris, David Banner, Pastor Troy, LIl Jon and OutKast, though Cook is quick to point out, ""They're not selling a flag. They were wearing it, so there's a difference."" Pastor Troy wonders if West, who was born in Atlanta but grew up in Chicago and is about to move into a Bel Air mansion with fiance Kim Kardashian, understands how powerful the symbol is in the South. Driving through South Georgia during a phone interview, the Atlanta rapper, whose real name is Micah LeVar Troy, said he had just been passed by a swamp boat, the entire hull of which bore the Confederate flag, and he would remind West to be careful disrespecting things that others find sacred. ""Now, these are the ones Kanye needs to be worried about. Kanye ain't waving that flag in front of them,"" he said. ""Be careful, Kanye."" Not that Troy hasn't used the flag on album covers and in videos, but ""I wasn't lifting it up to glorify it,"" he said, explaining he knew the ramifications of using the banner. To Troy, the flag stood for rebellion, and he was being rebellious himself in flaunting it. ""I was letting them know it was a new day down here in the South, from then to now. Whoever would've thought a black man could touch that flag without getting killed?"" he said. With West,Troy said, ""it sounds more like a personal agenda, which you're free to have. But make it make sense, as my dad used to say."" A complicated symbol . The Rev. Al Sharpton shared what he felt the flag represented in a column last month: ""The Confederate flag symbolizes dehumanization, injustice and pain. It is a stark reminder of an era in our history that was defined by the abhorrent practice of slavery. And it is representative of a mentality that looked upon blacks as inferiors who needed to remain in the shackles of subservience."" Yet that meaning is far from universal. In addition to the aforementioned state's rights advocates, there are those who see it only as a symbol of Southern pride or heritage. Southern governors have risked boycott and ouster from office to keep it flying at state installations. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama has said it belongs in a museum. ""When people say that the Confederate flag represents slavery, I ask them, 'If you look at the importation of slaves to the United States from Africa, what flag did they fly under? It was the United States flag,"" said George Mason University's Walter Williams, an economics professor who studies and writes about race. ""People say, 'Let's get rid of the Confederate flag because it's a symbol of slavery.' I say, 'What do we do with the American flag?' "" he said. WIlliams doesn't like hip-hop music, but that doesn't mean it should be banned or removed from public view, just like the Constitution shouldn't be outlawed because some people have visceral reactions to the Second Amendment, he said. While the Nazis represented a ""despicable"" regime, it's a ""gross violation"" of freedom of expression to ban anyone from displaying the Nazi flag, Williams said. To Williams, it's a matter of freedom of expression, the true test of which is not how one reacts when people ""express themselves in ways you think they ought to express themselves, but when they express themselves in ways you find offensive."" While Cook isn't wholly ruling out that West has a plan to stoke dialogue about the flag, he hasn't seen it yet. If the ""Jesus Walks"" rapper is just engaging in naked profiteering, that's fine, but Cook said he hopes the flag's true meaning and symbolism isn't lost or skewed in the flap. ""You can't leave room for misinterpretation, or some people will take that to the bank,"" Cook said. ""He's going to take some of this to the bank himself."" Follow Eliott C.

"In one of the most closely-watched Senate races of the year, incumbent Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan of North Carolina holds a narrow three-point advantage over her Republican challenger, according to a new CNN/ORC International survey. But the poll indicates that Thom Tillis, the GOP nominee, may be falling behind Hagan because a Libertarian candidate could be siphoning off Republican votes. Hagan edges Tillis, 46%-43%, while Libertarian Sean Haugh has support from 7% likely voters, according to the poll. The three-point gap between Tillis and Hagan, however, is well within the poll's sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points among likely voters, meaning the candidates are about even. The race is one of eight Senate contests that CNN rates as ""up for grabs"" this fall. As Republicans seek to retake the Senate majority, they consider North Carolina one of their best chances to pick up a Democratic seat. Politics of fear -- how the GOP is using ISIS against Dems . Since Hagan was first elected in 2008, North Carolina has transitioned from somewhat of a purple state to solid red territory. Republicans took the governorship and seized both houses in the state Legislature, and North Carolina was one of two states that voted for Barack Obama in 2008 but Mitt Romney in 2012. Hagan's favorable rating is 46%, indicating that everyone who likes her is going to vote for her. But Tillis gets a 47% favorable rating among likely voters, yet only 43% of the vote. ""That suggests that there are voters who would probably choose Tillis in a two-way race but aren't going to vote for him in a three-way contest,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. While Haugh only has the backing of 7% of voters, his presence in the race could be hugely influential if Tillis ends up losing to Hagan by just a few percentage points. Amid worrisome polls, Democrats make new pitch for women . President Barack Obama's low approval rate in North Carolina -- 42% -- has forced Hagan to keep some distance from the President. When he came to her state last month to speak to the American Legion convention in Charlotte, for example, she publicly criticized him and his administration's handling of the Veterans Affairs scandal this summer. Emily's List, a political action committee that backs female Democratic candidates, has spent millions to support Hagan and make the debate over equal pay a big issue in the race. The equal pay issue is one that Democrats nationwide believe will help bolster their general lead among women voters. According to the CNN/ORC poll, Hagan has a seven-point advantage among women, while Tillis has a six-point margin among men. Outside spending groups have helped make the North Carolina battle the most expensive Senate race this year, with nearly $44 million spent by candidates and third parties, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Tillis, the North Carolina House Speaker, has seen a big turnout in support from high-profile Republicans, including Romney, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Sen. Rand Paul will campaign for Tillis next week. Obamadale: The secret weapon that could save Iowa Democrats? According to the poll, Hagan wins among likely voters with higher incomes, while Tillis does better among lower-income voters. ""That may be explained by the way wealth is spread across the state -- Hagan does best in the Charlotte area and around the Raleigh-Durham Triangle, the two geographical areas with a large share of higher-income voters in North Carolina,"" Holland said. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International by telephone with 1,010 adult Americans on September 22-25.","A new CNN poll shows that the U.S. Senate race in North Carolina remains tight .

"Washington (CNN)The Supreme Court jumped into the same-sex marriage debate again, deciding Friday to hear arguments this spring on the question of whether states have the right to ban same-sex couples from getting married. It's expected to hammer out a decision on one of the most controversial social issues by June when the 2016 presidential race will be well underway, forcing the debate into full view during what's expected to be a crowded and diverse Republican primary. It's not an issue that establishment Republicans are eager to drag into the spotlight. On the national level, the party is increasingly reluctant to focus on social issues, especially after the 2012 debacle over Todd Akin's rape comments and as polling continues to show a majority of Americans support same-sex marriage. A recent CNN/ORC International survey indicates that 57% of Americans think gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to get married. Off the table or on? Some Republican strategists say quietly that a decision could bring some finality and take the issue off the table well before the election, while others say it could reignite the debate. ""I fear there could be a bigger fight within the GOP because of a Supreme Court decision than there would be without one,"" said Vin Weber, a former congressman from Minnesota and an adviser to Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign.  ""I don't want to see a fight over this issue, because I think it's evolving on its own state by state."" He added: ""I would guess social conservatives would take up umbrage, make it a divisive issue, and force every Republican candidate to go on record saying what they really believe."" It's a tough issue to talk about for Republicans, consultants say, because no matter what position they take, they're going to get in trouble with one side of the party or the other. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who adamantly stood against same-sex marriage during his unsuccessful 1994 gubernatorial run, struck a conciliatory tone last week when Florida became the 36th state to legalize same-sex marriage. ""We live in a democracy, and regardless of our disagreements, we have to respect the rule of law,"" Bush said in a statement, calling for ""respect for the good people on all sides of the gay and lesbian marriage issue."" Weber said that Bush's statement likely reflects the position of a majority of Republican candidates and elected officials on the issue. ""They're not quite ready to endorse gay marriage, but they really don't want to crusade against it like they used to,"" he said. ""They're looking for ways to describe their position that don't put them directly at odds with supporters of same-sex marriage."" 'Profound consequences' Opponents of same-sex marriage, however, argue that anyone who thinks the fight will slowly die down is highly misguided.  Brian Brown, president of the National Organization for Marriage, said a Supreme Court decision that reverses same-sex marriage bans will be ""a frontal assault on the religious liberty of all Americans."" ""There are going to be profound consequences,"" he said. ""If the Supreme Court rules, it will be just like Roe v. Wade all over again."" With the 2016 GOP field spanning a wide ideological spectrum, there's a sizable crop of potential candidates who've signaled that they're ready for a fight. Sen. Ted Cruz spelled out a 10-point agenda for the new Republican Congress in a speech Monday that also read like a potential presidential platform. One of his themes was the need to ""rein in judicial activism,"" pointing to federal court rulings on same-sex marriage. ""The Constitution makes clear marriage is a question for the states,"" he said. ""It's not a question for a bunch of unelected federal judges who may disagree with the democratic views of the people who live in the United States of America."" Mike Huckabee last fall threatened to leave the GOP if Republicans don't take a stronger stand against a wave of acceptance. ""If the Republicans want to lose guys like me and a whole bunch of still God-fearing, Bible-believing people, go ahead and just abdicate on this issue,"" he said. He seemed to soften his tone a little bit, writing in his newly released book that the idea that ""same-sex marriage is destroying society is actually greatly overstated,"" adding that Christians who get divorced ""have as much to answer for as do those who militantly push to redefine marriage."" Still, while conservative candidates are more vocal about standing on principle, strategists say it's not as likely that they'll start a war over same-sex marriage in the face of issues involving the economy, terrorism, and health care -- especially when the tide has rolled in favor of same-sex marriage at such a rapid pace in the last couple of years. ""It's not 2004. Gay marriage is not going to determine the outcome of presidential election like it did in Ohio,"" said GOP strategist Tara Setmayer, referring to the surge of Republicans who showed up to the polls to approve same-sex marriage bans in nearly a dozen states a decade ago. The turn-out helped tip the scales for George W. Bush's re-election. ""The issue may come up in the primary, but I don't think anyone wants this to be the hallmark of this campaign,"" she said.","The Supreme Court decided Friday to hear same-sex marriage arguments this year .
That could lead to a major decision during the early 2016 presidential race .
Strategists say a decision could be welcome news to some Republicans, while others are ready to fight ."
"(CNN)House Speaker John Boehner turned to an unorthodox messenger for his pitch to young Americans panning President Barack Obama's proposal to offer free community college for everyone: Taylor Swift. The GOP leader paired Swift gifs and GOP arguments opposed to the proposal in a blog item posted to his site Friday that quickly went viral. While the community college proposal ""sounded exciting at first,"" Boehner's staff writes — paired with a gif of Swift to illustrate the excitement — ""when President Obama said 'free' what he meant was '60 Billion dollars over 10 years.'"" ""Not even all the Taylor Swift album sales in the world would cover that bill,"" the post declares, atop a gif of Swift looking perturbed. The post goes on to suggest Obama's proposal would either require a tax hike or else contribute to the national debt, accompanied by clips from Swift's music videos that range from infuriated to goofy. Instead, Boehner's office proposes: ""Wouldn't it be better if we just worked together to lower costs for folks across the board and improve our children's education?"" as Swift applauds in a clip from an awards show. ""Looks like an apology is in order Mr. President,"" the post continues. Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told the Daily Dot the post was an effort to ""reach people where they are."" ""We are always looking for fun, effective ways to communicate with the American people about President Obama's failed policies, and our better solutions,"" he said. Swift is a safe pick for the party as it looks to expand its appeal to younger voters in time for the 2016 elections. While Swift has matured over her career, she hasn't turned to raunchy moves or lyrics to shed her squeaky-clean teen persona. Indeed, Boehner's not the only Republican to turn to Taylor Swift to say what their own words can't. Newly-minted Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst said she would ""shake it off"" when outgoing Sen. Tom Harkin compared her to Swift. And Sen. Ted Cruz's digital strategist is a huge fan of the pop star. Republicans know there's a blank space on young voters' ballots heading into 2016. Verdict's still out, though, on whether the GOP love for T Swift will get Millennials to write the GOP's name.","House Speaker John Boehner turned to pop star Taylor Swift to make his case on President Obama's free community college proposal .

"Paris (CNN)At least a dozen people have been detained in the Paris region in connection with last week's shootings, the city prosecutor's office said Friday. The people arrested are suspected of providing logistical support for the attacks. The arrests were made in the Grigny and Fleury-Merogis neighborhoods, and those arrested were in Amedy Coulibaly's entourage, the Paris prosecutor's representative said. Coulibaly was killed last Friday in a police siege to end a hostage taking at a kosher supermarket in Paris. He had killed four hostages and is believed  to have shot a policewoman to death in the city a day earlier. Two days before Coulibaly was killed, brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi had attacked the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, killing 12 people and injuring 11. They died the same day as Coulibaly as police moved in to end a separate siege. There does not appear to be a command-and-control element to the Paris attacks other than a general ""go forward and do something,"" a Western official with direct knowledge told CNN, describing the attack as ""highly franchised terrorism with general instructions."" The Kouachi brothers ""legitimately aligned with AQAP"" and Cherif Kouachi was associated with networks that brought him to Yemen to train with the terror group, but Coulibaly's alleged connection with ISIS is still unclear, the official said. AQAP refers to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Investigators are still trying to determine whether Coulibaly coordinated with the Kouachi brothers in the execution of the attacks or launched his own attack after learning of their actions, said the Western official. Who were the victims? France's frayed nerves will not be eased by the Belgian authorities' operation Thursday to dismantle a suspected terror cell believed to be on the brink of carrying out attacks on police. However, investigators have so far found no links with events in Paris, Belgian prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said. Meanwhile, in the French city of Reims, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northeast of Paris, the City Hall confirmed Friday that a police operation had taken place and that there had been gunfire. It's not clear whether this is related to the investigation of the Paris attacks. However, Reims was the hometown of Said Kouachi. At the same time, a man with a handgun entered a post office in Colombes, a northwestern suburb of Paris, according to the local police department. Police said the man might be mentally unstable and that they did not know yet if this was terror-related. According to French media, there are up to five hostages inside the post office. In his first visit to France since last week's terror attacks, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said that he ""really wanted to come here and share a hug with all of Paris and all of France."" Standing alongside Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, Kerry added that he ""wanted to express to you personally the sheer horror and revulsion"" over what he called a ""living nightmare."" American singer James Taylor also appeared, crooning a customized version of his 1971 hit song, ""You've Got a Friend."" Kerry met earlier with President Francois Hollande, when he voiced the ""full and heartfelt condolences"" of Americans. ""We watched the people of France come together with a great sense of purpose and unity. It was a great lesson to the world that once again, France's commitment to freedom and passion of ideas has made an important statement to the world,"" Kerry said. Kerry laid a wreath at a makeshift memorial at the site of the kosher supermarket attack Friday, accompanied by Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. Kerry and Fabius spoke there for several minutes with Joel Mergui, the president of Consistoire du Paris, a national Jewish organization. Kerry and Fabius also paid their respects at the offices of Charlie Hebdo. Francois Vauglin, the mayor of Paris' 11th district, where the offices are located, told CNN that Kerry's visit was very welcome. ""It's so important for us to feel supported at this time,"" he said. The street is still cordoned off as investigators continue to comb the area for clues, adding to the sense of disquiet for local residents, he said. ""We know that the threat is still very high, and we don't know how long we will be able to withstand this threat,"" he said. President Barack Obama's administration has admitted it erred by not sending a senior figure to a huge unity march held Sunday in Paris. More than 40 world leaders, including the British, German and Israeli heads of state and Russia's foreign minister, joined at least 1.5 million people on the French capital's streets. The goodbyes continue after the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices. Funerals are being held for magazine editor Stephane ""Charb"" Charbonnier, illustrator Philippe Honore and Algerian-born copy editor Mustapha Ourrad. The question of where to bury their killers is more contentious. Cherif Kouachi's widow, Izzana Kouachi, has requested that both he and his brother Said Kouachi be buried in Gennevilliers, on the outskirts of Paris. The Gennevilliers mayor's office told CNN that the city was obliged by law to bury Cherif Kouachi there, as he was a resident of the city. But a spokesman for the mayor, Jean-Francois Boye, said that it would not do the same for Said because he lived in Reims. ""That's for sure, he's not from Gennevilliers, we won't let him get a funeral here,"" Boye said. A ""survivors' issue"" of Charlie Hebdo was published Wednesday -- the first since the attack. Copies have flown off the racks of newsstands despite a print run of more than 4 million. However, the magazine's decision to run a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed on the front cover -- not for the first time -- has been criticized by a number of Muslim leaders, since this is deeply offensive to many Muslims. Anger over the cartoon boiled over into violence Friday in Pakistan, where police resorted to using tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters outside the French Consulate in Karachi. A Pakistani photographer for AFP was shot and injured at the protest, the French news agency reported. He is ""doing better,"" it said via Twitter. Ahmed Chinoy, chief of Karachi's Citizen Police Liaison Committee, told CNN that investigations were underway to determine who shot the journalist. At least 200 protesters were involved in the violence, which broke out after religious parties called supporters out to condemn the cartoon following afternoon prayers, Chinoy said. The protests come a day after Pakistan's Parliament unanimously passed a resolution condemning the caricatures printed in Charlie Hebdo. Several French media outlets' websites went down Friday morning, including those of radio station France Inter, newspapers Le Parisien and 20 Minutes, weekly magazines L'Express and Marianne, and investigative publication Mediapart. This prompted speculation that the outage could be the result of a hack linked to publication of the Charlie Hebdo cover. But Internet service provider Oxalide said it was not the result of a cyberattack. With France on its highest level of alert, 10,000 troops have deployed across the country. Thousands of police officers are on patrol, including hundreds assigned to protect Jewish schools. As France still reels from the shock of the Paris attacks, authorities in neighboring Belgium swooped in on an alleged terror cell in an operation that left two suspects dead. Prosecutor Van Der Sypt said weapons and police uniforms were recovered as part of raids on a dozen properties in Belgium, in which 13 people were arrested. The plan was to kill police officers on public roads or in police offices, he said. Two people were also arrested in France, he said, and Belgium will be asking for them to be extradited. They are Belgian nationals who belong to the alleged cell but were found in France, he said. A Western intelligence source told CNN that the ongoing terror threat appears to involve up to 20 sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility Wednesday for the Charlie Hebdo shooting. The attack was years in the making, AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi said in a video, claiming U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was the mastermind behind it. In the days since last week's attacks, security services have been working to track those associated with the Kouachi brothers and Coulibaly. Neetin Karasular, a suspected Belgian trafficker in weapons who met Coulibaly's widow, Hayat Boumeddiene, is in custody, Karasular's attorney, Michel Bouchat, told CNN on Friday. Karasular has been charged with association with wrongdoers and offenses relating to firearms, in a case handled by the local public prosecutor's office in Charleroi, Belgium. According to Bouchat, police didn't find any weapons at Karasular's house. However, the police investigation revealed that Karasular used to spend time in a garage in Charleroi where documents were found that mentioned weapons. According to multiple Belgian media accounts, these included documents about the type of gun used by Coulibaly in the attack on the supermarket a week ago. Bouchat told CNN that his client was not at all connected to Thursday's police raids in Belgium. According to the attorney, Karasular wasn't involved in any jihadi group. Bouchat confirmed that Karasular had previous convictions. How the Kouachi brothers were radicalized .

"(CNN)Have you ever thrown away a banana peel or dumped expired milk into the garbage? Well, if you do it in Seattle you are in for a fine. Under a new policy, passed 9-0 by the Seattle City Council earlier this week, those who fail to compost ""food waste and compostable paper"" will be penalized. The new program will come into effect in January 2015 for commercial establishments and residences. It will be enforced by the Seattle Public Utilities commission. Seattle has had a similar rule for noncompostable recyclables for nine years. After receiving two warnings, residents and businesses will be fined $50 for dumpsters and a more modest $1 for waste at single-family homes. Previously, the utilities commission left residents and businesses a note that asked them to compost. If they did not comply, the city refused to collect the garbage. 4 ways to combat food waste at home . So, why is Seattle making residents compost? The city was not going to meet its self-imposed goal of recycling 60% of all waste. ""Compostables are about 30% of what is still in the garbage and they are the largest target we have to help us reach our goals,"" said Timothy Croll, solid waste director of the utilities commission, which asked the city council for the change. ""Also, composting food waste reduces emissions of methane, which is a strong cause of climate change."" Although the utilities commission contends inspecting garbage and issuing fines for noncompliance will have ""minimal costs"" and save money in the long run by reducing landfill usage, not everyone agrees. ""This program is not free, it costs money and nobody is looking at the real cost of this [program],"" said Todd Myers, environment director for the conservative Washington Policy Center. Opinion: Composting in a city: Are you kidding? Myers said the program costs could be put to better use. ""There are a lot of ways to spend this money to actually do good for the planet. ... Seattle is very good at doing things that feel good, but very bad at doing things that do good for the planet,"" said Myers. But Croll said the program is worth it. ""Nine years ago, we prohibited recyclable paper and containers from the garbage and this created a significant rise in our recycling rate,"" Croll said. The program is modeled on a similar one instituted in San Francisco in 2009. Last year, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg proposed requiring New York residents to compost. New York's city council only extended the requirement to commercial establishments.","Seattle City Council mandates food waste composting .

"Phoenix (CNN) -- A federal judge entered a plea of not guilty Monday on behalf of Jared Lee Loughner to three counts of attempted murder in the mass shooting that wounded U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords earlier this month. After entering the packed courtroom, Loughner, 22, showed the same smirk as he had in his mug shot. He appeared to chuckle to himself as he looked into an upper balcony area filled with spectators. He smiled occasionally during the 15-minute arraignment and remained silent. U.S. District Court Judge Larry Burns asked federal public defender Judy Clarke about Loughner's ability to comprehend the proceedings. ""We are not raising that issue at this time,"" Clarke told the judge. When the judge asked for plea from the defendant, Clarke asked the judge to enter one on Loughner's behalf. Loughner is charged with trying to kill Giffords and two of her aides, Ron Barber and Pamela Simon. Prosecutors have turned over hours of videos taken off Loughner's home computer to the defense. They also provided the defense with witness statements, attorneys said in court. Clarke acknowledged she received two discs from the prosecution. The next court hearing is scheduled for March 9 and is expected to be held in Tucson, not Phoenix, at the request of prosecutors, who wanted to be closer to witnesses and victims. The defense said it had no problem with the request as long as his attorney knows where Loughner will be held in Tucson. Monday's arraignment was held in Phoenix because the mass shooting occurred in Tucson, in which six persons were killed and 13 more were wounded. Among those killed was Arizona's chief federal judge, John Roll of Tucson, and all federal judges in Arizona then recused themselves from Loughner's proceedings. Monday's hearing was presided over by Burns, who's from the U.S. District Court for Southern California, based in San Diego. He was designated to head the case by the 9th Circuit Court. Prosecutors said they might file a superseding indictment within the next 30 to 45 days. Legal experts expect additional charges, including those for the murders of six people, to be filed against Loughner, who is a Tucson resident. ""The grand jury investigation will continue,"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said last week. ""There's a long way to go in this case, and (the attempted murder) charges will be there. But I'm certain more will be there as well."" Meanwhile, in Houston, Giffords continued to show improvement in her rehabilitation from a gunshot wound to the head. She was Loughner's alleged main target on January 8, when gunfire was sprayed in the Safeway supermarket parking lot in Tucson. Critically wounded after being shot in the brain, she is in intensive care Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center in Houston. The amount of car traffic on the campus of Texas Medical Center, a cluster of 42 university-affiliated schools, hospitals and clinics outside downtown, has doubled since Giffords' arrival Friday, campus security chief Fernando Bertrand told CNN affiliate KPRC. Yet Bertrand, who wouldn't detail any special security precautions beyond saying there was careful coordination with state and federal law enforcement agencies, said things thus far have gone smoothly. Since being transferred there from southern Arizona, Giffords has impressed doctors, the hospital's medical director said. That includes her ability to do exercises that involve moving, sitting and standing. ""She's doing very well,"" Dr. Gerard Francisco said Saturday, adding that she ""surprised us"" with her ability to use her muscles and other developments. ""She did not need as much assistance as we anticipated."" On Sunday, Giffords' husband Mark Kelly, a NASA astronaut, posted on his Twitter feed that his wife was continuing to work toward a full recovery. ""Gabrielle starts her second day of rehab in 20 minutes at Memorial Hermann. No weekends off here,"" he wrote. Giffords has a breathing tube in her neck and cannot talk, but Francisco said he believes she is trying to communicate. She is very responsive to others and follows commands. He said doctors were particularly encouraged by Giffords' bringing her left leg, which was dangling off the side of the bed, up onto the bed. Giffords has good movement and muscle tone on her left side, he said, and some on her right side as well -- even though she was shot in the left side of her brain, which controls her right side. Arizona doctors said Giffords' transfer from that state went flawlessly. Dr. Randall Friese of the UMC trauma center said that at some points as she traveled through the streets of Tucson, Giffords could hear applause from those who turned out to honor her. ""She responded very well to that,"" he said, smiling and even tearing up a bit. ""It was very emotional."" Despite reaching a series of milestones, Giffords has a long road ahead, doctors have said. Once she enters rehabilitation, the process is expected to take four to six months.

"A group of 23 students has filed a federal complaint against Columbia University alleging the school failed to protect victims of sexual assault, according to a statement from the students. The complaint alleges the Ivy League university discouraged students from reporting sexual assaults, allowed perpetrators to remain on campus, sanctioned inadequate disciplinary actions for perpetrators and discriminated against students based on their sexual orientation, according to a statement from the students who are calling themselves Our Stories CU. The students collectively filed the complaint Thursday with the U.S. Department of Education, alleging violations of Title II, Title IX and the Clery Act against Columbia and Barnard College, the affiliated women's school. Title II is a part of the Americans With Disabilities Act, and Title IX is part of the Higher Education Act. The Clery Act is a federal law that requires colleges and universities across the United States to disclose information about crime on and around their campuses. In a statement Friday to CNN, Columbia said it had been informed of the complaint but it had not seen it and could not comment on the allegations. ""Sexual assault and gender misconduct are unacceptable, including on college and university campuses,"" Columbia said in a statement. ""We have been working with students, faculty and staff to make that emphatically clear on our campus and have already taken the first of a series of significant new measures dedicated to preventing such sexual misconduct, supporting survivors, and improving adjudication of these painful cases."" Ending rape on campus: Activism takes several forms . The students' statement described the complaint in detail, but the group refused to release any copies, saying it wanted to protect those who do not want their names publicized. As a policy, the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights does not release information to the public until after a formal investigation has been opened into a complaint. ""Columbia is more willing to silence and punish survivors and their supporters than serial rapists,"" the students said in their statement. ""Because of this reality, students have decided to file ... (the complaint) to hold the university accountable for its deliberate mishandling of campus sexual violence and mental health."" Their statement details multiple allegations, ranging from one student being denied mental health accommodations and another transgender student having an attack dismissed ""because it didn't fit the normative 'boy-rapes-girl' narrative."" ""I don't trust the University to take my experience or my safety more seriously than they take their own public image,"" one complainant said in the students' statement. Zoe Ridolfi-Starr, a Columbia junior and lead complainant, told CNN on Friday that activists from universities across the country offered plenty of advice and support to the group, saying, ""It's absolutely a national issue."" Ridolfi-Starr said she was sexually assaulted the summer after her freshman year at Columbia and said the primary goal of the complaint is to pressure the university to make reforms. Ridolfi-Starr said that four more students reached out to her Friday asking to join in the complaint and that the group plans to file an addendum over the next few days. The students' actions come on the heels of a similar complaint against Harvard University in early April. The Harvard Crimson, the university's daily student newspaper, published an open letter from a student citing repeated misconduct on the part of administrators after reporting a sexual assault. 55 colleges under investigation over handling sexual violence complaints .","Twenty-three students allege Columbia University failed to protect victims of sexual assault .

"French officials exploded in outrage after BNP Paribas agreed to plea guilty to criminal charges, pay nearly $9 billion in fines, and have access to dollar clearing suspended for a year for its persistent violations of US economic sanctions against Iran, Cuba and Sudan. The international bank fell under US jurisdiction by virtue of facilitating transactions in dollars which passed through the US. Most financial commentators had little sympathy with the French position, since the giant bank's conduct was egregious. It included ongoing records-doctoring to hide the true identity of customers and stymieing the US investigation. But the French argument was essentially political: that the US had no right to impose its will on a foreign bank, and these transactions were legal under European law. Yet this is far from the first time the US has used its position as issuer of the world's reserve currency to advance its foreign policy agenda. For instance, in the Suez Crisis in 1956, Britain's need for dollar credit to defend the pound enabled the US to force Britain and France to pull back from military confrontation. The economic reality is that the US derives considerable power from its role as the issuer of the world's reserve currency and its control over dollar-based payment systems. Large banks run huge volumes of transactions with each other during the day. They are willing to do so because these systems are ultimately backstopped by the Federal Reserve. While parties unhappy with America's use, and some would contend abuse, of US dollar dominance, financial institutions could set up dollar transaction mechanisms that completely skirted the US. But with low volumes and no Fed protection, they'd be vastly higher cost. The other alternative is to try to encourage more use of non-dollar currencies, like the euro and China's renminbi. But the euro has no benchmark bond, plus continued concerns about political fracture and sovereign bond restructurings mean it's not a contender to replace the greenback any time soon. And even though China has been aggressively promoting trade denominated in the renminbi, the volume is puny, a mere 1.5% of the global total. But putting aside the international row, what does the BNP Paribas settlement say about addressing misconduct at too big to fail banks? Perversely, while banks are wards of the state and get more support and subsidies than any other type of business (for instance, ZIRP and quantitative easing are massive transfers from savers to financial players), the authorities have lacked the will to discipline them effectively. Even though the BNP Paribas fine exceeded a year of earnings, the bank's stock rose 3.6% when the deal was announced, saying that investors though BNP Paribas had done well. The conundrum is indicting a bank at the parent level is widely perceived to be a potential death blow, since many counterparties would have to stop doing business with it immediately. Removing the US banking licenses of a serial fraudster, another possible remedy, would similarly put a US firm out of business and would inflict severe, permanent damage on a big foreign bank. Hence the tendency of officials to rely on big, or at least big-sounding, fines. But it is bankers, not banks, that commit crimes. Here, the BNP Paribas deal falls short. True, 13 officers were forced to resign, including one of its chief operating officers. But he was on the verge of retirement, and more important, no one was charged criminally or fined. By contrast, in 1991, when Salomon Brothers failed to curb a trader that was repeatedly gaming government bond auctions, Salomon's CEO, vice chairman, and president departed abruptly. We've seen nothing like that punishment meted out to top executives in the post-crisis wave of investigations. And until that happens, banks will continue to behave as if they have the upper hand.

"Houston (CNN) -- Doctors at the Houston hospital where U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was transferred said that while she remains in intensive care, she has surprised them with the progress she has already made. Giffords, 40, who was shot in the head at a public event in Arizona on January 8, was transferred Friday to Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center. It was thought the congresswoman would begin rehabilitation at The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research (TIRR) Memorial Hermann, but officials said she was taken instead to the hospital's trauma center for evaluation and treatment. ""She's not quite ready for rehabilitation yet,"" Dr. Dong Kim of Memorial Hermann told CNN on Thursday. Kim would not elaborate, but on Friday, Dr. John Holcomb told reporters that Giffords has fluid on her brain. ""There's a little fluid collection that the docs have put a drain into, around her brain, and that drain is still in place,"" he said. ""With that drain in place, she can't leave the ICU."" He said Giffords will remain in the hospital while ""this drain business"" is sorted out and doctors make sure no infection is developing. During that time, she will undergo rehabilitation in the intensive care unit, as she was at Tucson, Arizona's University Medical Center. That rehabilitation was under way on Saturday, Dr. Gerard Francisco, the hospital's medical director, told reporters. ""She's doing very well,"" he said. The exercises involve moving, sitting and standing, he said. ""We're still in that phase of discovering what she can and cannot do so we can come up with the best combination of therapy."" Giffords ""surprised us,"" he said. ""She did not need as much assistance as we anticipated."" Doctors had said earlier that Giffords has been able to stand with assistance. ""She's activating her muscles even more than what I had anticipated,"" Francisco said. Giffords has a breathing tube in her neck and cannot talk, but Francisco said he believes she is trying to communicate. She is very responsive to others, and follows commands. He said doctors were particularly encouraged by Giffords' bringing her left leg, which was dangling off the side of the bed, up onto the bed.

Six people died in the shooting at a Tucson supermarket earlier this month, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl. A total of 19 people were shot. Giffords is the only one who remains hospitalized. Police said they believe suspect Jared Lee Loughner, 22, targeted Giffords in the attack. Loughner is in custody and facing federal charges.

"CBS correspondent Lara Logan apologized Friday and said the network was ""wrong"" for a ""60 Minutes"" report that raised questions about the Obama administration's response to last year's attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. The assault left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. ""In this case, we were wrong. We made a mistake,"" Logan said on ""CBS This Morning."" ""That's disappointing for any journalist. It's very disappointing for me."" A primary source for the ""60 Minutes"" report on October 27 was a security contractor using the pseudonym ""Morgan Jones,"" later identified as Dylan Davies. Davies told CBS he was able to reach the Benghazi compound on the night of September 11, 2012, scale a wall and even fight off a militant. Also on Friday, the publisher of a book containing Davies' account said it was suspending the sale and publication of the book. Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, is recommending that booksellers not sell ""The Embassy House"" and return the books, spokeswoman Jennifer Robinson told CNN. The ""60 Minutes"" story broadcast October 27 cast doubt on whether the Obama administration sent all possible help to try to save Stevens and his three colleagues. The story was then cited by congressional Republicans who have demanded to know why a military rescue was not attempted. Benghazi attack timeline . On Friday, Logan responded to questions from CBS's Norah O'Donnell, who pressed her for details about Davies. ""What we know now is, he told the FBI a different story to what he told us,"" Logan said. ""That was the moment for us when we realized that we no longer had confidence in our source and we were wrong to put him on air, and we apologize to our viewers."" Logan was also asked about how CBS vetted Davies and his story. ""We verified him, confirmed who he was, that he was working for the State Department at the time, that he was in Benghazi at the special mission compound the night of the attack,"" Logan said. ""He showed us -- he gave us access to communications he had with U.S. government officials."" ""The Embassy House"" tells the same story Davies told Logan. Davies also told Logan that he acted in violation of his employer's orders to stay away from the compound. Since the revelations about problems with the story, Logan said CBS has tried to contact Davies but has not heard from him. Congressman: Benghazi questions need answers . The news show apology comes a day after CBS issued a statement saying, ""60 Minutes has learned of new information that undercuts the account told to us by Morgan Jones of his actions on the night of the attack on the Benghazi compound. We are currently looking into this serious matter to determine if he misled us, and if so, we will make a correction."" On Thursday a U.S. official told CNN that there were discrepancies between the contractor's accounts to the FBI and CBS, although the official did not specify them. A second U.S. official told CNN the same thing Friday. The New York Times, citing two senior government officials, reported Thursday that the contractor told the FBI he did not go the Benghazi compound on the night of the attack. When Logan was asked Friday why CBS was willing to stand by its report after Davies lied to his employer, she said, ""because he was very upfront about it; that was part of his story."" Incident report raised questions . The CBS story first came into question because of an incident report filed by the contractor's employer, the Blue Mountain security company. The incident report, obtained by CNN and first reported in The Washington Post, said the contractor never reached the Benghazi compound. The incident report also revealed the real name of ""Morgan Jones"" to be Davies. CBS initially stood by the story after the incident report came to light. Davies said he never saw the incident report. But he said it matched a false account he gave his Blue Mountain supervisor to cover up that he had disobeyed the supervisor's order not to go to the compound. In a statement to CNN this week, Davies said, ""The account in my book is consistent with what I gave to the FBI and U.S. authorities about what happened in Benghazi."" CIA operatives to testify at classified Benghazi hearing . Davies' co-author, Damien Lewis, also told CNN this week that Jones never wavered in his story. ""He's been consistent in the story from the word go,"" Lewis said. ""Not only that, he's the kind of guy who downplays his role."" Reached Friday after CBS's apology, Lewis said he would have nothing more to say until Davies comments. Hearing set for next week . CIA employees are scheduled to testify about the attack at a closed-door congressional hearing next week. U.S. officials have said Stevens and information officer Sean Smith took refuge behind a heavy metal door at 10:30 p.m. on the night of the attack, about 30 minutes after attackers had breached the walls of the compound. The two were quickly overcome by smoke when attackers set fire to the building. Also at 10:30 p.m., six security agents left a CIA annex a mile away. The six agents and 16 Libyan security officials regained control of the compound. With the help of a rescue team that arrived from Tripoli at 1:15 a.m., the agents rescued about 30 Americans and took them to the CIA annex. They also took Stephens and Smith, although their conditions at that time have not been made clear. At 4 a.m., militants attacked the CIA annex. Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were killed.","Publication of book containing account is suspended .

"(CNN)The U.S. ocean, atmospheric and space agencies affirmed on Friday what the planet has been telling us every way it knows how: 2014 was the hottest year since record keeping began in 1880. That means average land and sea temperatures, worldwide, have never been hotter in modern times, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (the gold standard for global climate data) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (the guys who put a man on the moon). This isn't about whether we believe in science: It's about whether we believe the thermometer. In fact, the 16 hottest years on record have all occurred since 1997, the new data confirm, contributing to widening deserts, rising seas, withering drought, ravaging storms, blistering heat and other climate change impacts reaching from the tiniest African village to our own backyards. Here in the United States, Arizona, Nevada, Alaska and California all wrapped up their hottest years on record. California remains mired in the grip of a three-year drought, its worst in centuries. The Northeast is still rebuilding from Hurricane Sandy. And that was just one of the climate-related disasters that cost this country an estimated $139 billion in damages in 2012 alone. Above and beyond the economic costs, climate change has created a widening humanitarian crisis noted by spiritual leaders around the world. For example, Pope Francis is expected to publish an encyclical on the state of the world's environment, singling out climate change as an urgent challenge to global stewardship. It's reported that he'll call on people of all faiths to embrace our obligation to protect future generations from this grave and gathering scourge. President Obama has embarked on the single greatest U.S. effort yet to combat this growing menace, by reducing the dangerous carbon pollution that's driving climate chaos. He has directed the Environmental Protection Agency to put in place the first limits on carbon pollution from the power plants that account for about 40% of the U.S. carbon footprint. Under the President's Clean Power Plan, we'll cut carbon emissions from our power plants 26% by 2020 and 30% by 2030. We can do better than that -- and we should. The President's plan puts us on the right track. Since last summer, EPA officials have been hard at work, coordinating with their state counterparts, public service commissions, power companies and other vested stakeholders to come up with tailor-made plans to hit the targets in the most cost-effective way. Some power companies are already well on their way, investing in efficiency so we can do more with less waste, getting more power from the wind and sun, cleaning up dirty power plants or some combination of the three.

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- Arizona shooting suspect Jared Loughner photographed himself posing with a 9mm handgun while wearing a red G-string, a law enforcement source said Saturday. It's not clear when the photo was taken, but it was among those on a roll of 35 mm film that Loughner dropped off at a Walgreens store in the hours before the shooting rampage that took six lives and left 13 others wounded, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The photo, which has not been made public, shows Loughner posing with the handgun covering his groin, according to the source. A Walgreen's employee who saw the photos contacted police. The FBI is analyzing the photos, according to police. Police say Loughner used a 9mm Glock handgun with an extended magazine in the attack on a constituents meeting hosted by Giffords outside a Tucson, Arizona, Safeway store on January 8. Loughner is being held without bail on federal charges of murder, attempted murder and attempting to kill a member of Congress. Meanwhile, a new video reportedly narrated by Loughner also has emerged. The video, released by Pima Community College to the Los Angeles Times and KOLD-TV following a public records request, was cited in campus police records as among the reasons administrators suspended Loughner in September following a series of outbursts and incidents that disrupted classes and left teachers and students shaken. The undated video does not show Loughner or explicitly identify him, but includes many of the same themes attributed to him in other online venues, including statements about currency, mind control and grammar. The narrator also identifies himself as ""Jared of Pima College."" The narrator opens the nighttime walking video tour of the campus by saying ""All right, so here is what we are doing. We are examining the torture of students."" During the video, another man emerges from a building and the narrator calls out ""How's it going?"" He then says, ""Thanks for the B. I'm pissed off man. What's that?"" He then laughs and adds, ""I lost my freedom of speech to that guy, and this is, this is what happens and I'm in a terrible place."" He later refers to a sociology teacher who he said gave him a B grade. He also complains about illiterate students and campus police, calling the college ""one of the biggest scams in America."" He calls the college his ""genocide school"" and complains he will be homeless because of it. ""If the student is unable to locate the external universe, the student is unable to locate the internal universe,"" the narrator says. ""Where is all my subjects? I could say something sound right now but I don't feel like it."" He ends the video saying, ""This is genocide in America. Thank you. This is Jared of Pima college.""

"Edward Snowden may stay in Russia longer than first thought. Snowden has said the time isn't right for him to return to the United States, where he could face criminal charges for leaking classified information. Russia gave him asylum for a year. Now Russia says it will continue to extend asylum protections to Snowden and won't send him back home. That word came Friday from Alexy Pushkov, a legislator who is head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Duma, Russia's lower house. He spoke about Snowden at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Russia's position basically buys Snowden more time as he mulls his next move. Snowden has said he wants to return home but also wants whistle-blower protection. The U.S. government, meanwhile, says it will not offer clemency. In an online chat Thursday, Snowden said that returning to the U.S. ""is the best resolution for all parties,"" but ""it's unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistle-blower protection laws."" He pointed out that the U.S. government's Whistleblower Protection Act doesn't cover someone like him, a former government contractor. ""There are so many holes in the laws, the protections they afford are so weak, and the processes for reporting they provide are so ineffective that they appear to be intended to discourage reporting of even the clearest wrongdoing,"" he wrote. ""... My case clearly demonstrates the need for comprehensive whistle-blower protection act reform."" Snowden offered his remarks from Russia, where he's been since June, having been granted a one-year asylum. Pushkov's remarks appear to open the door to an extension of that asylum. The U.S. government hasn't stayed silent on his case, either. On Thursday, around the time that Snowden was answering questions online, Attorney General Eric Holder said that ""if Mr. Snowden wanted to come back to the United States and enter a plea, we would engage with his lawyers."" The government would take the same tack with anyone willing to plead guilty, Holder said at an event at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. But in Snowden's case, the attorney general insisted, ""Clemency isn't something that we (are) willing to consider.""","A Russian lawmaker says Russia will not push Snowden out .

"(CNN)In matters regarding Nigeria, the international community seems to be learning from experience. Why galvanize support for a government that then exercises its sovereignty by not backing up that support? Why effuse sympathy on people who themselves seem to care so little? When more than 200 girls were in April 2014 kidnapped by Boko Haram terrorists from their school in Chibok, the international community rallied around Nigeria. From Michelle Obama to Alicia Keys to Malala Yousafzai, personalities from across the globe lent their voices to the #BringBackOurGirls social media campaign. This response contrasted greatly to the relative apathy which followed what has been described by Amnesty International as Boko Haram's deadliest attack -- the massacre of up to 2,000 mostly women and children in Baga town of northeast Nigeria last week. At about the same time that the Baga bloodbath was making headlines around the world, the international community was rallying around France in support against the terrorist attacks on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper offices in Paris, giving rise to the #JeSuisCharlie social media campaign. A simultaneous #IAmBaga social media campaign has failed to gain much steam. The Igbo proverb points out that a man cannot expect you to both marry a wife for him and then buy the new couple a bed on which to sleep. Similarly, a country is expected to take responsibility and set sail with the winds of global support. France's President Francois Hollande was addressing the world's media and showing leadership within minutes of the attack. His government's efforts to hunt down the terrorists were broadcast for all the world to see. Nigeria's President Jonathan, on the other hand, waited two weeks before even offering a word on the Chibok kidnappings. So far, he has said nothing about Baga. However, President Jonathan has issued a statement condemning the Paris attacks. Perhaps it is not that the Nigerian government does not care about its own people. Perhaps they simply want to spare us the repetitiveness of their public statements and condemnations: ""The perpetrators of this dastardly act shall be brought to book"". ""No stone shall be left unturned"". ""God will punish them and their families"". But who cares about words and worn-out clichés? Action is what the Nigerian people need. One year on, the fact remains that -- despite predictions that they would be released imminently -- the more than 200 missing girls have still not been found. The Boko Haram perpetrators, rather than cowering under the fire of the Nigerian armed forces, have become bolder. More women and girls have been kidnapped. Boys have been kidnapped. Communities in the northeast of Nigeria are being raided and razed on an almost weekly basis. It is also possible that the Nigerian government's incertitude is being misconstrued as sluggishness or inaction. Maybe they do not believe that things are as bad as is being widely reported by the international media. Last year, President Jonathan's wife, Patience, openly queried the veracity of the missing girls report. This week, the Nigerian defense ministry insisted that fewer than 150 lives were lost in the Baga attack, as opposed to Amnesty International's quoted 2,000. Some Nigerians I've listened to have also expressed their doubts about the 2,000 figure. They believe that, similar to the World Bank's assertion that more than 67% of Nigerians are living in poverty, the Baga reports are all part of the international community's grand conspiracy to taint Nigeria, to make our country look bad. They insist that the international media, in their quest to excavate bad news from ""Africa,"" have simply latched on to an unverified casualty figure. Unfortunately, the Nigerian media -- presumably not part of this grand international conspiracy -- are unable to provide us with enough alternative information. They are too busy covering the preparations for the forthcoming elections scheduled to take place in February. Political rallies are beamed live on local TV and radio stations for hours every day. Photographs of grinning politicians are splashed on newspaper front pages every morning, their latest pronouncements and promises stealing all the headlines. Current affairs programs and opinion pages are consumed with the adulation or derogation of either President Jonathan or his main contender at the polls, General Muhammadu Buhari. Baga and other such will clearly have to take a back seat until after the elections. Nevertheless, the ongoing carnage in Nigeria's northeast will definitely be a determining factor in the outcome of the February elections. A recent snap poll by Nigeria's NOIPolls (which partners with the U.S.'s Gallup) identified security as one of the key issues that Nigerians want their president to focus on in 2015. I suspect that those Nigerians who believe the relatively popular theory in certain ethnic circles that the rise in Boko Haram attacks are being orchestrated by unknown forces who want President Jonathan out by all means, will vote to keep him in -- just to prove a point to his enemies that their vicious efforts did not work. Others who feel that Jonathan is simply insensitive and incapable of handling the crisis will probably vote Buhari. Whatever happens at the polls, Nigeria has to at some point face the Boko Haram issue squarely -- even after the international media frenzy around the group's latest attacks has died down, as it surely will. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.","Up to 2,000 people in northeast Nigeria killed in Boko Haram's worst ever attack in early January .

"(CNN) -- In the wake of the six-month anniversary of Boko Haram's kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls two weeks ago, the Nigerian military released a terse statement that it had negotiated a ceasefire with the cult-like Islamist insurgency, saying it would be finalizing the details for return of most of the girls this week. The announcement came as a surprise, since the administration of President Goodluck Jonathan had refused to negotiate for the girls' release up to that point. What is going on? Boko Haram has yet to comment publicly on any of this, and instead attacked two villages the day after the purported ceasefire. Last week, they reportedly abducted another 30 children. The Nigerian military has, for its part, regularly made false or misleading statements throughout the insurgency, which spread in earnest beginning in 2011, and which has seen Boko Haram expand control of territory in the northeast of the country. Yet despite these developments, the Nigerian government maintains that talks with the insurgents are progressing in neighboring Chad. If the government really is in talks, then it represents the best prospect for the return of the girls since they were kidnapped in April. Still, a real resolution of the insurgency -- and an end to Boko Haram's current tactics -- seems remote. After all, kidnapping is one of the most important sources of Boko Haram financing, and the girls' return will certainly come at a heavy price. Moreover, the movement's goal of installing its medieval version of a Taliban-style state in as much of Nigeria as it can capture leaves little room for negotiating some form of a permanent settlement. But that is all looking ahead. In the meantime, there is the complicated issue of determining the Nigerian government's motivations for agreeing to a ceasefire and negotiations. Up to this point, the inaction and/or ineptitude of President Goodluck Jonathan's administration in managing both Boko Haram and the liberation of the kidnapped girls has prompted heavy criticism within Nigeria and abroad. The success of the #BringBackOurGirls movement, which has kept a daily demonstration alive in Abuja since April, and enjoys the support of U.S. first lady Michelle Obama and a chorus of celebrities, underscores public frustration with the Nigerian government's poor management of Boko Haram. Why the government, which earns roughly $100 billion annually from oil revenues alone, cannot finish the job is the source of intense debate across Nigeria. Massive sums of public funds are being released for the counterinsurgency effort, but troops in the theater of operations have mutinied several times over lack of equipment and allegations that officers are stealing their pay. Just as shocking as the corruption is the apparent indifference of the government to the emergency. The very day that Boko Haram kidnapped the schoolgirls in April, just a day after it set off a bomb at a bus stop killing over 70 innocent victims, President Jonathan reportedly danced and sang at a political rally for himself and his ruling party as general elections approach in February 2015. Not only did the military have a four-hour warning that the attack on the girls' village was imminent, according to Amnesty International, but it took them two weeks to respond. To his credit, President Jonathan met with his security chiefs about the kidnappings the day after the political rally, and also visited the bus stop shortly after the bombings took place. But his political priorities appear clear -- spending the majority of his energies seeking to stave off the growing political opposition to his re-election plans. Despite a major insurgency that is threatening a third of the nation and displacing over 250,000 people, by some estimates, the business of politics, it seems, comes first. And what a business it is. Earlier this year, the internationally respected governor of the central bank announced that $20 billion of Nigeria's oil earnings were unaccounted for by the state-owned oil company, and that he planned to investigate. Rather than applauding these anti-corruption efforts, the President sacked the governor. In a surreal public debate, the finance minister counter-argued that ""only"" $10.8 billion was missing. While 85% of Nigerians live on less than $2 per day, the Nigerian media report almost daily accusations of audacious spending and corruption across government at all levels, from gold-plated iPhones allegedly distributed to guests at the President's daughter's wedding, to the minister of petroleum reportedly spending millions in public funds on chartered aircraft for private trips. As a result of all this, fears are growing that government claims of the girls' imminent release is a public relations stunt designed for election year consumption and to divert attention from the Jonathan administration's problems. Not only has Boko Haram embarked upon new attacks and kidnappings in recent days, but Nigerian journalists are also reporting that the man the government says is representing Boko Haram at the talks in Chad is a fraud. The media-savvy head of Boko Haram, Abubakar Shekau, has yet to comment, but the government has wrongly claimed to kill him twice already, only to have him appear in another online video. Of course, if the negotiations prove to be real and succeed in reuniting the girls with their families, the Jonathan administration has a brief opportunity to initiate a process that could end the insurgency. Boko Haram is a movement of many parts, the most extreme controlled by the Shekau network. But other factions are interested in a negotiated settlement and have requested mediators on several occasions. If the Nigerian government can engage these fence-sitters in the movement in a peace process that offers some measure of amnesty, it may be able to isolate Shekau and the hardliners sufficiently to bring them to justice and end the war. Unfortunately, with so much at stake in the coming elections, there seems a very real chance that the Jonathan administration will return its attention to the business of politics, and lose this opportunity to change course. If so, it will face not only the weary Nigerian electorate at the ballot box in the coming months, but also a growing insurgency that may see less and less reason to negotiate.","Despite ceasefire claims, Boko Haram attacks continue, says Darren Kew .

"(CNN) -- What does it mean to be Nigerian? That's the question on the lips of many in Africa's most populous country as new national identity cards are being rolled out. But this is an I.D. with a difference. The card, which fits into a wallet and comes with a credit-card style chip, can also be used to make electronic payments. Nigerians can use it to deposit funds, receive social benefits, pay for goods and withdraw cash at ATMs across the country, according to MasterCard, which provides the card's prepaid payment technology. The company also claims that by providing proof of identity, the card solves one of the biggest problems people face when trying to open a bank account. ""To all Nigerians, I say, remember the National Identification Number, is your identity,"" Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan said at the launch of the National Identity Smart Card, or NeID, at the end of August. ""The card is not only a means of certifying your identity, but also a personal database repository and payment card, all in your pocket."" The card could also be used for voting in the future, while Chris Onyemenam, director general and CEO of the Nigerian Identity Management Commission (NIMC), said that citizens will have ""the potential to use it as an international travel document."" Earlier this week, finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said 3,000 people had received cards. In order to get the document, Nigerians have to register at one of the NIMC enrollment centers around the country and provide 10 fingerprints, a picture of their face and iris, as well as information about their age and place of birth. Once registered, the NIMC official issues an I.D. number and then the card. Growth opportunity . Nigeria produces more oil than any other African nation, but the World Bank says only about 30% of the population have a bank account.  Given 170 million people live in the country, Mastercard claims to have spotted an opportunity for growth. Research conducted by MasterCard's consultancy arm says that cash dependency in a country like Nigeria can cost up to 1.5% of Gross Domestic Product. Given Nigeria has recently recently re-calculated it's 2013 GDP to a figure of $488 billion, making it Africa's biggest economy, that's certainly an amount the government is keen to keep a hold of. Card controversy . But not everyone is happy with this pocket-sized one-stop-shop. Human Rights Activist Shehu Sani attacked the scheme on Facebook: . While Eze Onyekpere, lead director at the non-governmental organisation Centre for Social Justice, said the collaboration was not appropriate. ""There should be difference between everyday credit or payment cards and an identity card issued by a sovereign authority,"" he says. ""Even if Mastercard was needed to ensure a good payment system, there is nothing that says it must be heavily embossed on the card. It could guarantee the card without necessarily getting this free advert from 170 million Nigerians."" Onyekpere has also criticised the way the Nigerian government partnered with the international payments provider. ""The choice of Mastercard did not undergo a competitive selection process,"" he claims. ""It was clearly an abuse of Nigeria's public procurement process and the selection should have been open to all companies that can provide the service. A MasterCard spokesperson denied the payments company was turning the I.D. card project into a branding exercise. In an emailed statement the company said ""the brand mark is not MasterCard's corporate logo, nor is it an advertisement for the company. The MasterCard brand displayed on the card is what makes the electronic payment component of the eID card accepted as a means of payment."" NIMC spokesperson Umar Abdulhamid rejected any allegation of foul play in partnering with MasterCard. ""It's a level playing field,"" he said In a phone interview. ""Other payment providers have been invited to get involved, but were apprehensive."" And Daniel Monehin, president of MasterCard's Sub Saharan Africa division, joined Abdulhamid in dismissing this claim. In a phone interview he said that ""the collaboration went through all the highest levels of government."" Previous attempts . This is not the first time Nigerian authorities have tried to implement such a card. The idea of a national identity card scheme for Nigeria was first initiated in 1978, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. But successive governments and coups meant the idea did not become a reality. More recently, progress on the provision of identity cards for Nigerians took shape in early 2003, when some 60,000 centers were set up to register citizens. While the approach to take photographs and fingerprints sought to avoid fraud, an article on the U.N. refugee agency's website reports that irregularities in the roll-out of the I.D. cards meant that by 2008 the government was planning a new card. A month into this latest identity project there remains no fixed timetable for when the roll out of the initial 13 million cards will be completed. Read more: Africa's oil and gas: Boom or hype?

"Coronado, California  (CNN)Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker portrayed himself as a battle tested warrior who has successfully beat back successive attempts by powerful Democratic-aligned organizations to try and defeat him, during a campaign style speech Thursday night to members of the Republican National Committee. Walker, who is considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination, used his remarks to sharply criticize Washington and Hillary Clinton as he argued that Republicans should look to the states for a presidential nominee in 2016. While not outwardly saying he would run, it was clear Walker was making the point to these state party leaders and activists that he has the record and the experience to be the next GOP nominee. ""I want to share a vision, I think we have a unique opportunity going forward, not only for the good of this party, but more importantly for the good of the country, to find a new fresh leader out there who can take big bold ideas, take ideas that come from of outside of Washington, from the states all the way down to the grassroots,"" Walker said. ""We need someone who hopefully has the backing and the track-record of success, of showing that commonsense, commonsense conservative reforms can work not just in Wisconsin, but they can work all across America."" Walker reiterated a common theme throughout his remarks that it is a time for a ""fresh new approach"" -- an apparent reference to Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush, both of whom have strongly signaled they will seek the Republican nomination. As he was leaving the ballroom following his speech, Walker was asked about Romney, to which he replied ""good man"" as he walked away. In his speech, he noted it was critical for the GOP to offer voters a contrasting vision and experience in governing in the next election. ""For us going forward, if we are going to be up against particularly, Hillary Clinton, we got to offer a new fresh approach, and ideally it comes from the states,"" he said. ""The reason for that, the reason we mentioned last week in our inaugural address is the states is the place where he actually gets things done. That matters."" Walker was a top target for national Democrats last year, but he won re-election by more than five points. He survived a recall election in 2012. Walker also emphasized that he enjoyed campaigning and meeting voters -- an important trait for a presidential candidate who endures grueling hours on the road away from family and friends. He told the audience that the reason he was motivated to run for governor in 2009 was because of his sons. ""We were afraid that the state was not as great as the Wisconsin we grew up in,"" Walker said of the decision he made with his wife to seek the governorship. Walker then followed by saying that since taking office, ""because of our reforms in our great state of Wisconsin, they are growing up in a state that is better, even better than the state I grew up in."" He later added, ""I look at our country I am worried about our country the same way I was worried about my state in 2009.""","Walker is considering a run for the White House in 2016 .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN)The rattle of ice in a stainless steel shaker heralds the first mojito of the day. It comes courtesy of the award-winning cocktail waitress at Waoo!, a private restaurant run by 41-year-old Cuban entrepreneur Alain Rodriguez. ""The recipe for success is maintaining the real taste of Cuba, whether that's in the food and drink or our taste for life,"" he told me. Businesses like Rodriguez's are among the most visible examples of economic reforms -- that are fueling small, private enterprise -- already launched by President Raul Castro. Rodriguez, a former sommelier at Havana's famed El Nacional Hotel, says he set up his own business just over two years ago in a house owned by his cousin and financed with his own savings and some investment from relatives in the United States. Now small businesses like his could get substantial new cash injections thanks to measures announced by President Barack Obama, which came into effect Friday. Among the changes, it will be easier for Americans -- and their spending money -- to come to Cuba. Cuban authorities and tourism industry experts estimate that could open the door to 1 million U.S. visitors a year, added to the expected 3 million international tourists from other parts of the world. Equally significant, the Obama administration has approved a four-fold increase in remittances from Cuban-Americans to their families in Cuba and no upper limit on remittances destined to fund small business. Unveiling the changes to U.S. trade and travel policy on December 17, Obama said: ""We're calling on Cuba to unleash the potential of 11 million Cubans by ending unnecessary resistance to their political, social and economic activities."" Predictably the decision drew fire from some U.S. Republicans who thought the easing of restrictions would put more money into the hands of the Cuban government, the United States' longstanding Cold War foe. But perhaps Obama's decision over time could prove to be a backdoor to generating change on the island. U.S. economist Milton Friedman, a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan, once said: ""Economic freedom is an indispensable means to the achievement of political freedom."" Now, with Obama's changes, some ordinary Cubans could gain higher incomes because they work in the growing tourist sector, could set up private businesses, or could receive higher-value remittances from  families in the United States. Others may be left behind, unable to make ends meet on meager state-sector wages, currently running around $20 a month. As economic divisions are exacerbated, so is the chance of growing political divisions that could ultimately chip away at Cuba's socialist system. Restaurant owner Rodriguez, however, doesn't seem concerned. ""If salaries start to rise and more remittances come in, then great. In Cuba we don't pay much attention to who is a first-, second- or third-class citizen. But if that starts to happen we'll have to see how we deal with it,"" he said. Rodriguez is already considering the possibility of new outlets and has patented his Waoo! trade name with a view to possible franchise options. But he is convinced liberalization must be gradual and orderly. He does not favor a free-for-all. He says all his 20 staff are affiliated to the Cuban labor federation, CTC, and march in the May Day parade to Havana's Revolution Square. Rodriguez is a firm believer that Cuban government reforms coupled with a bigger influx of U.S. dollars will not undermine Cuban socialism. Across Havana, at a very different type of private business, nail salon owner Indira Yero has a very different viewpoint. At 29 she has never worked for the state. She charges around $5 as she works quickly but precisely smoothing then painting claw-like acrylic nails. She seems to have a well-established clientele who drop by a side room in her ground floor apartment in Old Havana. Yero expresses very little patience for Cuba's socialist system and perhaps surprisingly is not afraid to speak her mind. ""I am one of the capitalist generation. I've never worked for the state and I believe that the capitalist generation is better than the other,"" she said. Until fairly recently, such talk would have run her the risk of being branded a counter-revolutionary by her neighbors. Yero is unabashed when she suggests her generation has little time for talk of the Cuban Revolution. ""All that business of Fidel and the Revolution is a very pretty story but it's got nothing to do with now,"" she said. ""Now its different. Young people want to go to good places, a disco, an all-expenses paid hotel and with a state salary you just can't do that."" Above her workstation, Yero has scratched a sign into the fluorescent light fitting. ""No money. No nail do."" A warning that Cuba's once-cherished dream of forging an egalitarian society may be dimming.","Cuban entrepreneurs hope U.S.-Cuba policy changes mean more chance to make money .

"Tucson, Arizona (CNN) -- U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords on Thursday continued her dramatic recovery from a gunshot wound to the brain by going outside for physical therapy, one of her principal doctors in Tucson, Arizona, told CNN. ""Today actually, we were glad to say that we were able to take her outside and she was able to do her physical therapy,"" Dr. Peter Rhee told John King. ""We gave her some fresh air and also gave her some sunshine,"" said Rhee, speaking from outside University Medical Center. ""She was able to see the Arizona mountains."" Behind Rhee, flowers left by well-wishers filled a portion of the hospital lawn. A day before she was to be flown to a Texas hospital, the husband of Giffords, shot in the head less than two weeks ago at a public event, described his wife's progress as ""remarkable."" Mark Kelly said Thursday he is hopeful the Arizona congresswoman will make a full recovery. ""I've told her that,"" Kelly told reporters at University Medical Center. ""She recognizes it ... she is a fighter like nobody else that I know."" Giffords is able to stand with assistance, but is not yet able to take steps or walk, said Rhee, adding therapists are helping Giffords with ways to express her thoughts and, eventually, speak. ""[We are] holding her up so she can train herself to hold her head up,"" Rhee said. ""She is learning to balance and learning all the little things we can take for granted."" Giffords, 40, was shot in an assassination attempt and mass shooting that killed six and wounded 13 at a Safeway grocery store in Tucson on January 8. The congresswoman is the only person still hospitalized after the attack, the hospital has said. Giffords will be taken by ambulance Friday morning from University Medical Center in Tucson to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base. Giffords will be flown to Houston, where she will receive further treatment at Memorial Hermann-Texas Medical Center, her office said in a statement. On Wednesday, the public learned that Giffords was able to rise from her hospital bed and stand with assistance. Kelly said that while what physical therapists classify as ""standing"" or ""steps"" and the clinical definition of it are ""a little bit different,"" he said his wife ""can bear her own weight, which is a big step, I think. Just speaking for the doctors here, I think she's made a remarkable recovery at this point."" He said he believes she has tried to speak, although she is prevented from doing so by a breathing tube in her neck, and believes she is aware of her surroundings, saying he can look in her eyes and tell. She will smile at him and pat him on the face -- something she did before the shooting, he said. ""Every time I interact with her, there's something quite inspiring,"" he said. ""We've seen her moving her lips,"" acknowledged Dr. Michael Lemole, chief of neurosurgery at the hospital. But, he said, it's hard to say whether Giffords is actually trying to speak. He said Giffords has been able to scroll through an iPad and interact with her husband, so she does appear to be aware of her surroundings. But, Lemole cautioned, she has a long road ahead of her that will take months, at least. Kelly has discussed the shooting incident with Giffords, Rhee said. ""She can probably put some of that information together on her own."" Kelly said he believes his wife would be proud of how the Tucson community has reacted to the shootings. ""She's going to need to continue to be strong,"" he said. ""She will really appreciate the support of this community."" He said Giffords' family looked at several different rehabilitation facilities and liked Memorial Hermann for several reasons. The medical team there specializes in penetrating head injuries like the one Giffords has suffered, and its closeness to Tucson is also helpful. Giffords has undergone other ""minor procedures"" this week, Lemole said, calling it ""housekeeping. It's really getting her to a position where she can graduate from this hospital."" Investigators have charged Jared Lee Loughner in the attack. A federal grand jury indicted Loughner on Wednesday on three charges of attempted murder. The indictment charges Loughner, 22, with attempting to kill Giffords and two of her aides, Ron Barber and Pamela Simon. Legal experts said that more federal charges against Loughner are likely. ""This is really a placeholder indictment,"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Wednesday.  ""The grand jury investigation will continue; there's a long way to go in this case and these charges will be there but I'm certain there will be more as well."" Loughner is next set to appear in court on Monday in Phoenix. ""I don't think we're ever going to fully understand the whys and the how and, you know, the reason for what happened on the 8th of January,"" Kelly told reporters. ""It's a loss of innocent life. The injury of a dozen people, the death of a 9-year-old girl, a federal judge and the serious traumatic injury to my wife Gabrielle -- we'll never fully understand that.""

"Paris (CNN)A man with a handgun entered a post office outside of Paris early Friday afternoon before reportedly surrendering and releasing his hostages unharmed. The incident in Colombes, a community about 10 kilometers northwest of the French capital, began at about 12:45 p.m. (6:45 a.m. ET) and was over two hours later. The gunman might be mentally unstable, according to police in Colombes. Police said that they don't know yet whether the incident is related to terrorism. This is a hot topic in France after last week's deadly attacks. A Western intelligence source said there could be as many as 20 terrorist sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people ready to strike in France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The gunman eventually surrendered and the hostages emerged with no injuries, according to France Bleu, which is part of the country's public broadcasting group. CNN's Greg Botelho and Elwyn Lopez contributed to this report.","Public radio: Gunman surrenders, hostages released uninjured .

"Concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere reached record highs in 2011, according to new data published by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The WMO's annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, released Tuesday, reports that carbon dioxide rose to 390.9 parts per million (ppm), up two ppm on 2010 levels. Carbon dioxide is the single most important greenhouse gas emitted by humans, says the WMO, and the increases recorded last year are in line with average rises seen each year over the last decade. Combined with average yearly rises of 1.5 ppm during the 1990s, the WMO says radiative forcing (the warming effect on our climate) by long-lived greenhouse gases has now increased 30% since 1990. ""These billions of tons of additional carbon dioxide in our atmosphere will remain there for centuries, causing our planet to warm further and impacting on all aspects of life on Earth,"" WMO secretary general Michel Jarraud said in a statement. According to the WMO, about 375 billion tons of carbon has been released into the atmosphere since the industrial revolution began in 1750, with around half this amount being absorbed by carbon sinks. But natural carbon storage facilities like oceans and forests ""will not necessarily continue in the future,"" say the WMO. ""We've already seen that the oceans are becoming more acidic as a result of the carbon dioxide uptake, with potential repercussions for the underwater food chain and coral reefs,"" Jarraud said in a statement. The Swiss-based United Nations agency, which uses data from more than 50 countries to compile the report, also detailed rises in other greenhouse gases including methane and nitrous oxide. Around 60% of methane released into the atmosphere comes from human activities such as farming, rice agriculture, fossil fuel exploitation, landfill and biomass burning, according to the WMO. In 2011, concentrations reached a new high of 1813 parts per billion (ppb), 259% higher than pre-industrial levels. Watch: CNN special 'Secrets in the Ice' Emissions of nitrous oxide -- 40% of which are estimated to come from human activity -- reached 324.2 ppb, up one ppb on the 2010 figure and 120% higher than pre-industrial times. Richard Allan, from the Department of Meteorology at the UK's University of Reading, said the WMO's latest data confirmed the trend in the rate of rise reported in recent decades. ""What it shows isn't surprising, but it obviously has very important implications for the future well-being of the planet,"" Allan told CNN. Even if emission rises were halted now, the planet would continue to warm because of the time it takes for the climate system to return to equilibrium, he said. ""We are committed to the warming for a long time, even if we do take strong action against it now,"" Allan said.","United Nations agency report says 2011 saw new high for levels of greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere .

"(CNN) -- The death of more than 300 African migrants in a shipwreck off the Italian island of Lampedusa in early October has shone a spotlight on illegal immigration to Europe. But although the tragedy at Lampedusa shocked the world, it has done little to dissuade migrants who continue to make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean from northern Africa to European shores. Frontex, the European Union border agency, says the majority of people residing illegally in the EU arrived by plane with a valid travel visa and simply stayed on after their visa expired. But Frontex also estimates that at least 72,000 people illegally entered the EU via land and sea routes in 2012 -- and the actual figure may be much higher. According to Frontex's ""Annual Risk Analysis 2013"" report, 51% of migrants entering illegally via land and sea took an eastern Mediterranean route, with many crossing into Greece before continuing on to the western Balkans by land or through ferry links to Italy. OPINION: Europe's immigration nightmare just beginning . While detections of illegal border crossings dropped in the western Mediterranean area between northern Africa and Spain, attempted migrant incursions through the central Mediterranean region -- including Italy -- are up in 2012, according to the report. Many of the migrants are fleeing violence and poverty in places like Syria and Libya. The deaths of hundreds of migrants in early October has prompted EU leaders to review the bloc's immigration policies. OPINION: EU must solve crisis to deserve Nobel Prize . The EU's commissioner for home affairs, Cecilia Malmstrom, issued a statement in early October calling on European nations to give Frontex the resources to mount ""a wide Frontex search and rescue operation in the Mediterranean, from Cyprus to Spain."" The EU also said it is setting up a new border surveillance system and Mediterranean task force to bolster its efforts and will review its asylum immigration policies next summer. OPINION: What's the place of outsiders in Europe? But in the meantime, observers don't expect any let-up in migrant boats attempting to reach the shores of southern Europe. Explore the breakdown of the routes immigrants are taking into the EU in the infographic above.","Frontex: At least 72,000 illegally entered EU via land and sea routes in 2012 .

"(CNN)With its pristine beaches, warm water and coral reefs, Seychelles has long been a must-visit destination for jet-setters from all over the world. They come from Europe, the Middle East and Asia to unwind in the sun. But not all the hosts can afford to be so relaxed. The country, which is made up of 115 islands, will host 215,000 international tourists this year,  and these visitors will contribute 21.7% of its gross domestic product. Indeed, the World Bank says Seychelles' economy is ""highly dependent"" on tourism. Capitalizing on the nation's natural beauty, and making this sector a success, is crucial if the country wants to retain the top spot in African human development rankings. Decline in visitors . As the global financial crisis of 2008 stopped many people from taking holidays, the Seychelles was hit hard. That year, the country's GDP contracted by 2.1%. Tourism contributed close to 30% of GDP in 2008, but by 2010 that number was closer to 25%. Since then numbers have continued to fall. Another reason for this decline, according to Euromonitor International, is competition from Sri Lanka, which ended a violent civil war in 2010. The research group says visitors to Sri Lanka are from the ""same demographic as those who travel to the Seychelles"" and the substitution has had an impact. In addition to these issues, the country has had to deal with the failure of the state-owned national airline. Air Seychelles recorded a loss of $12.5 million in 2010/11 and the company made massive cuts. Things got so bad that in January 2012 the national airline flew fewer passengers from the country's biggest airport than Emirates. Industry revival . It was this situation that led the UAE airline Etihad to offer $20 million for a 40% stake in the company. The Seychelles government matched the investment and retained 60%. The cash injection and corporate reorganization that followed helped turn the company around. ""The partnership with Etihad has allowed the airline to reorganize itself, restructure itself and allowed us to get to where we are today,"" says CEO of Air Seychelles Manoj Papa. ""It's a win for Air Seychelles in the sense that it helps us to grow our network...[It] helps people being trained and developed."" And the latest numbers show the partnership has paid off. In 2013, almost 200,000 people embarked on an Air Seychelles flight overseas -- twice the number from the previous year. As well as this boost, the government embarked on an aggressive re-branding exercise to appeal to holidaymakers on a budget. The African Development Bank now forecasts GDP growth to be ""above 3.5% in 2014 and 2015 due largely to a rebound in the tourism sector."" Given the country grew at 2.8% in 2012, there is some proof things are improving. And this trend is also recognized by the World Travel and Tourism Council, who say the country has ""excellent"" prospects when it comes to travel and tourism. David Scowsill, CEO of the private sector body says ""[The Seychelles] has been affected in the last few years by the recession in Europe but ...the contribution from the sector to the Seychelles economy is forecast to rise by 4.3% every year over the next decade."" Gulf investments . As well as the tourism sector, money from the Middle East has also gone into the country's infrastructure. In 2011, the Sheikh Khalifa Diagnostic Center opened, bringing the first MRI and CT scans to the island. But the benefits of the center go beyond health. ""The second floor is almost entirely dedicated to teaching and learning,"" the minister of health explained during a speech to open the center. ""Indeed, it has been designed with continuous professional education in mind."" And the UAE has also funded eight wind turbines which whirr above the capital, Victoria, and also two diesel powered generators. These power sources supply roughly a quarter of the country's energy -- crucial for hotels, bars and restaurants which keep tourists coming back. ""Investment from the UAE and other countries as well has been instrumental in turning around the economy,"" says President James Michel who was reelected in 2011 with a 55% majority. ""Over the last five years we've seen $1.5 billion in investment from mainly the UAE, Russia and China."" Indeed, China is becoming an increasingly important source of visitors to the archipelago. Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics show that visitor arrivals in Seychelles are up by over 90% compared to last year. Courting controversy . But as well as benefits, foreign investment has also brought controversy to the sleepy island chain. ""The Arabs come in and basically they want to take over,"" says Wavel Ramkalawan, the leader of one the main opposition parties. ""When you look at it at face value it appears to be good investment...when you balance things out to see what he got from us and what he brought in. If he would have been made to pay the necessary taxes we probably would have earned more."" The ""he"" Ramkalawan refers to is Sheikh Khalifa the President of the UAE, who happens to own a mansion with a billion-dollar view -- just one example of the high-profile Emirati presence. But President Michel has rejected complaints that preferential treatment was given to those willing to spend big bucks. ""If anyone comes here whether it is from the Emirates or from America, Europe or China, the same rules will apply."" More from Marketplace Africa .

"Paris (CNN) -- The conversation between space cadet and world leader had a simple purpose: To make an ill teenager happy. That's how South African space tourist and software entrepreneur Mark Shuttleworth remembers the day he spoke to Nelson Mandela, the hero of South Africa's anti-apartheid struggle, who died last week aged 95. ""He brought a little girl with him who was very ill, it was such a classic Mandela move,"" Shuttleworth told CNN during tech conference LeWeb, being held in Paris. ""Lots of people wanted to be on the phone with a space cadet and I get the impression that for many of them it was about the spotlight being on them, whereas for Madiba (Mandela's tribal name) the most wonderful thing for him was about making this little girl's wish come true."" Michelle Foster, 14, was terminally ill with cancer and through the Reach for the Dream foundation had been able to meet Mandela and later link through satellite to Shuttleworth in space. Foster died less than a month after she'd spoken to him. Shuttleworth, who founded software company Canonical, recalled the conversation ahead of Mandela's state funeral Sunday, the conclusion of 10 official days of mourning. Mandela's lasting lesson, Shuttleworth said, is that people should ""find the Madiba in our counterpart. ""Even good societies, societies filled with good people can end up in very dark places,"" he said. ""We should focus on the rules of society and the norms of society and make sure those aren't ripe for abuse."" There could even be lessons for dealing with terrorist organizations, like al Qaeda, Shuttleworth said. ""Don't tell me there isn't somebody in every institution who doesn't have the capacity to transcend the mess they've got themselves into."" Shuttleworth's conversation with Mandela was in 2002, when space tourism was in its infancy and only two paying guests had gone into orbit. Shuttleworth reportedly paid $20 million to travel with Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gidzenko and spend a short time at the International Space Station. A decade later, Richard Branson's Virgin's Galactic is one several companies pushing to make space tourism a reality. Meanwhile, Shuttleworth predicts, the world will see first ""the first commercial suborbital flights in the new two years ... and I think we will see a partly commercial interplanetary flight in the next 10 years."" Eventually, humans will move beyond earth, he said.""I think our destiny is in the stars ... there is probably a habitable planet out there within 15 light years of us."" That, he adds, is ""in our neighborhood."" ""The galaxy is around 100,000 light years across so 15 light years is very little. It may take us a couple hundred years to achieve that but look back a couple of years and you're at the rebuilding of Paris, so I think this is the sort of timescale we should be dreaming in."" Read more: Ray Kurzweil on your future . Back on Earth, Shuttleworth's company has signed its first deal with a phone hardware partner to use its operating system, Ubuntu. Shuttleworth won't give details yet -- it's expected to be made public in 2014 -- but says it's a step forward from the company's work with personal computers and could eventually position it to compete with the likes of Android. While the operating system market is dominated by giants such as Google and Apple, Shuttleworth sees opportunity in ""convergence,"" when all mobile devices run seamlessly from one set-up.
