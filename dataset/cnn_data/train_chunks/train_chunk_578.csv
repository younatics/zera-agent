War is a ‘heterosexual hobby’, and it wouldn’t exist if more men were gay. The outspoken former frontman of The Smiths, who has previously criticised the Royal Family and branded the Chinese a ‘subspecies’, said war stemmed from heterosexual men’s passion for killing each other. Big mouth strikes again: Morrissey told a U.S. magazine if more men were gay there would be no wars . Morrissey, 53, said: ‘War, I thought, was the most negative aspect of male heterosexuality. ‘If more men were homosexual, there would be no wars, because homosexual men would never kill other men, whereas heterosexual men love killing other men. They even get medals for it. Women don’t go to war to kill other women.' ‘Wars and armies and nuclear weapons are essentially heterosexual hobbies.’ The singer, whose real name is Steven Morrissey, made the comments in Rookie, an American online magazine for teenage girls. His remarks show little regard for . history.  Military leaders known or believed to be gay include Alexander . the Great, Julius Caesar, Field Marshal Montgomery and Hermann Goering. Indie icon: Morrissey (second from right) with his 1980s group The Smiths . Today, 45 countries allow homosexuals to serve openly in their armed forces, including the US, Canada and France. Countries which ban homosexuals from serving in the military include Iran, Egypt and Syria. Morrissey has made headlines in the past for his controversial views, attracting the most attention for his anti-meat comments. He called the Chinese a ‘subspecies’ for their treatment of animals and claimed that Anders Breivik’s massacre of 97 people in Norway in 2011 was ‘nothing compared to what happens in McDonald’s and Kentucky Fried sh** every day’. And last year, he attacked the Royal Family following the death of nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who was the victim of a hoax call from an Australian radio station while the Duchess of Cambridge was in hospital with an acute form of morning sickness. He accused the royals of ‘absolutely staggering’ arrogance and said Kate ‘feels no shame’. Criticised: Beyonce, left, and Justin Bieber, right, were singled out by controversial singer Morrissey .

Even though she followed a gruelling diet to shed more than 7st in a year, Dawn French admits she is happier now she has piled on the pounds again. The comedienne, 55, went on a strict regime that included cutting out chocolate and carbohydrates after her 25-year marriage to Lenny Henry ended in 2010. But she has recently put 2st back on – and says she feels more dignified and ‘in control’. ‘If you’ve got the gift of a bit of extra heft, use it,’ Miss French told Australia’s New Idea magazine. Dawn French shed 7st after cutting down on carbohydrates and chocolate having peaked at about 19st . ‘I’d like to decide what you may find funny about my fatness. For me there’s a dignity in that. ‘I don’t need you to be laughing at my fatness in a cruel or bullying way. Luckily in my life I’ve never experienced that, but I know that other big women do and don’t like it at all. I’ve always wrestled that into my control.’ Miss French, who is to star with James Corden in the BBC2 comedy The Wrong Mans, was 19st at her heaviest. She blames her recent weight gain on a weakness for bread, pasta and potatoes. ‘I had ballooned a bit more than I wanted to. I want to be there for my kid,’ she added. The Vicar Of Dibley actress, who began . dating twice-married charity executive Mark Bignell, 49, last year, has . ruled out any more diets in the future, saying she has come to terms . with her figure. ‘I am perfectly happy with how I look and I always have been. I’ll . always be a fat girl and I am happy with that,’ she said recently. The comedienne has found love again with charity chief executive Mark Bignell after splitting from Lenny Henry after 25 years of marriage . In interviews at the time she said that entering her fifties had made her more health conscious. Miss French also explained that falling in love has given her a new lease of life, and suggested that she started to put the weight back on following a romantic trip to Paris with Mr Bignell. ‘Generally I eat much more healthily and I eat less, probably half as much as I did before,’ she said. ‘I am very fond of this body - it’s served me well and it’s never disappointed me. ‘I understand it, I know it and I even like it now it’s all saggy, it’s a mark of my journey this far.’ Mr Bignell, whom Miss French has described as a ‘remarkable man’, is chief executive of a Plymouth-based charity which helps drug and alcohol abusers reintegrate into society.","The comedienne lost 7st in a year following her split with Lenny Henry .

Novelist Barbara Taylor Bradford, pictured with husband Bob, says the secret to happy marriage is to respect your partner . She has been happily married for almost half a century. And Barbara Taylor Bradford has given a very simple piece of advice for all those women searching for the answer to marital bliss; admire your husband. The best-selling author, who wed film producer Bob Bradford on Christmas Eve in 1963 after meeting on a blind date, said respecting one’s partner was the most important ingredient of a happy marriage. The 79-year-old, who famously wrote a . guide called How to be the Perfect Wife, said she was appalled by . couples who quarrel in public. She . said: ‘I think that basically, you can’t just be in love with a man. I . think you have got to admire him and like him. Because a lot of the . other stuff goes away. ‘That . doesn’t have to matter – but I feel that you have to work at marriage. You have to like and respect the man you are married to. ‘There’s . nothing worse than when we go out to dinner with a couple, and the . woman starts to put her husband down and vice versa. It’s unnecessary. If you don’t like each other, then get a divorce. We remain married . because of those reasons and because we share very simple interests.’ Speaking . to the Daily Mail at the launch of her latest novel, Secrets from the . Past, hosted by The Lady magazine she added: ‘We like going to the cinema, going to the theatre and . reading. The only thing we don’t do together is sit in the sun – because . Bob likes to lie by the pool in the South of France and bake himself, . whereas I go the colour of a lobster. Barbara Taylor Bradford has dedicated each of 29 novels to her husband Bob . ‘That’s the only thing we don’t agree . on, but I never chide him about it. I’ve learned to keep quiet. You’ve . got to edit yourself sometimes. ‘It’s knowing when to shut up, because men never do. It’s always women who think, “I’ll walk away from an argument”.’ Miss . Taylor Bradford is regarded as the doyenne of women’s fiction whose 27 . novels, including the hugely popular A Woman Of Substance, have sold 88 . million copies worldwide. She . and her husband, a former German Jewish refugee, met in London in 1961 . after being introduced by a mutual friend who took them on a blind date. At the time, she was 28 and was working as a writer for the London American Magazine, while he was already an established film producer, having worked on the Charlton Heston epic El Cid. She said he had immediately made an impression on her because he was wearing a tie. Two years later the couple got married and moved to America, where she began writing novels. She published her most famous book, A Woman of Substance in 1979, which went on to sell 31million copies worldwide. She has earned a fortune of £188m, selling 88million books globally during her career. She has dedicated each of her 29 novels to her husband, who she has described as ‘demanding’, while he has made 10 of her books into films whilst managing her career. The couple have never had children and Miss Taylor Bradford has spoken in the past of suffering a miscarriage during the 1960s. She said she suspects that she also had a second miscarriage, but says it was too early in the pregnancy to be certain. In the past the writer has claimed that they’ve never had a major row, saying: ‘We’ve never said anything like, “You’re a son of a bitch.” We always stay on the subject of the quarrel rather than attack each other. ‘I may get shrill with Bob, but I don’t say wounding things to him.

With his Premier League salary rumoured to be around £230,000 a week, Wayne Rooney is certainly a man with money to spare. Now the Manchester United and England striker is using his wealth to help provide a boost to the economy. The 27-year-old has teamed up with cricketer Kevin Pietersen and Dragons’ Den star Theo Paphitis to offer a service giving loans to small businesses that have been turned down by the banks. The trio are investors in a £2.5 million venture put together by Ian Currie, a former director of Bolton Wanderers. They are thought to have contributed about £200,000 each to the partnership, which has been lending to small business without fanfare for more than a year and has given loans to more than a dozen different companies. Wayne Rooney, pictured with his wife Coleen, has invested in Senone, which lends money to small businesses turned down by high street banks . England cricketer Kevin Pietersen, pictured with wife Jessica, is also thought to have invested about £200,000 in the venture . ‘Through the loans we have saved about 200 jobs,’ Mr Currie told The Mail on Sunday. Unlike many investments favoured by sports stars, such as film and property ventures, there are no tax advantages to the deal. ‘We lend to companies that can’t borrow from the banks. We put about £200,000 to £500,000 into businesses,’ Mr Currie said. He added that since its creation in late 2011, the partnership – called Senone – had been inundated with requests for finance, fielding 500 queries in the past year. The partnership has 13 investors, including several partners in Seneca, Mr Currie’s investment firm. Bob Holt, the chairman of social housing maintenance company Mears, is also a backer. Mr Currie said he had contacts in  the sports world from his time at Bolton, enabling him to put together the stellar cast of investors. ‘Clearly, with the money these guys have got, it’s not massive money for them.’ While Pietersen and Rooney are relative newcomers to the world of small company financing, Theo Paphitis has a long background in backing small ventures. The entrepreneur made his money turning around retailers including La Senza and Ryman. More recently he set up a lingerie firm, Boux Avenue, and bought high street hardware chain Robert Dyas in July last year. Earlier this year he said he would be stepping down from his role on Dragons’ Den. Former Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis, another investor in Senone, has a long background in supporting small ventures . Senone has put money into printing firms, one petrol forecourt business, an interior design company and a luxury motorhomes business. The funding venture has been so successful that Mr Currie is considering starting a bank. He said the Senone partnership was set up as a turnaround fund to rescue struggling companies, but the demand has been from companies unable to obtain conventional bank loans. Politicians have been bitterly critical of banks and their failure to lend to small businesses, despite Government initiatives such as the Funding For Lending scheme. That has led to a growth in alternative sources of finance, with new enterprises stepping in to lend to firms. ‘One company we lent to got a big contract, and couldn’t get funds to honour it,’ Mr Currie said. He is now hoping to start a proper bank focused on the North of England. It would take deposits from individuals and lend to small companies. He said he is aiming to raise £20 million to get the project off the ground. The Senone partnership is not technically a bank because it does not take deposits. Anyone can lend to small companies, but anyone taking deposits must have approval from regulators. The Government is trying to encourage the launch of new banks, announcing changes last week that would make it easier for companies to enter the market.","The pair have joined a £2.5million venture to boost the economy .

Jannah Reid has no need for an alarm clock to wake her three children for school. The daily dawn chorus in her tower block apartment in downtown Damascus is the thump of rockets fired from Syrian army artillery batteries in the hills surrounding the country's capital or the roar of government MiG fighter jets overhead. Dundee-born Jannah is trapped in a war zone. The teacher can't leave because she needs the written permission of her estranged Syrian husband to take her two younger sons, Ridwaan, 11, and Hashem, ten, out of the country. He is currently living in exile in Saudi Arabia and doesn't reply to her letters. 'Some days are worse than others,' says Jannah, 51. 'I'll feel trapped and scared by the bombing going on around me, but then the next day, the situation quietens.' Trapped: Jannah Reid with sons Talal 19, Hashem Bous al-Jiddi, 10, and Ridwaan Bous al-Jiddi, 11 . As we speak, another salvo of rockets fires out from the hilltop. The noise appears not to faze her children – her oldest son, from her first marriage, is 19-year-old Talal. But Jannah is clearly rattled. The UN says at least 70,000 people have been killed since protests against President Bashar al-Assad began two years ago. In the past few days, 15 students died at the university after a mortar strike and ten shells have exploded within half a mile of Jannah's office during heavy fighting in the capital. She has lost two close friends to the conflict, one to a bomb and one to a sniper bullet. At least a dozen of her former students have been killed. 'I fret and cry daily about our safety and the lack of money,' she admits. 'Every time a child is late home, I think they have been killed or held at one of the military checkpoints as they cross town to school. Bloody conflict: A masked Free Syrian Army fighter smokes during heavy fighting in the Ain Tarma neighbourhood of Damascus . 'I've friends who say it'll all be over in two months but they've been saying that for two years. Others think it'll be like Algeria, and that went on for eight years, or Lebanon – six years. My feeling is it's a stalemate because both sides have so much outside support. I think the war will go on for at least another five or six years.' The violence all around is the new normal in Damascus. 'Yesterday, a small truck suicide bomb went off within 200 metres of the park my children were playing in,' she adds. 'Ridwaan told me, ''Mum, it was like an earthquake. The ground was moving.''' She speaks with only a hint of a Scottish brogue after years of living in London – where she worked as a dental hygienist and then as sales manager for a medical finance company – and almost a decade in Syria. Brought up a Roman Catholic, she was educated at the £10,000-a-year High School of Dundee and currently teaches English to businessmen and students at the Sky Education Institute in the tax-free business zone, across the city in West Damascus. Her daily journey involves lengthy detours on foot to avoid the checkpoints, where one false move can see you arrested, roughed up or worse. 'I'm more worried about Talal when it comes to the checkpoints,' she says. 'At 19, he is rebel fighting age and a target for checks. He has to show his papers every time. But as soon as he shows his British passport, he flies through “Go go go! Go quickly!” they tell him.'Talal says the official Syrian army checkpoints present no problems. Instead, he fears the unpredictable, untrained rebel forces. 'The biggest threat for me are definitely the free army,' he says. 'I hate it all. In truth I'm a complete pacifist. I don't want to see any weapons in this world.' Jannah's three boys are a credit to her. 'They sometimes calm me down when I leap up hearing an explosion,' she says. 'They say, “Calm down, Mum – it's just the rebels or the government farting.” To them it's normal now. 'I love Syria. I'm so sad about the situation here, I cry every day. The people are incredible, so friendly, so helpful. Civil war: Flames and smoke billow from burned cars after two bombs exploded at Qazaz, Damascus . We'd all cry if we had to leave – and we . may have to once we can. But at the moment we're stuck here because my . two younger boys' father is Syrian. They have a well-known Damascene . surname. I need power of attorney from their father to get their . passports stamped to leave the country.' She does not know where he is living in Saudi Arabia. Now, though, she has discovered he is wanted by Syrian police for alleged non-repayment of government loans connected with his academic studies in Britain. Because of that, she now hopes divorce might be possible in a matter of months. Jannah's story is as tangled as it is sad. After her first marriage collapsed, she converted to Islam in Britain, but was targeted by a fundamentalist sect, the Salafee, who put pressure on her to marry an adherent. She has now renounced the Salafee and holds moderate views. 'The pressure never let up and I eventually married my husband after meeting him for three hours – as Salafee rules dictate. I made a premarital verbal agreement that we would live in his home country. He promised he would finish his PhD in six months and we would move to Syria. Uprising: The UN says at least 70,000 people have been killed since protests against President Bashar al-Assad began two years ago . 'But I then discovered he was in danger of deportation. I had to apply for a visa so he could continue his studies. Four years later, he still had not completed his PhD and we were still in the UK. Apart from two short periods of maternity leave, I supported the family almost unaided. If he gave me money for the weekly shop, it was never more than £50. 'I sold my home in Chiswick, West London, and bought a new property in Colchester. He began work to extend it, but the money ran out. He used up my overdraft and suggested borrowing money to complete the home and then move to Syria. I borrowed £25,000.' He was supposed to pay the monthly payments, but never did. 'I moved to Syria in 2004 with £15,000, leaving £10,000 with him to finish the work – which was not done. I'm not even sure if all the windows are in place. I don't even have the keys. 'I brought the boys to Syria, and hired part-time help in my home and went to work teaching English. Then, in 2006, his friend came and took the remaining £1,000 back for him. He visited us perhaps for less than 50 days in the years between 2004 and 2010, when I last saw him. 'My husband is now wanted in Syria for taking money from the university to study for his doctorate, then never completing it and not returning to work at the university to fulfil his contract. I am trying to use that to gain a divorce.' Meantime, she struggles to feed her sons in a country ravaged by the conflict and by the inflationary effects of international sanctions and profiteering. 'My rent has gone up 30 per cent in six months. Bread and gas cylinders for cooling and heating – it's all three, four, five times more expensive than before the war.' Rebels: Free Syrian Army fighters take their positions at the front line of Maaret al-Numan . She has no choice but to work long hours, teaching English for 12 hours most days. The boys make their own sandwiches before going to school. 'I've no choice but to work long hours just to stay above water. It's frightening. I speak English. I'm a graduate. I can earn decent money for Syria and still I'm really struggling. So what about the 80-odd per cent of people who earn less than me? How are they coping? 'I worry and cry daily about not having enough money to live. The sanctions are killing as many people here as the fighting. 'The exchange rate used to be 47 Syrian lira to the US dollar – now it's about 120 lira. A bottle of LPG gas for cooking that used to cost 240 lira this week cost me 2,400 lira. Fierce fighting: A Syrian military tank shells a neighborhood in Damascus this week . 'We lived the whole winter with no diesel fuel to fill the heater and we had severe cold and snow. And there are power cuts often, up to three times daily for about three hours each. During the snow, the power was off for more than 36 hours.' 'You need money to leave. I have none. Where would I store our belongings or do I just abandon everything? How could I move back to Britain, where I have no savings? Would I find a job? I'm terrified of not having enough money to feed my children – or even that I might lose my children because of this.' There has been no British Embassy in Damascus since 2011. Even then, diplomats told her she was on her own. So she sits tight in the warren of concrete apartment blocks, listens for rockets, mortars and MiGs and worries about her children and their future. Alex Thomson's report can be seen tonight on Channel 4 News  at 5.20pm.","Jannah Reid is trapped in the war zone with sons Ridwaan and Hashem .

But now The Mail on Sunday can reveal that the Wigan MP has not always been so careful to project a serious image. As the editor of a ‘Dear Lisa’ column in her university newspaper, Miss Nandy starred in a photo casebook which detailed her search for a male sex partner and also showed her naked in bed with another woman. Up front: Lisa Nandy certainly made an impression with this low-cut effort in the House of Commons . Miss Nandy, now Shadow Children’s Minister, was the figurehead of the column in Newcastle University’s Courier student newspaper. Styling herself as ‘The woman who likes a bit of hot mail’, the politics undergraduate appeared in a comic book-style photostrip recording her quest to bag a boyfriend. ‘I’ll never find a man!’ she moans in the strip, psimon mursimon  urrinted 13 years ago. Then, when a friend suggests a suitable partner, Miss Nandy is pictured opposite the prospective male with her hands pressed against her face in exasperation. A thought bubble reads: ‘Oh, my God! I’m not .  .  . s******g THAT!’ Later, as she is chatted up by another student who offers her a drink, Miss Nandy says: ‘I’d love a stiff one! Actually, d’ya wanna come back to my place?’ After apparently having sex with him, the MP is pictured discussing the incident with a friend. Using her fingers to illustrate her point, she complains: ‘The smallest I’ve ever seen! I’m going back on the pull .  .  .’ Just as she is giving up hope, a Fairy Godfather intervenes promising to ‘sort it out’. She is then pictured naked in bed with another woman. Miss Nandy, who has her arms wrapped around the attractive blonde, says: ‘Ooh, I thought you only had your ears pierced!!!’ Torrid: Lisa Nandy's comic book search for sex in a student paper . The 33-year-old MP, elected to Parliament on an all-women shortlist, was at the centre of a sexism row shortly after winning her seat in 2010 when she sat directly behind Mr Miliband in the Commons wearing a low-cut top, prompting a storm of debate on Twitter. During her time in charge of her student column, Miss Nandy also dispensed advice to readers. In one column she wrote: ‘As I’ve said many times over the course of this year, THERE ARE NO FIT MEN AT THIS UNIVERSITY.’ She adds: ‘There’s a lot of diversity in a university – virgins, slimy b******s who offer to buy you a drink but have no intention of doing any such thing, geeks, the lot. The trick is how to spot them. You can usually identify a virgin from a thousand paces, cos they’ll be trendy dressers and well into dance music.’ Miss Nandy adds: ‘The only solution is to quit the manhunt and wait till after uni when you’re back amongst normal people.’ In another photo casebook, she appears to advocate smoking marijuana before writing an essay. A male student is pictured smoking a ‘spliff’ to ‘calm his essay crisis’, then gets a first for his essay. Miss Nandy adds: ‘Before the anti-drugs lobby gets straight on my case, I am not about to advocate getting caned before a deadline.’ In another column, a third-year student asks for advice on how to hit on first-year students. Miss Nandy says: ‘.  .  . you could try pulling in the Union when Red Bull and vodka is on special – it works for me.’ Last night the MP claimed her columns were meant to be humorous and did not reflect her personal views. She said: ‘This was a spoof piece published by my student newspaper over 13 years ago.

Andrew Mitchell has made an official complaint over police leaks as they have run a 'dishonest and illicit' campaign to destroy him . The Cabinet Minister forced to step down over the ‘plebgate’ affair has accused police of a sustained ‘dishonest and illicit’ campaign to destroy him. Former Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell launched the attack after a press report suggested an official Scotland Yard inquiry has dismissed his claim that police lied about being insulted by him. He accused Scotland Yard of leaking the information in an attempt to clear Downing Street police, who claimed he called them ‘f****** plebs.’ In a letter to Deborah Glass, deputy chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, he said: ‘I would like to lodge an official complaint to the IPCC.’ He added: ‘This was an enquiry into a dishonest and illicit attempt to blacken my name and destroy my career. 'It would appear that this police enquiry continues precisely that process. I am deeply dismayed that the Metropolitan Police appear to have leaked part of their report prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service .  .  . and spun it to the advantage of the police officers involved.’ Mr Mitchell’s response came after press reports that Scotland Yard’s inquiry into the row found no conclusive evidence that Downing Street police lied or tried to frame him. Mr Mitchell has apologised for using bad language when asked to take his bicycle via a side entrance at the Downing Street gates last September. But he has always claimed that police fabricated claims that he called them ‘f****** plebs’. It led to his resignation as Chief Whip after it was leaked to the press. But the row flared again last week when the Metropolitan Police sent the results of a three-month investigation into the affair to the CPS. The former Chief Whip has written to Deborah Glass, deputy chairman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission. He argues that the police attempted to destroy his career . It is understood to conclude there is no proof of a conspiracy by the officers to smear or destroy Mr Mitchell’s career. The saga took another turn when, hours after receiving the Met’s file, the CPS said it was unhappy with the quality and quantity of the evidence. Weeks after being forced to resign in disgrace, Mr Mitchell became convinced that he was the  victim of a police conspiracy after new evidence appeared to cast doubt on the claims against him. About 30 detectives have taken statements from all  800 officers in the diplomatic protection group as part of  Operation Alice, the codename for Scotland Yard’s ‘plebgate’ investigation. However, it is understood that Operation Alice has found no evidence to corroborate  Sutton Coldfield MP Mr  Mitchell’s allegation. He has always claimed that police fabricated claims that he called them 'f****** plebs' when he was asked to use a different entrance last year (pictured) Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis, a close ally of Mr Mitchell, said last night: ‘It is not for members of the Metropolitan Police to decide on their own case, and it is certainly not for them to attempt to spin themselves out of trouble.’ Criticism: Keith Vaz said the Met police should not have investigated its own officers . Former Tory leader Michael Howard said: ‘I am concerned about the leaked report. ‘It should not have put into the public domain. If leaked by the police – and there are indications that this is the case – it is utterly deplorable.’ Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, said the latest development showed it was wrong for Scotland Yard to lead the inquiry into its own officers. He called for the whole investigation to be taken over by the IPCC. Scotland Yard is trying to discover how two national newspapers obtained information about the 'Plebgate' row and if it came from police. It is also looking at a police officer's claim to have witnessed the altercation and allegations by Mr Mitchell that police had lied in a log of the event. Three officers from the Diplomatic Protection Group have so far been arrested as part of the investigation. All three remain suspended. Papers related to the case were passed to prosecutors on Thursday, but the CPS said it was not 'a full file of evidence' and more is expected . ""We now await the conclusion of the police investigation before considering charges,"" it said in what was seen as a rebuke to the force.","Lodged a complaint to the Independent Police Complaints Commission .

"Lightning only ever strikes during heavy 'vulcanian' or 'plinian' explosions when the . amount of red lava is low . By . Nick Mcdermott . PUBLISHED: . 12:23 EST, 19 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:38 EST, 19 March 2013 . Streaks of crimson lava soar hundreds of feet into the air as an erupting volcano puts on the most spectacular of light shows. But Mother Nature isn’t quite finished yet. She throws in blinding flashes of forked lightning, which crack the red-hot sky and show just the sort of fireworks she has at her command. Light show: Lightning emerges from lava erupting from the Sakurajima Volcano in the Kaghoshima area of South Japan in this picture taken by German photographer Martin Rietze . Rare: Lightning only ever strikes a volcanic eruption during heavy 'vulcanian' or 'plinian' explosions when the amount of red lava is very low . This awesome display of natural power . was captured by German photographer Martin Rietze, who waits patiently . for days in remote locations for exactly the right explosive moment. Scientists can’t quite explain how the . phenomenon of volcano lightning occurs. They believe . electrically-charged particles of ash disgorged during the eruption . somehow react with the atmosphere to create the forks of clear white . light. Mr Rietze, 45, spends his life in the . world’s volcano hotspots – travelling from Costa Rica to Italy – to . capture the grandeur of an erupting firestorm. This stunning photo of volcanic . lightning striking an erupting crater was taken last month at the . Sakurajima volcano near the southern tip of Japan. Waiting game: Patient Mr Rietze waited days before finally capturing the lightstorm images on February 25, 2013, at around 4.50am . ‘You have very few chances to catch . lightning close to an erupting volcano because it involves being very . patient and waiting for many days,’ Mr Rietze said. ‘I waited around four days for . Sakurajima. Knowing that very few people have ever experienced something . so beautiful gives a very special feeling. I will never ever forget . those moments surrounded by poisonous gas, feeling the heat of the . flowing and bubbling lava and hearing noises louder than a plane taking . off.  Sometimes your body can feel the shockwaves and the ground is . shaking.’ He shrugs off the dangers of being so . close to molten lava. ‘It’s great fun, and so unique. I have had fewer . mishaps chasing eruptions than when mountain climbing,’ he said. Drama: Volcanoes are an opening or vent in the Earth's crust. When gas and magma builds up under the surface it eventually erupts above the surface through this gap, spewing rocks, lava and ash . Danger: The lava can reach 1,250C and burn everything in its path. These flows are currents of hot gas and rock that reach temperatures of 1,000C and travel up to 500mph . Equipment: Mr Rietze shot the magnificent photos on a highly sensitive full format DSLR with a shorter (90-200mm) but very bright tele-lens . A volcano is essentially an opening or . vent in the Earth’s crust. When gas and magma – the hot fluid under the . surface – build up they erupt through this gap, spewing hot rocks, ash . and lava reaching 1,200C (2,192F). But when lightning follows, it is a . different type from that seen in thunderstorms. Dr Sue Loughlin, head of . volcanology at British Geological Survey, explained volcanic lightning . is still a natural mystery. ‘Lightning typically forms as ash . particles are charged through friction during eruption and dispersion in . the atmosphere,’ she said. ‘Ice particles in the atmosphere are also . involved. But scientists are unclear about the exact mechanisms.’","German photographer Martin Rietze captured these images near the Sakurajima Volcano in South Japan .

A U.S. Marine returning from a tour of duty in Iraq has been ordered to remove an American flag he's hoisted outside his Florida home. Gregory Schaffer says an anonymous complaint from a neighbor over the banner's pole has led to a citation from his town of Hypoluxo accusing it of being a code violation. 'It's sad. It's sad that we have to go through that just to fly a flag,' Mr Scahaffer told WPTV. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Violation: Marine Gregory Schaffer has been told he must take his American flag down from his front yard in Hypoluxo, Florida with the pole found in code violation . Policy: Mr Schaffer, who recently returned home from a tour of duty in Iraq, says his town's building department insist that he have a building permit for the pole . Mr Schaffer raised the flag to share a symbol of national pride in his town but the building department says that it must side with the neighbor. 'He can fly his flag, the issue is that he has to get a building permit,' Tim Large, who heads Hypoluxo's building department told WPTV. The flag pole he says is considered a structure, one the Marine doesn't have a permit for. 'I would love to see the guy be able to do this. To me it's not personal, it's strictly my job,' said Mr Large. But getting a permit is easier said than done, according to Mr Schaffer. Cited: Days after Mr Schaffe raised the flag in his front yard, seen, he received the citation from an anonymous neighbor . Because he's only renting the property he says he'll have to go through a third party contractor to submit an application. He says that could cost him nearly $1,000. 'It's disgusting that anybody should have to go through that. I fought for the flag, now I'm paying for the flag,' said Mr Schaffer. As for the neighbor who reported him, Mr Schaffer says he has mixed feelings on that matter. Outrageous: Mr Schaffer shows off the notice he received, informing him of his need of a permit which he says could cost him around $1,000 . Having served in the Marines he knows well the rights of freedoms given to all Americans, ones he personally fought to protect. 'I respect their right to be able to file a complaint and handle things the way they did. Do I respect what they did? No. I respect their ability to do so,' he said.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:42 EST, 30 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:42 EST, 30 March 2013 . Militant teachers put themselves on a collision course with the Government yesterday, calling for a boycott of school inspections and backing a spate of strikes. Delegates at the National Union of Teachers conference voiced their fury at school reforms introduced by Michael Gove. Several said the Education Secretary  had lost the confidence of teachers as delegates chanted: ‘Gove must go, Gove must go.’ Others said they had no confidence in Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw, whose school inspection regime is widely resented and blamed for raising teachers’ stress levels and suicide rates. No confidence: Delegates at the NUT  conference said that Michael Gove and Ofsted had lost the confidence of teachers through their school reforms . Delegates later confirmed plans by the NUT and the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers to hold joint strikes, starting with regional action in June and escalating to a national walkout in autumn. Teachers agreed to strike over pay and pensions this week, despite Mr Gove insisting that both issues were 'fixed'. Both the Education Secretary and the teachers' unions have refused to back down from the stalemate. At the National Union of Teachers annual conference, general secretary Christine Blower said: 'We are not rowing back... We have put these reasonable demands and we want to talk to him about them, not just have him send us a letter.' Still striking: NUT's Christine Blower, pictured last year, warned that teachers strikes will go ahead . She also rounded on Mr Gove for previously calling his critics ‘enemies of promise’. ‘I think people were astonished when Michael Gove used the expression ""enemies of promise"",' she said. ‘It seemed to teachers whom I have talked to about it that he has no idea what goes on in schools up and down the country. ‘If you’ve ever been into a primary or secondary school on a normal . working day, you will find teachers working extremely hard, even in the . face of Government interventions, and children being taught incredibly . interesting and exciting lessons.’ Her comments in Liverpool came after Mr Gove wrote to unions saying he was willing to meet but the 'direction of travel' on key issues was 'fixed'. The NUT and National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers last week announced rolling strikes from June 27, with a national walkout before Christmas. Speaking at the NUT annual conference in Liverpool today, general secretary Christine Blower warned Mr Gove that the unions stand firm in their position. This week, Mr Gove wrote to the NUT and the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) to say he was willing to meet the unions to discuss the issues, but insisting that the ‘direction of travel’ on both pensions and pay is ‘fixed’. Ms Blower said: ‘Negotiation is about sitting across the table having an exchange and listening to people. ‘What he’s saying is pay and pensions are done and dusted, and there’s no reason to talk about it. That’s not our view.’ The unions put a list of demands to Mr Gove, calling on him to suspend the introduction of performance-related pay, due to be brought in later this year, and to publish an evaluation of the Teachers’ Pension Scheme. Collective action: The strike will begin in the North West in June with further walkouts to follow during the autumn term with a national strike in December . Money woes: The two main reasons for the teacher walkout are the Government's controversial public sector pension reforms and plans to introduce performance-related pay (file photo) They also wanted him to ‘commit to genuine engagement’ by setting up a series of meetings to discuss the dispute. In his letter to the unions, Mr Gove said he would be ‘very happy’ to meet them, but he warned: ‘While I am happy to discuss any issue you have, I shall stress in advance that on changes to teachers’ pension and pay arrangements, the direction of travel is now fixed. In both cases, there has been full consultation with trade unions including the NASUWT and the NUT.’ In . her response to the letter, NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: . ‘This is a serious situation which requires a more measured response . than this display of arrogance and belligerence from the Secretary of . State. ‘As far as we are . concerned we remain committed to engaging in genuine discussions and our . original demands still remain on the table.’","Delegates at the NUT conference voiced their fury at school reforms .

Cashing in: Insurance tycoon Peter Wood (pictured) is set to pocket £175m from the £1bn flotation of his online venture Esure . The insurance tycoon who founded Direct Line and Sheilas' Wheels is set to pocket £175m from the flotation of his massively successful online venture Esure, it emerged today. Peter Wood, who is chairman of the company and owns 90 per cent alongside private equity backer Tosca Penta, will dispose of only part of his shareholding in the London market's biggest float so far this year. Stock in the initial public offering will be priced at between 240p and 310p, giving it a mid-point valuation of £1.15billion and enough for a place in the FTSE 250 Index. Mr Wood, who will remain Esure's largest shareholder, said today: 'We have worked hard for many years to make Esure a business that can compete at the highest level with confidence.' Mr Wood established Esure in 1999, after massive success with Direct Line, and also later founded women-focused car insurer Sheilas' Wheels as well as taking a 50 per cent stake in comparison website GoCompare. The 65-year-old entrepreneur's wealth was estimated at £500m by 2011's Sunday Times Rich List. In December, he vowed to keep all his wealth in Britain and to pay his full tax here when Esure floated. His comments came after it was reported some months earlier that he was looking at the possibility of moving his domicile to the Channel Islands as a means of easing his tax burden. But with the increasing disclosures of widespread tax avoidance by businesses operating in Britain, Wood made it clear he and his family want to lead by example by making their full contribution to the Exchequer. Wood is one of the few British financiers to emerge from the great financial panic with his business empire enhanced. When his partners Lloyds-HBOS ran into difficulty in the autumn of 2008, he moved quickly to rescue Esure from the wreckage using his personal wealth to buy back his shares in the group. ‘I am a British resident and intend to stay in the UK,’ Wood said in December. Business powerhouse: Mr Wood (pictured with Halifax chief executive James Crosby in 2000) established Esure in 1999 after enjoying huge success with Direct Line . Eye-catching: Esure was made famous by the late Michael Winner's 'Calm down, dear' television adverts . As a father of five daughters, Peter Wood did not need convincing that women are the safer drivers. Esure broke new ground in the British insurance market in 2005 by reaching out to women through the Sheilas’ Wheels brand, characterised by its three pink sequin-clad Sheilas (above) from Australia. The company has enjoyed phenomenal success in large due to the lower degree of risk. And as 95 per cent of policyholders are female, this has also minimised the price disruption caused by the recent introduction of a new gender-neutral pricing regime across the industry. He was also sharply critical of U.S. firms such as eBay and Google that make huge profits in UK and compete . with his online insurance site GoCompare.com but avoid UK tax. He urged the Government to create a ‘level playing field for online businesses’ in the UK. Wood is among the most successful figures in the global insurance industry. In an earlier life at Royal Bank of Scotland, he built Direct Line in 1985, which at its peak earnings power was estimated to be worth £10billion. He had done much the same in the US, where he has been a key figure at insurer Plymouth Rock. As someone who spends a considerable part of his business life in the US – in Boston and also has a home in Florida – Wood had no shortage of routes to avoid the net of British taxation. Following the IPO, Wood intends to remain chairman as well as being the largest shareholder. He is committing, however, that any chairman’s fees go directly into a charitable trust and he will be paying the full whack of income tax on any dividends that he receives in the future. Confidence in IPOs has been lifted by . the successful listing of housebuilder Crest Nicholson, which was . priced at 220p or £550million on February 13 and is now trading at 280p. The . Esure business, which was made famous by the late Michael Winner's . 'Calm down, dear' television ads, was created out of a joint venture . with the Halifax before Lloyds Banking Group sold its 70 per cent stake . in 2010. Wealthy: Mr Wood (seen here with Bob Dench, managing director of Barclays Insurance) has a estimated fortune of £500m according to 2011's Sunday Times Rich List . There were . 1.25million in-force motor policies and 500,000 home policies at the end . of 2012, helping the Surrey-based company to more than double pre-tax . profits to £115.5million last year. The . company's conservative approach to underwriting means 87 per cent of . its motor policy holders are over 30 years of age, while 98 per cent of . in-force home policies are located in areas considered to have low risk . of flooding. And as 95 . per cent of Sheilas' Wheels policyholders are female, this has minimised . the price disruption caused by the recent introduction of a new . gender-neutral pricing regime across the industry. The IPO, which will place between 35 . per cent and 50 per cent of shares in public hands, will raise . £50million towards paying down debt.","Esure Chairman Peter Wood will remain company's largest shareholder .

Children have been banned from a town centre at night under sweeping new police plans to crack down on anti-social behaviour. Police officers have been given the power to stop anyone under 16 from walking the streets in Barsley, South Yorkshire, after 9pm, and to take them home if they are not with a parent or responsible adult. The six-month dispersal order - which police said was introduced in the wake of reports of rowdy and abusive behaviour in the town centre - has been branded 'totally wrong' and a 'blatant infringement' of civil liberties by critics. No children allowed: Police in Barnsley can now stop children under 16 from walking around the town centre after 9pm . The order, which came into force yesterday and covers the hours between 9pm and 6am, also gives police the power to disperse groups of two or more people from areas where there is persistent anti-social behaviour. Any breach of a dispersal order, such as refusing to comply with being told to leave, is classed as a criminal offence. 'Abusive behaviour': Police said Barnsley residents have complained of feeling 'harassed and intimidated' Campaigners have warned that the ban infringes on civil liberties and said it amounted to treating groups of young people as criminals. Nick Pickles, director of Big Brother Watch, said a dispersal order was a 'blunt, crude tool' that, at best, moves the problem to another location nearby.'It is a sign that the police have lost control of the streets and yet does nothing to restore either the community spirit or respect for the law that has been lost,' he said. 'It's simple - if people break the law, harass people and cause distress then the police should arrest them. 'The idea that simply by being under 16 and in town is grounds for the police to take you home seems a waste of time and resources. 'To treat every group of young people as criminals is totally wrong and a blatant infringement on people's rights to move around Barnsley.'The campaign group Liberty has said dispersal orders 'blur the distinction between nuisance and criminal behaviour'. Inspector Julie Mitchell, from South Yorkshire Police, said: 'Over the past few months, we have received numerous reports of nuisance caused by large groups congregating in the town centre. 'The Barnsley Interchange has reported a number of nuisance behaviour incidents within their premises, and the County Way car park has been a regular venue for nuisance drivers late at night. 'Many interventions have been put in place and although some measures have had some success, nuisance behaviour still persists on an almost daily basis. 'The common theme that appears to cause the most concern is rowdy, inconsiderate and abusive behaviour,' Insp Mitchell added. 'This is often from people in large groups and has led to members of the public and business community reporting the feeling of being harassed and intimidated.' The officer said discretion would be used and that the force wants to encourage residents and visitors to go into the town centre for retail and leisure. 'By dispersing those groups intent on engaging in poor behaviour, we will ensure Barnsley is a safer and stronger town for everyone else,' she said.","Police can stop under 16s from walking streets after 9pm in Barnsley .

Rhino horn can reach prices of £50,000 a kilo - making it more valuable than gold or cocaine. On mission: The soldiers were taking part in Operation Rhino, a South African project to stop illegal rhino slaughter . It comes after three suspected poachers were killed last week in a shoot-out with rangers in the vast Kruger park, where the killing of rhinos is now rampant. So far this year, 188 rhinos have been poached in South Africa, 135 in Kruger alone. Last year, 668 were killed illegally in the country, a 50 per cent rise on the previous year. Illegal trade: The horn of an adult rhino, seen at a Johannesburg safari park, can reach prices of up to £50,000 a kilo . Surging demand from the Far East, where the horn is falsely believed to have medicinal value, is responsible. A defence department spokesman said the cause of yesterday’s crash is being investigated.

Disappointment: One cruisegoer was very unhappy when she realised that Gary Barlow, who apparently once been on the ship, was not aboard for her holiday . Unhappy with your luxury cruise? You might not want to make a fuss. Because now a disgruntled travel agency has revealed the ten strangest complaints their customers made in the last 12 months. Top of the list, compiled by bonvoyage.co.uk, was a woman who wanted a sound-proofed room because the noise of the Mediterranean kept her awake. She was closely followed by a newly wed husband who was furious that he wasn’t offered a private butler to bring him rose petals, strawberries and champagne. Third place went to the woman who moaned because she wasn’t sent a text prompting her to remember her passport. And one couple were miffed when the captain ignored their note saying they would be back two hours later than departure time – and left without them. A young woman on a Hawaiian cruise heard Gary Barlow had once been on her boat – and demanded to know why she hadn’t seen him. One man on a cruise around Alaska even wanted compensation because the weather was not as warm as he had expected. An elderly couple who went on a holiday around France and Spain asked for a refund because they weren’t provided with a packed lunch every day. And a woman on a ship called Celebrity Cruises asked for a full refund last summer because she didn’t see any celebrities on board. Quirky complaints: One woman grumbled to company Celebrity Cruises that she has not seen any celebrities on her holiday . Rounding off the list was a couple from Yorkshire who moaned that staff were so kind it cost them too much money in tips and a woman who wanted a sea view in her windowless cabin. Steph Curtin, from bonvoyage.co.uk, said: ‘The vast majority of feedback we get from holidaymakers is hugely positive, telling us what a great time they had, but from time to time we come across a few quirky complaints that we can do little to help. ‘Whilst we make sure we go back to every complaint, I’m afraid we can’t be held responsible for the sea being too loud or the lack of celebrities – as much as we wish we could put Gary Barlow on every cruise!’","Travel company revealed British cruise customers' quirkiest complaints .

Natalie Creane, who was recently put in a coma for the seventh time, desperately needs an operation . The family of a British woman who was left brain damaged after a wooden panel fell on her head in a seven-star hotel in Abu Dhabi fear she is 'dying before our eyes'. Natalie Creane, 34, had to be put in a medically induced coma this month for the sixth time to protect her against the severe seizures she has suffered since the freak accident in 2008. However, her family say without treatment costing millions of pounds her next seizure could be her last. They say she urgently needs specialist surgery at a neurological hospital in New York but they . cannot afford to pay for the treatment after receiving only £36,000 in . compensation. Mrs Creane, who has been intensive care more than 20 times in the past four and a half years, has recently come out of her latest coma at the Rashid Hospital in Dubai but her friends say 'every day she runs the risk of another major seizure.' Her parents Angie and Derick Smith said today they and Mrs Creane's husband Trevor have been left 'devastated' by her decline. Mrs Smith, 63, told the Sunday People: 'We've seen things no parents should see their child go through. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.' Mrs Creane's four-and-a-half year battle for justice after she was injured at the Emirates Palace hotel ended in Abu Dhabi Higher Claims Civil Court last month when she was awarded just a fraction of the £3.5million claim she lodged to cover the impact on her life. Since the accident, Mrs Creane struggles to walk and talk and cannot be left alone after the blow to her head left her suffering epileptic seizures and a traumatic brain injury. She has also had to give up her career in human resources. Scroll down for video . Mrs Creane can no longer work and her family fear she is 'dying before our eyes' Mrs Creane, from South Weald, Essex, was staying at the Emirates Palace in July 2008 to celebrate her engagement to husband Trevor, 43. She was alone in the room unpacking when a 2.2kg wooden panel, which was not fixed properly to the top of the wardrobe, fell on her head. She was found unconscious on the floor by a room attendant and was taken to hospital by car instead of an ambulance. Mr Smith, 65, said the impact of the panel, which fell 8ft, was equivalent to three bricks falling on Mrs Creane's head. Mr Creane, who has stayed in Dubai with his wife, said her 'injuries were horrific'. He told the Sunday People that immediately after the accident her eye was totally closed and her face was completely swollen. Mrs Creane was awarded just £36,000 after the panel fell on her head while staying at the Emirates Hotel, pictured . The 34-yer-old was celebrating her engagement to husband Trevor when she was injured. Since 2008 she has had to give up work and struggles with  speaking and reading and has been in intensive care 20 times . He said the hotel promised to investigate the accident after senior management met the couple in the days after her injury. He said: 'They were shocked. They sent flowers and assured us the incident would be . investigated thoroughly.' But, despite the assurances, the family say the compensation is not enough and are appealing to the verdict. The first appeal hearing will be held on April 17. The family set up a Facebook page called Justice for Natalie to highlight their story. An update on the page said Mrs Creane is beginning to recover after her latest coma. It said: 'It has been a slow recovery, probably as a result of her heart issues and auto immune disease. 'We are waiting to see about her surgery and the Radiation therapy she needs and the costs involved. A luxury bedroom at the Emirates Hotel. The Creane family are appealing their compensation award next month . 'We are desperately trying to keep her from catching another infection after her three bouts of Pneumonia this year, but her immune system is so bad now, it is extremely hard - this means visitors now are practically non existent with all the bugs going around. 'Her cognitive problems aren't good and she is struggling to eat, feed herself and has her usual problems with memory and walking/talking. 'As always she has good days and bad days. More recently since her deterioration this last year, she has much more bad days. Please continue to share this page and her story, we are so scared that we are running out of time for our Nat.' Mrs Smith said every day her daughter goes without the operation, the worse it becomes. She said: 'I'll do anything to get Natalie the help she desperately needs, to stop her from dying. But we are running out of time.'","Natalie Creane suffers seizures since being hit by a wooden panel in 2008 .

A Texas man who became the first person in the U.S. to receive a full face transplant recipient got married on Saturday to another burn patient that he met at a support group. Dallas Wiens, of Fort Worth, was severely injured in a bizarre construction accident in 2008 when he came into contact with a high-voltage power line. Jamie Nash, of Garland, nearly died in a car crash in Ennis in 2010. Her car erupted in flames, and she was trapped. She was severely burned on her hands, back and legs. Scroll down for video . Face transplant recipient Dallas Wiens, right, and burns victim Jamie Nash dance during their wedding reception in Forth Worth, Texas on Saturday . About 200 people attended the wedding at Ridglea Baptist Church, including doctors and nurses who had treated the couple . The couple, who got engaged last fall, exchanged vows Saturday morning at the Fort Worth church where Wiens was working when he was critically hurt. ‘I am blessed beyond measure that you have chosen me, and I love you with all of my heart,’ Wiens told Nash, reports The Dallas Morning News. Pastor Scott Cox says about 200 people attended the wedding at Ridglea Baptist Church, including doctors and nurses who had treated the couple. Cox says the couple told him they believe God brought them together. Wiens was painting the church in 2008 when he touched a power line. He suffered facial injuries and was blinded. In 2011 he underwent a full facial transplant at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Nash, 29, was burned over 70 percent of her . body in a one-car wreck in June 2010. Today she speaks at schools and . churches about the perils of texting while driving. The couple met in a support group at Parkland Hospital, where both were being treated. First dance: Wiens, who became the first in the nation to receive a full face transplant recipient after a 2008 power line accident, wed Nash, another burn victim he met at a support group, on Saturday . Wiens was walked down the aisle with his grandfather, Del Peterson of Fort Worth. A retired banker, Peterson accompanied Dallas through much of his recovery, including multiple flights to Boston. ‘He’s marrying someone who can share about their pain that they’ve gone through, and their recoveries,’ said Sue Peterson, Del’s wife. Until recently, Wiens lived with the Petersons. ‘They have fantastic attitudes about why they’re where they are.’ Escorted by her father, Nash wore a chiffon gown with a pink-lace bodice, off-shoulder sleeves and a plunging back that revealed the scars from her accident. ‘Things happened that I didn’t think ever could be possible for me, and you made them possible,’ Nash said. ‘You gave me hope, and you gave me tender love that I will always treasure.’ The wedding was followed by a reception at the Flying Saucer in downtown Fort Worth, where the couple made their entrance to Bruno Mars’ hit Just the Way You Are. The couple met in a support group for burn victims and started dating a couple of months later . Guests included church friends and people who’ve assisted Wiens and Nash in their respective recoveries, including Parkland staff. ‘I think their confidence in their healing process and getting better just made them a perfect match,’ said Ethan Gloger, a clerk in Parkland’s burn unit.Wiens' features burned away and he was left blind . Win's facial features were burned away and he was left blind after his head touched a high-voltage power line while painting the Ridglea Baptist Church in November 2008. He received a new nose, lips, skin, muscle and nerves from an anonymous donor, and has had more than 38 surgeries. However the transplant, which was paid for by the U.S. military, was . unable to restore his sight, and some nerves were so badly damaged from . his injury that he has partial sensation on his left cheek and the left . side of his forehead. Wiens pictured with his daughter Scarlett . before his horrific accident in 2008, and right his bride shows off her ring . Describing the first moment she locked eyes on him at the Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Nash said: 'I just looked at him from across the room, and there . was something about him'. This is the second marriage for both . Wiens and Nash. He has a 5-year-old daughter, Scarlette. Her children are 10-year-old Samantha and 6-year-old Lucas. Wiens, . who was previously married but filed for divorce before his accident in . November 2008, said he wasn't interested in getting into a relationship . at first. 'I had sworn off love and relationships,' he said. 'I had no desire to be in one whatsoever.' Then, on Christmas Eve, they talked all night and set up a date. 'We went to dinner and a movie, and that's all she wrote,' he said. The two said they have been together every day since. All in the past: The couple are planning to tie the knot at the Ridglea Baptist Church in Fort Worth, where Wiens' horrific electrical accident took place four years ago . 'I told him it's got to be love, because I'm not sick of you,' Nash joked. 'I know I've never felt more real than this.' The couple plans to put their pasts behind them. 'There's no reason to dwell on the past,' he said. 'It's dead and gone,' she added. 'It burned in the fire.' They said they make the perfect couple and help balance each other. Her hands, for example, were severely injured in her accident. His are fine. She can see. He lost his eyesight in the accident. 'It's a story of hope, a story of . true survivors,' Nash said. 'I mean, if we can do it, I guarantee you, . anybody out there - we all have a story. 'We're all going through . something.

The study forecasts that rising temperatures will lead to a massive 'greening' - increase in trees and shrubs - in the Arctic. Scientists have revealed new models . projecting that wooded areas in the Arctic could increase by as much as . 50 per cent over the next few decades. Exploring: The Arctic could soon become greener as temperatures warm and lead to an increase in trees and shrubs . The research shows that this dramatic greening will also accelerate climate warming at a rate greater than previously expected. Lead author Richard Pearson, a research scientist at the American Museum of Natural History's Centre for Biodiversity and Conservation, said: 'Such widespread redistribution of Arctic vegetation would have impacts that reverberate through the global ecosystem.' Plant growth in Arctic ecosystems has increased over the past few decades, a trend that coincides with increases in temperatures, which are rising at about twice the global rate. The research team - which includes scientists from the Museum, the University of York, AT&T Labs-Research, Woods Hole Research Centre, Colgate University and Cornell University - used climate scenarios for the 2050s to explore how the trend is likely to continue in the future. Flora and fauna: Research shows that this dramatic greening will also accelerate climate warming at a rate greater than previously expected. The scientists developed models that statistically predict the types of plants that could grow under certain temperatures and precipitation. Although it comes with some uncertainty, the researchers said such modelling is a 'robust' way to study the Arctic because the harsh climate limits the range of plants that can grow, making this system simpler to model compared to other regions such as the tropics. The models reveal the potential for massive redistribution of vegetation across the Arctic under future climate, with about half of all vegetation switching to a different class and a massive increase in tree cover. For example, in Siberia trees could grow hundreds of miles north of the present tree line. Doctor Pearson said: 'These impacts would extend far beyond the Arctic region. 'For example, some species of birds seasonally migrate from lower latitudes and rely on finding particular polar habitats, such as open space for ground-nesting.' Research: The team includes scientists from the American Natural History Museum (pictured) The researchers also investigated the multiple climate change feedbacks that greening would produce. They found that a phenomenon called the albedo effect, based on the reflectivity of the Earth's surface, would have the greatest impact on the Arctic's climate. When the sun hits snow, most of the radiation is reflected back to space. But when it hits an area that's 'dark' - covered in trees or shrubs - more sunlight is absorbed in the area and temperature increases. This increases climate warming as the more vegetation there is, the more warming will occur. Co-author Scott Goetz, of the Woods Hole Research Centre, added: 'By incorporating observed relationships between plants and albedo, we show that vegetation distribution shifts will result in an overall positive feedback to climate that is likely to cause greater warming than has previously been predicted.' The findings were published in the journal Nature Climate Change.","Rising temperatures will lead to an increase in trees and shrubs in the Arctic .

This is the shocking moment when a footballer appeared to make a Nazi salute on the pitch. AEK Athens midfielder Giorgos Katidis raised his right arm after scoring the winning goal in his side's 2-1 Super League win over Veria in Greece yesterday. He was banned from all Greek national teams for life by the Hellenic Football Federation for the action, which said the action was ‘a profound insult to all victims of Nazi atrocities’ and condemned it ‘unequivocally and categorically’. The Federation said in a statement: ‘The player's action to salute to spectators in a Nazi manner is a severe provocation, insults all the victims of Nazi bestiality and injures the deeply pacifist and human character of the game.’ Katidis was heavily criticised on social media for the celebration, although he later insisted he did not know the meaning of the gesture. He was said to have claimed that he was pointing to team-mate Michalis Pavlis, who is recovering from injury, in the crowd. Katidis said on Twitter: ‘I am not racist in any way. I abhor fascism. I would not have done it if I knew that it meant something. I know the consequences and would not do it ever.’ Scroll down for video . Arm raised: Katidis (centre) celebrates the goal during a Super League football match against Veria yesterday . Amazed: Giorgos Katidis's Brazilian-born team-mate Roger Guerreiro (left) looks at him in astonishment . The Federation said the ban was a unanimous decision from its executive committee who met after the incident at the Athens Olympic Stadium. AEK have demanded an apology from the player and said the board would meet to decide his future. But the club’s German coach Ewald Lienen backed Katidis. ‘He is a young kid who does not have any political ideas. He most likely saw such a salute on the internet or somewhere else and did it without knowing what it means,’ he said. AEK are in 10th place in the table with 29 points from 26 games. Veria are fourth from bottom. Katidis has played for Greece's Under-17, U19 and U21 teams, but has not been capped at senior level. He was captain for the U19 side and . joined the club from Aris Salonika last year after impressing in . Greece's run to the final of the European Under-19 Championship where . they lost to Spain.

Jewish residents of Thessaloniki yesterday went to the city’s Freedom Square to mark the day. David Saltiel, leader of the city's Jewish community, said: ‘The commemoration is an honor for the city of Thessaloniki. But some people look upon this era nostalgically and are bringing back the old Nazi symbols.’ He was referring to the emergence of the extreme right-wing Golden Dawn, a party with neo-Nazi roots that swept into Parliament for the first time in June on an anti-immigrant platform amid the country’s financial crisis.","AEK Athens midfielder Giorgos Katidis raised his right arm yesterday .

A friend of Pedro Quezada, 44, told the New York Daily News: 'He said he’s going to pay the rent for everybody here on this block for at least a month or two months. He’s such a good guy.' Bodega owner Quezada has become well-known for his generosity in Passaic, New Jersey, where the immigrant moved from the Dominican Republic 26 years ago. Joy: Pedro Quezada, the winner of the Powerball jackpot, talks to the media during a news conference . Windfall: Powerball winner Pedro Quezada has pledged to pay rent for his whole block in Passaic, New Jersey for a month or two . Neighbor Richard Delgado, 45, reacted happily when he heard of the new millionaire's promise. 'God bless him, and thank you,' Delgado told the Daily News. Another man in the block in School Street, Passaic, said the people in street rarely saw Quezada and his Mexican wife, Ines Sanchez, as they worked so hard. 'He’s somebody who needs it, not like the people who had millions already and won it,' Cheech Rivera, 57, said. Rivera explained to the Daily News that the couple didn't attend summer block parties. 'They struggled. They are always constantly working,' said Rivera. 'They don’t really have time to get together with us.' Winners: He was joined by his wife Ines Sanchez, center, to talk about their plans for spending the money . Mr . Quezada earlier said that he will buy his wife 'whatever she wants' with the money. He has settled the $29,000 he owed in child support. This was claimed before Quezada collected his huge winnings. Quezada was joined by Sanchez, when appeared at a New Jersey Lottery . press conference in Lawrenceville on Tuesday afternoon to talk about his . shock at the massive payout, and what he intends to do with it. 'I will help those in need,' he vowed in Spanish, adding that he was planning on buying 'a good car - the one I like'. He said he would no longer be working at the bodega he has owned in Passaic, New Jersey for seven years, and will insist that his 23-year-old son, who runs the store, will quit the job as well. 'With all those millions, would you allow your children to work in a store like that?' he said. Mr . Quezada, who has another son, 15, and three daughters, aged five, 10 . and 17, joked that he would continue to pay the lottery despite his huge . winnings. But he said he . was also wary of people around him who may want to take advantage of his . new-found riches, and declined to give the name of his hometown in the . Dominican Republic. Kind-hearted: Quezada said he has not decided on the specifics, but hopes to help people in need . 'You have to be careful, some people aren't good people,' he said. '[My life] has to change because it's so much money, but it will not change my heart.' He was vague about where he plans to go next, but said he might buy property in New Jersey, the Dominican Republic or Mexico. Mr Quezada also detailed the moment he discovered he had the winning ticket. He had previously been caught celebrating on camera after learning about his win at Eagle Liquors. 'The store is located on the way to my . deli store so when i saw the commotion outside I figured maybe the . winning ticket was purchased there, so that's why i stopped,' he said. 'When the gentleman checked, he said, ""Congratulations"".' Only when he saw himself and his wife on television did he realise it was real, he said. His . wife, to whom he has been married for nine years, said she thought her . 'heart wanted to come out of my chest' when her husband called her with . the news. 'I had no words,' she said. 'All I can say is I feel very happy because God has blessed us with this prize.' Mr Quezada took the winnings as a lump sum, which came to $152 . million after taxes. Federal tax is 25 per cent of the payout, and the . state gets another six per cent. The moment of discovery was captured by the swarms of media gathering in the store. 'We . won! We won! We're not gonna be poor anymore!' he told his mother as he . spoke on the phone in Spanish after discovering the massive win, the New York Post reported. 'I can't believe it. I'm overwhelmed. I was praying so much for this,' he added to the Daily News. Celebration: Mr Quezada said he will be quitting work, buying a new car and helping the community . Riches: If he chooses to take a lump-sum payment, Mr Quezada will get $152 million after taxes . Stunned: The bodega owner and 44-year-old father of five discovered he had the winning ticket in the shop . He said he hopes to help people with the money, and his son said his father will continue to work. 'He's going to stay here doing what he loves to do,' Casiano Quezada told The Star-Ledger. Quezada, who lives in a shabby third-floor apartment on a block next to a highway, began working in a factory after arriving in the U.S. 26 years ago. In . 2006, he opened his own bodega, which is run by his son Casiano, 23. But he chooses to play the lottery at Eagle Liquors because he never . applied for a license. Casiano . told the Post that he was working at the bodega when his father called . with the good news - but that he initially didn't want to close the . store because he didn't want to lose business. Joy: His son, Casiano Quezada, smiles while talking to members of the media inside Apple Deli Grocery . Change ahead: Quezada (pictured with a friend) runs the bodega, which his father has had for seven years . Worker: After the win, the younger Quezada didn't want to shut the store because of losing business . Devoted: Casiano Quezada closes early on Tuesday. He said his father will continue working despite his win . Neighbours . added that the family, including Quezada's wife, Ines . Sanchez, were rarely seen, and they assumed it was because they worked . so much. Eladia Vazquez, who has lived across the . street from Quezada for the past 25 years, described the coupe as 'quiet and not overly . talkative' but sensed that they seemed to be working all the time. 'This is super for all of us on this block,' she said. 'They deserve it because they are hardworking people.' Quezada's wife Ines added: 'We're hardworking people. We always struggled.' Quezada said he had not yet decided what to do with the money but knows 'I'm going to help a lot of people, whatever they need'. He has three daughters, aged five, 17 . and 10, and two sons, a 15-year-old and 23-year-old Casiano. He also has . five brothers and two sisters.

Success rates for the detection of burglaries are as low as 12 per cent in the areas where forces are giving out flowers, including London and west Mercia. Victims told The Sunday Telegraph that while they appreciate the thought, they would rather that police focused on solving their crimes. Nice thought: Police have been giving bouquets of flowers to people who have been burgled or mugged . The Met has sent out 300 bouquets in the north London borough of Barnet since November, including one to 55-year-old Sarah Miller. She had two laptops, a camera and other valuables stolen from her home. The day after the burglary Mrs Miller received a card apologising as the lack of evidence made it unlikely that her crime could be solved. But the following day she received a £25 bouquet of flowers as well as a £5 voucher for the florist that donated them. Victims: The success rate for detection of burglaries or robberies is as low as 12 per cent in areas where the flowers are being given out . Mrs Miller said that although the flowers are lovely, she would rather the police used their resources elsewhere. She said: 'Don't get me wrong, it was nice to receive them, but the thought that went into that could have gone into solving the burglary. 'I'd rather they'd have sent a community officer to comfort me after it happened rather than fobbing me off with flowers.' Last year in London there were 55,693 residential burglaries, with only 12.5 per cent of them being recorded as solved, slightly below the national average for England and Wales of 13 per cent. Police say that the gesture is meant to soften the blow of hard to solve crimes . A spokesman for the Met said: 'Giving someone glowers helps soften the blow and shows we are there to support them. We have found that just that simple gesture helps start up a dialogue with victims and helps them begin to feel safe again.' Lancaster based flower wholesaler iFlorist donates 16 bunches a week free of charge. They aim to increase their business while providing the flowers to people who have been through a hard time. The West Mercia police force is also giving out flowers to victims as part of a local initiative started four years ago. The flowers are paid for by the proceeds from the sale of unclaimed property, and contributions from officers and the public.","Sending bouquets to victims of unsolvable burglaries and muggings .

The controversial new NHS ‘111’ helpline will launch tomorrow with thousands of inexperienced staff who have carried out only half the required training, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Question marks: The new NHS non-emergency helpline 111 is due to go live on Monday despite concerns raised by the British Medical Association . Staff were supposed to receive two weeks training, work for a month, and then undertake a further two weeks training. But due to the last minute influx of new call handlers, recruits have not been given the second half of their training. An NHS recruitment manager responsible for two major trusts said: ‘The whole project has been rushed. It’s a shambles and lives are going to be put at risk. ‘Staff are paid £16,000 a year, have no medical background and are expected to help distressed, unwell people on the phone. They are woefully unprepared.Up and down the country it is the same.’ Dr Kailash Chand, deputy chair of the British Medical Association, said: ‘I fully believe the new system will suffer these problems because the government is cutting costs. ‘According to the NHS service specification the cost per call for NHS 111 should be £8, almost a third of what NHS Direct costs. Harmoni has won more than a quarter of contracts to operate the 111 service . ‘The launch needs delaying until it is safe for the public.’ The use of NHS 111 for non-urgent calls is a flagship Coalition health policy. The system is intended to lower the health budget by replacing the £123 million-a-year NHS Direct. Staff ask the caller a series of questions and enter the answers  into the NHS Pathways program. The software judges whether the patient needs emergency help. An NHS spokesperson said: ‘NHS England is working with local commissioners and giving them more time to rectify this issue.

"By . Tim Shipman and Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:03 EST, 28 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:10 EST, 28 March 2013 . Former Labour spin doctor Damian McBride will reveal the secrets of the inner workings of the Brown operation . Damian McBride, the Labour spin doctor who resigned over a smear scandal, is to publish his memoirs – presenting Ed Miliband with a fresh headache. The book, which promises the truth about plots that tore the party apart during the Blair-Brown years, will coincide with the Labour conference in September. Mr McBride is the first member of Gordon Brown’s inner circle, which also included Mr Miliband, to publish details of how they seized control of the party. The book is expected to reveal Mr Miliband’s behaviour in the dying days of the last government and will be scrutinised for material critical of the Labour leader. The timing of the announcement is a second blow to Mr Miliband after his brother David quit British politics admitting he could not work for him. Mr McBride – known as ‘Mad Dog’ by his allies and ‘McPoison’ by his enemies – resigned in April 2009 after emails he wrote smearing senior Tories. His book, Power Trip: A Decade of Policy, Plots and Spin, will lift the lid on Mr Brown’s government and his rows with Chancellor Alistair Darling during the financial crisis. Mr Darling famously accused Mr Brown and Mr Balls of unleashing the ‘forces of hell’ in a briefing  against him. In a statement yesterday, publishers Biteback said: ‘It is a book which will send shivers down the back of the Labour establishment as it reveals the truth about life within Gordon Brown’s government. Mr McBride was at Gordon Brown's side for a decade, before being forced to quit in 2009 over plans to smear Tory MPs with false rumours . ‘[Mr McBride] writes candidly about his experiences at the heart of government, and provides the first genuine insider’s account of Gordon Brown’s time as Chancellor and Prime Minister. ‘He reveals the personal feuds, political plots, and media manipulation which lay at New Labour’s core, and provides a fascinating, funny, and at times shocking account of how government really works.’ A Labour source said: ‘Under Ed Miliband’s leadership, the party has moved a long way from those days. We have turned a page.’ The decision to break cover four years after he quit will fuel talk in Westminster that Mr McBride is seeking to clear the air and make a return to frontline politics. He took aim at David Miliband earlier this week, claiming ‘timidity’ had held back the former foreign secretary. Mr MCBride has used a blog to reveal the inner workings of the Brown administration, which have become a must-read for journalists and MPs. The memoir, due to be published during the autumn Labour conference, will lay bare the extraordinary feud between Gordon Brown and Tony Blair in the battle over who should be Prime Minister . Just yesterday Mr McBride took a . swipe at David Miliband, who announced he was quitting British politics . two and a half years after losing the Labour leadership contest. Mr . McBride said Mr Miliband failure of nerve had stopped him from moving . against Mr Brown before the last general election: 'His huge moment was . 2008 but we monstered him because of his timidity.' The memoir is likely to make for . uncomfortable reading for Mr Miliband, who worked alongside Mr Brown and . Mr McBride in the Treasury before becoming an MP but has sought to play . down his links with the former PM. Ed . Balls, Labour’s shadow chancellor, was also a close ally of Mr McBride . but sought to distance himself after the communications chief was forced . to quit in 2009. Mr . McBride gave a flavour of life working for Mr Brown last year in a blog . post on the former PM's infamous temper. He wrote: 'There are two . phrases that every former Gordon Brown staffer got used to hearing when . he couldn’t hide his exasperation with them any longer. The memoir is expected to make for uncomfortable reading for Labour leader Ed Miliband and shadow chancellor Ed Balls, who were both close aides to Mr Brown before becoming MPs . 'The . first – delivered slowly and usually punctuated with a pounding fist on . the back of a chair – was “Too. Many. Mistakes.” The second – delivered . in a strangled growl, usually at the person he wanted to murder on the . spot – was: “I NEED NEW PEOPLE”.' Iain . Dale, the former Tory blogger who is now managing director of . publishers Biteback, said: ‘I have absolute confidence in predicting . Damian’s book will be seen as the political memoir of the year. ‘I’ve been chasing this book for at least eighteen months and am delighted to have persuaded Damian to put pen to paper. ‘Everyone . knows from his blog that Damian is a brilliantly incisive writer and . that he was in a unique position to expose what being at the centre of . power in the Brown government was really like.’ After being cast out of the Labour . fold, Mr McBride has used his blog to give a brutally honest account of . the Brown regime’s failings. Mr . McBride said: ‘Given that Iain Dale was one of my supposed enemies when . I was working in Downing Street, he was the last person I expected to . be working with, but his thoughts on what this book should be about . exactly matched my own, and I am delighted to be publishing it with him. ‘I . hope that, like my blog, this book will be a chance not only to give my . account of what happened during Gordon Brown's time in office, but also . to give an insight into what life is like for those working in . government today.’ Royalties . will be split between the Catholic aid agency Cafod, where Mr McBride . now works, and the appeal by his former employers Finchley Catholic High . School to build a new sixth-form centre.","Damian McBride plans to releases his book on the eve of Ed Miliband's major party conference speech .

Haunting: Boys accused of misbehavior were held in the mausoleum like building at the Florida reform school . Eerie: The unmistakeable bloody hand print on the wall betrays a violent past . Chilling: One boy had written his name and the unexplained note '19 times' Former students spoke out several . years ago with horror stories of sexual abuse and frequent beatings in the White House, at the school in the Florida Panhandle city of Marianna. MyFoxOrlando showed disturbing footage from inside the prison-like building. One room has a bloody handprint smeared on the painted walls and a number of other stains. Another room has haunting graffiti with the names of boys who were interred in the school. One marking has the name Ellerbe and an unexplained note of '19 times' The school was legend among . adolescents for about 100 years in Florida, as the state's major reform . school, until it was closed in 2011. Abuse: Former students spoke out several years ago with horror stories of sexual abuse and frequent beatings in cells at the White House . Reminders: One room has several stains from earlier times . Victims: Boys that were held at the Dozier school left their mark behind . Bodies discovered in a once-secret graveyard at the reform school could be now be dug up after calls for federal funding for a forensic investigation into the site. Dozens of unmarked graves have been found on the property after years of allegations of abuse and children dying in mysterious circumstances. Soon investigators could digging up that past. Investigators are trying to determine . the circumstances surrounding the deaths, which experts say probably . occurred between 1914 and 1952. State officials have for years . insisted that 31 boys were interred in a tiny cemetery on the grounds of . the notorious reform school. Horrors: Crosses mark graves at a cemetery at . Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida. Investigators have said . they had found at least 50 graves on the grounds . Scene: Former students spoke out several years ago with horror stories of sexual abuse and frequent beatings in this mausoleum-like building dubbed the 'White House' Investigation: Researchers believe that 96 boys died at the school and expect to find more burial sites . But now, using high-tech search . equipment, forensic scientists have already found evidence of at least . another 19 bodies buried under the site - and fear there could be many . more. 'We really don't know exactly how . many, or who they are,' said Erin Kimmerle, a forensic anthropologist at . the University of South Florida. She has a scroll-like map of spots . around the school's grounds where her ground-piercing radar has spotted . evidence of human remains. Some boys died under unknown circumstances, according to relatives. Institution: Dozier was opened as a state reform school in January 1900 for misbehaving boys . Treatment: The boys were allegedly forced into hard labour, while others were beaten, raped or killed . Culture: A memorial or burial service around 1950. More than 20 students' burials were undocumented . In December, researchers from the . University of South Florida in Tampa said they found evidence of at . least 50 graves on the school's property. In 2009, writer Roger Dean Kiser published The White House Boys - An American Tragedy detailing the horrors he experienced while incarcerated at Dozier School for Boys. He was sent to the reform school in 1959 when he was 12, and suffered brutal, bloody beatings in the infamous White House building. 'Little did I know that America had its own concentration camp for little boys right here in the good ole U.S. of A,' he wrote. 'A devil was hiding behind every tree, every building and even behind every blade of manicured grass.' He writes on his website: 'The terrible screams I heard and the brutal beatings I witnessed as a 12 year old will remain in my memory forever. 'The beatings I suffered are not my horrors today. My horrors are the beatings of crying boys that I had to witness before my own beatings. The horror of knowing that I was next. 'The thick concrete walls and the loud . industrial fan easily muffled the horrible screams of the boys as they . were beaten bloody. Some were carried to the hospital in wheelbarrows . and some had to have their underwear or pajamas surgically removed from . the buttocks. 'For almost thirty minutes, at age sixty-two, I stood alone in the exact room where I was almost beaten to death. With my heart racing and the side of my neck pulsating, I lit a cigarette and I cried without feeling shame.' They also found more grave shafts in . and around an area called 'Boot Hill', which rises across a major . highway from the high, razor-wire-topped fences of the closed school. There could be even more victims, but . researchers do not have access to records after 1960 because of privacy . laws, and overgrowth on the grounds has hindered them from full . searches. Dr Kimmerle said: 'All the focus on exact numbers is not really the issue. 'Whether it's one or 20 or 40 or 60, we are talking about a child and families that are asking for information.' Dozier School was closed in June 2011 . by the Department of Juvenile Justice after a years-long controversy . over widespread physical and sexual abuse. Previous investigations and lawsuits . have been brought by the 'White House Boys' - so called because of the . name of the squat, whitewashed building where much of the abuse took . place. A group of former students sued the . state in 2010, but their case was dismissed as the statute of . limitations had expired. Other students have written books about their . experiences. Following the claims, researchers at . the University of South Florida in Tampa used ground-penetrating radar . and soil samples and now believe there are many more bodies buried there . than previously reported. The largest gravesite is on the . northside of the campus, where African-American boys were buried. It is . at this site where the 31 graves are marked with white crosses, but . researchers believe they do not correspond with actual burial sites. 'We anticipated finding about 25 to 30 . grave shafts,' said Christian Wells, an assistant professor of . anthropology who led the anthropological work at the site. 'But in fact . we found a minimum of 50.' Discovery: University of South Florida radar research shows burial sites do not correspond with the crosses . Dozier's own records show that more . than 50 children were buried on the grounds, while more than 30 other . bodies were sent elsewhere to be buried. But the school failed to record burial . locations for 22 other children who researchers learned died on the . site, the Miami Herald reported in December. Some of the children - and two adults - . died in a fire and influenza outbreak in the early 1900s, while others . were reported to have suffered from ill health or physical traumas . Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi and other state officials are now seeking a court order to allow the remains to be exhumed. The U.S. Department of Justice has a . programme that could provide up to $3million for a thorough forensic . sifting of the burial areas, said U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Democrat, . who toured the site yesterday. A $200,000 appropriation is already pending in the state legislature. School grounds: Scientists believe there are bodies buried in wooded areas and unmarked graves .

A party at a gaming conference featuring women wearing skimpy clothes while dancing on stage has caused several high profile female industry figures to speak out about what they say is the unacceptable level of sexism that still persists within their field of work. The Game Developers Conference is a four-day event, held in San Francisco, which is the largest annual gathering of professional video game developers. It finished on Friday and the issue dominating much of the event was that women working in the industry have had enough of being demeaned and objectified by their male counterparts. Brenda Romero, disgusted by the dancing . girls at an event co-organized by the International Game Developer’s . Association, promptly resigned her position as co-chair of it's Women in . Games group via Twitter. Taking a stand: Meagan Marie, left, and Brenda Romero, right, have both spoken out this week about the overt sexism that still exists within the gaming industry . Dancing girls: Women in skimpy clothing are apparently still acceptable at gaming industry events in 2013 . 'Two women walked up to me this morning with tears in their eyes and thanked me,' Romero wrote in a follow-up tweet. 'Now I have tears in my eyes.' The IGDA, a non-profit organization, has acknowledged that some of the performers' outfits were inappropriate, reports Business Insider. 'We regret that the IGDA was involved in this situation,' read an IGDA statement. 'We do not condone activities that objectify or demean women or any other group of people.' She wasn’t the only woman determined to take a stand against sexism within the industry. On Tuesday, Meagan Marie, who works for Crystal Dynamics who make games including Tomb Raider, also took a public stand against the sexism she had had to endure at PAX, a gamers conference the previous week. Gender equality has become a hot-button issue in Silicon Valley, especially on the heels of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's 'Lean In' Marie is known for organizing 'cosplay' events where gamers dress up in costumes. Many video games depict women in revealing clothes and so some of the costumes were sexy. Unfortunately, blogged Marie, some men think that gives them the right to be vulgar or aggressive. 'The situation this weekend at PAX made . me question why I'm willing to stand up for others, but not myself. By . allowing myself to be treated this way I'm perpetuating that this . behavior is acceptable. 'And it isn't. If I continue stand by silently, I . might as well sit on the sidelines and watch while other young women . endure what I have. 'The treatment and representation of women in gaming has come to a head . this past year, and I know some of you are tired of hearing about it. I'm tired of living it. Adria Richards was fired from her job at tech company SendGrid after sending this tweet alleging sexual innuendos from several men at a California conference . Richards attended the popular SXSW conference in Austin, TX earlier this month . 'I want to feel safe and valued as a member of . this industry, whether I'm conducting an interview, talking to fans on a . convention floor, or cosplaying. And I have a right to that,' she wrote.

A South Carolina mother has been arrested after allegedly slapping a young boy she mistook for her son before apologizing and knocking her actual son to the floor. Spartanburg County sheriff deputies say Tyshekka Collier, 36, walked into Fairforest Middle School to pick up her son who was being suspended when she slapped the child who was waiting to go home sick. Principal Ty Dawkins told WYFF that that mistaken boy was sitting with his head down when he was abruptly hit on Wednesday morning. Not playing: Police say Tyshekka Collier, 36, slapped a boy she mistook to be her son on Wednesday before apologizing and knocking her actual son to the floor . Fortunately, he says, when Collier realized she had slapped the wrong child she immediately apologized. But once seeing her actual child in the room, the arrest warrant says she went over to him and slapped him across the face and head too, knocking him to the ground. 'I believe he was more scared than stunned over anything else,’ said Mr Dawkins of the mistaken boy’s reaction. 'But still this is the kind of behavior that you don't need to do to anybody, even to your own children,' he said. Big mistake: Fairforest Middle School's principal said that the mistaken boy was sick and waiting for his own mother to pick him up when Collier walked into the office and hit him . Collier was charged with disturbing school and assault and battery. It wasn't known if she had a lawyer. '...in speaking with the parents and all the interviews that were done -- the two charges for the assaults and disturbing school, we felt were the most appropriate means to go with,' Mr Dawkins added. Collier’s three children are in now protective custody.","Boy was waiting to go home sick when police say Tyshekka Collier walked up and slapped him across the face .

A boy aged three has had his first ever haircut so his two-foot-long locks can be made into a wig for children with cancer. Little Elijah Edney has raised more than £1,000 in sponsorship to pay for the wig to be made. His mother, Amber Edney, 27, let Elijah grow his hair how he liked - but it got so long people started to mistake him for a girl. Scroll down for video . Ready for the chop: Little Elijah Edney's hair has never seen scissors since he was born, but now it is being cut and made into a wig for young cancer sufferers . Haircut: Elijah sits happily in the barber's chair as his 2ft-long hair finally gets the scissors treatment . Getting shorter: Elijah's verdict on his new haircut after his 30-miute cut? 'I love it', he said . Mrs Edney had washed and dried his hair daily, spent hundreds of pounds on shampoo and conditioner, and dedicated hours to brushing it. But his new ear-length cut, with smart centre-parting, should be much easier to maintain. The football-mad youngster today looked relaxed as he sat on booster seats in the barber's chair at M Cutting in Portsmouth, Hants. Hairdresser Mike Walters, 79, tied Elijah's hair into a ponytail before snipping it off at the start of the 30-minute cut.

Mrs Edney, a dinner lady, was also thrilled with the result. She said: 'You wouldn't have thought it was his first hair cut - he's been so calm and I think he's enjoyed it. Short haircut: Elijah sports a new look as he proudly shows off his shorn locks which his mother says she is going to keep to that length . 'I'm so pleased that he's been smiling and laughing throughout. I was worried that he wouldn't like it. I'm so happy with the result, he looks very smart and I'm over the moon that he loves his new look too.' Elijah's shorn hair will go to the Little Princess Trust, which makes wigs for children with cancer and other hair-loss illnesses. His mother added: 'I can't believe the response we have had from friends, family, and members of the public - it's been fantastic. 'The initial target was to raise £350 . so that a wig could be made with his hair. Now that we've raised over . £1,000 hopefully the Little Princess Trust can make more than one wig. ''It's going to such a great cause and I'm sure that the wig will change a young person's life. 'I . couldn't bear to see all Elijah's beautiful hair go to waste and my mum . mentioned about charities that use human hair to make into wigs. 'Elijah keeps telling people he is giving his hair to poorly princesses and he was so excited to get it done.' Before the cut, Mrs Edney showed the barber a picture of her other son Beau, six, who has the hairstyle Elijah wanted. She added: 'He was so excited this morning and couldn't wait to have his hair cut. He looks up to his brother.' Mother and son: Amber Edney says Elijah wanted to look like his older brother, Beau .

"By . Eleanor Harding . UPDATED: . 13:37 EST, 29 March 2013 . The head of the NHS should resign over the 'deeply questionable' decision to suspend children's heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary, it was claimed today. Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS's medical director, is under fire for his decision which came just a day after plans to close the unit were quashed in the High Court. The hospital was forced to close the unit yesterday after data emerged suggesting it had a death rate twice the national average. NHS bosses are conducting an internal review of the data, which is expected to . last several weeks. Leeds General Infirmary was forced to close its children's heart unit after data emerged showing an unexpectedly high mortality rate . The hospital is at the centre of a . long-running row over the future of its children's heart services and . critics have questioned the timing of the closure - just 24 hours after a High Court judge declared the decision-making process to close the children's unit was 'legally flawed'. But the report's author today warned that the findings were only 'preliminary' and needed further validation. And today, Dr John Gibbs, chairman of the steering . committee for the Central Cardiology Audit Database (CCAD), which . supplied the data, said the mortality figures were preliminary and had . not undergone the 'usual rigorous checking process'. 'I'm absolutely furious,' he said. 'This data was not fit to looked at by anyone outside the committee. 'It was at a very preliminary stage and we are at the start of a long . process to make sure the data was right and the methodology was correct. 'We would be irresponsible if we didn't put in every effort to get the data right.' Dr Gibbs said the 'ground-breaking' study involved complex analysis which would require at least two months to validate. A problem had already been identified with the figures, he added, with some data being incorrectly discounted from results. Speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme this morning, Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of NHS England, defended his controversial decision. He said the figures were among a . 'constellation of reasons' behind the suspension and there were . 'rumblings' among the cardiac surgical community for some time that 'all . was not well' in Leeds. Conflict: Sir Bruce Keogh's decision to close the unit came just 24 hours after Mrs Justice Nicola Davies ruled further consultation was necessary . He . said: 'On Tuesday, I had two phone calls which I found disturbing, both . from highly respected temperate surgeons who commenced the . conversations by saying they had to speak out.' One raised concerns about the . referrals process at the hospital and the other spoke to him about . staffing levels, Sir Bruce said. That was followed by preliminary data . on mortality that was 'considerably' higher - around twice the national . average - than any other unit. A campaigner fighting to keep children’s heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary said she felt ‘sick’ when she heard it had been suspended to allow a review of death rates. Stephanie Ward, 45, has been campaigning for several years to ensure the Infirmary remains open after her three-year-old son Lyall received treatment there that saved his life. She said: 'I first heard the news last night and I was extremely shocked, especially as it came the day after the High Court scrapped the plans to close it. 'I felt sick when the story broke. Heart surgery isn’t like having your tooth out, it’s one of the worst things a family could possibly ever go through. 'Leeds was declared safe in all wards recently and to close the infirmary based on unsubstantiated evidence and flawed material stinks, to be honest. 'The judge at the High Court lambasted the proposal to close the infirmary, but this latest setback has left us in shock,' she said. Ms Ward was pregnant with Lyall, who has Down’s Syndrome, when he was diagnosed with a heart condition. In January 2010, he had corrective open heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary. 'Without it, he would have died, no doubt about it,' she said. 'Luckily for us he’s OK now, but this ward closing means families will have to  go to Newcastle or Liverpool, which are over an hour away.' He added: 'I couldn't do nothing. I . was really disturbed about the timing of this. I couldn't sit back just . because the timing was inconvenient, awkward or would look suspicious, . as it does.' It is understood the alarm was raised when auditors spotted that the mortality rate in the department was higher than expected. There were also suspicions that the LGI was not referring complex cases on to other centres with better expertise - such as the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle. And on Sunday, it was revealed an unnamed . surgeon - only one of four in the department - had been suspended while . 'aspects of his practise' were investigated. The hospital admitted the consultant was already under an earlier restriction from carrying out certain procedures. But Greg . Mulholland, MP for Leeds North West, said he was 'stunned and appalled' by the suspension and called for Sir Bruce to resign. The MP said he understood the medical . director of NHS England and senior members of the Care Quality . Commission arrived at LGI yesterday morning to demand that children's . heart surgery cease. In a . statement on his website, Mr Mulholland said: 'To have arrived in Leeds . and done this, without warning, just one day after the decision to close . the Leeds unit was proved in a court of law to have been unlawful . beggars belief. 'I believe that Sir Bruce Keogh should . resign as he has both authorised this wholly unreasonable and deeply . questionable action and also presided over the fundamentally flawed Safe . and Sustainable review, which has proved an exercise in how not to . effect major change to the NHS.' The . department is already under pressure after it emerged on Sunday that . one of its senior surgeons has been banned from operating. It also narrowly escaped closure on Wednesday when Mrs Justice Nicola Davies ruled further consultation was necessary. Yesterday's review was ordered after hospital bosses met with officials from NHS England and the Care Quality Commission. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said it would be 'independently validated' and supported by external experts. NHS England said the closure was taken as a 'precautionary step' to ensure the safety of child patients. Sir Bruce added: 'Some questions have been raised by the trust's own mortality data and by other information. 'It is important to understand that while this information raises questions, it does not give us answers. 'But it is absolutely right not to take any risks while these matters are being looked into. 'The priority must be the safety of children.' There were also suspicions that the LGI was not referring complex cases on to other centres with better expertise - such as the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle (pictured) Stuart Andrew, Conservative MP for Pudsey, told BBC Breakfast that the situation was 'all very odd'. He said that the day after the High Court Judgement had ruled it was unlawful to take heart surgery away from Leeds, Sir Bruce Keogh had been up to the hospital and surgery had been suspended. He added: 'We have always asked ""is it safe at Leeds"" and the answer has always been yes.' He also questioned the reliability of the data indicating high mortality rates. It has also emerged that surgeons who . were performing congenital heart surgery over the period the mortality . figures relate to have since moved on, and are working at units in other . parts of the country. The . Trust is currently contacting all families whose children were due to . undergo heart treatment at the hospital to make alternative . arrangements. Maggie Boyle, chief executive of the . Trust, said: 'This will look at all aspects of congenital cardiac . surgery for children undertaken at the unit in Leeds. 'We . have taken the decision to temporarily pause children's congenital . cardiac surgery and associated interventions while this review is . conducted, a process we would aim to complete in around three weeks. Children who were due to undergo heart treatment at Leeds will now have it at other centres . 'We apologise to parents and families who will be affected during this time, and can assure them we always put the safety of our patients first. 'It is really important to us that the review is done as speedily and comprehensively as possible which, of course, we hope will show the services in Leeds to be safe.' Last year, the Children's Heart . Federation said it had 'major concerns' about standards of care at . Leeds, claiming some babies had been sent home to die and called for an . investigation following feedback from parents. The . safety of children's heart surgery at Leeds was also raised two years . ago with the Care Quality Commission health watchdog when a report found . there had been 20 'excess' or unexpected deaths over eight years to . 2008. Leeds is one of three children's heart units to be closed after a review in the wake of the Bristol heart scandal in the Nineties in which 35 babies died and dozens more were left brain-damaged. It sparked a change in the way mortality rates in hospitals are monitored, especially in cardiac care. In recent months, a huge legal campaign, backed by publicity, has been mounted to keep heart surgery at Leeds following last year's Safe and Sustainable NHS review, which recommended all surgery be transferred to better-equipped Newcastle. But a number of independent experts have spoken in favour of closure, stressing there were 'serious issues' at the unit.","Department forced to close after data emerged showing high death rates .

"By . Emily Davies . PUBLISHED: . 11:11 EST, 31 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:40 EST, 1 April 2013 . More than 8,000 motorists in the UK are driving despite having picked up enough penalty points to be banned from the roads, it emerged today. Drivers who collect 12 points on their driving licence should face an immediate ban. But shocking figures obtained from the DVLA show a staggering number have escaped disqualification and are legally driving around despite exceeding the limit. More than 8,000 motorists in the UK are driving despite having 12 points on their licence, which should lead to an immediate ban . This is because courts can a rule that a motorist who faces losing their licence could face ‘exceptional hardship’ and escape a ban. Incredibly, one unnamed motorist from Warrington, Cheshire is driving around after racking up a total of 36 points - three times the disqualification figure. And there are three individuals with 33 points and another driving around with 30. The eight drivers with more than 30 points on their licences come from Greater London, Colchester, Southend, Romford, Oldham, Huddersfield and Doncaster. Points can be put on a driver's licence for a variety of motoring offences, from speeding to drink driving and they stay on a driving licence for up to four years. Bans can last between six months and two years for those who have more than 12 points on their licences and if a driver is banned for more than 56 days they must apply for a new licence before being allowed back on the roads. There are 33 drivers who have more than double the amount of points required to get disqualified - 19 of these have 24 points. Points can be put on a driver's licence for a variety of motoring offences, from speeding to drink driving . The DVLA said they have no say in how sentences and bans are imposed on drivers. A spokesman said: ‘The DVLA's role is to record the information provided by the courts. ‘The courts are able to use their discretion to decide whether or not to disqualify a driver. However, the statistics are likely to include cases where drivers have served their period of disqualification and successfully reapplied for their driving licences.’ The Magistrates' Association, which represents magistrates in England and Wales, said about 30,000 drivers a year reach the 12-point mark with nine per cent of these escaping disqualification. They also said in some instances drivers with a large amount of points may be ‘anomalies’ who have benefited from poor communication between organisations. Drivers with 12 points or more claim 'exceptional hardship' to dodge losing their licences with an automatic ban . A spokesman said: ‘The Association has previously written to the Transport Minister about communications failures between HMCTS, DVLA and some fixed penalty offices which resulted in inaccurate driver records and the possibility that courts did not have full details of a driver's history in front of them. ‘There's a problem that the DVLA have no way of recording exception hardship on their computer system we're hoping that they will change this when they revamp their computer system.’ Peter Rodger, chief examiner and head of driving standards from the Institute of Advanced Motorists said drivers who are close to 12 points need to improve their driving. He said: ‘It's difficult to turn around and say there's a direct danger caused by it but on the other hand it is also the case that if everyone thinks this is what happens then the respect for the rules of the road and for obeying the law on the road will be removed. ‘If you're in the position where you've got points on your licence and the next set of points are going to take you into the realms where you would expect a ban then you need to sort your driving out, you shouldn't be behaving like that. ‘There isn't a good reason for people to be behaving like that.’ In total the figures revealed there are 8,099 drivers with 12 more or penalty points on their driving licences. CR00 - Croydon - 6,855 . SL06 - Slough - 5,884 . LE02 - Leicester - 5,874 . NG05 - Nottingham - 5,204 . ML06 - Motherwell - 5,114 . LE03 - Leicester - 4,989 . BN03 - Brighton - 4,773 . BN02 - Brighton - 4,711 . WA05 - Warrington - 4,559 . CF14 - Cardiff - 4,499 . This is a slight decline from 2011 when there were 10,000 drivers who could have been banned but were not. However the Institute of Advanced Motorists said it has become easier for motorists to keep their licences when they have 12 points. Mr Rodger added: ‘It does appear that that has become more flexible than it used to be. The grounds on which people are allowed to retain their licence do appear to have been relaxed. ‘I don't think there's been a sudden relaxation but it's one of those things that has gradually happened over time.’ There are more than 3.3 million road users in the UK who have penalty points on their driving licences. Figures from the DVLA show more than 2.5 million have picked up in excess of three points. Motorists in Croydon are the worst behaving, with 6,855 drivers living in the CR00 postcode having penalty points and one motorist racking up 24 points. Following Croydon are small areas of Slough, Leicester, Nottingham and Motherwell, who all have more than 5,000 drivers with points on their licences. Rodger said the total number of drivers with points on their licence ‘indicates how endemic our misbehaviour has been.’","Drivers claim 'exceptional hardship' to dodge losing their licences .

As arguments over marriage equality rage on in the nation’s capital a striking new map shows how many of the nation's people may already have taken a stand in its favor. The social media world went red this week according to a newly released map by Facebook that showed an overwhelming increase in users swapping out their profile pictures, many for pink-on-red equal signs. The Human Rights Campaign urged people on Monday to change their Facebook profile pictures to the sign to show their support of marriage equality in the midst of the Supreme Court's hearings over two potentially nation-changing cases. Changed: Facebook saw an overwhelming 120 percent increase in users changing their profile pictures from the previous week, with the most user's counties seen in brighter red . Seen it? This is the original pink-on-red profile photo the Human Rights Campaign urged marriage equality supporters to place on their Facebook page this week . By Tuesday Facebook reported a 120 percent increase in profile picture changes from the previous Tuesday. It was approximately 2.7 million people to be exact according to the social networking site. 'While millions of U.S. Facebook users update their profile photos on a given day, we found that significantly more users -- roughly 2.7 million (120%) more, updated their profile photo on Tuesday, March 26 compared to the previous Tuesday,' they wrote with their findings. The trend did not signify that all of those millions specifically switched to the pink-on-red equal sign, however. But they say the exact timing and irregularity suggest a substantial correlation. 'We find that the increase in uploads . does indeed start around the time when HRC began urging their Facebook . followers to change their profile photos at 1 p.m. EST,' they wrote. Rise: This graph shows that when the Human Rights Campaign urged supporters to change their profile photos at 1pm, where the dashed vertical line is seen, a major rise was immediately seen in Facebook updates . In a graph showing the change, users' profiles can be seen drastically updated compared to the previous days just after a dashed vertical line that marks the HRC's 1pm statement (see above). Among those who swapped during this time were also to have certain demographics in common. Most were around 30 years old, slightly more were women, and the users generally updated their profile more often than others. Geographically the top 25 counties showing a change were . also in college towns, the most active being Ann Arbor Michigan's . Washtenaw County, home to Michigan State University. Others included the counties of the . University of North Carolina, Duke University, Indiana University, . University of Iowa, Ohio University, University of Wisconsin, University . of Coloraddo and the University of Texas at Austin. Symbols: An assortment of users' personalized red and pink equal sign profile photos are seen after collected by the Human Rights Campaign . San Francisco and Washington D.C. - where HRC is headquartered - also ranked highly while Los Angeles, Chicago and New York City had only slight increases. An overwhelming region of the country that showed less activity than others on the map were parts of the southeast, commonly known as the Bible Belt. 'Standing in support of marriage equality on social media, and bleeding the Internet red, sends a powerful message to the community -- particularly LGBT youth -- that the majority of Americans are on the right side of history,' HRC said in response to Facebook's results on Friday. 'For a long time, when people stood up for a cause and weren't all physically standing shoulder to shoulder, the size of their impact wasn’t immediately apparent,' Facebook wrote in close of their report. 'But today, we can see the spread of an idea online in greater detail than ever before.'","The Human Rights Campaign urged Facebook users to change their profile pictures to red equal signs to show their support of marriage equality .

The eight-year-old daughter of Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky who was found dead at his UK home has paid tribute to her father saying he was 'an inspiration' to her and had a 'joy for life'. An inquest heard this week that the 67-year-old was found lying on the floor of the bathroom at his home in Ascot, Berkshire, on March 23 with a ligature around his neck and a cause of death was given as 'consistent with hanging'. His daughter, Arina Berezovsky, said in a statement released through Thames Valley Police: 'I didn't know my dad very well but what I am sure of is that he really loved his family and that he was always happy around his children and grandchildren. Boris Berezovsky with his ex girlfriend Elena and two children Arina, then eight-years-old and Gleb, who was six in 2003 . An inquest that the 67-year-old was found lying on the floor of the bathroom at his home in Ascot, Berkshire with a ligature around his neck . 'His life was a turbulent roller-coaster with never-ending ordeals, and I admire the way in which he handled them with utter grace, control and most commendably honesty. 'Unfortunately, honesty does not 'cut it' in this corrupt world and is often mistaken for being manipulative; which my dad was not. 'He had a certain joy for life, which was beautifully refreshing, and never took anything he had for granted. 'His all-consuming determination for justice will be an inspiration to me for the rest of my life and I aspire to one day have half the courage he did when standing up for his beliefs; even if he had to stand alone. Mr Berezovsky fell out with Russian President Vladimir Putin and often feared for his life . 'My hopes for him now are that he is at peace and that he is happy.' The inquest opened on Thursday by Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford was adjourned until a date to be set. Mr Berezovsky fell out with Russian President Vladimir Putin and often feared for his life - prompting speculation in Britain and Russia over the manner of his death. Even though police said they have found no evidence that anyone else was involved, it has not stopped widespread speculation. Specialist officers in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear substances examined the country mansion in Mill Lane before declaring it safe. Officers said they are speaking to the Russian's close friends and family to build up a picture of his state of mind in the last days of his life. It is thought that he was having serious financial difficulties after paying out astronomical sums in legal fees over the last few years, and wanted to return to Russia. His eldest daughter, Elizaveta Berezovskaya, 43, an artist who grew up in Moscow but now lives in Surrey, described her father this week as 'one of the greatest men of our time' who she is sure 'has left some surprises'. Speaking just days after his death, she told the Independent on Sunday he did no favours in the UK by not explaining his past. The oligarch lost a multibillion-pound High Court battle with Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich . She said: 'He is one of the greatest people of our time. 'We . will have to wait quite a time to fully understand what he was, as you . do with great men. 'I'm sure he has left some surprises. In court: Chelsea Football Club's Russian owner Roman Abramovich . The oligarch, who last year lost a multibillion-pound High Court battle with Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, could have run up more than £100 million in legal bills since 2011. In July 2011, he paid out Britain's biggest-ever divorce settlement to his ex-wife, Galina Besharova. Reports suggested the deal was worth more than £100 million. He later built up fees totalling more than £250,000 after becoming embroiled in a case at the High Court with his former partner, Elena Gorbunova, who sat at his side throughout much of his battle with Mr Abramovich. Mr Berezovsky emigrated to the UK in 2000 after falling out with Mr Putin. In fear for his life, he sought political asylum in the UK and moved to the South East, buying upmarket properties in London's Knightsbridge and in Berkshire. The businessman survived a number of assassination attempts, including a bomb in his car which decapitated his chauffeur. He became a vocal critic of Mr Putin's rule in Russia, where he had become a wanted man. In 2006 the Kremlin accused foreign-based opponents of fatally poisoning former KGB spy-turned-dissident Alexander Litvinenko. It was thought that Russia was in part referring to Mr Berezovsky, who denied the allegation and accused Mr Putin of personally being behind Mr Litvinenko's death from radioactive polonium-210 poisoning.","Arina Berezovsky released a statement through Thames Valley Police .

This morning we revealed the sensational news that an animal sanctuary had trained owls to deliver the mail in a development worthy of Harry Potter. The innovation could revolutionise how our postal system works - but don't get too excited, because now that midday has passed it's time to come clean and admit that it was in fact an April Fool's joke. While the pictures may have looked convincing, the clue was in the name of the reporter - 'Nesta Vowles' is, sadly, not a real person. Prank: The Mail reported that owls had been trained to deliver the post just like in Harry Potter . In full flight: But unfortunately these amazing pictures were mocked up - there's no Roy-owl Mail yet! But the Mail was not the only newspaper to pull the wool over its readers' eyes - many of our rivals also played along with the spirit of the day. The Guardian roped in its editor Alan Rusbridger to announce the launch of 'Guardian Goggles', a parody of Google glasses which apparently allows its users 'to see the world through the Guardian's eyes at all times'. The jokey story pokes fun at the left-wing newspaper's reputation for earnest commentary, saying the device is useful 'because life's too short to think for yourself'. The Daily Express revealed that austerity had even hit the Royal Family, with Buckingham Palace renting out its Belgian Suite to wealthy tourists for £10,000 a night at Hotels.com. Guests will supposedly be allowed to join the Royals at breakfast 'for an all-you-can-eat buffet selection' - but they will be strictly forbidden from accessing the Palace's wine collection. A wizard idea: But perhaps the hoax was too close to J.K. Rowling's hit Harry Potter series . Revolutionary: But it might take some time for owls to displace traditional methods of postage . The Daily Telegraph took a political tack, claiming that theatre impresario Sir Cameron Mackintosh was about to launch The Coalition: The Musical, by German composer Olaf Dyliparos. The composer supposedly told the paper: 'It focuses very much on the relationship between David Cameron and Nick Clegg and it has a big, operatic feel to it – I mean, it's a sort of love story that's gone wrong.' And The Times made a literary joke with its April Fool's gag as it announced the discovery of a cache of papers belonging to Captain Jasper Speedicut, who supposedly fought in all of the British Empire's major battles. The paper linked the adventurer to Harry Flashman, the fictional hero of George MacDonald Fraser's popular series of novels. Parody: The Guardian poked fun at its own earnest reputation with 'Guardian Goggles', inspired by Google . The Daily Mirror's prank story will send a chill down the spine of nervous flyers, as it announced the launch of a glass-bottomed plane allowing Virgin Atlantic passengers to watch the world go by during their flight. The paper reported that planes would be diverted over Loch Ness to survey the spectacular scenery - and provided a clue to the story's purpose by saying that 'more glass floor jets will be introduced from April 1, 2014'. On its website, the Mirror indulged in a second joke by allowing users to apply 'Instagram-style filters' which change the look of the homepage. The filters included a vintage MS-DOS look, a mirror image of the Mirror page, and a 'drunk' view to replicate the experience of trying to read the paper after a night out. Filter: The Daily Mirror introduced Instagram-style viewing options to its online homepage . Showbiz: The Sun roped in Jodie Marsh to help it trick its readers this April Fool's Day . For its own April Fool's jokes, the Sun turned to the world of showbiz and roped in model Jodie Marsh to play a prank on readers. The tan addict announced that her brown skin was thanks to 'Tanseal', a new skin product from Ronseal, better known for its DIY wood stains. Another Sun story reported that the Rolling Stones had gone on a camping holiday (at the 'Rolf Apilo' campsite) in order to prepare for the rigours of headlining Glastonbury this summer. Online news site The Huffington Post flexed its Photoshop muscles to post a picture of 'The Shlide', a helter-skelter slide newly built around the Shard skyscraper in London. And venerable leftist magazine the New Statesman joked that it would adopt the hated Comic Sans font to celebrate its 100th anniversary, describing the typeface as 'jaunty, fun and frolicsome'. Sniffing it out: Google Nose, where users can search the 'Aromabase' for smells and then inhale through their computer and phone screens, was launched on April 1 . Google is always an enthusiastic participant in April Fool's Day, and this year posted a number of pranks including Google Nose, supposedly a scent-based search engine. YouTube, the video site owned by Google, announced that it was shutting down after the conclusion of its eight-year quest to find 'the best video in the world'. And users of Google Maps were today allowed to apply a 'treasure' filter to their browsing, rendering the world in an antique style. Twitter also made a major announcement, revealing that it would start charging $5 a month for irs users to be allowed to use vowels.

Daniel Maddox, a father of one who was very well known in skiing circles, was killed after a vast wall of snow fell from 1,000ft above him. The force of the impact swept the 41-year-old into a gully in Glen Coe in Argyll on Saturday, burying him under 13ft of snow and rock. Tragedy: Daniel Maddox, a 41-year-old father of one, was killed after a vast wall of snow . fell from 1,000ft above him on Saturday afternoon. He is the 14th person to die on Scotland's mountains this year . Rescue teams fought for hours to free Mr Maddox of Tillicoultry, Clackmannanshire, who had gone off- piste, away from the official ski area, when he got into trouble. His body was pulled from the snow yesterday morning, making him the 14th person to die on Scotland’s mountains this year. Mr Maddox’s parents, Barbara and John, were too upset to speak last night. His 14-year-old son Luke was also coming to terms with the tragedy. Colin McPhail, owner of Footworks sports shop in Edinburgh, where Mr Maddox worked as a ski technician, paid tribute to the extreme sports addict. ‘Danny loved skiing more than anything and he was hugely respected within the skiing and snowboarding community,’ he said. ‘No one would have been better prepared to deal with an avalanche,  he was incredibly experienced. ‘It is very sad and he will always be remembered for his gentleness and approach to life. God rest his soul.’ Emergency services: Rescue teams fought for hours to free Mr . Maddox who had gone off- piste, away . from the official ski area, when he got into trouble. His weight triggered an avalanche 650ft wide . Mr Maddox was a close friend of Finlay Mickel, a Scottish winter sports star and one of Britain’s fastest downhill skiers. Mr Mickel raced for Scotland in the 1980s and, after retiring, worked for Glencoe Ski Club and as a ski technician and teacher. He was also skiing at the Glencoe centre on Saturday, when the risk of an avalanche was officially given as  ‘considerable’. But Mr Maddox went off piste, leaving the safer designated ski slopes, which are regularly maintained and patrolled, to go it alone. It is believed his weight triggered an avalanche 650ft wide. A male friend skiing on a different slope above Mr Maddox escaped unscathed. Scrambled: An RAF Lossiemouth helicopter is pictured helping in the search on Saturday and Sunday . A team of rescuers was scrambled to the area, close to the Glencoe Ski Centre, at 1pm on Saturday, where they began a desperate search. John Grieve, leader of the Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team, said: ‘The avalanche came down into a gully well over 60ft in depth, so the snow was very deep and compressed. ‘It had turned to ice and had a lot of boulders in it to dig through, which is why the rescue went on for so long. Glencoe Mountain Rescue said the avalanche travelled about 1,000ft down a rocky face of a slope . An RAF Lossiemouth has been helping rescuers with the search effort, which continued into Easter Sunday . Harsh conditions: The search focused on an area 'off the piste' near to the Glencoe Ski Centre . ‘We found Daniel’s gear, his hat and gloves, so we had a good assumption of where his body would be but had to abandon the search overnight on Saturday. The next day we located his boots and dug him out.’ By the time the search resumed at 8am yesterday, it was known Mr Maddox would not have survived. It was a recovery operation for the 50-strong team from Glencoe and Lochaber mountain rescue teams, Northern Constabulary and a rescue helicopter. Mr Grieve added: ‘It was a pity it was such a sad outcome but that is the way it is with avalanches – not many people survive them. I knew Daniel when he was young and he was a vastly experienced skier. He knew the risks of skiing off-piste.’ Off-piste skiing, also referred to as . 'back country' skiing, involves the use of unofficial slopes which are . not patrolled or maintained. Mark . Fulton, 25, from Gourock, Inverclyde, was skiing all day with his . family on the slopes at the Glencoe Ski Centre and saw the rescue . mission unfold. 'I was . up there from about 10am and at lunchtime we went in to get something to . eat at the cafe and we saw an emergency helicopter hovering about,' he . said. 'It looked as . though it was coming in to land near the bottom of the hill. When we . were leaving later I saw police and mountain rescue vans all gathered as . well. Members of Glencoe Ski Club said they were devastated by the news. One, who did not want to be named, said: ‘Danny was the one who taught me to ski, he was a great teacher. We all went out onto the mountain today because it’s what he would have wanted. ‘He wouldn’t have wanted anyone sitting in their armchair at home, even after what happened to him. Skiing was what he really loved.’ Earlier this year four climbers were . killed in an avalanche on Bidean Nam Bian, a mountain which is about 10 . miles from Glencoe Ski Centre. Hospital . doctor Rachel Majumdar, 29; PhD student Tom Chesters, 28; Christopher . Bell, 24, also a PhD student; and 25-year-old junior doctor Una Finnegan . are thought to have fallen 1,000ft in the incident on January 19. Yesterday, two men were airlifted off . Ben Nevis after becoming stranded half way up by icy conditions. They . were wearing ‘inappropriate footwear’, rescuers said. Lochaber Mountain Rescue team has issued warnings to those using the so-called ‘tourist track’ on Ben Nevis to take care.","Daniel Maddox was killed after a vast wall of snow .

A neighbour of the museum on Paris's Left Bank alerted police after hearing a whirring sound at 3am. The target of the attack, an African elephant skeleton, was given to the Sun King by Portugal's king in 1668. It lived in the zoo at the Palace of Versailles for 13 years until its death, when its skeleton became part of the natural history collection. The tusks of the skeleton were added in the 19th century but are still historically and scientifically valuable. Louis XIV, the Sun King, was given the African elephant by the king of Portugal in 1668 . The museum opened as usual on Saturday but the damaged skeleton was covered in plastic wrapping while repair work began.

Police officers are pocketing more than £20million a year in personal injury claims. They are instructing ‘ambulance-chasing’ lawyers to sue over mishaps on duty such as slips, trips and animal attacks. Officers are being encouraged to make the claims by a hotline run by the Police Federation. Much of the £42million paid out over the past two years is taxpayer-funded. WPC Kelly Jones, left, is suing burglary victim Steve Jones, right, after she tripped on a 6in kerb at his garage, pictured, while investigating a break-in . Solicitor's letter . In a case that has caused uproar, a policewoman is suing the man who dialled 999 to report a burglary because she tripped over a kerbstone at his property. Kelly Jones, 33, is seeking a five-figure sum for injuries to her leg and wrist last August. She was well enough however to carry on the search for the suspected intruder. Steve Jones, the garage owner who made the 999 call, said: ‘How can anyone feel safe calling the cops if they size you up for compensation while they’re fighting crime? ‘Surely policing has elements of both public service and risk. Isn’t that what officers sign up for when they put on the uniform – chasing villains and keeping us safe?’ Recalling the incident, the 50-year-old businessman said: ‘I thought nothing of it – other than she must have been a bit embarrassed – and I helped her up. Then we carried on with the search.’ Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, demanded urgent Home Office guidelines on the issue. ‘This civil claim will have huge implications for every citizen if they call police out to their premises to help them in an emergency,’ said the Labour MP. ‘It is in the public interest to know . where exactly people stand in circumstances like this. If there are . going to be cases like this, then people will feel reluctant to call the . police in case they are sued. ‘I . do not think in such circumstances the public would feel they had a . responsibility for health and safety issues, in the middle of the night . while apparently facing danger. ‘It’s a bizarre case and we need some urgent guidelines from the Home Office.’ WPC Jones has hired a London firm to sue Mr Jones, claiming he failed to keep her safe as she investigated the suspected break-in at the Nuns’ Bridges service station in Thetford, Norfolk.She was in hiding at her parents’ home in Thetford yesterday. The mother-of-two, who is divorced from a police officer, declined to comment and suggested that reporters dial 101, the police non-emergency number. She took the legal action without informing her employers at Norfolk Constabulary and is now on sick leave over an unrelated medical condition which requires an operation. Her claim makes 11 allegations against Mr Jones including that he failed to turn the lights on or warn her of the kerb. The officer said she injured her left leg and her right wrist in the fall, although she was well enough to continue the search at the time. Mr Jones is accused of failing to ensure the officer was ‘reasonably safe’ and of failing to ‘carry out an adequate risk assessment’. WPC Jones tripped while investigating the break in at the Nunns Bridges Service Station in Thetford, Norfolk. Owner Steve Jones said it is example of the 'fallacy that someone is to blame for every accident' The legal letter, from Pattinson Brewer solicitors, concluded that the 999 call-out exposed the officer to an ‘unnecessary risk of injury’. But the garage owner said: ‘If an officer can now sue you because they’ve tripped over on your property what does that mean for the average homeowner? ‘If you hear a burglar downstairs, do you have to nail down your stair carpet, close the windows and put the lights on before you dial 999? ‘This is the health and safety culture at work, the fallacy that someone is to blame for any and every accident and that compensation is free.’ The Police Federation, which represents 131,000 frontline officers, said the safety of its members came second to public service. However it actively promotes the claims hotline on its website, which links its members to personal injury lawyers. The service is open to officers and their families to claim for injuries on or off duty at no cost to themselves. Applicants can choose from a ‘menu’ of claims including accidents at work, animal attacks, professional negligence, public liability and slipping and tripping. Keith Vaz, left, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, has demanded urgent Home Office guidelines while Norfolk MP Norman Lamb, right, said the Thetford case was unacceptable . These are passed to a specialist personal injury lawyer who fights their case at no cost to the officer whatsoever. Many . potential claims appear to be aimed at officers suing their employer . over issues such as defective equipment or training accidents. The firm behind the scheme says it aims to ‘maximise compensation’ for officers. Norfolk MP Norman Lamb said the Thetford case was unacceptable, adding: ‘I think most people would regard it as quite bizarre that an officer acting in the course of their duties would pursue a claim against a member of the public who has legitimately called them out. ‘It is preposterous to imagine that it is appropriate; it is the police doing the job they are employed to do.’ Paul Ridgway, of Norfolk Police Federation, said WPC Jones’s claim was forwarded to lawyers, regardless of the organisation’s views. He said: ‘All members of the public, regardless of what profession, can claim litigation against people and against private firms - that’s why everyone has insurance. ‘It’s not common, I appreciate that, but the claim has come in and we’ve honoured the officer’s wishes by putting it through to the solicitor.’ The national Police Federation said the vast majority of claims made through its helpline would be for road accidents and are not necessarily linked to police work. A spokesman said: ‘Police officers undertake their duties with public protection as their top priority, with the potential risk to themselves as a secondary consideration, if at all. ‘However, on occasion private prosecutions and civil claims are made by police officers - and they must be treated each on their own merits. ‘We share the public view that policing is a job that carries with it a reasonable amount of risk, at times much higher than that.’","The Police Federation are encouraging officers to make the claims .

Border guards battling the illegal trade in elephant tusks and rhino horns from Africa are making 600 seizures a year as gangsters try to smuggle ivory into the Far East. Although the international trade in ivory was banned in 1989, customs officials are still seizing illegally imported ivory every week, including a 15kg haul discovered at Heathrow Airport. The freight was being smuggled from Nigeria to China and Hong Kong, where there is a growing market for intricately carved ivory jewellery and decorations. Seizure: Grant Miller of the UK Border Agency says his team seize 600 illegal shipments of elephant tusks and rhino horns every year . As a result the price of ivory has reached an incredible £2,000 per kilo. When officials looked inside the shipment, labelled as 'handicraft samples', during a check on suspicious-looking crates, they discovered several hundred carved items, including bracelets and beads hidden inside. An investigation by the Sunday People newspaper revealed how Border Force investigators are still facing a battle against ivory poachers, many of whom are supported by terrorist organisations. Senior border force officer Grant Miller told the newspaper that his team were currently making around 600 seizures a year - most of which was ivory. Caught: A man had tried to smuggle this rhino horn, taken from a dead animal at Colchester Zoo in Essex, out of the UK to China where is is powdered and used in traditional medicine . Prized: Powdered rhino horn can reach prices of £50,000 a kilo - making it more valuable than gold or cocaine . 'There is no doubt about it that these are terrorist organisations who are slaughtering the animals to fund their activities, whether it be human trafficking or other things,' he said. As many as 50,000 elephants were slaughtered for their ivory in 2011, the highest figure in 23 years. Only two weeks ago 50 poachers on horseback, carrying rifles and machetes, brutally killed 89 African elephants including 33 pregnant females and 15 calves - leading to fears that there could be a further increase in smuggling cases. The poachers attacked the herd in the central African country of Chad, with officials sadly confirming that the animal's tusks had been hacked off before they were killed. Under threat: As many as 50,000 elephants were slaughtered for their ivory in 2011, the highest figure in 23 years (file picture) Last year poachers killed 650 elephants at the Boubandjida National Park in Cameroon, butchering the surviving animals when they returned to mourn their dead. When the sought-after ivory reaches China, where the domestic market is still legal, it is quickly purchased by buyers keen to exhibit their wealth. Even museums and zoos in the UK have become fearful that poachers could strike because the trade in ivory and rhino horn, which is used in traditional Asian medicines and is prized as an aphrodisiac, is so lucrative. Poaching gangs have been turning to . Europe in their attempts to get the horns as rhinos in the wild have . been hunted to the brink of extinction, with just 29,000 remaining. Valued: Ivory is smuggled from Africa to China and Hong Kong where there is a growing market for intricately carved ivory jewellery and decorations (file picture) The powdered horn can reach prices of £50,000 a kilo - making it more valuable than gold or cocaine. At Port Lympne Wild Animal Park in Hythe and Howletts, near Canterbury, Kent, volunteers have been recruited to help protect the centre's 20 black rhinos by carrying out night patrols. Park boss Bob O’Connor said: 'The police are taking it seriously enough to visit us, so we’ve got to take it seriously as well.' In 2010 a man was jailed for two months after he attempted to smuggle the horn from a dead rhino at Colchester Zoo, Essex out of Manchester Airport to China. And it is not just organised criminals who can fall foul of import laws, as Mr Miller told how his specialised team often were forced to confiscate hunting books and boots made from elephant skin from tourists. Other recent finds include skulls, tiger bear and wolf skins and coral - all among the 30,000 animal and plant species listed as Endangered. The team also discovered a rhino horn that would fetch £110,000, which has been placed under lock and key at a secret location. Demand for the prized horn has risen in Vietnam and China because it is wrongly seen as a miracle cure. The International Fund for Animal Welfare has insisted that the UK must continue to battle the illegal trade. 'Flimsy punishment does not deter poachers – often the same people involved in drugs and arms dealing,' said director Robbie Marsland.","UK Border agency still seizes illegally imported ivory every week .

Bath Abbey could be plugged into the city's Roman drains under new plans to heat the vast medieval church from ancient underground springs. The Church of England has drawn up ambitious proposals to harness energy from Bath's source of 45C spring water to power a modern day central heating system for the historic building. The Abbey, which lies at the centre of Britain's only World Heritage city, has been granted planning permission for the unique £18million scheme. Bath Abbey will have the world's first natural underfloor heating system sourced from spring water in Roman drains which is 40C . Plans show how Bath Abbey will use water from the city's ancient springs which usually filters out to the River Avon . Architects plan to excavate ancient crypts below the church to locate a Roman drain where 850,000 litres of natural spring water currently empties every day into the ground. Engineers hope to divert the warmed water instead through a network of underground pipes to provide a world-first natural under-floor heating system for the Abbey. Church leaders believe the plans would provide a unique source of green energy for the Abbey and help the 10th century building reconnect with its Roman roots. Bath Abbey rector Edward Mason said: . ‘These are ambitious plans which would allow us to capture an incredible . and ancient natural resource which is currently being wasted. ‘The Abbey lies at the heart of what was once Roman Bath, and our architects have located a drain where spring water flows. ‘As it stands, the water pours away and empties eventually into the Avon. An artist's impression of plans for Bath Abbey shows how the ground will be excavated to create the heating system, new work space and song school . A new underground room for singing is part of the plans for Bath Abbey highlighted in an artist's impression . A new work space will be created beneath the ground under the plans to excavate parts of Bath Abbey . ‘Our plan is to remove the floor of the Abbey, dig down and divert the drain and then pump the water through an underground heating system to warm the church. ‘It would provide virtually all of the Abbey's heating and would give us a unique way to reduce our carbon footprint.’ The site of where Bath Abbey stands has been used for religious worship since 757 AD. In 973 King Edgar was crowned in the Anglo-Saxon . Abbey Church which stood on the site. All kings and queens of England including Elizabeth . II have had their coronations there. The present Abbey Church was founded in 1499 on the orders of the Bishop of Bath Oliver King. The Abbey lay in ruins for more than 70 years after the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539 by order of King Henry . VIII. In the 1830s Bath architect George Manners added new pinnacles and flying buttresses . to the exterior. Sir George Gilbert Scott transformed the inside of the Abbey between 1864 to 1874 in a Victorian Gothic style. The unusual plans for Bath Abbey were given approval by the city's council this month. The scheme is now set to be considered for funding by the National Lottery Heritage fund. The innovative project will be overseen by architects from Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios, the team responsible for new plans to transform London's South Bank. Rev Mason said the plans would help ensure Bath Abbey remained sustainable for the future. He said: ‘Bath has gained much as a city from its natural springs, and it is exciting to think we could harness the available resources for good use. ‘The project would also allow us to create a new work space and song school underground.’ Bath Abbey has been a religious site for centuries and the current Grade I listed building was founded in 1499. The medieval building was transformed by nineteenth century architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, who used Victorian Gothic motifs across the church. The Abbey receives more than 420,000 visitors a year. 850,000 litres of spring water which usually filters through to the River Avon will be used to heat the Abbey .","Roman drains with 45C spring water to be used for eco-heating system .

Gardeners may be fearing for their flower beds as cold conditions continue into spring, but one newly created plant could provide a solution. Botanists have produced the first frost-proof petunias, which are so hardy they can withstand winter. The popular bedding plant usually yields colourful trumpet-shaped flowers from spring to autumn and is wiped out by the first frosts. But scientists have now grown a much tougher variety after ten years of experiments. Colourful: Botanists have produced this petunia plant which is so hardy it can withstand winter .

The new hybrid petunia has grown and tested at the foot of Mount Vesuvius in Italy, which is consistently chilly during the winter months. The exhaustive process began in 2003 by mixing different types of petunia together, or cross-hybridising. Countless trials involving breeders planting out the hybrid varieties then took place, with the most hardiest of plants being selected for the next process. The plants have been undergoing outdoor tests in Ipswich, Suffolk, for the last three years.

'Our breeders in Italy are very protective over their secrets behind it. 'The trial ground was at the bottom of Mount Vesuvius, just south of Naples. 'It gets extremely cold there during the winter, with temperatures as low as minus ten degrees. 'They did a selection course which took a number of years, planting the petunias outside. 'They are now up to such a standard that if you were to plant then in winter time you would get flowers in your garden. 'It is a vigorous plant, achieved through a process of cross-hybridisation. 'They were trialled outside in Ipswich for three years prior to launch to make sure they were hardy enough for the UK. 'Parts of the UK get cold and hard frosts but these plants will withstand that. 'Over winter it won't produce as many flowers as it will during the summer but you will certainly get a good number.

Costly change: A move to ban councils from putting street lights on electricity poles could cost town halls 'millions of pounds' Villages and towns across the country face reductions in street lighting because of a health and safety ruling. For years, councils have fixed street lights to poles belonging to electricity firms, saving money and reducing street clutter. Phone companies used them too, combining three services in one pole. However, the practice is under threat following the death of a BT engineer who was electrocuted while working on an electricity network pole. Councils may have to erect their own poles for street lights, at a cost of around £1,000 each. Parish and town councils are saying they just don’t have the money, so street lights will have to be turned off instead. The National Association for Local . Councils is seeking urgent talks with the Government over the . policy which it estimates will cost authorities 'millions of pounds.' A spokesman said: 'The National Association is extremely worried about the situation which arisen from this policy. 'The cost to local councils to maintain . existing lighting with new types of poles is going to be . disproportionate to the overall budgets of these councils. 'We know that in a small rural parish . council in Cumbria that the costs could amount to £65,000; which is . greater than its total annual budget. 'There is a risk that in some areas of . the country there will be darkness which then is a risk to the . vulnerable in our society and this is not right.' Dan McLean of the Campaign to Protect . Rural England (CPRE) said: 'It’s daft really. What we don’t want is more . infrastructure such as 'street furniture' being put up. 'There is no point having three poles next to each other, each carrying one service, when one pole will do. 'Surely people can be trained in the . necessary safety procedures and the electricity, local authorities and . communications services can collaborate with each other. That is the . sensible option.' Catalyst: The policy follows the death of a BT engineer . The ban on hosting street lights was revealed by Electricity North West's chief executive, Steve Johnson. He says other companies are taking the same action. Mr Johnson says other electricity companies across the UK are taking the same action. Street lights are thought to deter crime and there are fears the move could lead to an upsurge in muggings, thefts and burglaries. The move has horrified the parish of Beetham in Cumbria, which has just 1,724 residents and about 40 lamps fitted to electricity poles. The council estimates it would cost £40,000 to replace them, twice its total annual expenditure. Councillor Pru Jupe said: 'The Government is doing nothing at all to help. There is just no money to do this work and we will have to turn off all lights affected in this way if nothing is done to help.' She said town and parish councils would be saddled with massive debt due to the change in health and safety policy. 'I appreciate that it is very sad that someone died after climbing an electric wire pole,' she said. Blackout: The ban on hosting street lights was revealed by Electricity North West's chief executive, Steve Johnson. He says other companies are taking the same action . 'However, we don’t have chapter and verse as to the exact circumstances and it seems to me that the key issue is training. 'We don’t close all roads, or stop people driving on them because of one single accident. The response has surely to be proportionate.' A spokesman for Electricity North West said councils were alerted of this safety requirement two years ago to allow time to plan for the change. 'We have not sought to remove all such equipment immediately, rather we have phased the work over several years as part of our routine refurbishment work on electricity poles. 'We will continue to give councils six months notice when we will be removing the lighting from our poles.'

Payback: Richard received £10,000 from his parishioners today after they invested his generous donation . Taking his cue from the Parable of the Talents in the Bible - where Jesus tells the story of a man who entrusts money to his servants - Richard wanted to see some creative ideas for a return on his investment. Richard said he had never expected such a huge response to his ten pound giveaway. Speaking on Easter Sunday, he said: 'The whole thing has been fantastic and very heartwarming. 'Everyone involved has dug deep and been very, very thoughtful. Charity: The money and gifts were handed over at a special service held at the church on Easter Sunday, three months after he gave out the original tenners . Imaginative: After giving out £550 pounds Richard has now been given back £10,000 in cash and goods from his canny parishioners who invested the cash . 'One 11-year-old girl handed me £550, she has been making homemade cards and selling them for 75 pence each, that is a lot of cards. 'Another woman just handed me £50, she said she didn't know what to do but works as a volunteer and sometimes she gets paid so she gave me a day's wages. 'One man was left some jewellery after his mother died and has been selling pieces of it, he gave £500. Grateful: The reverend has thanked his parish for being as inventive as they where in paying back the money . 'Nine thousand pounds is such a tremendous total and much of it has been raised by the congregation, along with gifts and donations from others. 'The whole process has been really life inspiring to those taking part. 'I just want to say a huge thank you to the congregation. They are a fantastic bunch of people. 'The handing out of the money was a good idea as a lot of these things wouldn't have happened if I hadn't. There are people from eight to 80 who wouldn't have been able to give anything unless they had that little bit to get them started. 'I gave £10 to a woman on Thursday so maybe it will keep on going.' Engineer Steve Jackson, 49, was one of the congregation who took a tenner and it helped him start making birdboxes, a surprisingly lucractive sideline that has brought in over £700. He said: 'The £10 spurred me on to get started. 'Everyone seemed to want one once they heard about them, all the business has just been through word of mouth. 'I've made about 30 and I am stopping taking orders after Easter.' Steve's sister, Sara Jackson, also took a £10 note at the service and like her brother felt compelled to put it to good use. Faith: Rector Richard Steel hands out the £10 notes to his parishioners to invest in the hope that parishioners will make a fortune to help with church repairs. Parable: The rector has taken inspiration from the biblical tale where a man entrusts money to his servants . She said: 'Once people heard about it they kept coming up and asking what I was going to do with the money. 'If I hadn't taken the money I would have probably just baked a cake or something but I decided to make chocolate truffles instead. 'I made one batch before Christmas and another for Easter. 'With the Christmas batch I made £280 and I still have to count up what it will be for Easter. 'I didn't realise how much attention it would get but it has been great for the church and people have really taken notice and helped.'","Reverend Richard Steel gave out £550 to his parishioners in November .

A man will spend his life in jail along with the hit man he hired from jail to kill his wife and family, but surviving relatives say they aren’t safe even with the man who tried to have them killed behind bars. Police encountered an unthinkably gruesome scene at the home of Robert and Tammy Rafferty in February 2011. Despicable: Christopher Wells, once a 'dashing' Chippendale dancer, will spend his life in prison for having his wife and brother-in-law killed . At the end of a trail of human teeth lay the body of Robert Rafferty, an ordained minister, in a pool of his own blood. He’d suffered a gunshot wound, stab wounds in the neck, and showed evidence he’d been beaten. The body of Amara Wells,39, lay nearby, too bloody for police to see the gunshot wound, but with the deep gash in her neck visible. The intruder had also tried to set fire to the Castle Rock, Colorado home. Amara Wells was the Rafferty’s sister-in-law, her husband Christopher Wells was Tammy’s brother. After years of escalating drug use, . violent threats, and a restraining order barring Christopher Wells from . having contact with his wife and daughter, Amara Wells took her daughter . and moved into the Rafferty home out of fear her husband would harm her . and her daughter. But on February 23, 2011, Wells was harmed anyway. A man dressed as a ninja entered the . Rafferty home and brutally slayed Robert Rafferty,49, and Amara Wells, . all while Wells’ 6-year-old daughter Alex watched, horrified. The investigation and later accounts would paint Rafferty as a hero who fought to his death to protect the 6-year-old and her mother. Ghastly: In Feb. 2011, Wells' daughter awoke to find her mother and uncle being shot and stabbed to death in this home in a quiet, secluded residential Colorado community . Almost safe: Amara Wells (right) and her daughter had fled from her drug-addicted, violent husband but he put a bounty on her head from jail . Sgt. Jason Weaver of the Douglas County, Colorado sheriff’s department was among the first to arrive at the scene and would later testify to all its gory details, but also to an uplifting one. Alex, who’d only just seen her mother and uncle savagely slaughtered, was trying to be strong. ‘I have never seen a child go through such trauma and be so strong,’ Weaver told ABC in a March 29 episode of 20/20. ‘That little girl is absolutely nothing more than amazing.’ Prosecutors in the case said that Alex woke up and saw the attacks, then ran to a neighbor’s to call 911. Investigators logically suspected Chris Wells, who’d been arrested four times for violating the restraining order his wife held. According to the family, former Chippendales dancer Wells was once dashing, but had become heavily addicted to methamphetamine and increasingly hostile in the time leading up to his wife leaving with the girl. While Wells’ and her daughter settled into life with the Raffertys, Christopher Wells’ behavior took and an even more disturbing turn. Hero: Robert Rafferty, an ordained minister, tried valiantly to fight off the intruder who eventually murdered him and his sister-in-law . Amara Wells’ sister Melissa Brown described one particularly horrifying incident the occurred after Chris Wells called to say he was dropping by to leave his wife and daughter’s belongings at the end of the Rafferty’s driveway. ‘All of the sudden I heard [Amara Wells] scream,’ Brown said. ‘She was standing there holding her wedding dress and he urinated across it and wrote a profanity.’ Though he seemed disturbed enough to . have committed the heinous crime, investigators hit a roadblock when . they realized Wells was in jail at the time of the double murder. Weaver and the other investigators remained convinced of Wells’ involvement, however, . They visited the car dealership where Wells worked and interviewed his co-woker, 27-year-old Josiah Sher. Sher had a suspicious wound on his head and police took him in for questioning. Sher would eventually admit to the killings and implicate three others, including Wells, in the killings. Sick duo: High on cocaine and wearing a ninja outfit, Josiah Sher (left) broke in to his victims' home, shot, and stabbed Robert Rafferty and Amara Wells to death while Matthew Plake (right) waited in the getaway vehicle . He . told them a middle-man named Micah Woody offered Sher, on behalf of . Wells, $5,000 each for the murders of his Wells' sister Tammy, his wife . Amara, and brother-in-law Robert Rafferty. After using cocaine leading up to the crime, Sher told police her was driven to the home by an accomplice named Matthew Plake. After a lengthy struggle with Rafferty, Sher says he managed to shoot and kill both him and Amara Wells. Matthew Plake would later confess he’d been behind the wheel of the getaway car that night but not involved in the actual slayings. Middleman: Micah Woody (pictured) will spend the next 46 years in jail for playing go-between and helping Wells hire Sher to kill Wells' family . During most of the trial of Wells, Woody, Plake, and Sher, Wells maintained his innocence. The prosecution had a powerful case without Wells’ confession, but 6-year-old Alex would be forced to take the stand and recount the heinous crimes she witnessed. The family had to decide if they wanted to put Alex on the stand and pursue the death penalty or allow Wells to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life in prison, sparing Alex. They chose to spare the girl and Wells agreed to confession on the condition he be allowed to tape a message for his daughter to watch. ‘He put together a very short, cold videotape, basically that he wouldn't be able to see her anymore,’ Amara Wells’ brother Jack Brown told ABC. ‘Oddly enough, that, you know, she should be a good girl and stay out of trouble and not to do bad things.’ Woody and Plake will spend the next 46 years behind bars for their cursory roles in the crime. Sher and Woods were convicted and sentenced to life in prison. Still dangerous? Wells will spend the rest of his life behind bars but family says he receives money from an unknown patron and will stop at nothing to finish them off . But surviving family like Tammy Rafferty, who was fortunate enough to be out of town on business the night of the crime and lives on in spite of the price tag once on her head, says instead of relief she feels only fear. She says her brother regularly receives cash from an unknown associate and prison officials confirm as much but say they are in control of how Wells uses the money while in prison. ‘I know what Chris does when he has access to money,’ Rafferty said. ‘His job isn't done, I think he wants to come after me because I wasn't home that night. And I think he wants to come after Melissa and Ed because they are now the parents of my niece.’","Police followed trail of human teeth to the gruesome crime scene where Wells' wife and brother-in-law were shot, slashed, and left dead in pools of their own blood .

Health managers at Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust today unveiled the gowns, which are already being used on some of the hospital’s wards. The Dignity Giving Suits for patients are the first of their type to be used in British hospitals. Birmingham Children's Hospital NHS Foundation Trust today unveiled new Velcro hospital suits, which are already being used on some of the wards . They have been universally welcomed by the hospital's doctors, surgeons, nurses and also by the patients who have been trialling them. The wrap-around suits have Velcro fastenings along the seams, doing away with the flimsy tie-backs of the backless gowns used in every hospital up and down the country until now. Michelle McLoughlin, the hospital's chief nurse, said she had wanted the hospital's young patients to feel ‘protected, safe and secure’, and that the old gowns were failing to make them feel that way, so hospital chiefs authorised a replacement. When it became clear there was no off-the-shelf solution, they ‘started from scratch’, she said. The entire process from idea to manufacture has taken 18 months. Mrs McLoughlin said the suits are proving so popular that children have been asking to take them home, while parents have been bemoaning the fact they are currently only available for children.

The use of contraceptive pills causes around 2,500 blood clots and 20 deaths every year in France, according to the country's health watchdog. The National Agency for the Safety of Drugs and Health Products (ANSM) undertook a study that found the pill was linked to thrombosis, or blood clots. Blood clots can be deadly, causing strokes or heart attacks if they get lodged in the brain or the heart. A total of 14 of 20 deaths were caused by third and fourth generation pills - launched in the last 20 years - while the remaining six were blamed on first and second generation pills, reports the Daily Telegraph. A study by a French health watchdog has found that the use of contraceptive pills causes around 2,500 blood clots and 20 deaths every year in the country . The third generation pill was introduced in the 1990s and the fourth generation pill was approved within the last ten years. The third and fourth generation pills are currently under scrutiny because of the case of 25-year-old Marion Larat, who has filed a lawsuit claiming that a later generation pill left her seriously handicapped following a stroke. 'The risk of venous thromboembolism applies to the population as a whole, but the risk is low,' ANSM said. 'It increases with age for all women, regardless of whether they use oral contraceptives or not. 'It is higher for users of third and fourth generation contraceptives than for users of first and second generation contraceptives.' The ANSM study was based on a statistical model. In France the use of contraceptive pills is among the highest in the world. In 2011, nearly 4.27million women were on the pill. However, after the health ministry . decided to more strictly regulate the prescriptions of these pills, the . sales of the third and fourth generation of pills fell sharply. After it was recently linked to four . deaths, regulators in France suspended sales of the hormone treatment . Dianette, which is also used as an oral contraceptive and is known to . increase the risk of blood clots. In Canada, 11 deaths have been linked . to the drug. The European Medicines Agency, which . regulates medicines across Europe, announced last week it will now carry . out a review into its safety. In the UK, concerns about the drug . were raised following the recent deaths of several young women, among . them Shannon Deakin in 2011. he 16-year-old from Hoyland, South . Yorkshire, had been prescribed Dianette by her GP for acne and had been . taking it for around four weeks before she died from an undiagnosed deep . vein thrombosis, when a blood clot from her leg travelled to her lungs. Blood clot: Third and fourth generation pills are currently under scrutiny in France because of health concerns . Dianette — or Diane-35 as it’s known in France — is prescribed to more than 62,000 British women a year, usually for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal problem affecting young women which leads to multiple small ovarian cysts, irregular periods, acne and excess facial hair. The condition is caused by an imbalance of the male sex hormone testosterone, which women also produce (it’s thought to help muscle strength and contribute to sex drive). Dianette is a combination of two drugs — cyproterone (a form of the female hormone progesterone) and ethinylestradiol (an oestrogen), which effectively suppress the effect of testosterone. As progesterone prevents ovulation, Dianette also works as an effective contraceptive. 'When you prescribe Dianette, you explain to patients there is an increased risk of blood clots, although the risk remains low' While other oral contraceptives carry a small increased risk of blood clots — which can be dangerous and potentially fatal if they travel to the lungs or brain — the type of progesterone in Dianette means the drug has one of the highest risks of blood clots of all oral contraceptives. Cyproterone is 65 per cent more likely to cause a blood clot than levonorgestrel (a type of progesterone found in older oral contraceptive pills), according to a review of 25 studies published last year in the European Journal of Contraception And Reproductive Health Care. The risk of a blood clot while taking Dianette is, however, small. Around 40 of every 100,000 women on it develop a blood clot in one year, compared with between five and ten women in 100,000 who are not taking the drug, according to the Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Low-dose combined contraceptive pills carry the lowest risk of blood clots — approximately half the risk of Dianette. But the Dianette risk is still lower than the risk of a blood clot during pregnancy (about 60 cases for every 100,000 pregnant women).","Oral contraceptive 'also causes 2,500 non-fatal blood clots'

Health experts have warned that the epidemic could leave unprotected children brain-damaged or dead . A measles outbreak is ‘spreading like bush fire’ in Wales despite urgent calls to ensure children have vital MMR protection. Health experts have again warned the epidemic could leave unprotected children brain-damaged or dead. They fear it could rival an outbreak which ravaged Dublin more than a decade ago, and killed three people. The latest warning is fuelled by concerns that increasingly urgent public pleas for parents to act do not appear to be getting through. The outbreak, centred on Swansea and the surrounding area, has seen the numbers infected rise from just over 200 on March 4 to 432 now. By the end of last week, the disease had spread to children in 111 secondary and primary schools, nurseries and play groups. Experts with Public Health Wales (PHW) expressed rising concern last week when the number of new cases rose. Since then, a further 116 cases have been reported and the rate at which the disease is spreading shows no sign of slowing. The majority of cases so far are in . the Swansea area but an increasing number are being reported across the . mid and west Wales regions. Dr Marion Lyons, PHW director of health protection, warned: ‘Measles is now spreading like bush fire across areas of Wales. ‘Worryingly, there are still tens of thousands of susceptible children across Wales, yet our weekly monitoring of vaccination rates shows only a slight increase in numbers receiving MMR jabs.’ She added: ‘If the numbers of parents bringing their children for MMR jabs does not dramatically increase, measles will continue to spread and quickly reach levels last seen in the outbreak in Dublin in 1999/2000. In that outbreak over 1,200 children were infected and three died. ‘The risk to unvaccinated children in Wales is increasing as the disease spreads. You only need one or two people who haven't had the vaccination in a community to put at risk babies, toddlers and anyone else who is vulnerable, such as children with leukaemia who cannot have the vaccination and pregnant women who haven't been vaccinated. Public Health Wales is urging people to get their children vaccinated . ‘A simple and safe jab from your GP will protect your child's health, could save their life, and will help protect other children too. 'It is the only precaution you can take at this time, and I would urge parents to contact their GP today to get their children's MMR vaccinations up to date. ‘If you haven't thought about it, make an appointment with your GP for your child to get the MMR jab. ‘If you're worried about the jab, I would reassure you that the jab is safe and offers the only protection against measles. Get your child vaccinated.’ Public Health Wales is urging parents of all children aged between one and 18 in Wales who have not been fully vaccinated to contact their GP for advice and to arrange vaccination as soon as possible.","In Swansea, Wales, there have now been 432 reported measles cases at 111 schools and nurseries .

A 'super-fit' detective who collapsed after chasing muggers who had stolen an iPhone was killed by a problem with her heart, an inquest found today. Witnesses said DC Adele Cashman, 30, appeared 'really tired' before falling to the ground on bonfire night last year. Colleagues who had also been chasing two suspects in Belsize Park, north London, immediately came to her aid. She was rushed to the Royal Free Hospital but was pronounced dead an hour later. Her parents said today that their daughter died 'doing what she loved'. A hearing at St Pancras Coroners Court was told she died from a fatal cardiac dysrhythmia in a morphologically normal heart. DC Cashman had been chasing two boys who had allegedly snatched a mobile phone from a 59-year-old woman in Haverstock Hill. Two 17-year-olds were later each given a six month referral orders for stealing the £550 iPhone5. Her parents Geoff and Lorraine said: 'Adele died on duty, serving the public, doing what she loved, working for the Metropolitan Police. 'Adele achieved a lot in her short life, she travelled the world, was well educated and she lived life to the full. Police officers lay flowers outside a tent where Detective Constable Adele Cashman collapsed. Detective Chief Superintendent Richard Tucker said DC Cashman was a 'much loved and wholly dedicated officer' 'We as a family are greatly comforted . by the many tributes received from her friends and workmates and by . knowing how many people really knew and loved her. 'We . would like to thank the police and our family and friends for their . unending support and help during these very difficult times.' Cardiac arrhythmias are linked to sudden adult death syndrome, which kills up to 500 people in the UK . every yea. DC Cashman joined the Metropolitan Police in 2006 and was made detective constable in Camden in 2010. The hearing today heard she had not . suffered any health problems in the run up to her death and regularly . went to the gym and planned to run a marathon. Her close friend and colleague Claire . Hart, who had recently been on holiday with DC Cashman, said she had . never even known her to have a cold. In a statement she said: 'I'm completely devastated as to understand how someone so young could die like this.' The coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe has recommended that members of DC Cashman's family now be screened . DC Cashman's partner Colin Baker said they had gone out for a meal the . night before she died and she had seemed fine. The last text he got from . her was at 9.18pm on November 5. Fifty minutes later she collapsed on the pavement in Belsize Park Gardens. Witness . Juliet Butcher, who saw the moment DC Cashman fell, said: 'She looked . really tired. She was staggering then she collapsed on the ground. 'I watched to see if she got up but when she didn't I went out to see if she was okay.' Within minutes DC Cashman's colleagues were on the scene and an ambulance was called. But despite having heart compressions for nearly an hour there was no response. Pathologist Dr Simon Poole said a post mortem showed no suspicious circumstances and toxicology tests proved negative. The officer's brain and heart were sent off for further examination but experts were again unable to find any abnormalities. Dr Poole said: 'By process of elimination . she is more likely to have died from a sudden and unpredicted . disturbance in the electrical activity in the heart which caused her . collapse and death. Flowers and messages laid in tribute to Dc Cashman. Her parents today said she died doing the job 'she loved' Cardiac dysrhythmia is a condition in which there is abnormal electrical activity in the heart, causing it to beat too fast or too slow, and may be regular or irregular. According to the NHS, Heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias), are experienced by over 1million people a year in the UK. Certain types can cause sudden cardiac death, which kills 100,000 people a year in the UK. Some arrhythmias are life-threatening medical emergencies that can result in cardiac arrest and sudden death. Others cause symptoms such as an abnormal awareness of heart beat (palpitations). Some types of arrhythmia can cause symptoms such as an abnormal awareness of heart beat, while others do not cause symptoms at all. Increased risks include stroke, heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Cardiac arrhythmias are a common cause of sudden adult death syndrome, which kills up to 500 people in the UK every year, and may be genetic. 'This is clearly unusual but it is a well documented phenomenon in young people who are otherwise fit and healthy.' It has since emerged that DC Cashman's mother suffers with a heart abnormality. Detective . Chief Superintendent Richard Tucker, Acting Borough Commander for . Camden, said: 'Adele was a much loved and wholly dedicated officer. It . is always devastating when a colleague loses their life, especially when . it is someone so young who devotes their life to keeping others safe. 'Adele . was such an officer and was held in very high regard by all who met her . - she continues to be sorely missed by everyone at Camden who had the . privilege of working alongside her.' St . Pancras coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe recommended members of the . officer's family now be screened in case they are also affected. Giving a ruling of natural causes she said the police chase had no bearing on the death as it 'could have occurred at any time.' She added: 'Adele Cashman was a young, healthy serving police officer who had no risk factors which were obvious at the time. 'There was some family history of potential congenital cardiac dysrhythmia. 'The . pathologist has concluded this is a death from natural causes due to . inherited abnormalities of the electrical components in her heart . structure. 'I'm . recommending her family undergo screening to make sure they are not . similarly affected and I want to convey my deepest condolences to them.' DC Cashman lived in St Albans with friends.

If the trio are excluded from the win, the remaining syndicate members will receive another £14,000 each . A lottery syndicate that won £1million are locked in a dispute today over how to share the money after three members are accused of not paying for the ticket. The 16 colleagues from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) were each due to receive £62,500 after they won the EuroMillions draw on Friday. But in a drama reminiscent of the BBC series The Syndicate, the group are arguing about how to divide the winnings after three members had not paid. Lottery operators Camelot were today trying to mediate in the row and senior officials at the DVLA . have become involved. If they exclude the workers who have not paid up the remaining members stand to gain an extra £14,423 each. In . the BBC drama, written by Kay Mellor, the winners have  to decide . whether to give a share to a member who had not paid his share for five . weeks. A DVLA worker, who did not want to be named, said: 'It’s like something out of that television show, I can’t believe the way they are acting. 'There is an office syndicate who group together and buy tickets - no one could believe it when they won. 'The win has gone a bit sour though as there are three people who the others say haven’t paid for their tickets. 'It’s all a bit awkward and there’s a bad atmosphere - it’s terrible how people can turn so nasty when a bit of money is involved.' More than 5,000 people work at the DVLA offices in Morriston, Swansea. It is thought the DVLA workers will hold a vote as they do not have a syndicate contract. The National Lottery recommend players draw up paperwork in the event of such a dispute arising. On their website is says: 'It’s important to draw up a group agreement in preparation of that big win.' They offer templates on their website . allowing people to decide contribution per draw, share of winnings and . what happens if someone fails to contribute. Camelot are mediating in the row between the 16-strong syndicate at the DVLA headquarters in Swansea . Workers at the offices said today they have been sworn to secrecy by bosses. An email was sent around warning staff that disciplinary action could be taken if the winners’ identities were revealed. The Department of Transport denied that security officers were called to the room where the winners work after a row broke out. A spokesman said: 'There have been suggestions that there were some disruption in the office and security had to be called in. I can state that there is no truth in that.' A National Lottery spokesman said because the syndicate had chosen to remain anonymous they could not comment on the dispute. Simon Horn, of the National Lottery, said a winning lottery ticket is owned by the individual that bought it and not by a syndicate. He said: 'We pay that individual after they sign the back of the winning ticket. 'So any splitting of the winnings between a syndicate is done by the individual winner. 'That is why we encourage every syndicate to sign a syndicate agreement form.' Mr Horn said it was very rare for people to fall out over a shared win. He said: 'In seven years I have met a lot of different winners and come across very few disputes. 'People are normally very happy to have won and it adds something to the experience to share it - more than it takes something away from the win.'","The 16-strong syndicate won £1million in Friday's EuroMillions draw .

Google Street View has released new pictures inside the 12-mile exclusion zone around Namie that was devastated in 2011 by the earthquake and tsunami.

They show a town abandoned in a hurry as thousands of residents fled to safety. Within the no-go area lies a ship stranded on a stretch of dirt flattened when the tsunami hit the coastline. Concrete rubble is strewn across the roads and shops lie empty and cars abandoned in fields.

A retired teacher was arrested today as part of a major inquiry into historic claims of a child sex ring at a school for vulnerable children. Ron Parker, 70, was held at the climax of a two year investigation examining allegations of abuse spanning four decades. The children’s author worked at Swaylands School, in Penshurst, Kent, an institution for ‘awkward boys’ which was shut down in the early 1990s. Held: A 70-year-old man has been arrested by police investigating historic child sex abuse at the now closed Swaylands School in Kent, involving 20 children with special needs . The school, in a sprawling listed . building, was closed amid allegations some of its pupils aged between . seven and 19 were treated cruelly. Now it can be revealed that a team of . up to 40 officers has allegedly uncovered evidence of widespread abuse . involving more than 20 victims. They have been contacting former . pupils who attended the school between 1967 and 1993, including . potential victims in Ireland and Australia. Three men, a 72 year-old-man in . Norfolk, a 69 year-old-man in Edinburgh and a 60 year-old man from . Berkshire have all been arrested and remain on bail. An additional three suspects identified by detectives were found to have died before the investigation was launched. Mr Parker was held by Greater Manchester Police during a dawn raid at his terraced home in Leigh, Lancashire. Arrest: Officers from Kent Police are investigating the case . He was interviewed by officers who travelled to the North West to question him on suspicion of ‘historic child sex offences’. The primary school governor and scout . master has published a series of books, including The Blue Bike Murder . which features disturbing scenes of child abuse. On one website he wrote: ‘I am a . writer, mostly of adult mysteries but I have also written some short . stories and a sci-fi book for youngsters. ‘I live in the North West of England . and I am involved with the Scouts and I am secretary of my local . residents association. I’m also a school governor ‘Despite this busy . life, I still find time to write and to look after my cat, Suzy.’ On a social networking site he claimed . to have worked as a ‘deputy superintendent’ at a children’s home . between August 1979 and December 1997. Swaylands School was set up in 1942 . and was operated and managed by the London borough of Barnet between the . mid 1960’s and 1994. Pupils with learning, emotional and . behavioural difficulties were placed there by local authorities from . across the capital and the South East. The landmark 19th century Tudor-style building was sold off several years ago for £2.65m and redeveloped into luxury housing. The police inquiry follows an . investigation in 1993 which resulted in the conviction of two men for . sexual offences involving four children. Both were sentenced to three . years. Det Chief Insp Paul Fotheringham, of . Kent and Essex Police’s Serious Crime Directorate, said the inquiry . followed ‘new information’ from a victim. He said: ‘This is a complex inquiry, where we have traced many people and records spanning a number of years. ‘Kent and Essex Police take . allegations of previously unreported offending seriously and every . effort is made to investigate whenever appropriate and possible. ‘We have also been working with a . number of charities to ensure that appropriate support is in place for . the victims that we have been speaking with.’ Peter Saunders, of the National .

Warning: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe the only way stop people using their mobiles while driving was tougher penalties . Drivers caught using a mobile phone behind the wheel twice should be banned from the roads, according to Britain’s most senior police officer. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was deeply concerned about the thousands of drivers who continue to flout the law. The Scotland Yard boss said the only way to change their habits is to adopt a tougher line and kick them off the roads. He said the penalty should be doubled from three points to six, meaning motorists would be banned under totting up rules if caught twice in three years. Young and inexperienced drivers would be forced to retake their tests if they are caught once within two years of getting their licence. The commissioner spoke out after figures revealed road deaths and casualties in the capital have increased for the first time in 20 years. He said: ‘I have to say I have still got an issue around mobile phone usage myself. I think it is still very high when people are driving. If I was able tomorrow, I would say you get six points for driving while using a phone. ‘The problem at the moment is we are dishing out lots of tickets, somebody gets three points and they have got another three chances. ‘I would say you have got two chances. You have had a mobile phone infraction and if you do it again you lose your licence.' His comments follow concerns that an increasing number of drivers are ignoring the ban on using their mobiles behind the wheel. Experts believe the Government’s decision to increase the penalty from a £30 fine six years ago to £60 has had little effect on motoring attitudes. One recent study suggested around 200,000 motorists are fined for the offence every year. Research claims driving while on a mobile slows reaction times so much it could be more dangerous than drink-driving. Police are being faced with the first rise in the number of road deaths and casualties for 20 years . Edmund King, of the AA, said using a mobile behind the wheel does not have the ‘social stigma’ of failing to wear a seat belt or drink-driving. He said: ‘There is a case for having a stronger deterrent like six penalty points. ‘This would have a particular impact on young people who would lose their licences immediately. If the penalty was increased there must be a concerted police campaign to show people there is a strong likelihood they will get caught.’ But Kevin Clinton, of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said he would prefer to see ‘more consistent enforcement’ of the existing law. He said: ‘If drivers know there is a good chance of getting caught if they use their phone while driving, they are less likely to risk doing so. ‘Increasing the points for this offence would be inconsistent with other motoring offences, but it is very likely that the fine for a range of fixed penalty motoring offences will be increased, from £60 to £90.’ Motorists are permitted to use a phone’s speaker or hands-free kit to avoid breaking the law as long as they do not hold the phone. Despite this, several studies have found that even speaking on a hands-free kit impairs driving ability. Some scientists argue the increased demands on the brain involved in holding a conversation on a phone – whether hand-held or hands-free – is the real danger while driving, not handling of the device. However police can still issue a £60 fine and three points if they deem the driver not to be in control of the vehicle. The Government said it would increase the financial penalty for using a mobile phone behind the wheel from £60 to either £80 or £100 last year but has yet to do so.","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe deeply concerned by number still flouting the law .

A local consular official had to call Sandiford’s 61-year-old sister Hilary Parsons – who is staying in an £18-a-night guest house five minutes’ walk from the prison – and she phoned a male prisoner inside Kerobokan jail to ask him to raise Sandiford in the women’s block. But the Briton, sedated after falling into a deep depression over her death penalty, was asleep. As the clock ticked down, she was woken and ran to the prison office, where a letter was quickly drafted. A consular official dropped it at the court 30 minutes after closing time – and after a nerve-racking  18-hour wait, it was accepted the following morning. Yesterday Ms Parsons accused the Foreign Office of cruelly mishandling her sister’s case. ‘I am appalled at their incompetence and insensitivity,’ she said. ‘When I got her on the end of a phone I said, “Get up, wake up, go to the prison office and get them to write the letter as quick as you can.” Accused: Julian Ponder, alleged to be the ringleader of the plot to smuggle the drugs, has apparently made death threats to Ms Sandiford, according to her sister . ‘It was absolutely terrifying. When the court closed, we had to endure a night believing the chance to appeal against the sentence was gone. ‘It was all left to me and I was made to feel it would have been my fault if she’d missed the chance to appeal against the death penalty.’ Ms Parsons, who moved to Bali in October from her home in North London to be near her sister, added: ‘Lindsay has been distressed at their behaviour all the way along. She told me many times that they don’t know what they are doing. When you get here and see what is going on, you understand what she’s up against.’ Ms Parsons said her sister’s ordeal had been made even worse by repeated death threats from the men she claimed forced her to smuggle the cocaine from Bangkok to Bali – Britons Julian Ponder, who was given six years, and Paul Beales, who is serving four years. Ms Parsons said. ‘We were sitting in the prison office together when Ponder went past on his way to go to court. He put his head in the window and laughed at us. Lindsay just cried.’ Ms Parsons says Sandiford was told there would be a gang ‘waiting for her’ in prison and that other inmates had been threatened for talking to her. Ms Parsons has now launched a website to raise awareness of her sister’s legal fight. A Foreign Office source last night confirmed Ms Parsons’ account of the chaos surrounding the appeal letter but insisted that diplomats had been misinformed by local court officials in Bali. An FCO spokesman said: 'We would like to make it clear that we have not made a “blunder” and we did not create a “mix-up” during the appeal process. 'We have worked very hard within the restraints of the local court system to use the processes available to us and have done so as quickly as possible.'","Appeal letter on behalf of Lindsay Sandiford, 56, rejected after mix-up .

Wilfred De'ath was was kept on bail for more than three months over an historic sex assault allegation but was later cleared . A retired BBC producer arrested in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal launched a scathing attack on police last night after being told he will not face charges. Wilfred De’ath, 75, accused the authorities of a ‘perversion of justice’ after he was kept on bail for more than three months over a sex assault allegation dating back almost half a century. He was arrested by seven officers at 7am at his flat on Remembrance Sunday last year after being accused of assaulting a teenage girl in the 1960s. Yesterday he was told he will not be . prosecuted after the complainant, once a relatively well-known actress, . withdrew her statement and said she was not willing to give evidence in . court alone. Mr De’ath, from Cambridge, is the . first of 11 people arrested as part of the controversial Operation . Yewtree investigation to learn his fate. He said he has endured a ‘very, . very unpleasant experience. I feel very indignant, I’m still very . angry’. He added: ‘I feel very bitter – I’m totally innocent.’ He also questioned why it was . necessary for a team of officers to arrest him over such historic claims . and accused Scotland Yard of allowing ‘political correctness’ to . ‘outweigh common sense’. A friend of his compared the behaviour . of investigators to that of the secret police in Communist East Germany . and the Soviet Union. Jimmy Savile is one of the UK's most prolific abusers and has sparked an investigation into sexual activity at the BBC . The friend added: ‘At a time when . known drug-dealers, murderers and other real criminals escape . prosecution because of a lack of certainty of conviction, it has to be . asked why this sorry affair ever took place. Chief Crown Prosecutor Alison Saunders said that the case could not be pursued without the witnesses statement as there was not enough evidence . 'Did the Yewtree team really . believe they could and should make a prosecution stick concerning an . alleged incident from nearly half a century ago to which there were no . witnesses?’ Mr De’ath once produced a Savile radio show but the allegations against him were unconnected to the disgraced paedophile. The actress claimed Mr De’ath groped . her thighs as they sat in a cinema in the 1960s when she was 14. She . came forward after he was interviewed as part of a TV documentary about . Savile’s past. Mr De’ath said he had met the girl . briefly at a party but had never gone to a cinema with her or assaulted . her. Earlier this month he said he had ‘a feeling of vindictiveness’ towards the now elderly actress. Alison Saunders, of the Crown . Prosecution Service, said the woman voluntarily withdrew her statement: . ‘She said that as she would be the only complainant to give evidence if . the matter went to trial, she did not want to pursue it. ‘She confirmed she came to this conclusion of her own free will.’ Others who have been arrested as part . of Yewtree are DJ Dave Lee Travis, paedophile Gary Glitter, celebrity PR .

A white middle-class Islamic convert yesterday admitted plotting a terrorist atrocity on the town where thousands gathered to honour dead British soldiers. Richard Dart, 30, trained at Al Qaeda camps in Pakistan for an attack on Royal Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire. The former BBC security guard was part of a three-man gang – which included a former police community support officer – who also planned to wipe out the heads of M15 and MI6. Plot: Richard Dart has admitted to involvement with terrorism offences along with Imran Mahmood, 21, and Jahangir Alom, 26 . Suspicion: British soldiers and Marines killed in Afghanistan pass along the High Street in Wootton Bassett, where the terror group was believed to be targeting . Co-conspirators: Former PCSO Jahangir Alom (left) and Imran Mahmood (right) also pleaded guilty at the Old bailey today . Last night it emerged that teacher’s son Dart was converted to Islam by notorious radical cleric Anjem Choudary in 2011. He was transformed from a promising carpentry student into a rabble-rouser preaching hatred against the West. Last year, Dart – who has changed his . name to Salahuddin al Britani – featured in a BBC documentary about his . conversion to Islam. Despite his supposedly devout lifestyle, he lived . rent-free while claiming thousands of pounds from taxpayers. In the BBC3 . film, My Brother the Islamist, he was seen protesting about British . soldiers in Afghanistan and calling them ‘murderers’. Extreme: Dart has made several appearances on YouTube and on BBC TV discussing his faith and his views, as well as attending several anti-British protests in London (right) Dart admitted plotting the terrorist . attack alongside ex-PCSO Jahangir Alom, 26, and Imran Mahmood, 21, . during a hearing at the Old Bailey. The three were arrested in police raids prior to the Olympics. Admission: Richard Dart had travelled to Pakistan for terror training and was implicated after police seized a computer . Alom was held at his home in . Stratford, East London, in the shadow of the Olympic Park, by officers . who used flash grenades and Tasers. Police discovered the men plotted to . attack Royal Wootton Bassett, the town where people regularly lined the . streets to mark the repatriation of British troops until late 2011. The trio had travelled to Pakistan’s lawless frontier with Afghanistan where they undertook terrorist training. Traces of explosives, including . nitro-glycerine, were found inside Mahmood’s rucksack when they . returned. The men also passed information to other extremists about . travelling to Pakistan and evading detection. They were arrested after a long  surveillance operation which followed two separate trips to Karachi over two years. The would-be bombers used a bizarre ‘deaf and dumb’ method in a bid to conceal their communications. Surveillance officers looked on as . they stood in the street tapping messages into their mobile phones and . laptops before deleting them. They devised the technique to outfox investigators using sophisticated bugs or lip readers to work out what they were saying. But it backfired because software on Richard Dart’s laptop automatically saved fragments of their incriminating discussions. The messages included discussions . about travelling to Pakistan to meet Al Qaeda and potential targets, . including Royal Wootton Bassett. The incriminating laptop was seized from Dart as he tried to board a plane to Karachi in November 2011. A painstaking police investigation . discovered fragments of incriminating messages on their phones and . laptops. In one, the trio discussed ‘WB’, interpreted by police as . Wootton Bassett. Stand: Dart pictured before his arrest during a Muslims against Crusades protest against the Royal Wedding outside the House Of Commons . Home: Dart had lived in a luxury flat here in Mile End, East London, paid for by benefits . Another message read: ‘If it comes down to this, it is that or even to just deal with a few MI5 or MI6 heads.’ Dart, who has a long bushy beard and wore traditional Muslim robes, spoke only to plead guilty during yesterday’s hearing. He converted to Islam after mixing in . extremist circles, including the group Muslims Against Crusades, which . was banned by the Home Office in November 2011. The leading figure in the group was . Choudary, a hate preacher linked to a string of Islamist groups . including Islam4UK, who boasted of converting Dart ‘by my hand’. Choudary gave him the name ‘Salahuddin’ after the medieval leader who drove Richard I from Jerusalem. Dart’s mother, Deborah Leech, . declined to comment yesterday at the £350,000 home she shares with her . husband Thomas in the village of Upwey, near Weymouth, Dorset. Speaking in court yesterday, . prosecutor Jonathan Laidlaw QC said there is a dispute over the ‘degree . of risk to members of the public’ the men posed. The judge, Mr Justice Simon, said he would sentence the men next month.","Richard Dart, Imran Mahmood, and Jahangir Alom, plead guilty at Old Bailey .

They buy more Bentleys than the British, fill their luxury homes with more Swarovski crystal than the Swiss, and spend more on Louis Vuitton and Versace than the French or the Italians. But one precious commodity has eluded the Chinese in their extraordinary rise from peasant nation to superpower: good manners. Officials are so exasperated by the tendency to spit, shout, slurp and push in at queues that they have taken to pleading and cajoling. It is not long since Shanghai launched a ‘Seven Nos’ campaign: no spitting, no littering, no vandalism, no damaging greenery, no jaywalking, no smoking in public places and no swearing. It was a  dismal failure. During the 2008 Beijing Olympics, a squad of 1,500 supervisors was sent out to discourage fighting at bus stops. Paper bags were handed out by volunteers in uniforms emblazoned with the Chinese characters for mucus. But when a Beijing university set  up a ‘civic index’ to calculate the level of politeness, researchers concluded glumly that the city was still a long way off international norms and the index was quietly dropped. Now, however, a school of etiquette is about to open in Beijing with classes based on the deportment of the British aristocracy – and the decorous behaviour of the Duchess of Cambridge. Sara Jane Ho, a Hong Kong businesswoman who grew up in London, is offering lessons in being classy to an exclusive clientele for an appropriately princely sum: courses at her Institute Sarita, based in the five-star Park Hyatt Hotel in Beijing, cost from £2,000 to £10,000. Dozens of society wives have signed up for lectures on how to use a knife and fork properly, how to peel a piece of fruit, how to greet a prospective mother-in-law, how to walk in heels and how to eat soup without slurping. High-powered bosses of Chinese state-owned companies are also hiring Sara Jane for lessons on how to conduct themselves at business meetings in Europe and America. She says a subtle pro-British snobbery . is driving the desire of wealthy Chinese to improve themselves . socially: ‘There is an aura of mystery about European royalty that . Chinese people can’t resist. Any aristocracy in China was wiped out, so . the Chinese are fascinated by the idea of a royal dynasty that stretches . back hundreds of years.’ Sara Jane plans to show her students . pictures and videos of Kate Middleton – someone who, like China itself, . rose from a relatively humble background to take her place at the top . table. She says: ‘Kate is probably the most . followed Royal in China. She is very elegant, very classy. Even though . she is not from an aristocratic family, she carries herself very well . and I think she is a role model for the younger generation around the . world. ‘All my students will . know who she is. It is very demanding to be a role model and to have . everybody watch your every move, but she has carried it off with so much . class and patience. She seems to exude kindness and etiquette awareness . and care for others. The English adore her as well, don’t they?’ Culture clash: Sara Jane Ho teaches table manners at her etiquette school in a five-star hotel in Beijing where students pay £2,000-£10,000 to learn how to present themselves the British way . Clear instructions: A 'no spitting' sign at a textile factory in Zhejiang Province . Sipping elegantly from a bowl of vegetable soup in a trendy Beijing restaurant, Sara Jane, a 27-year-old graduate of Harvard Business School, says China misplaced its manners during Mao’s Cultural Revolution. Her own family fled and then made its  fortune in Hong Kong. In her plummy British accent, she says: ‘I am Chinese and very proud of my country. I don’t think the vast majority of Chinese people are purposely offensive. They just haven’t been enlightened to etiquette awareness. ‘The Cultural Revolution wiped a lot . of that away. When you are pushing to the front of the food ration line . just to get that last bit of rice to feed your family, you don’t have . the luxury to think about etiquette. You are just trying to survive.’ She . is hoping to invite British  aristocrats to lecture her students and . even has plans to lead classes on a Grand Tour, taking in the opera . houses and art galleries of Europe to complete their education. Model behaviour: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, is the inspiration for many young, high society Chinese women . Converting Beijing’s nouveau riche will be no small task. At an introductory lesson, female students drove up in a convoy of Maseratis, Ferraris and Bentleys, then emerged in a maelstrom of fur and diamonds. Their nails were so ornate they had difficulty handling the cutlery. ‘In Hong Kong and London, it is all about subtlety,’ explains Sara Jane. ‘In Beijing, I will go out for lunch with a girlfriend and she will have a big Marc Jacobs ring that you open up and it’s a lip balm. When I go out to socialite events in Beijing and I put on minimal make-up, they say, “Darling, you didn’t put make-up on today. Are you feeling OK?” ’ Multi-millionaire’s wife Zaozao Jiang, . one of her new students, says the shocking manners of her fellow . countrymen have almost driven her abroad. ‘I simply can’t abide people . who pick their noses, spit and talk too loudly,’ complains the glamorous . 30-year-old Beijing socialite. Zaozao, whose husband heads one of . China’s biggest auction houses and has a family income equivalent to . £1 million a month, is an eye-catching regular in the society columns of . China’s glossy magazines. She adds: ‘Some people behave like . barbarians. They eat and drink loudly and take phone calls in the middle . of dinner or at a movie. There are so many wealthy people in China but . they have no manners. I often think about migrating to another country . because of it.’ Zaozao will pay between £5,000 and . £6,000 for her course and says she is already amazed at what she has . learned from two introductory sessions, adding: ‘We were taught how to . shake hands, and how you should always have eye contact when you’re . talking to people. Before the course, I didn’t know how to wipe my mouth . properly with a napkin or how to fold it before placing it in my lap – . or even how to tear a piece of bread and put butter on it.’ She pauses, then adds with a shudder: ‘It’s only now that I realise how terribly rude I must have seemed.’ China’s lack of manners has become something of a national embarrassment, with academics openly debating in the state-run media how habits can be changed. Certainly, public behaviour can come as a shock to Westerners. On one of my first visits in 2004, I learned not to put my head out of a bus window. When I did so, a man three rows ahead spat expertly and copiously out of the window and scored a direct hit on me. It is not uncommon to see people blowing their noses without a handkerchief. My translator told me, however, that many Chinese believe phlegm is toxic and that spitting it out expels poison from the body. To them, she said, our habit of blowing our noses into a handkerchief and putting it in our pockets is just as repugnant. Sara Jane hopes that the perfect manners she is teaching will trickle down to the rest of Chinese society: a new form of cultural revolution. ‘When I say I’m starting an etiquette school the first thing people say to me is, “Thank you. China needs this,” ’ she says.","It is still acceptable behaviour in China to spit on the street, blow your nose in your hand, slurp your soup and unashamedly push ahead in a queue .

Ashraf Rossli, 21, was robbed by two men who tried to ‘help’ him to his feet as he lay on the ground having had his jaw shattered by a thug during last summer’s London riots. The robbery, filmed on a mobile phone and uploaded on to YouTube, caused outrage. Within weeks, Reece Donovan and John Kafunda, both 23, were arrested and charged for the offence and, in March, were each sentenced to four years in jail. But their convictions were overturned on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Disappointed: Rossli Harun and Maznah Abu Mansor, the Parents of student Ashraf Rossli, who was robbed by thugs posing as Good Samaritans, told how they feel cheated by British justice after the men convicted of the attack were acquitted . Mr Rossli’s father, retired army officer Rossli Harun, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘This is not justice. This is not fair. We are all very upset.’ Mr Harun, 50, is angry that neither the police nor the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) informed his son or the family about the High Court’s decision. He and his son learned about the judgment after being contacted separately by The Mail on Sunday. The failure of the police and the CPS to contact the family was in marked contrast to the way they were feted a year ago by senior police figures and politicians. Mr Rossli, an accountancy student, was hosted in Parliament by Labour MP Keith Vaz and also met London Mayor Boris Johnson. Attacked: Ashraf Rossli, 21, was robbed by two men who tried to 'help' him to his feet as he lay on the ground having had his jaw shattered during the London riots . When Mr Harun and his wife flew to their son’s hospital bedside, they were greeted by senior police officers and politicians. Speaking from his home in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, Mr Harun said: ‘None of the people we met when we visited London has contacted us.’ Donovan, from Romford, Essex, was a heavy cannabis user who had convictions for theft, affray and violent assault against a police officer. Kafunda, from Ilford, East London, was jailed for six months in 2005 for robbing the same person twice. When they were found guilty of robbing his son, Mr Harun said his faith in the British judicial system was restored. But last week, the two men walked free from the Royal Courts of Justice and celebrated with champagne after the country’s top judge, Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, overturned the verdict. He said the conviction was unsafe as it was primarily based on evidence given by two anonymous witnesses. Horrified by the ruling, Mr Harun, said: ‘What happened to my son would never have happened in Malaysia. In Malaysia, people are taught from an early age that they will be punished if they do something that is against the law. They would be afraid to behave like this. They would never dare do it.’ Mr Harun said his son still suffers from a phobia of going out into as a result of the attack. Mr Rossli scored straight-As in his high school exams, and won a scholarship worth £60,000 from the Malaysian government to study in Britain. Freed: John Kafunda (far left) and Reece Donovan (right with his mother) were charged for the offence and each sentenced to four years in jail but their convictions were overturned on Thursday . Overturned verdict: The pair walked free and celebrated with champagne after Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge said the conviction was unsafe as it was primarily based on evidence given by two anonymous witnesses . Speaking from his student digs in the upmarket London area of Bayswater, Mr Rossli said he still hoped that his attackers would one day face justice. He said: ‘This has brought back a lot of emotions but I am just trying to get on with life.’ He added: ‘It is very difficult for me to forgive the people who hurt me and I haven’t managed to do that yet. Hopefully, one day the people who are responsible will face justice.’ Mr Vaz said he was shocked by the acquittal of Kafunda and Donovan. He said: ‘I am deeply disappointed that the people convicted of this offence which shocked the nation should have been acquitted. ‘I met Ashraf Rossli on two occasions, along with his family. He is one of the most gentle, kind people you can meet.’ Sickening: Phone footage of last year's attack on Mr Rossli which was uploaded on to YouTube, caused outrage . Mr Vaz, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, added: ‘I am disappointed that no one has informed him of the outcome. ‘He should have been given full details about the case and the verdict immediately. We must ensure this never happens again, and someone needs to apologise to him for this error.’ The Metropolitan Police said  detectives did try to contact Mr Rossli through the Malaysian embassy after Thursday’s High Court ruling, but ‘were unsuccessful’. Police have since managed to contact him after he was informed by the Mail on Sunday. This weekend, Donovan protested his innocence and said that the last 16 months of being locked up in custody and serving the jail sentence was ‘hell’ for him. Speaking from his mother Lisa’s house in Stepney, East London, he said: ‘We’re [he and Kafunda] scared to go outside because we are the most hated people in Britain. I lost my girlfriend and flat as a result of all this and my solicitor will be looking into compensation from the police.’","Ashraf Rossli, 21, was robbed by two men as he lay on the ground with a shattered jaw during last summer's London riots .

This is the end of a glittering career. 'The great thing I can say is that he's in a positive frame of mind and that is number one.

Leading amateur jockey JT McNamara is still in hospital after being injured when his horse fell at the Cheltenham Festival . Gold Cup day at Cheltenham Racecourse on March 15. McNamara was injured in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Challenge Cup . 'We devote our lives to the sport we love. None of us want to see a jockey injured, the same goes for the horse. 'Getting injured is always in the back of your mind but if you were thinking about it, you wouldn't be able to do your job. 'He's alive and well and in a positive frame of mind. It's important that racing does what it can to help him enjoy the rest of life. I cannot tell you how nice a guy he is.' The latest statement on McNamara's condition was issued jointly by Dr Adrian McGoldrick, Irish Turf Club Senior Medical Officer and Lisa Hancock, CEO, Injured Jockeys Fund, on behalf of the rider's family. It read: 'JT McNamara remains in the Frenchay Hospital, Bristol. Whilst he suffered a serious neck injury resulting in paralysis, he has made progress in the last week and is in a very positive frame of mind. 'He is greatly appreciative of the many messages, cards and letters received and also wishes to thank the Frenchay Hospital who are looking after him so well.' Speaking to Sky Sports News, Hancock said: 'It's a risky sport. Safety is important and it continues to be, but it is a risky sport and every jockey knows that. We are looking at safety measures and continue to do so. 'But at the end of the day you're riding a horse at speed and jumping fences at speed so the risk is always there.' McNamara is famed for his prowess as a point-to-point rider and in cross-country races at Cheltenham and Punchestown, enjoying tremendous success in the colours of owner JP McManus on the likes of Spot Thedifference. Paul Struthers, chief excutive of the Professional Jockeys Association, tweeted: 'Awful news with confirmation of the extent of JT's injuries.

Pressure: Man Booker Prize winner Julian Barnes has said writers are under increasing pressure to include explicit sex scenes in books . Novelist Julian Barnes said yesterday writers were under increasing pressure to include explicit sex scenes in books. But by writing graphically about intercourse, novelists were increasingly at risk of being ‘laughed at by future generations’. The widely-acclaimed English author, 67, listed the three cardinal sins of bad sex writing as being too pornographic, too facetious or overly solemn. ‘Safe’ cliches used by modern writers included characters wearing the ‘wrong underpants’ and ‘humiliating attacks of impotence’, Barnes said in an interview. He said that British literature ‘grew up’ and began to write more detailed sex scenes, after the failure of the Lady Chatterley’s Lover obscenity trial in 1960 , he said in the Radio Times. But ‘old euphemisms’ had sometimes been replaced by ‘misleading new cliches’ and a commercial obligation to write about sex in detail, the Man Booker Prize winner said. Barnes, who won the Man Booker Prize in 2011 with The Sense Of An Ending, said that the fear that readers might think an author was writing from personal experience could be ‘a great inhibitor’. ‘I remember Kingsley Amis telling me some time in the 1980s that he had recently abandoned a novel because there was a homosexual character in it and he was afraid “the chaps at the club might think I was queer”, he said. ‘This seemed, even at the time, a pitiful excuse, and seems the more pitiful with hindsight.’ Barnes admitted that the comic approach was popular with writers because they would not be accused of ‘solemnity’ or ‘moralising’. Lady Chatterley's Lover: British literature 'grew up' after the failure of the Lady Chatterley's Lover obscenity trail, said Mr Barnes . But he added: ‘The comic tone inevitably pushes you towards bad sex. It’s ... perhaps impossible, to be funny about good sex, but with bad sex the field is wide open. ‘That embarrassing premature ejaculation, that humiliating attack of impotence, the wrong underpants, the social uncertainty of what and where and when and how and how often. This is safe territory for the novelist - perhaps too safe.’ He added another concern was vocabulary, ‘which parts do you name, and what names do you give them?’ Barnes, who talks about the challenges of writing about sex on Radio 3’s The Essay: Explaining The Explicit, added: ‘John Updike is a writer whom I revere, and who wrote with precision and understanding about sex, especially from the male point of view. ‘But in one novel - I think it was Brazil - he kept comparing the male member - as he wouldn’t have called it - to a yam. ‘Whenever he did so, instead of my visualising all the more clearly the sex that just was about to happen, I kept imagining a vegetable stall.’","Writers feel increasingly obliged to include explicit sex, says Julian Barnes .

The over-60s will be able to take out student loans so they can go back to university, the higher education minister announced last night. David Willetts claimed that older people who return to higher education to keep their skills up to date will be more likely to keep their jobs. The Conservative minister said that the upper age limit for taking out student loans to cover tuition fees had been lifted. David Willetts said older people are more likely to keep their jobs if they retrain and keep their skills up to date . He said that the change would allow older people to find ‘great value’ in taking a university degree course. Pointing out that older people are expected to work for longer before retirement than they were in the past, Mr Willetts suggested that they could struggle to compete against the younger working generation. He said that the solution would be for them to retrain. The minister, who is accompanying David Cameron on his visit to India, suggested that the new rules would help older workers cope with the pressure that they would face to keep up to date as they worked well into their 60s. He said: ‘There is certainly a pressure for continuing to get retrained and upskilled. ‘Higher education has an economic benefit in that if you stay up to date with knowledge and skills you are more employable.’ The move by the Coalition is likely to raise fears about whether the older generation of people taking out student loans will have enough time left in which they can pay the money back. Until now in England, only students who were younger than 54 have been eligible for a loan to cover tuition fees for a higher education course. ‘There was a lot of criticism about the ageism of all this,’ Mr Willetts said, as reported by the Daily Telegraph. ‘The regime now is there is no age limit on fee loans.’ He said there was a ‘great value in lifelong learning’ and education is ‘not reserved for younger people’. David Willetts said education is 'not reserved for young people' Mr Willetts said a university course had ‘wider benefits’, making people likelier to lead healthy lives. He also said online courses were attracting ‘a lot of older people’ who had more free time and so could spend the time studying. His comments came after a government report found that the country’s future economic success  depends on the skills and contributions of older workers. However, campaigners raised concerns about whether pensioners would be willing to commit to challenging degree courses and further debt. Dr Ros Altmann, a pensions specialist, said she was ‘not convinced’ that many people would see a three-year university degree costing £27,000 as a good investment. She said: ‘I wouldn’t have thought that three years at university with those kind of costs, and the long holidays that universities have, would be the best thing for older people to take up and pay for.’ Economists have warned that the ageing population will place an unmanageable burden on taxpayers unless more people work for longer than in the past. One in four people will be older than 65 by 2033 and the State pension age is to rise to 67 by 2028. Last year only 1,940 undergraduates starting courses were older than 50, out of a total 552,240 students in the UK. Mr Willetts suggested this figure was expected to rise. Worryingly, ministers have warned that they have no idea when younger workers in the 30s will be able to retire. In January, Pensions Minister Steve Webb admitted it was ‘too early’ to predict what future rises in the state pension age will be. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, some 6,455 undergraduates starting courses last year were aged between 50 and 60 years old. Currently, the majority of older people go back to university for recreational purposes, or take part in other similar academic groups or organisations for their own enjoyment.","David Willetts said older people should return to higher education .

British Airways is to follow budget airline rivals by charging less if passengers travel with just hand luggage. The airline said the cheaper fares – which will initially be offered on flights from Gatwick Airport to five European destinations – will give passengers ‘more choice’. Holidaymakers who travel with luggage they wish to check in will not pay more to compensate for the lower ‘hand baggage only’ fares, the airline said. British Airways will offer customers 'more choice' when they travel by charging less for hand luggage . It is a move likely to be viewed as an attempt by BA to compete with low-cost airlines such as Ryanair and Easyjet that charge more for passengers to check in baggage, effctively charging less for those who don’t. Peter Simpson, director of Gatwick for British Airways, said: ‘The introduction of our hand baggage only fare is all about giving our customers more freedom to choose the kind of flying they want. ‘Many British Airways customers on Gatwick short-haul breaks choose not to check in a bag as they’re already taking advantage of our generous two-bag hand luggage policy. BA plan on taking on their budget rivals, such as Easyjet, that encourage only taking hand luggage . ‘Those who still want to check in a bag will simply pay the same price they do now.’ The flag-carrier said it will initially offer a discount for those travelling with just hand luggage from Gatwick to five short-haul destinations including Amsterdam, Dubrovnik, Jersey, Tunis and Turin in Europe. The size of discounts will vary depending on the route but will range from £9 to £15. Passengers can start benefitting from the lower fares from Tuesday (February 26), with starting prices ranging from £39 one-way to Amsterdam to £69 one-way to Turin. Bob Atkinson, a travel expert at Travelsupermarket.com, said it was a great opportunity for passengers to have the full ‘BA offering’ of food and reward points while being handed a ‘generous hand luggage allowance’. He said: ‘This is an interesting move for BA which is clearly looking at other ways to position its offering to price-sensitive customers. ‘However passengers who take up the offer to travel without checked luggage will still benefit from a generous hand luggage allowance plus free on board food and drink.’ The move comes after Dutch airline KLM decided to begin charging customers who check in luggage on short-haul flights.","BA plan to take on budget airlines who have been offering the service .

But one type of rice is flying off the shelves, because it has virtually no calories. Slim Rice, a new British product, helps you feel full while barely registering on your waistline. There are 7.7 calories in a 100g serving, compared to 350 calories in the same weight of white basmati rice. Regular boiled rice contains 64 per cent water. Slim Rice, which comes already cooked, is made up of 97 per cent water and the Asian root konjac. Some nutritionists claim that vegetable . extract konjac – also known as Moyu – can stabilise blood-sugar levels . and prevent hunger pangs and over-eating. The unusual product smells strongly of starch and needs to be rinsed at least twice under warm water to remove its distinctive odour. Advocates claim the rice, which is chewier than normal varieties, tricks your brain into thinking you have eaten a full meal. One portion can create the sensation of being full for up to four hours. The Slim range – which includes Slim Pasta and Slim Noodles – is flavourless, allowing you to add a sauce of your choice.

The whistleblower who was forced out of the Lib Dems and made to sign a gagging order over the Lord Rennard allegations has been named as former head of fundraising Helen Jardine-Brown . Fresh details emerged last night about the whistleblower who was forced out of the Liberal Democrats and made to sign a gagging order over the Lord Rennard allegations. She was named as Helen Jardine-Brown, a former head of fund-raising, who was pregnant at the time. When she approached senior Lib Dems four years ago with claims about Lord Rennard’s behaviour, she was told Nick Clegg would call her directly, but was never contacted. Less than two months later, her post was allegedly cut, shortly after she told her boss that she was pregnant. She was told her role was going as part of a ‘re-organisation’. Miss Jardine-Brown eventually reached a £50,000 settlement with the party on condition of her silence. On Saturday, the Daily Mail revealed that a high-ranking woman official had been sacked but did not name her. It is believed Miss Jardine-Brown raised concerns about Lord Rennard’s behaviour in September 2008, during an interview with senior officials at the party. Less than eight weeks later, after informing her employer she was pregnant, she was told her role was to be cut. Sources told the Daily Telegraph she was offered the chance to reapply for a more junior role, which she rejected. Miss Jardine-Brown, who has declined to comment on the case, filed a formal complaint against the Lib Dem chief executive and the party on grounds of sex and disability discrimination. In November 2009, she reached a settlement with the party on condition that she did not discuss the case or the terms. A senior Lib Dem official has said Nick Clegg, right, was aware of allegations about the behaviour of Lord Rennard, left, by September 2008 . Former Lib Dem party member Alison Smith described an ordeal involving Lord Rennard's alleged inappropriate behaviour back in 2007 . A Lib Dem spokesman said he was unable . to discuss the case ‘for the same reason the person involved can’t’. He . added: ‘I can, however, confirm this case had absolutely nothing to do . with the recent allegations involving Lord Rennard.’ Sources told the Daily Telegraph Miss Jardine-Brown was offered the chance to reapply for a more junior role, which she rejected . Meanwhile, . damning new allegations that Lord Rennard pestered two women activists . for sex after buying them dinner emerged yesterday. The party’s then chief executive . invited the women back to his London flat for a late-night drink but . then ‘locked the doors’ and suggested they ‘go upstairs’, according to . new evidence. Alison Smith, then a party member but now an Oxford University politics lecturer, and a fellow Lib Dem – referred to as A – endured the ordeal in 2007, it is claimed. Miss Smith’s account appears to be corroborated by an ITN News interview with a senior Lib Dem official in 2009 as part of an investigation into claims about Lord Rennard. The incident allegedly happened after Miss Smith stepped down as a parliamentary candidate. The official told the broadcaster: ‘Chris Rennard offered to take A and Al out for dinner to commiserate with Al for having to give up her seat. ‘Rennard invited them back to his . house for a drink. After dinner . . . he locked the doors – they didn’t . realise that he had locked the doors, but he had.

There is a knowledge at a senior level.’ The official said Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was aware of the alleged incident and other allegations by September 2008. Miss Smith said last week: ‘He just very suddenly got up and plonked himself between us and started moving his hands down our backs and places where they had absolutely no business being. It was both of us at the same time. I straight away stood up and said: “No, that’s not acceptable. I’m going home”.’ Lord Rennard has strenuously denied any inappropriate behaviour and has insisted he did not lock the door at his home while the women were there in 2007.","Approached senior Lib Dems four years ago with claims about Lord Rennard .

Post Office workers have gone on strike today in a row over jobs, pay and closures - saying they received strong support from the public over their action. Members of the Communication Workers Union in around 260 so-called Crown offices took industrial action in protest at plans to close or franchise 70 branches. The union said the walkout was 'solidly' supported by thousands of its members, with picket lines set up outside post offices across the country. Scroll down for video . Five-year-old Josiah Barnes protests with Post Office workers outside Holloway Post Office in London where they are striking against jobs, pay and closures . The Post Office said scores of branches were open despite the strike. The CWU said MPs and local politicians offered their backing to the strikers, adding that members of the public were also showing support. The union said hundreds of jobs will be affected by the proposals, which it warned would cause further problems for high streets already suffering from shop closures. The CWU added that staff had not received a pay rise for two years. The Post Office said Crown branches were losing £40million a year and accused the union of ignoring the 'harsh realities' the company faces. Dave Ward, the CWU's deputy general secretary, said: 'Our post office members are standing up against destructive plans which would slash 20 per cent of the Crown network and are simply asking for fair treatment and job security. Donna Barnes protests with Post Office workers outside Holloway Post Office in London . 'The Post Office's plans are short-sighted and would rob the network of the most productive offices while simultaneously putting hundreds of jobs at risk and potentially damaging local economies. 'We'd like to see a better vision for a successful network which maintains services in the heart of communities alongside quality jobs. We're confident this could be achieved if Post Office management would agree to negotiations.' Kevin Gilliland, Network and Sales Director at the Post Office said: 'We regret any inconvenience caused to customers by today’s strike action. 'However, over 100 of our Crown branches are open today and the remainder of our 11,800 branches are unaffected. 'The CWU is ignoring the harsh commercial realities being faced by the Post Office and other retailers across the UK. 'Crown branches are currently losing £40m per year and this is being subsidised by public money.  This cannot continue. 'The Post Office is transforming its network to improve customer experience and in turn bring in new business. 'We are committed to the Post Office remaining a key part of UK high streets and our plans ensure this will happen. 'This means for 70 of our Crown branches – less than one per  cent of our network – we will be looking to partner with a suitable retailer, whilst at the same time we will invest £70m in the remaining 300 Crown branches to modernise and grow services to ensure their long term viability. 'Our pay offer remains unchanged.  We want to make the first payment of up to £1400 as quickly as possible.  Any future strike action can only cause further inconvenience for customers and delay how quickly this money will be received into our people’s pay packets.'

High-fiving Sir Tom Jones in front of nine million TV viewers, she seemed to have the world, or at least the music industry, at her feet. A year on, some fans of The Voice may struggle to remember Leanne Mitchell’s name. As the BBC1 talent show returns for a second season tonight, sources have privately admitted its first winner has been a disappointment…and even Sir Tom thinks it would have been better if she hadn’t won. Scroll down for video . Reluctant star: Leanne Mitchell, 29, pictured with Sir Tom Jones on The Voice, has enjoyed limited success since winning the BBC singing competition last year . The 29-year-old, who still lives in a semi-detached bungalow in Lowestoft, Suffolk, failed to enter the top 40 with her first single. Almost a year since her victory she hasn’t released an album or been on tour – calling into question the credibility of a programme that boasts it is a springboard for musical success. Members of the former holiday camp entertainer’s management team told the Daily Mail she appears to be a reluctant star who has refused to co-operate with publicity opportunities to boost her profile and failed to work as hard as The Voice runners up Bo Bruce and Tyler James. No impact: Miss Mitchell, who still lives in a semi-detached bungalow in Lowestoft, Suffolk, failed to enter the top 40 with her first single . A source said: ‘Leanne is wary of fame and doesn’t aspire to be a massive star. She just wants to sing. Unfortunately for her, you have to promote yourself if you want people to buy your music.’ Meanwhile Sir Tom, who returns as a coach this weekend after mentoring Miss Mitchell to victory last year, accused her record label, Universal Music, of mismanaging her career. Asked why she has failed to make a mark in the music industry, he said: ‘I think they [Universal] rushed it. ‘The one problem is if you win The Voice, it’s out of your hands completely. Because you’re signed to Universal Records, with management, agency, the whole thing. ‘So you can’t do much for that person after you’ve got that person to win. If you want to do something with them further, it’s better that they don’t win.’ Miss Mitchell’s only release to date, a cover of Run To You by Whitney Houston, was a flop, selling just 7,000 copies last June and reaching number 45 in the charts. By contrast, all nine winners of The Voice’s ITV rival, The X Factor, have recorded number one singles at their first attempt. She suffered further disappointment in September when the show’s official live tour, due to showcase its eight finalists, was cancelled following poor ticket sales. Her debut album – called Leanne Mitchell – was originally set for release in April but has been postponed until May 27. Mismanagement: Sir Tom Jones, who mentored Miss Mitchell to victory last year, accused her record label, Universal Music, of mismanaging her career . Some of last year’s runners-up, including Tyler James (left) and Bo Bruce (right), have enjoyed more success . Perhaps surprisingly, given her young age and lack of starting career success, the singer will release an autobiography, entitled Finding My Voice, on April 18. A source on the BBC show said: ‘Leanne’s trajectory since The Voice has been a disappointment. She has not been the best advert for the show.’ Some of last year’s runners-up appear to have achieved far more. Bo Bruce, 28, saw a re-release of her 2010 single Search The Night reach number two in the online charts a week after The Voice ended last year. She subsequently signed to Mercury Records. The best doesn't always win: Will.i.am, a coach on The Voice, said: 'The public voted for Leanne, but the best artist does not always get the most votes' Comeback: The Voice returns to screens this weekend after a disappointing start . Tyler James, 28, signed a deal with Island Records and regularly plays at gigs around the country. His debut single, Single Tear, peaked at number 28 in the charts last October, while his album, A Place I Go, reached 47. Mr . James’ coach on The Voice, Will.i.am, said: ‘The public voted for .

"By . Richard Pendlebury . PUBLISHED: . 19:31 EST, 27 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:51 EST, 28 March 2013 . A black and yellow arrow is the vivid symbol of the International Rescue Committee. You will see it on flags flying over refugee camps from the Syrian borders to the Congo. Yet it was the poison-tipped missile that thudded between David Miliband’s shoulder blades at the Labour leadership election which most informs his decision to abandon British politics for a place among New York’s glamorous charity elite. Younger brother Ed was the deceptively geeky assassin with the bow. He snatched the job David thought was his birthright. 'Took it personally': David's wife Louise Shackelton, left, believed Ed's wife Justine Thornton, right, should have done the right thing and put a stop to his efforts to become leader of the Labour party . The sight of the two Primrose Hill-raised Labour apparatchiks engaged in political fratricide was astonishing, and in the subsequent two-and-a-half years, no amount of fine public words or behind-the-scenes finessing has healed that wound. Forget Ed’s almost tear-stained eulogies yesterday at the news his brother was  leaving British politics; forget mentor Tony Blair’s hope that ‘this is time out, not time over’; forget the $450,000 salary the Twittersphere was predicting for the new IRC boss; set aside even David Miliband’s own part-explanation that he was repaying a debt to an organisation formed in the 1930s to help people like his parents flee Nazi persecution. Home ties: David Miliband's wife Louise Shackleton is American and their two children were adopted in the States . For the 47-year-old former Foreign Secretary and one-time No 10 hopeful, a new life along the Hudson rather than the Thames is about escaping Ed. Leaving Westminster wasn’t enough – only an ocean apart would do. In an interview with the BBC yesterday, he hinted at this when he said it was ‘hard for me to accept that I can best help the Labour Party by giving not just the space between the front bench and the back bench to Ed, but the space between the front bench and 3,000 miles away’. He went on: ‘I want it to be the vision Ed Miliband has versus the vision David Cameron has. Not Ed and David Miliband. I didn’t want to become a distraction. I didn’t want the soap opera to take over the real substance of what needs to be done.’ One Westminster source used rather blunter language: ‘He will never come back.’ Another added: ‘He knows in his heart of hearts he is finished here.’ So ends serious recent speculation that the fraternal schism could be healed for the good of the party, with the more experienced and charismatic Miliband brother returning to the Shadow Cabinet to turn a strong position into a winning one at the next general election. According to several Westminster insiders, David Miliband’s decision was vigorously encouraged by his musician wife Louise Shackelton. She is an American and their two children were both adopted in the States. But the most telling factor is her continued bitterness at the way in which her husband was ‘betrayed’ by his little brother. ‘The relationship between the two brothers has never really recovered, but the driving force is David’s wife Louise,’ an associate of David’s said. ‘She took it personally, and has not come to terms with it even slightly. Why should David go back into the Shadow Cabinet and improve things for Ed? ‘Louise feels that Ed’s wife Justine should have done the right thing and stopped her husband. Louise wants to get right out of the political “Primrose Hill mafia” set from which the brothers emerged, and New York is also a good base for her own orchestral work.’ And so the discord continues, giving the lie to Ed Miliband’s statement when he stood for the leadership that ‘David is my best friend in the world. I love him dearly but win or lose we will remain the best of friends’. Wrong! ‘Heartbroken’ both by the dashing of his ambitions and the person behind it, David stepped down from front-rank politics. In his resignation statement, he said he had done it to ‘give Ed the space ... he needed to lead the party without distraction’. Discord: David said he had quit politics to give his brother Ed, right, 'space' to lead the Labour party . It had done little to soothe his feelings to hear the victorious Ed declare that Britain had not ‘heard the last’ of David, and that he would be ‘around in one way or another’. Like Banquo’s ghost at the feast, it seemed. The lasting damage became clear with the publication of the first biography of the new leader, Ed: The Milibands And The Making Of A Labour Leader. Written by two Left-wing writers, it was an uncompromising picture of the schism which made uncomfortable reading for all concerned. Among the book’s revelations was that David’s wife had cut Ed dead when they met behind the scenes following his unexpected victory. The book also suggested that the brothers’ mother, Marion, was ‘devastated’ by the rift and wished she had persuaded her younger son not to have stood. And the brothers, who once spoke several times a week, largely communicated through their offices. There were also revelations about the smears – Ed was dubbed a ‘Bennite’, ‘Red Ed’ and ‘Forrest Gump’ – supporters of both brothers waged in the run-up to the ballot. There was a public coming together for Ed’s marriage to lawyer Justine Thornton in May 2011. Then David tweeted: ‘Great day for Ed and Justine. They look very happy – congratulations from all the Milibands.’ Tellingly, though, David and Louise did not attend the reception at Ed’s north London home. But if David was devastated at this political assassination, he discovered that having more time on his hands could be lucrative. He embarked on the international lecture circuit, and took on ‘advisory’ roles, earning £70,000 for three-and-a-half days work with a Californian eco-technology company. And even as his brother struggled to impose a credible leadership, there were signs that the David Miliband camp was still manoeuvring for position. Leaks to the Guardian, which had supported David’s leadership bid, were a clear sign – such as the publication of emails which showed that the two Eds, Miliband and Balls, had plotted to oust Blair after Labour’s 2005 election victory. While David told Jeremy Paxman he no longer dreamed of being Prime Minister, his supporters privately suggested that he was biding his time. Unlike Ed, he would not throw down a direct challenge to a brother. But he would step in if other forces conspired to ensure that Ed lost the leadership. Brothers at war: The first autobiography of Ed Miliband made for uncomfortable reading . Today, with the Coalition in some disarray and Labour with a double-figure lead in the polls, that eventuality seems more unlikely. As one ally said yesterday: ‘David does not want to stand still any longer.’ Of course Miliband senior’s departure represents more than simply the end of his own ambitions here. Some have called it the final curtain on the New Labour project. As one insider said: ‘The New Labour corpse was just about twitching with David Miliband still around on the back benches, but that’s the end of it now.’ What’s left, of course, is a Labour Party ever more in hock to the unions, and with policies that seem designed to drag it away from the centre ground. So could David still have enough of a passion for politics to return from America and throw down the gauntlet once more? ‘It would be too weird for one Miliband to take over from another,’ says the source. ‘It would make Labour look like North Korea. And you have to remember that David Miliband is older than David Cameron. ‘Anyway, he is sick of the whole soap opera, psycho-drama that a minor role in British politics brings. I never thought he would stay until the next election. A former Foreign Secretary as back bench MP for South Shields? I don’t think so.’ And so the future lies westwards. Like Blair before him, David Miliband is using the contacts he made in his former life to forge a lucrative future. One in which he might still wield real power. ‘Everyone thinks the Clintons sorted his new job for him, and you would think David will be heavily involved in Hillary’s presidential election campaign in 2016,’ said another Westminster source. ‘She and David had a real chemistry when he was Foreign Secretary. She admitted she had a crush on him and could end up giving him an important job. ‘What price David Miliband in a senior role in the White House and Ed Miliband in No 10? Stranger things have happened in politics.’ But none that come quickly to mind. A new chapter in the David Miliband story begins, but the sibling rivalry continues unabated.","Former Foreign Secretary's wife Louise Shackelton encouraged decision .

Bombed to pieces in a raid which could have come straight out of the film Top Gun, it was a stark symbol of Saddam Hussein's rule over Iraq having been broken and destroyed. The Al Mansur, translated as ‘The Victor’, was the dictator’s £25million yacht which was blasted during the Iraq War in March 2003 - and 10 years on it is still a stark reminder of a fallen tyrant. The 400ft boat, weighing 7,400 tons, could seat 200 guests under a glass atrium in the middle and even had a secret escape route descending down from Hussein’s room into a submarine launch pod. Bombed: Saddam Hussein's private yacht, the Al Mansur, lies at the dockside in Basra on April 10 2003 . Blasted: The 400ft boat, weighing 7,400 tons, could seat 200 guests under a glass atrium in the middle . It was designed to Saddam's personal specifications and sumptuously decorated all over in marble, exotic woods, and with silver and gold fittings. Measuring 350ft long, the boat weighed 7,359 tons and looked more like a smart cross-Channel ferry than a private yacht. Saddam's love for al-Mansur was proved just five days before the war began. Despite all the other urgent war preparations, he had ordered the yacht . to be moved under a full naval guard from its normal berth in the far . southern port of Umm Qasr to Basra's inner harbour in a vain attempt to . offer it better . protection. But it was blown up in Basra harbour . by 500lb Mark 82 bombs during the Anglo-American invasion by two VF-2s . with TARPS (Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System) from USS . Constellation. These ‘Bounty Hunter’ F-14 Tomcats . attacked the yacht on March 27, 2003, more than 20 years after it had . been launched in 1982. It had escaped damage during the Iran-Iraq War of . 1980 to 1988. In profile: Saddam Hussein's presidential yacht took its name, Al Mansur, from an 8th century caliph described by historians as a merciless potentate who destroyed any threat to his rule . Up in the air: A U.S. F-14 Tomcat is pictured on the flight deck of the USS Harry S. Truman. It was F-14 planes that bombed Hussein's ship . Dictator: Saddam Hussein was hanged in Baghdad, Iraq, for crimes against humanity in December 2006 . The F-14s were flying near the . Euphrates River for a standard TARPS reconnaissance mission when a . British Army forward air controller asked them to attack the yacht, . reported The Aviationist blog. The . Combined Air Operations Center had realised that radio equipment on the . ship was being used for battlefield communication, although the vessel . had never been used for military purposes before. The ship had already been hit by a . shot from an S-3B Viking - a primarily anti-submarine plane - but it was . missed by two laser-guided bombs from F/A-18 Hornets, reported The . Aviationist. However, on March 27 the attack was led by a Tomcat team of Lt Mark Callari and Lt Jeff Sims, which dropped two bomb runs while Lt Pat Baker and Lt Sean Mathieson provided cover in the second F-14 above. They then switched positions and Baker and Mathienson dropped their bombs, hitting the hull above the water. Both planes headed back to the Constellation with the Al Mansur on fire. The team knew their attacks had not sunk the vessel. The bombs were designed with fuses intended for ground support, but not for sinking the ship - because they exploded before hitting. But the Al Mansur was rendered unusable by the bombs and was decommissioned almost three months later before being scrapped at Basra in 2005. In 2009 the boat's sister ship which was also built in secret for the Iraqi dictator went on sale for £17million. Decor aboard the floating palace - originally called Qadissivat . Saddam - included Arabesque arches, dark wood carvings, deep pile . carpets, and loose rugs woven in Islam's holiest cities. As well as other typically Muslim features, including prayer . rooms and ornate fountains, the Danish builders also installed . gold-tap bathrooms, whirl pools, steam rooms, and hi-tech . bathrooms. Unlike the Al Mansur, the Qadissivat Saddam was kept abroad after it was built in . Denmark in 1981 and was completely untouched by the . numerous wars Saddam was involved in during his reign. The statue of Muslim caliph Al Mansur, founder of Baghdad, sitting in a dreary square in the city . Al Mansur (712 to 775) was the second caliph of the Abbasid dynasty and is generally regarded as the real founder of the Abbasid caliphate. His father was a great-grandson of Mohammed's uncle Abbas. Al Mansur wiped out the last remnants of the deposed Omayyad dynasty, and cut the Abbasids free from the revolutionary movement that had brought them to power. He achieved power with the aid of Persian troops, and he established his new capital at Baghdad. Arab historian Al Masudi in Meadows of Gold recounts a number of anecdotes that present aspects of this caliph's character. He tells of a blind poet on two occasions reciting praise poems for the Umayyads to one he didn't realize was this Abbasid caliph. Al Mansur rewarded the poet for the verses. Al Masudi relates a tale of the arrow with verses inscribed on feathers and shaft arriving close to Al Mansur. These verses prompted him to investigate the situation of a notable from Hamadan unjustly imprisoned and release him. There is also the account of the foreboding verses Al Mansur saw written on the wall just before his death. A very impressive aspect of this caliph's character is that when he died he left in the treasury six hundred thousand dirhams and fourteen million dinars. In 2008, MBC 1 had depicted the life and leadership of Al Mansur in a historical series aired during the holy month of Ramadan.","Al Mansur ('The Victor') was bombed during Iraq War in March 2003 .

'Unethical': Judge Wade McCree reportedly got a witness pregnant after working on her case . A Detroit judge has admitted having sex in his chambers with a woman involved in a case he was presiding over. Michigan Judge Wade McCree  who is married, allegedly had an affair with  Geniene La'Shay Mott after she brought her ex-boyfriend into his court for failing to pay child support. She claims McCree got her pregnant and the lovers even allegedly exchanged text messages discussing potential punishments for her former boyfriend, Robert King, who served jail time following the case. McCree was previously in trouble for texting topless pictures of himself to a married bailiff. The judge, who was suspended last December, responded on Tuesday to a Judicial Tenure Commission (JTC) complaint against him. McCree wrote that he 'became involved in a sexual relationship with Ms. Mott that began in mid-June 2012,' as reported by WXYZ.com. McCree stated that he made 'the unfortunate decision to engage in a sexual relationship with Ms. Mott and also admits that on a few occasions, the relationship took place in his chambers.' Yet the Detroit judge maintained that he did not allow this affair to 'influence his judicial conduct or judgment' and says it did not impact any of his decisions regarding the case. In December alleged text messages between Mott and McCree shown to MyFoxDetroit.com  allegedly reveal the couple talking about King's punishment in the child support case, discussing his options. 'OK, The math will be based on his . failures since being placed on probation, but if U'r right. The threat . of jail will loosen his purse strings!' an alleged text from the judge said. In the same response to the complaint against him Judge McCree on Tuesday explained an alleged text message which referred to a 'docket from hell'. The judge claimed he sent this message to Mott in an attempt to flatter her rather than insult anyone in his courtroom. Affair: McCree allegedly promised Geniene La'Shay Mott, both pictured, he would get divorced and marry her . The alleged text reads: ''C'mon, U'r . talking about the 'docket from hell,' filled w/tatted up, overweight, . half-ass English speaking, gap tooth skank hoes ... and then you walk . in.' According to the Detroit Free Press, McCree's response acknowledges he 'may have' sent message like this but it wasn't sent from the bench. The JTC complaint accuses Judge McCree of sending inappropriate text messages while in the courtroom. These December accusations of the . affair came just three months after McCree was forced to apologize - and . barely held onto his job - after sending nude photographs of himself to . a female colleague. Coming forward with the latest claims, La'Shay mistress told FOX: 'I . met him as a litigant, a complaining witness in his courtroom, and he . stayed around after the case was over and that's when... our . relationship picked up. 'It went from being a summer fling . and just something to do... to falling in love, promises of marriage, me . getting pregnant, us buying a house together, name it.' After . McCree's wife found out about the baby, the couple separated but Mott . said she will keep the child, despite McCree offering her 'anything she . wanted' to have an abortion, she said. She added that she decided to speak out about the . affair after he went to the Wayne County prosecutor claiming she . was stalking him. Investigators found his complaints baseless, Fox . reported. Together: But he allegedly had a change of heart after his wife found out about her pregnancy . But there had been a time when she had wanted him around, Mott said, and described their sexual encounters in his . chambers, and how she had even gone with him to deliver his divorce papers. Another alleged message apparently shows his fears that the relationship will be discovered. 'My judicial tenure commission has me nervous, as you might . expect,' it read. 'I have to be real careful until this matter is put to rest. 'You . are the complaining witness on a case that is before me. Naturally if it . got out that we were seeing each other before your BD's [baby daddy]'s . case closed everybody could be in deep s***. Speaking out: Mott said she decided to speak to Fox News about the affair after McCree went to a prosecutor to claim she was stalking him - claims which investigators found were baseless . 'Why you want to spend time . with a man like me remains a mystery but if you'll have me... then as Bill Withers said, 'use me up!' SMOOCHES.' And further messages show he had a change of heart about the relationship and buying a home together after McCree's wife, Laverne, found out about . the pregnancy. Under fire: He previously had to apologise for sending topless pictures to a colleague . 'I WANT . (AND SO DOES LAVERNE) THIS TERMINATION,' one text read. 'U'LL GET . WHATEVER U WANT 4 IT! I'VE BEEN CLEAR ON IT FROM THE GET GO! WHATEVER U . WANT YOU SHALL HAVE!' Mott said she realised people who heard about her situation would tell her 'she knew what she was getting into messing with a married man'. But . 'I believed him with everything,' she said. 'His actions showed me that . he was leaving. He filed for divorce. I mean, there was nothing to say . that we weren't moving forward.' McCree barely held on to his job . after it emerged he had sent topless pictures of himself to a court . employee. McCree admitted in April 2012 that he had sent the picture to bailiff LaDawnn Malone in 2006 and initially boasted about physique, memorably saying: 'I've got no shame in my game.' 'I've sent that out to other women,' he said. 'There's nothing nude about it. I'm in no more clothes than I'll be at . the Y this afternoon when I swim my mile.' But . the judge soon backtracked and issued a public apology, saying: 'I am . embarrassed and truly sorry for my actions, which have hurt and caused . great pain to my family.' A . ruling issued by the Michigan Supreme Court allowed McCree to . keep his job, but ordered that he be publicly censured for his antics. Outrage: She had been in court over child support from her ex partner, Robert King (pictured), and allegedly discussed his potential punishments over texts with the judge while the case continued . The . court declared that the judge 'conducted himself in a flippant manner . and did not give the interview the seriousness he should have. He brought shame and obloquy to the judiciary.' The bailiff's husband added: 'It's totally inappropriate. It says a lot . that he's flawed. 'He's . been looked upon as some great figure but, as you can see according to . the picture, you see what he's really all about. 'What kind of man would . send this to a married woman, knowing he's a married man himself?'","Judge Wade McCree admits he had a sexual relationship with Geniene La'Shay that also took place in his chambers .

Tobias Dustin Summers, a transient with a long criminal record, was also identified by authorities over the weekend as a suspect in the case. Previous convictions: Tobias Dustin Summers, 30, a transient with a long criminal record was named as a suspect last week . Police initially said they were looking for two suspects but noted they were focusing their efforts on Summers. The connection between Summers and Martinez wasn't immediately clear. The girl was abducted around 3am last Wednesday and found 12 hours later wandering near a Starbucks several miles away. Face of evil: Summers' tattoo - he is believed to have abducted a ten-year-old girl last week . She was barefoot, had bruises and scratches, and wasn't wearing the same clothes she had on when she vanished. Investigators have said they believe the girl was driven around the San Fernando Valley in a couple of cars and taken to at least two locations, including a storage facility, before she was released. The Los Angeles Times reported that law enforcement sources said the girl was sexually assaulted. Police . noted Summers had a criminal history dating back to 2002 and had been . arrested for robbery, grand theft auto, possession of explosives and . kidnapping. Authorities haven't given a motive for the kidnapping. They don't believe Summers and the family knew one another. Summers was believed to have been let out of prison as part of a program to ease overcrowding in California jails. Anyone with information on Summers is asked to call the Robbery Homicide tipline at 213-486-6890.  Anyone who has a sighting of Summers is urged to call 911 immediately.

A toddler who slipped outside through a doggie door was mauled to death by her family's seven pit bulls in the backyard while the attack went unnoticed by the child's mother and other relatives inside their home, a southeast Georgia sheriff said on Thursday. Bryan County Sheriff Clyde Smith said the child's grandmother told investigators she was lying in bed when she heard the pit bulls and pit bull mixes barking, and she looked outside her window to see them dragging the girl. Smith said she began yelling, ‘They're killing Monica!’ Tragically it was too late. Monica Renee Laminack, who would have turned two in June, was dead by the time an ambulance arrived on Wednesday evening. Monica Renee Laminack, who would have turned two in June, as mauled to death by her family's seven pit bulls in the backyard of their Georgia home . ‘The 18-year-old mother ... picked the child up and stayed with it, but she knew the child was dead at that time,’ the sheriff said. Animal control officers used drugs to euthanize the dogs at the home on a rural road in tiny Ellabell, about 30 miles west of Savannah. Deputies found the girl's shoes, diaper and shredded clothing scattered across the fenced-in yard, Smith said. ‘They had dragged the child all over the yard. ... They tore her clothes all up,’ Smith said. Mom Summer Laminack, 18, 'picked the child up and stayed with it, but she knew the child was dead at that time,' the sheriff said . Deputies found Monica's shoes, diaper and shredded clothing scattered across the fenced-in yard after the horrific attack . The toddler lived in a modest, two-story house tucked away from the main road. The sheriff said four generations of the same family shared the home, including the child's 18-year-old mother, grandparents and two uncles who are still young boys. The girl's grandmother, Michelle McIntyre, sat weeping on the tailgate of a pickup outside the home Thursday. Summer Laminack, the child's mother, sat next to her staring silently at the ground. ‘She's in shock,’ Barbara Brauda, a friend who was visiting the family, told The Associated Press before a man approached and asked a reporter to leave the property. ‘She hasn't been doing a whole lot of crying because she's still numb.’ Monica Renee Laminack, who would have turned two, was killed by family pit bulls at this Georgia home on Wednesday night . The sheriff said at least three adult relatives were inside the home when the dogs killed the girl outside. No criminal charges had been filed . Thursday. Smith said he expects charges will be brought after he's had a . chance to discuss the case with the district attorney and the girl's . family has been given time to hold her funeral. ‘I can see child neglect at the very minimum,’ Smith said. Relatives told investigators the dogs that mauled the child were essentially family pets - a mother dog and six offspring from a litter she had about 16 months ago, the sheriff said. The dogs had their own doggie doors that let them come in and out of the house as they pleased. The family told deputies the dogs had never attacked a person, though one of them might have killed a cat, Smith said. He said relatives insisted the toddler would play with the dogs and even ‘use them as pillows while watching TV.’ Vicious attack: The two-year-old girl was mauled to death by seven pit bulls (not pictured), who were later put to death . Smith said the dogs looked healthy and well-fed, and investigators found no signs they were being used as fighting dogs by their owners. ‘They said they have never been aggressive to other people,’ he said. ‘Why they got started I have no idea.’ Christy Lamica lives across the street from the home where the girl was killed. She said she's seen neighbors walking pit bulls on leashes along the street but isn't sure where the owners live. ‘Everybody on this street has dogs, and everybody pretty much keeps to themselves,’ said Lamica, who said she doesn't know the family of the mauled toddler. ‘Their dogs don't get out, and we never hear anything from them. I'm home all day, and I've never had issues.’ According to officials, the family had nine dogs in total, and the child often played with all of them. The two dogs that were not involved in the attack were spared. They were not pit bulls.","Monica Renee Laminack slipped unnoticed into the backyard of her family's home and was set upon by the seven pit bulls .

The chancellor's holiday follows weeks of protest in Cyprus, . focused on the German leader, over the terms of a euro zone rescue . package for the island’s banks.

His daughter Marianna said Chanellor Merkel had lunch with the family, adding the visit was a 'pleasure' But the Chancellor has been urged to consider the impact of the current economic crisis on those in difficulty like failed businesses and young unemployed during her Easter holiday . First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said in televised remarks that . it would be a 'great pity' if Russians lose their money in Cyprus, but . added that the Cabinet won't take any action to soften the blow.

But while the weather might be cheerful, the UK is bare of any blooms, because of the spate of bad weather. The unseasonably cold winter has wreaked havoc on flower crops, causing them to bloom by up to four late. Last year a couple were pictured basking in glorious sunshine amid of field vibrant daffodils in Northumberland - a stark contrast to the bleak picture this year .

But it will stay cold with frosty nights and sub-zero temperatures forecast for Saturday night. Rural Wales is expected to experience lows of -3C to -4C, and elsewhere the thermometer will drop to -1C and -2C. Frank Saunders, Met Office Chief . Forecaster, said: 'The prospect of drier and brighter weather will be a . welcome relief for many but the prolonged low temperatures will mean . that any lying snow will be slow to thaw.

The United States has sent F-22 stealth fighter jets to join South Korean military exercises in a show of support for Seoul as it urged North Korea to restrain itself from making threats against the South and its allies. Yesterday, the North's top decision-making body said nuclear weapons are 'treasure' and the . 'nation's life' and will not be traded for billions of dollars, the . latest in a series of provocative statements from the rogue state. '[North Korea] will achieve nothing by . threats or provocations, which will only further isolate North Korea and . undermine international efforts to ensure peace and stability in . north-east Asia,' the US said in a statement. Scroll down for video . North Korea, led by Kim Jong-un, has stepped up its fighting talk with a series of warnings and threats in recent weeks . The United States has responded to the threats by sending F-22 Raptors to join South Korean military exercises (file photo) Sabre-rattling on the Korean peninsula also . drew a plea for peace from Pope Francis, who in his first Easter Sunday . address called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. 'Peace in Asia, above all on the . Korean peninsula: may disagreements be overcome and a renewed spirit of . reconciliation grow,' he said. After the North's young leader Kim Jong-un chaired his first plenary meeting of the ruling Worker's Party central committee yesterday, a statement to the official KCNA news agency said the country's nuclear weapons 'are neither a political . bargaining chip nor a thing for economic dealings to be presented to . the place of dialogue or be put on the table of negotiations aimed at . forcing [Pyongyang] to disarm itself'. On Saturday, North Korea said it was entering a 'state of war' with South Korea but the statement was played down by Seoul and the US as the latest piece of 'tough talk' from Pyongyang. Tensions have been high on the Korean peninsula since Kim ordered its third nuclear weapons test in February, breaching United Nations sanctions and ignoring warnings from China, its closest ally, not to do so. The test drew further UN and bilateral sanctions designed to pressure North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program. Instead, Pyongyang has responded with a campaign of threats, including a vow to launch nuclear weapons at the United States, and a series of warnings. Pope Francis called for a diplomatic solution to tensions in the Korean peninsula in his Easter Sunday address yesterday . An unknown number of radar-evading F-22 Raptors were deployed to Osan Air Base, the main US Air Force base in South Korea, from Japan to take part in the annual joint Foal Eagle military drills, which prepare the allies to defend the South from a North Korean attack. On Thursday, the United States performed a rare show of force aimed at the North by dropping dummy munitions from two B-2 Spirit stealth bombers on practice runs over South Korea, which led to Kim putting the North's missile units on standby to attack American military bases in the South and the Pacific. The two Koreas have been in a state of war since the truce that ended their 1950-53 conflict. Despite the threats from the North, few believe Pyongyang will risk near-certain defeat by restarting a full-scale war. On Saturday, North Korea declared it was entering a 'state of war' with the South . Analysts say the threats are more likely to be efforts . to provoke softer policies toward Pyongyang from a new government in . Seoul, to win diplomatic talks with Washington that could get more aid for the North . and to strengthen the young North Korean leader's image and . military credentials at home. Japan's top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga condemned North Korea for 'aggressive provocation' after Kim's ruling party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, identified US military bases in Japan as targets for attack. Pyongyang justifies its own nuclear pursuits largely on a perceived threat from the US. The White House says the United States . is taking North Korea's threats seriously, but has also noted .

The prosecutor's decision today to seek the death penalty for Dark Knight 'killer' James Holmes has been applauded by victims and friends of victims who say they want to watch him die. One friend of Holmes' 12 victims even said he wants to watch the alleged killer die. 'I don't know if it's painful. I want him dead. I just want to be there in the room when he dies,' Bryan Beard told ABC outside the Colorado courthouse. 'He took one of my friends from this Earth. Death equals death.' Beard's close friend Alex Sullivan was one of the 12 people killed in the shooting on July 20 last year. It was his 27th birthday. Scroll down for video .

Parents: Robert and Arlene Holmes arrive at district court for a hearing in the case of their son, Aurora theater shooting suspect James Holmes, in Centennial, Colorado today . Blank: Holmes sat silently through last week's . proceedings. He wore a red jail jumpsuit and sported a thick, bushy . beard and unkempt dark brown hair . Should Dark Knight 'killer' James Holmes get the death penalty? Holmes showed no . reaction when the announcement was made in court today. His parents were . also at the hearing and held hands tightly throughout. Once the death penalty decision was made, his father nodded his head and put his arm around his wife. DA George Brauchler said: 'It is my determination and my intention that in this case, for James Eagan Holmes, justice is death.' He . said he personally spoke to 60 victims' relatives. 800 survivors and . victim's relatives were contacted in total for their input into the . decision. Holmes is charged with 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and other offenses in connection with the attack. He is scheduled to go on trial August 5. His lawyers are expected to ask to postpone that date if the case moves forward. Behind-the-scenes maneuvering erupted . into a public quarrel between prosecutors and the defense over Holmes' public offer to plead guilty last week. Victim Pierce O'Farrill, who was shot three times, said: 'It could be ten . or 15 years before he's executed. I would be in my 40s and I'm planning . to have a family, and the thought of having to look back and reliving . everything at that point in my life, it would be difficult,' he said. Holmes is accused . of meticulously planning and brutally executing a plan to attack a . Colorado movie theater at midnight during a showing of the latest Batman . movie, killing 12 people and injuring 70. Defense lawyers . revealed in a court filing last week that Holmes would plead guilty if . prosecutors allowed him to live out his days in prison with no chance of . parole instead of having him put to death. That prompted an angry response from prosecutors, who called it an attempt to gin up public support for a plea deal. Prosecutors also said the defense has repeatedly refused to give them the information they need to evaluate the plea agreement. April 1: District Attorney George Brauchler arrives at district court for the hearing, left, and two women embrace after he announces they will seek the death penalty . Stalling: The former graduate student's defense team said he was not ready to enter a plea so the judge entered one for him . After effects: Family members and victims arrive at district court for the arraignment of James Holmes, Aurora theater shooting suspect, in Centennial . Suspect: Holmes is accused of killing 12 people at an Aurora movie theater on July 20 . If Holmes is . sentenced to prison, the state Department of Corrections would determine . what kind of mental health care he gets, said Alison Morgan, a . department spokeswoman. A third of the . state's inmates have moderate to severe mental illness, and the prison . system has an extensive mental health division with a 250-bed facility . for the acutely mental ill, she said. Inmates can be . sent to the state mental hospital in Pueblo – where people found not . guilty by reason of insanity are committed – but the stay is temporary, . and they are returned to the prison system after treatment, she said. A plea bargain would bring finality to the case fairly . early so victims and their families can avoid the prolonged trauma of not . knowing what will happen, said Dan Recht, a past president of the Colorado . Criminal Defense Bar. ‘The defense, by making this public pleading, is reaching . out to the victims' families,’ he said. Holmes last appeared in court in mid-March. As he has done in past hearings, Holmes . sat silently through the proceedings. He wore a red jail jumpsuit . and sported a thick, bushy beard and unkempt dark brown hair. In the dock: Colorado shooter James . Holmes appears confused while making his first court appearance at the . Arapahoe County on July 23 . When he walked into the courtroom, he . looked at his parents, James and Arlene Holmes. They sat silently at the . front of the room and left without comment after the hearing. His parents have been in . relative hiding since the shooting and that was the first court proceeding that they had attended. During the hearing, defense attorney . Daniel King said he could not advise Holmes on what plea to enter. He . said the defense wasn't ready despite previous delays — prompting . prosecutors to object. If . a jury agrees he is insane, Holmes would be committed indefinitely to a . state mental hospital. There would be a remote and unlikely chance he . could be freed one day if doctors find his sanity has been restored. Prosecutors . laid out a case that Holmes methodically planned the shooting for . months, amassing an arsenal and elaborately booby-trapping his apartment . to kill anyone who tried to enter.

Doctors have cleared fluid from Nelson Mandela's lungs after the former president had a recurrence of pneumonia . Nelson Mandela was expected to spend a fourth day in hospital in South Africa today recovering from pneumonia. Doctors in Pretoria removed pleural fluid from his lungs yesterday to ease his breathing, but worries continue for the health of the frail 94-year-old. The former South African president suffers from a recurring lung condition as the result of tuberculosis contracted during his 27 years’ imprisonment on Robben Island by the apartheid government. Mr Mandela spent 18 days in hospital over the Christmas period with a respiratory infection, and also had gallstones removed. He has spent three periods in hospital over the past four months. Yesterday, South African presidential spokesman Mac Maharaj said that Mr Mandela was ‘responding well and is in good spirits’. He said fluid had been tapped from his lungs and that he would remain under observation. The president's office thanked all who have prayed for Mr Mandela and his family and have sent messages of support. Mr Mandela was admitted to a hospital in the capital, Pretoria, late on Wednesday night. It was his third admission to hospital since December, when he was treated for a lung infection and also underwent a procedure to remove gallstones. Mr Mandela spent 18 days on a ward in December undergoing . treatment for a lung infection and gallstones surgery. It was his longest stay in hospital . since 1990, when he was released from  prison after serving 27 years for . conspiring to overthrow the white-minority apartheid government.

He had spent 27 years in prison under the apartheid regime and after his release in 1990 was widely credited with averting even greater bloodshed by helping the country in the transition to democratic rule.

Feminism has failed working class women by focussing too much on gender equality in high profile roles, according to new research. Eight out of 10 married women still do more housework than their husbands, according to the research by . think-tank Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), while just one in 10 married . men do an equal amount and 13 per cent do more. Despite this, the number of 'house husbands' in . Britain trebled over the last 15 years, with 62,000 men staying at home . to care for their family and remaining economically inactive. While the average gap between the earnings of men and women has narrowed in the last 50 years, differences between professional and unskilled women are significantly higher than those between men, a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) found. With or without a university degree, men continue to earn more than their female counterparts. But researchers found that women with a degree born in 1958 earned nearly three times as much as women in unskilled jobs born in the same year - compared to a difference of less than half between men in the same groups. Dalia Ben-Galim, IPPR associate director, said: 'While feminism has delivered for some professional women, other women have been left behind. 'Many of the advances for women at the top have masked inequality at the bottom. 'The ""break-the-glass-ceiling"" approach that simply promotes ""women in the boardroom"" has not been as successful in changing family-friendly working culture or providing opportunities for other women to advance. 'Gender still has a strong independent impact on women's earnings prospects - but class, education and occupational backgrounds are stronger determinants of a woman's progression and earnings prospects. Motherhood was also a key factor, . with women who had children earlier seeing their earnings prospects . decrease compared to those who postponed forming a family, the study . found. For men the reverse was true, as fathers enjoyed a 'fatherhood pay bonus' which saw them earn more than men without children. The . IPPR called for a more progressive parental leave system, more . affordable and accessible childcare and better paid part-time jobs to . address these issues. It . also warned against the 'decoy effect' of focussing on women in high . profile positions, and said the breaking down of stereotypes should be . the priority.

From jokes and jibes aimed at rival teams, to passionate tributes to their own clubs, football fans have long used banners as a means of getting their message across. Now a UK academic has hailed the humble football banner as an 'art form', pointing out that supporters are becoming increasingly clever and creative when it comes to devising their slogans. Dr Jamie Cleland said that, while the intelligence of sports fans is often 'downplayed', the messages adorning football stands are just as likely to be witty political puns as crude jokes at other teams' expense. Witty: Irish football fans give their take on the EU bailout of their debt-stricken country at a Euro 2012 fixture . The Loughborough University professor highlighted a group of Ireland fans who turned up at the Euro 2012 tournament bearing a flag emblazoned with the phrase: 'Angela Merkel thinks we're at work'. The cheeky banner name-checking the German Chancellor was a reference to the EU bailout of the debt-stricken country, and made headlines during the football tournament. 'Fans respond to the news agenda of the day,' said the lecturer, who has conducted research into football fan-dom. 'Sports fans get down-played as not necessarily being very intelligent, but football fans can be very creative.' Dr Cleland also recalled seeing a sign that read 'MUFC AAA rating' in the stands at Old Trafford in the days after the UK was stripped of its prized triple A credit rating. The professor said the rise of social media meant a clever banner could give a football fan access to a form of short-term fame, as pictures of a popular banner could quickly go viral on Twitter or Facebook.

At the time they were taken television fame may have seemed light years away, but these pictures show that Doctor Who star Matt Smith was always destined  for success. The future Time Lord is seen aged 17 in a school production taking on the demanding role of doomed 12th Century archbishop Thomas Becket – the murder of whom King Henry is said to have inspired with his outburst: Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest? But despite the young Smith already displaying remarkable stage presence, his teachers at Northampton School for Boys reveal he was a reluctant star. Matt Smith pictured in 2000 playing doomed archbishop Thomas Becket in a production of Murder in the Cathedral at Northampthon School for Boys . Smith, seen in another school production, had to be persuaded he was good enough to make acting his career, according to his former drama teacher . Former headteacher Rod Goldswain said: ‘As soon as Matt stepped on the stage the audience were enthralled, but it took quite a bit of convincing from his drama teacher to get him to take part. ‘What particularly sticks out in my mind was his performance in the Pirates Of Penzance. He was 16, playing the Pirate King, and strolling around the stage ad-libbing with the audience. It was fantastic.’ Smith, now 30 – who returned to our screens as the 11th Doctor last night – also had school roles in West Side Story and Twelve Angry Men. His former drama teacher, Jerry Hardingham, said: ‘Matt is one of the only students that we have ever had to persuade to believe he could be an actor and that he should consider it as a career.

Home Secretary Theresa May announced the UK Border Agency would be split into two after acknowledging it was 'not good enough' An Iranian convict with no permission to be in Britain is fighting to stay because of human rights legislation, despite racking up 40 offences including theft and assault. Davodreza Abasbahi-Gotti, 37, came to the UK in 2002 and has already had 18 convictions and has served three prison sentences during that time. His crimes include assaulting a police officer, theft, and driving while disqualified on multiple occasions. He has also been convicted for driving without tax or insurance numerous times, according to the Sunday Times. Abasbahi-Gotti has launched a legal bid to be allowed to stay in Britain because he is a drug addict and suffers depression stemming from developed adjustment disorder. Legal-aid funded lawyers acting for the criminal said he has 'psychiatric medical conditions including a dependency disorder on opiates', although it is not clear whether the drugs are prescribed or illegal substances. The human rights claim is his second attempt to be allowed to stay in Britain after the 37-year-old initially argued deportation would breach his right for respect to private and family life. But it emerged last week that he lied about having a wife and two children here and in fact only has three siblings who arrived less than two years ago. Abasbahi-Gotti, who lives in a tax-payer funded house in Uxbridge, west London, expressed his gratitude to the government for supporting him during his legal battle to remain in the UK. 'They are looking after me very good. They gave me a house and they look after me,' he said. Muslim Cleric Abu Qatada has avoided deportation again in his latest appeal . Abasbahi-Gotti admits most of his 40 offences committed over his decade in the UK but denied the assault charge claiming the injury occurred when he was evading arrest. 'They tried to catch me and I ran away and the police officer he fell down and they were saying to me ""You assaulted a police officer"".' Abasbahi-Gotti is said to have used more than 20 aliases since arriving in the UK, but says this was because of repeated spelling mistakes by police. Abasbahi-Gotti is one of 4,000 foreign . criminals living in the UK who are thought to be using human rights laws . to fight deportation. The Home Secretary Theresa May announced last week that the UK Border Agency would be split into two parts after acknowledging its performance was 'not good enough.' A report by MPs said the backlog of immigration cases would take 24 years to clear if the rate of dealing with claims stays the same.

He is the judge who thinks  burglars are ‘courageous’ – an opinion which earned him an official reprimand for damaging public confidence in the courts. Now Peter Bowers is at the centre of another controversy, this time for letting a convicted paedophile skip jail because he thought he ‘would suffer very badly’ in prison. In a move which has outraged campaigners for victims of child abuse, the judge allowed 24-year-old child-porn addict Mark Martin to walk free, despite the fact that he is a repeat offender. 'Strange decision': Pervert Mark Martin (pictured) has been spared jail by a controversial judge despite being caught with child porn while already on a suspended prison sentence . 'Remarkably short-sighted': Judge Peter Bowers (left) has been criticised for refusing to jail Martin because he would 'suffer badly' in prison . Martin was caught for the second time . with a catalogue of hardcore indecent images of young boys and girls on . his mobile phone – a crime which even he admitted he ‘fully expected’ to . go prison for. But Judge Bowers gave him a suspended . sentence – the second Martin has received – because he feared he . wouldn’t ‘cope’ with jail. Judge Bowers told Martin: ‘I have read . with some concern about you, and this addiction you have had of looking . at pornography of little children. ‘I think you would suffer very badly in prison and I don’t think, at the moment, it is necessary to send you there today. Peter Bowers, 67, a married father-of-three, has been no stranger to controversy in his 20-year career as a judge. Three years ago, he allowed a violent thug to walk free from court despite admitting that the public think judges are 'going mad' for passing soft sentences. In another case, he told a man who led police on a ten-mile car chase after trying to kill himself: 'Next time you want to commit suicide find somewhere quiet to do it.' More recently, he has made contradictory comments about burglary sentencing. In May last year, he criticised sentencing guidelines that let first-time burglars escape with a 'slap across the wrist'. But weeks later, he allowed a man with almost 80 crimes on his record to walk free for a burglary committed four days after his release from prison, telling the court: ‘I must be getting soft in my old age.’ ‘I am going to give you another . suspended sentence, but you have got to understand it is the very last . chance you are ever going to get.’ In September last year, Judge Bowers . caused public outrage for praising the ‘courage’ of serial burglar . Richard Rochford, 26, and letting him off with a suspended sentence. He told him: ‘It takes a huge amount . of courage, as far as I can see, for somebody to burgle somebody’s . house. I wouldn’t have the nerve.’ He was criticised for his choice of words, which were branded a ‘serious error of judgment’. Following an investigation, the Lord . Chancellor Chris Grayling and Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge upheld . complaints about the comments and issued  Judge Bowers with a reprimand . for his remarks which had ‘damaged public confidence in the judicial . process’. In the latest case, he was presented . with Martin, from Hartlepool, who had been already let off by a court . after being caught with child porn in 2009. He was handed an eight-month prison . sentence, suspended for two years, which allowed him to walk free as . long as he did not offend again during the supervision period. He was told to go on a sex offenders’ treatment programme to cure his ‘addiction’ and had to allow police . officers access to his computer. Then last week, Teesside Crown Court . heard how police visited his home in February last year to check on his . internet activity on his computer and mobile phone. Prosecutor Sue Jacobs told the court . that a total of 48 still and moving images of child abuse – some in the . worst category – were found on his phone. Although he was caught for a second . time after his first sentence had run its course, police could tell from . the image files that some had been downloaded within the two-year time . frame of the initial suspended sentence. Judge Bowers told him: ‘You . present quite a problem for me because, in theory, you had breached the . suspended sentence. ‘As most people will know, if  people . do breach a suspended sentence, then it is almost inevitable they go . straight away to prison.’ But in a highly unusual move, Judge . Bowers then imposed a 12-month jail sentence, suspended for two years, . with probation service supervision. The National Association of People Abused in Childhood last night described the sentence as ‘strange by any standards’. Dr Jon Bird, from the charity, said: . ‘This is remarkably short-sighted, in my opinion. In prison this kind of . offender would be segregated for his protection. ‘I imagine he is at home laughing about how he fooled a judge. ‘There has to be a strong deterrent enforced on these criminals who cause so much pain to their victims.’ Yesterday, Martin said outside his flat: ‘Obviously I didn’t want to go to prison but I went to court fully expecting to. ‘He said I couldn’t have coped in prison but this is my definite last chance. ‘I have definitely learned my  lesson and won’t do it again.’","Judge Peters Bowers claimed Mark Martin would 'suffer badly' if sent down .

An armed robber who broke out of prison in a desperate bid to see his cancer-stricken grandson has been jailed for just six more months after a judge said his case was 'exceptional'. John Cadby scaled a 10ft wall after being denied home leave to visit the toddler. The child's family were considering sending him to America for treatment and Cadby feared he would never see the 22-month-old again, a court heard. Cadby, of no fixed address, spent 11 days on the run after escaping from HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire on January 21. He was serving a six-year sentence imposed in October 2010 for a botched robbery in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham. On that occasion, police responding to reports of a man armed with an axe in Boldmere Road restrained Cadby after he jumped into a passing car and ordered the terrified driver to help him flee. Cadby, who was recaptured at a house in Tile Cross, Birmingham, admitted escaping from custody at Birmingham Crown Court. But he received only an extra six months in jail after Judge Stuart Rafferty QC decided the case was 'exceptional'. The judge told Cadby: 'I accept entirely that it had weighed heavily on your mind that your grandson was ill and may go to America and you may never see him again.' The court heard Cadby had also been sent to the higher-security Birmingham Prison after he was tracked down. Warren Stanier, prosecuting, said Cadby escaped after grappling with a guard at Sudbury, an open prison. Cadby scaled a 10ft wall at HMP Sudbury in Derbyshire after being denied home leave to visit the 22-month-old toddler . Anthony Potter, defending, said his grandson had been at Birmingham Children's Hospital since last October. The boy had a particularly aggressive form of cancer and it had been proposed to send him to the U.S., Mr Potter added. He said Cadby's request for home leave had been refused before he took the 'stupid' decision to escape. Sudbury hit the headlines in June, 2011 when it emerged more than 100 criminals had escaped in the previous four years.","John Cadby scaled 10ft wall after being denied home leave to visit toddler .

Mr Thatcher died aged 78 on February 24, after a two-week spell in hospital following a fall at his home in the Bristol neighbourhood of Southville. His daughters tried to remove his wedding ring at the time, but were unable to do so because his hands were so swollen. However, when an undertaker went to the hospital to pick up Mr Thatcher's body, the ring had gone missing. The family also claims that around £5 in cash vanished from the locker besides the pensioner's hospital bed. 'The ring was stuck on his finger because his fingers were swollen,' his daughter Gloria Bond said. 'We managed to get another ring off, but not that one. 'When I arranged the funeral they asked if he still had any jewellery on him and I said about the ring on his wedding finger. She told me that when he was brought back they would be in touch for us to pick them up straight away because they didn't like to keep anything like that. 'They rang me on March 8 and told me they had Dad there but that he didn't have the ring on his finger. My jaw just dropped and I couldn't actually speak.' Probe: Officials at the Bristol Royal Infirmary are currently investigating the upsetting incident . Mrs Bond's husband Gerald said that after Mr Thatcher died, a nurse put some tape around the ring to stop it slipping off his finger. He added: 'We are not worried about the cost of the ring - we know we are not going to get it back because it has probably been melted down now, we are more concerned about it happening to other people. 'It is quite distressing that someone took the ring off someone's finger after they had died and basically pinched it.' Avon and Somerset Police confirmed they were aware of the alleged incident, adding: 'Investigations are currently ongoing and we are working to establish the whereabouts of the item concerned.' The University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, said they were taking the incident 'extremely seriously'. Chief nurse Helen Morgan said: 'We are extremely sorry to hear about the Thatcher family's distressing experience. 'We are taking this matter extremely seriously and appreciate that this is a very difficult time for them. 'We are working with the family and our staff to investigate thoroughly and will share our findings with them once the investigation is complete.'","Clive Thatcher, 78, died at Bristol Royal Infirmary in February after a fall .

High street guru Mary Portas has spoken of her joy after she became a mother for the third time, aged 52. The Government's Queen of the Shops announced civil partner Melanie Rickey, a journalist, gave birth to Horatio six months ago after he was conceived via IVF with an anonymous donor. Ms Portas, who already has two teenage children, Verity and Mylo, from her first marriage, said: 'It's wonderful. I'd forgotten how much laughter there is — even at 5.45 in the morning when you feel like death. 'Going in to pick up a child is one of the most special things in the world.' The business champion said she felt more confident being a mother the third time around. 'I don't think you get as stressed when you're older,' she said. 'I kind of know what I'm doing more.' In a wide-ranging interview with the Daily Mail, the star spoke about how her own upbringing has shaped her parental ethos. 'I had an extraordinarily strong mother,' she said. 'The fundamentals of parenting are about love, structure, and knowing where you are in the world. 'I had that. I liken it to being out on the sea and knowing you have to get to land.' Ms . Portas runs a brand-management company and writes a weekly magazine . column, which inspired the BBC television series, Mary Queen of Shops. She . was also commissioned by the Government to lead a review of Britain's . high streets, but she said: 'Of all the things I have done, being a . mother is the most important, and the one I'm most proud of.' Ms Portas divorced from husband Graham in 2003 and entered into a civil partnership with Ms Rickey in 2010, whom she met at a Royal College of Art dinner. After combining retail with the world of TV in 2007 with reality series Mary Queen Of Shops, Secret Shopper and Mary's Bottom Line, she took what even she says was a 'slightly crazy' swerve two years ago by accepting an invitation from the Government to write recommendations on how to revive high streets, which resulted in the Portas Review and a pilot programme for change. Communities up and down the country were invited to become Portas Pilots by applying for grants for regeneration, and Ms Portas has off her own back visited many to see how they are implementing the ideas. In all, £1.2 million has been made available, with 12 towns benefiting from big pay-outs and nearly 400 more being offered advice.

Season tickets and Oyster cards could soon be relics of the past after proposals have been drawn up to introduce a phone and credit card payment system for train travel . In the longer term, customers will also be able to use their phones instead of tickets and Oyster cards . The scheme will launch in London at the end of this year, before being rolled out to the rest of the rail network - starting with the South- East - the Independent reports. It will work by using the contactless payment systems which are embedded in most new credit and debit cards. The technology will soon also be available in smartphones. Commuters will be able to buy a ticket . online or on their phone then use either the phone or credit card to . electronically access ticket barriers. Transport Secretary Patrick Mcloughlin said buying tickets online is currently 'too complicated' London Underground . customers will be able to use their normal bank card to open gates on the Tube . It is believed the scheme will eventually replace the Oyster card system, which has enjoyed huge success since its launch in 2003. Rail users will also no longer need to buy weekly or monthly season tickets. The system will calculate when a customer's travel has exceeded the cost of those tickets - and stop charging. The Transport Secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, said: 'The journey from buying tickets online to taking your seat on the train is too complicated at the moment. 'By harnessing the latest technology to make the ticketing process easier, we can vastly improve the passenger experience.' The DfT is also considering budget pricing to manage demand across the rail network more effectively, in a similar way to airlines. TfL is also working on technology which can tell passengers waiting at a station to see how full trains are, and decide whether to instead wait for the next one.","Commuters will be able to use their credit card to open platform barriers .

The fight in Newport, South Carolina on Sunday afternoon seems to have begun when the young men's Chevrolet truck cut off the Turners' Toyota SUV in a nearby town. The couple followed the other drivers for 25 miles, the victims claim, before both cars pulled up outside a house in Newport. While the video footage mostly shows Mr Berry and Mr Brotzman attacking Mr Turner, they insist that he threw the first punch.

'She's got the gun, hands it to him and her facial expression is completely calm,' Mr Berry continued. 'Even when he racks the gun, accidentally discharges, her face doesn't even flinch. 'She doesn't even blink. He discharged the weapon and left.' According to local police, Mr Turner then fired at Mr Berry's truck and hit a nearby house.

Its magnificent Edwardian rooms have lain empty and dilapidated for more than twenty years. But visitors to the Dyffryn estate in Wales will no longer have to peer through its mansion's dusty windows for a glimpse of grandeur, as the house prepares to open its doors once more. After spells as a conference centre and police training facility, the 52-room property has undergone an extensive multimillion pound refurbishment. Scroll down for video . Open again: Students from Swansea Metropolitan University view a fresco by Scottish artist Thomas Wallace Hay on a ceiling in Dyffryn House, near Cardiff, Wales, which will be reopened to the public this week . Refurbishment: The historic mansion has undergone a multimillion pound refurbishment after being taken over by the National Trust . Splendour: The 52-room house was originally built in 1893 . Impressive: Five room have been restored in by the National Trust, including this one featuring a fresco by Scottish artist Thomas Wallace Hay . The grade-II listed mansion, located in the Vale of Glamorgan, has not been entirely restored to its former glory, with only five rooms accessible to the public when the house reopens on Friday. The mansion's history has remained something of a secret since being built in 1893 on the 2,000 acre estate - designed to be a secluded family home but within close proximity to the Welsh capital Cardiff. While the mansion's interior has long remained something of a mystery, many will be familiar with its exterior, having visited the Dyffryn Gardens. The pristine 55-acre botanical site, including a number of garden rooms, was recently upgraded with £6.15m of Heritage Lottery Funding. The mansion's refurbishment, undertaken by the National Trust, will further add to the property's appeal, with the body expecting an additional 60,000 visitors next year. Earlier this year, the National Trust took over stewardship of the house and gardens from Vale of Glamorgan Council on a 50-year lease. The local authority had controlled the property since 1996. The property's current development was initially kickstarted during a failed attempt to turn it into a hotel during the 1990s. The estate's property manager Geraldine Donovan said: 'We are right on Cardiff's doorstep and it's remarkable the number of people who still don't know we are here.' Boost: The National Trust, who recently took over stewardship of the estate, hopes that opening the house will bring an extra 65,000 visitors in 2013 . Eye for detail: Another fireplace at the property which was built by industrialist John Corby . Getting ready: Bryony Lee, a conservation assistant, cleans carvings in one of the property's expansive rooms ahead of the public opening . - Dyffryn Estate dates back to 640 A.D when the Manor of Worlton was granted to Bishop Oudoceus of Llandaff. - Dyffryn means valley. -Two smallholdings and 14 farms included on original 2,000-acre estate. - Businessman John Cory bought the estate in 1891 from banker Henry Ellis Collins and built house in 1893. - Sir Cennydd Traherne purchased the estate in the 1930s, leasing it to Glamorgan County Council on 999-year lease. - Estate was eventually sold to Vale of Glamorgan council in 1999 for £300,000. - Parents of Sian Phillips acted as the estate's caretakers in the 40s. - It has served as a dog training centre, police academy and a failed redevelopment as a hotel was undertaken in the 1990s. Leader of Vale of Glamorgan Council, Neil Moore, said the property was leased to the heritage organisation in the hope to bring more money to the area. He said: 'Now the council has restored the site to its current wonderful condition, the National Trust can take this beautiful location to a higher level, drawing in its members from all over the UK. 'We expect visitor numbers to boom, boosting local tourism hugely.' The famous gardens and current house were developed by the Cory family, who moved from Devon to expand their shipping and coal exportation empire. The industrialist John Cory - who bought the estate in 1891 - and his children Reginald and Florence were responsible for shaping the garden into its current form, co-designing them with eminent landscape . architect Thomas Mawson. The landscaping began in 1894 and was completed by 1909. Miss Donovan said: 'The estate was bequeathed to Florence, . but it was Reginald who was mad about the gardens and horticulture in . general who made the gardens what they are today. 'The garden is considered to be the best Edwardian garden in Wales and . was the result of a creative collaboration between Thomas Hayton Mawson, . one of the most influential garden designers of the early 20th Century, . and Reginald Cory,' Reginald . went all over the world amassing exotic plants, even owning the largest . private bonsai collection in 1912. The current garden remains in thrall to its pioneers, with an arboretum hosting trees from all over the . world. Reginald Cory's . first-floor bedroom will be one of the five rooms open to the public, as . well as the ground-floor red and blue drawing rooms and billiard room.

A unique manuscript bearing celebrated writer Thomas Hardy's only known attempt at a song is to be sold at auction. The faded document features lyrics and a melody scrawled in pencil by the author behind classic works including Jude The Obscure and Far From The Madding Crowd. Hand written in pencil in 1922, it is expected to fetch at least £6,000 when it goes under the hammer tomorrow. Rare: The faded paper features lyrics by the acclaimed writer for his tune 'O I Won't Lead A Homely Life' Several . composers have written their own music to Hardy's poems in the past, but . no such effort by the great writer himself has come to light - until . now. Hardy wrote the words to O I Won't Lead A Homely Life on white paper beneath a sixteen-bar D major melody. The music is thought to be based on one of the tunes Hardy played on the violin as a young man while he was a member of the choir at Stinsford Church near Dorchester. In the unique music manuscript, Hardy notes alternative lyrics to the last line of the song - 'And sunk and sad was she' - were it to be sung by a woman. Would-be songwriter: Thomas Hardy wrote English classics including Jude The Obscure . The line: 'And sad was life for me' is scrawled above the original lyrics in red. The author wrote a note saying: 'If sung by a woman the words in red may be used.' The document, the only Hardy music manuscript in existence today, will be sold at Bonhams in London tomorrow. It is being sold by manuscript dealer Roy Davids, 70. The document was once owned by Sydney Cockerell, who was the literary executor of Hardy's will following his death in 1928. Mr Davids, from Great Haseley, near Oxford, said: 'It says on the manuscript ""To an old air"". 'This means he has written the poem and the music in his hand writing, but using an old tune that he would have remembered. 'It's the only manuscript for a poem of his own that has music attached to it, he didn't compose the music, he took it on. 'He may have adjusted the tune but we just don't know. 'However, this is the only one with music and lyrics in his hand, he destroyed a lot of drafts, so this is very rare. 'Hardy was a very good musician, he played the violin from his childhood and he remembered old tunes. 'He had a fantastic memory and would have known all the popular tunes of the day and his family went to local glee clubs and they played for hours.' Hardy grew up in a musical family and played the violin like his uncle, grandfather and father, who taught him to read music notation. He continued to play the violin and perform concerts after becoming a celebrated author with his classic novels like Tess Of The D'Urbervilles and the Mayor Of Casterbridge. He published his first poetry collection, Wessex Poems, in 1898 but he was not recognised as an influential poet until the 1950s. Mike Nixon, secretary of the Hardy Society, said: 'I think this document has the wow factor, it's genuine, and was written on the back of a circular dated 23 August 1922. 'It belonged to Sydney Cockerell, who was the literary executor when Hardy died, and he worked with his second wife Florence to clear out Hardy's stuff. 'It's extremely rare and very exciting. It's the only manuscript like this that we know of.' Thomas Hardy was born in a hamlet in Stinsford, Dorset, in 1840, to father Thomas, a stonemason, and Jemima, a well-read woman who educated her son until he went to his first school in Bockhampton at the age of eight. Despite displaying academic potential from an early age, the cost of university was beyond the means of the Hardy family and Thomas' formal education came to an end at 16 when he became a local architect's apprentice. After training as an architect Hardy moved to London in 1862, where he enrolled in King's College, before returning to his beloved Dorset five years later to devote himself to writing. The success of his 1874 novel Far From The Madding Crowd was such that he could give up architectural work and concentrate on the literary career that would see him go on to produce The Mayor Of Casterbridge, Tess Of The D'Urbervilles and Jude The Obscure among other novels. Hardy created some controversy with his sympathetic portrayal of a 'fallen woman' in Tess, while the sexual references in Jude The Obscure saw some booksellers covering copies with brown paper bags. His disgust at the criticism levelled at two of his best works led Hardy to give up writing fiction altogether in the 1900s.","Document is only known Hardy music manuscript in existence .

After two initial replays, CBS stopped showing footage Sunday of Louisville basketball player Kevin Ware breaking his leg during the first half of his team's NCAA men's tournament game against Duke. The injury during the nationally televised game, and the shocked reaction of Ware's fellow players, called to mind the gruesome broken leg suffered by Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann in a Monday Night football game in 1985. During Sunday's game, Theismann tweeted his best wishes to Ware. Scroll down for video . Horrific: Kevin Ware, 20, screams with pain as trainers cover his leg following a crippling injury Sunday night during the Louiseville-Duke game . Inspiration: Despite unimaginable pain, Ware reportedly told teammates not to worry about him and to focus on winning the game . Ware had leaped to try and block a shot by Duke's Tyler Thornton. His leg landed awkwardly, buckled and flopped as he fell to the ground. The first hint that the injury was out of the ordinary came from Thornton, who put his hands to his face and had an anguished look as he ran back on defense. CBS commentator Clark Kellogg described the injury was ‘gruesome.’ ‘If you can bear to watch it, take a look but it's a gruesome-looking injury,’ Kellogg said. CBS showed the replay twice in slow motion, although not with a close-up of Ware landing. The network also never showed a close-up of the injury. CBS then concentrated on reaction shots. Three of Ware's teammates were on the ground near the basket. Wayne Blackshear cried, Chane Behanan knelt on his hands and knees and Peyton Silva sat, a hand covering his mouth. The network aired a close-up of medical officials working on Ware, showing the player only from the face up. Hurt: Ware, 20, is comforted by teammate Luke Hancock after the horrific injury. He was quickly loaded onto a stretcher and taken to the hospital . Even Rick Pitino, the hardened coach of the Louisville Cardinals, fought back tears as his player was carted away from the court . CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus said that because of the graphic nature of the injury, the network decided not to show it after the original replays. People could quickly find replays on YouTube, anyway. ‘We did not zoom in on the injury when he was taken off,’ McManus said. ‘We did not try to highlight it. I think we did the right thing.’ At halftime, Greg Gumbel noted that CBS would not show the injury. Its highlight package again focused on the reactions, including Louisville coach Rick Pitino wiping away tears. Pitino answered questions from CBS during the game about Ware, noting the injured player was exhorting his teammates to win the regional final. A Louisville spokesman said Ware was ""resting comfortably"" at Indianapolis' Methodist Hospital. As is often the case, the coverage quickly became a hot topic on Twitter. Sports writer Jason Whitlock tweeted that ‘CBS handled this curveball (Ware injury) masterfully.’ The network's decision to stop showing the replay only goes so far. Right after the game ended, the CBS affiliate in Phoenix aired the footage of Ware being injured in a local sports report. Coverage of the injury represented the second difficult call of the day for CBS. Earlier, the network cut away from the dramatic conclusion of the Sony Open men's final, switching to the tipoff of the NCAA tournament game between Michigan and Florida. The network did alert viewers that if the third set between Andy Murray and David Ferrer went to a tiebreaker, it would switch coverage of the Tennis Channel.

Kevin Ware's break of the right tibia will go down in history as one of the most grisly sports injuries, but doctors agree that he will most likely be able to continue playing. Ware underwent successful surgery last night at Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis. In a two hour-procedure, doctors reset the broken bone and sewed up the wound from which the tibia had protruded. Fred Hina, Louisville's director of sports medicine, told USA Today that Ware's road to recovery will be a long one, but he should be able to play the game again. Dr Reed Estes, assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said basketball players are prone to stress fractures in the tibia, the larger of the two leg bones, and that can weaken them. 'If these are not detected they can result in a full fracture, particularly if the landing mechanics are just right' after a jump, he said. Ware should be fine to play next season, he said. Dr Frederick Azar, head of the Campbell Clinic in Memphis, Tennessee, and a spokesman for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, said Ware 'jumped pretty far horizontally and vertically, and he landed with a twist,' which puts so much torsion and stress on the bones they could have just snapped. He agreed with Estes' assessment that a stress fracture could have made Ware more prone to the injury. Former . Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann, who famously sustained a . broken leg during a Monday Night Football game against the New York . Giants, tweeted, 'Watching Duke/ Louisville my heart goes out to Kevin . Ware.' If anyone knows what . Ware is going through, it's Theismann, whose career was finished when . he was brought down by Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor, and his knee . drove into his lower leg bones. Theismann told NFL AM that he had texted Ware to offer 'anything he needed.'

A suspected murderer with a $100,000 reward on his head has appeared in court after turning himself in. Edwin Ernesto Rivera Gracias was wanted in Jefferson County on suspicion of stabbing to death his girlfriend's stepfather, 60-year-old Richard Limon, of Denver.

A-list celebrities from Robert De Niro to Russell Brand agreed to play a surreal game of hide and seek for these quirky portraits. Photographer Chris Buck invited famous subjects used to being the centre of attention to conceal themselves for 30 seconds while he took their picture. They each signed a statement swearing that they were genuinely in the frame - even if they are nearly impossible to spot. In his den: Rapper Snoop Dogg is hiding out in what he calls his 'man cave', protected by a fluffy white dog . Desert hide-out: Comedy actor Seth Rogan could be behind the closed door, or perhaps the cactus . An elusive Beatle: Drummer Ringo Starr is out of sight in this living room somewhere . In the tub: Photographer Chris Buck managed to get legendary actor Robert De Niro crouching hidden in a bathroom . Buck wanted to take the photos where the celebrities could not be seen as a subversive re-think on the public's love of viewing famous people. His first photograph was of Star Trek actor William Shatner, whom he was photographing on location. It was Shatner's idea to head for a barn on set, where he hid in the hay bales and sawdust. Many of the celebrities he shot on location such as talk show host Jay Leno, who hid outside the studio where he tapes his programme, and star of The Office: An American Workplace Rainn Wilson. Snoop Dogg is perhaps the most humorous portrait because it is posed near his 'man cave' with a fluffy white dog seeming to guard the entrance. Where's the host?: TV star Jay Leno is not usually so shy and retiring . At the Plaza hotel: Actor and comedian Russell Brand is somewhere in this New York hotel lobby . Knowing me, knowing you: Alan Partridge actor Steve Coogan is somewhere in this office block scene . Eerily empty: Horror director Wes Craven is lurking somewhere in this office . At the hairdressers: Lots of faces on the wall, but where is REM singer Michael Stipe? Actor Russell Brand was particularly enthusiastic about the idea and spent a lot of time hiding in the lobby of The Plaza Hotel in New York City for his portrait. Chris Buck collected them together for his book Presence. The book features fifty sittings including an eclectic line-up of Chevy Chase, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Nick Cave and David Lynch. Canadian-born Buck’s career spans more than two decades. Recently he was honoured to take an official picture of President Barack Obama. A roll in the hay: Star Trek actor William Shatner enthusiastically buried himself in the bales and sawdust . A ghost at the feast: There is no sign of comedian Sarah Silverman at the table - or is there? 'People told me they were looking forward to his (Obama’s) Presence photo,' Buck told slate.com. 'He worked hard to be president twice—he’s not hiding anytime soon.' In keeping with his interest in . unusual takes on famous people, Buck recently brought out a book called . 'Isn't' featuring celebrity lookalikes. The pictures played mischeviously on the personas of icons like Madonna, Tom Cruise, Bill Gates and George W. Bush.

Campaign: British aid money to Pakistan is allegedly used to fund party of President Asif Ali Zardari . Britain's decision to make Pakistan its biggest recipient of foreign aid is under scrutiny amid claims that £300million is helping to bankroll Benazir Bhutto’s former party. In evidence to a Commons inquiry, an aid expert alleged the Benazir Income Support Programme was being used to buy support for Mrs Bhutto’s widower, President Asif Ali Zardari, and his party. Ehtisham Ahmad, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, said the Department for International Development was pouring money into a scheme used to buy votes. ‘This is is the mechanism – which is . funded partly by DFID – to make friends and influence people. This is . the re-election campaign of Mr Zardari, which is funded by DFID,’ he . said. The Select Committee on International Development is due to publish a report into aid to Pakistan on Thursday. The . UK’s development assistance is expected to more than double between . 2011 and 2015, meaning Pakistan will become the UK’s biggest aid . recipient –getting almost £450million per year by 2015. Some . 60million people in Pakistan, one in three, live in poverty and . regularly go hungry. Pakistan has 12million out-of-school children and . half of all adults, including two of every three women, cannot read and . write. However, Pakistan’s . status as the potential largest recipient of UK aid is controversial, . given its unstable political situation, large defence budget, activities . of the military and intelligence services, level of corruption and tax . avoidance, and position as a middle-income country. Britain has said the increase in aid . is conditional on the government of Pakistan’s own progress in widening . the country’s tax base and tackling corruption. But . the Independent Commission for Aid Impact warned recently in a report . that plans for a vast hike in aid should be ‘approached cautiously’. ‘We . note that DFID has no track record of delivering programmes in Pakistan . on the scale that is now contemplated,’ the report warned. Half of the £300million going to the . controversial scheme in Pakistan will be given to families to help lift . them out of poverty, while the rest will be used to encourage parents to . send children to school. Accusations: Aid expert Ehtisham Ahmad alleged the Benazir Income Support Programme was being used to buy support for the party of President Asif Ali Zardari, who is the widower of Benazir Bhutto . But opposition parties complain the name of the programme means many people believe the money comes from the Bhutto family rather than the government. ‘The fact it is called Benazir Income Support Programme tends to suggest there is what is called clientelism,’ said Dr Ahmad. ‘The more you give the more benefit there is to the party that bears the Bhutto name.’ Imran Khan, the cricketer turned politician, claimed the programme was nothing more than a scam to ‘buy votes’. The biggest opposition party, the PML-N, has said it would reform the scheme and rename it the National Support Programme to avoid the charge of using it for political benefit. A DFID spokesman said: ‘The UK is politically impartial in Pakistan. Our aid is based on need and effectiveness, not politics. The Benazir Income Support Programme Act was unanimously passed and supported by all political parties in Pakistan. 'We keep our programme in Pakistan under constant review, and will continue to do so after the elections. 'Economic reform in Pakistan, including on tax, will be critical post-election, whoever wins. It will be important for elected politicians to show leadership to the Pakistan electorate and a commitment to reform by submitting tax returns and paying tax due.'","British aid money allegedly used to buy support for President Asif Ali Zardari .

After 15 fruitless years of trying for a baby, Claire Sanderson had all but given up on her dream of becoming a mother. Doctors had diagnosed her with unexplained infertility, and when her periods stopped altogether she and husband Dean thought it was 'the end of the road'. So Claire, 33, was stunned two years later to learn that she was pregnant at last - and that her much longed-for baby was due in a matter of weeks. 'Unbelievable news': Claire Sanderson, who was diagnosed with unexplained infertility after 15 years of trying for a baby, is now a mother to Summer . Claire decided to take a pregnancy test after feeling an unexplained movement in her stomach last April. To the couple's joy, it was positive, and they were dumbfounded when doctors told them Claire was already seven months along. Their 'little miracle' Summer arrived just eight weeks later. ‘We are still in shock about it,' said Claire. We had been trying for a baby for 15 years, and then suddenly a baby comes along in eight weeks. ‘I had never imagined I could be pregnant, but when I felt unwell for a number of weeks, I did a pregnancy test just to make sure. ‘When I looked at the positive test stick in my hand I just burst into tears. When the doctor said I would be due in a matter of weeks, it just seemed the most unbelievable news.’ Shock: Claire was stunned to learn she was seven months pregnant with baby Summer after all but giving up hope of becoming a mother . The couple started trying for a family just after they met in September 1997. After five years nothing had happened, so Mrs Sanderson went to see her GP. Mrs Sanderson said: ‘Dean underwent tests and he was fine, so we knew that it must be something that was wrong with me. ‘But I had a series of tests too, and although the doctors said that I had slightly polycystic ovaries, they said it was unexplained infertility. They said there was no reason why I shouldn’t fall pregnant and we should keep trying. ‘Dean was reassuring me that it would be alright and we would be parents soon. We never gave up hope.’ But as the years passed, Mrs Sanderson still hadn’t fallen pregnant. And two years ago - thirteen years after they started trying - her periods stopped altogether. She said: ‘It was devastating not to be able to fall pregnant. Everywhere I looked, I saw mothers and babies, and it was heartbreaking. ‘I so desperately wanted to be a mum. I would try and be happy for friends and family when they fell pregnant, but I was devastated inside. ‘When my periods finally stopped, I thought that was it. We’d already been trying for 13 years with no success, I thought that was definitely the end of the road for us. We never gave up hope totally, we were always hoping for a miracle, but realistically we thought our chances were probably over.’ At the beginning of last April, Mrs Sanderson was lying in the bath when she felt a sudden fluttering movement in her stomach. She said: ‘I’d never felt anything like it in my life. I could feel this movement. I shouted to Dean. He wanted me to do a pregnancy test but I didn’t want to, as I thought it would make me upset when it came out negative. ‘But Dean insisted, so we did a test and it was positive. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. After all these years I was finally looking at a positive pregnancy test.’ Claire went for a scan at Hull Royal Infirmary and doctors delivered the most surprising news. She was 31 weeks pregnant. She added: ‘It was such a shock when the doctors told me I was so far pregnant. I’d had no idea. ‘We only had a few weeks to be prepared. We’d been waiting for 15 years for this moment.  And it was nearly here. All our family rallied around and helped us get everything ready for the baby’s arrival. Claire gave birth to her daughter Summer just eight weeks later - a week early  - at Hull Royal Infirmary, weighing a healthy 6Ib 8oz. She said: ‘I was only in labour for five hours. It seemed like after waiting for so long, Summer was in such a hurry to get here. ‘When I’d given birth to her I was still in shock about even being pregnant. It was a wonderful feeling to have our daughter, but it felt like she wasn’t ours. ‘Dean even jokes that it is as though we are babysitting her and soon we will have to give her back. After waiting so long, everything happened so quickly and it still hasn’t sunk in that we are parents at last. ‘Our little miracle took 15 years - and then took just eight weeks and five hours to arrive.’","Doctors had diagnosed Claire Sanderson with unexplained infertility .

Lindsay Clift, 29, collapsed in a hospital delivery suite on September 26 last year. Lindsay Clift (pictured with husband Darren) died five hours after her daughter Katy May was stillborn last September . The couple had wanted to start a family since they met seven years ago. They discovered they were expecting their first child after marrying in May 2011 . She had been admitted because her baby still hadn’t arrived 12 days after the due date. Doctors planned to induce labour, but . found the baby, who the couple had already named Katy May, had died and . Mrs Clift would have to go through a stillbirth. Her husband said: . ‘There was no reason to think anything was going to go wrong that day. She walked in there fit and healthy. ‘In my view she was so heartbroken . that she wanted to be with the baby.  This was a longed-for baby, it was . mine and Lindsay’s first.’ The couple's daughter was 12 days overdue. When they induced Mrs Clift they discovered Katy May had died in the womb and Mrs Clift was forced to give birth to her stillborn . An inquest heard that Mrs Clift died of an amniotic fluid embolism - a rare condition affecting one in 200,000 mothers in the UK - which triggered a fatal heart attack . On Thursday Mr Clift, who lived with his wife in Bilston, West Midlands, broke down in tears at her inquest. His wife, a hairdresser, died of an . amniotic fluid embolism – a rare condition affecting one in 200,000 . mothers in the UK – which triggered a fatal heart attack, the inquest in . Smethwick, West Midlands, heard. Pathologist Dr Adrian Yoong said he . found skin cells and a fragment of hair in Mrs Clift’s lungs. He said: ‘Sometimes material comes . off the baby into the blood, including skin cells and so on. The only . source could have been the amniotic fluid. Speaking after his wife's death last year, Mr Clift described her as 'beautiful, stunning and warm' and said she died of a 'broken heart' Mrs Clift died at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton on September 26 last year after staff battled to save her . Mr Clift praised the hospital, saying staff had done everything they could . ‘We can say fairly surely that the finding in the lung suggests not only an embolism, but that it was the cause of death.’ But Mr Clift has said he feels a . broken heart played a part in his wife’s death. Shortly after the . tragedy, he said: ‘For them not to find an instant cause of death, it . sort of strengthens my feeling, even if it’s medically nonsense, that . she made the decision to go. ‘I still can’t believe how we got to this. The hospital were brilliant, they did everything they could.’ Mrs Clift, who married in May 2011, was brought to New Cross Hospital in . Wolverhampton to be induced 41 weeks and five days into her pregnancy. A midwife raised the alarm after failing to find a heartbeat, and an ultrasound scan confirmed Katy May was dead. Consultant obstetrician Dr David Churchill described how, as he . prepared for the urgent procedure, Mrs Clift collapsed, struggling to . breathe. He said: ‘It was clear that she had had a cardiac arrest.’ She died hours later. Black  Country . coroner Robin Balmain said the death was down to natural causes, adding: . ‘This is a tragedy for everybody. Mrs Clift would no doubt have been . anticipating a very exciting time. It was going to be her first child.’ An amniotic fluid embolism is a rare but serious condition that occurs . when amniotic fluid — the fluid that surrounds a baby in the uterus . during pregnancy — or foetal material, such as hair, enters the maternal . bloodstream. Why an amniotic fluid embolism occurs isn't well understood. It's possible the fluid or foetal material . enters the maternal bloodstream, possibly by passing through tears in . the fetal membranes. It's likely that amniotic fluid contains components . that cause an inflammatory reaction and activate clotting in the . mother's lungs and blood vessels. However, amniotic fluid embolisms are rare - and it's likely that some . amniotic fluid commonly enters the maternal bloodstream during delivery . without causing problems. It's not clear why in some cases this leads to . an amniotic fluid embolism.","Lindsay Clift, 29, died five hours after her daughter was delivered stillborn .

Even as more Republican politicians are coming out in support of gay marriage, there are some in the party who still refuse to change even in spite of close connections to the cause. Republican congressman Matt Salmon from Arizona said that even though his son is gay, he refuses to support same-sex marriage, saying that he's 'just not there'. 'As far as believing in my heart that we should change 2000 years of social policy in favor of a redefinition of the family. I'm not there,' Congressman Salmon said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Political pressure: Congressman Matt Salmon (center) said that he does not support same-sex marriage even though his son, also named Matt (center right) is gay . Family values: Congressman Matt Salmon (center) and his wife Nancy (center left) are firmly anti-gay but they still love their gay son Matt (far right) 'My son is by far one of the most important people in my life, I love him more than I could say,' he told local station 3TV News. 'I don’t believe that this is a lifestyle that he chose. 'It doesn't mean that I don’t have respect. It doesn't mean that I don’t sympathize with some of the issues, it just means that I haven't evolved to that station. Rob Portman apparently has.' The congressman's son, who is also named Matt Salmon, has been out and proud for a number of years, and told a Phoenix paper that he told his mother that he was gay when he was 14-years-old. His parents' anti-gay stance has not stopped the younger Matt Salmon from making his own way in state politics, becoming the president of the Arizona Log Cabin Republicans and posing for a photo shoot with his boyfriend for the Phoenix New Times. Open: Matt Salmon Jr (left, and right on right) posed for a photo shoot with his boyfriend in a Phoenix paper in 2010 . Adding to the complicated situation in the Salmon family is the fact that they are all devout Mormons, a faith that bans homosexuality. At the time of the interview in 2010, Matt was dating Kent Flake, who also has family connections to Republican politicians in the state, and the pair both decided to leave the church because of their conflicts with their sexuality. They received frosty welcomes from their families, who were not thrilled by the coupling. 'Everybody's pretty much told me, ""You're fine, we love you, but your partner's not welcome because we don't want gay around us."" And I'm like, ""Well, I am gay. What if he doesn't act gay?

'I love my father and realize that he can have the opinions that he has, and they might differ from mine, but that doesn’t change the way I feel about him,' he said. 'I definitely share my feelings, but I don’t pressure him to change his opinion because I know that given our relationship there’s no real need to do that. We each know where we stand.'

After the phenomenal success of Channel 4’s Come Dine With Me, it was perhaps inevitable that a property equivalent of the culinary show would follow. And, sure enough, ITV’s May The Best House Win was born, a programme in which four homeowners rate each other’s houses for their interior design, comfort and hospitality to win a £1,000 prize. The new series of the show is due to be broadcast in the spring, and of the houses to feature, few can match Stephen Spencer’s property in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, for originality. Seeing the light: Stephen Spencer outside Font House, a former Methodist church which he has converted into a three-bedroom home . Font House is a former Baptist church. While that might not seem unusual in itself – as congregation numbers fall across the country, scores of places of Christian worship have been converted – this one is strikingly modern. Moreover, the change of use came about as a result not of decline but of a rising congregation. A chapel was first built on the site in 1815 and the existing building dates from the Seventies. By the early Eighties, as more and more people joined the congregation, the church decided to vacate the building and move somewhere bigger. The site was sold to the Salvation Army. Stephen, 59, a publisher of magazines for schools, bought the property in 2010. ‘My original idea was to use it for a call centre for my business,’ he says. ‘But then I decided it would make a nice house.’ He spent £80,000 on the renovation, and the project took a year to complete. Stephen turned what was a simple hall at the front of the building into a contemporary living space with three bedrooms, two studies (both of which could be converted into further single bedrooms), and an eye-catching black-and-green kitchen and dining area. Praise: Pictured is the bright living room area with the front doors in the centre and the iron stairs up to the mezzanine level . The concrete floor was ripped up to install an underfloor heating system, which is now covered by gleaming porcelain-style flooring tiles. Sections of open brickwork on the walls were also plastered over. But the most extensive work was the addition of a mezzanine floor covering the back of the hallway for the master bedroom with en suite wet room accessed by a stylish cast iron spiral staircase. Stephen was uncertain how to deal with the vast total-immersion font, typical of Baptist chapels, that stood in the centre of the hall. ‘We considered turning it into a Jacuzzi,’ he says. ‘But in the end, we just filled it in.’ Generally, however, he found the original design of the chapel fitted in with his vision for a modern living space. ‘What is unusual for a church is that this building was designed to be flooded with light,’ he says. Though divorcé Stephen has transformed the front of the building – which he is now selling for £425,000 – what may excite prospective buyers is that the area at the back has scope for further development. Chapel change: Renovating Font House cost Mr Spencer £80,000 which he is now selling for £425,000 . The 36ft by 12ft space has a further bedroom, kitchen and bathroom. ‘It is such a big space that it has great potential to be used for a business such as a nursery,’ he says. ‘Alternatively, it could become a separate annexe or perhaps be used as a granny flat.’ Although Stephen did not install the underfloor heating in this part of the building, he says it could be easily extended from the system in place for as little as £1,500. With rail services to London’s King Cross taking around 50 minutes from nearby Huntingdon station, the property would easily suit young professionals planning to commute to the capital. Malcolm Thomas, of selling agents Individual Properties, is suitably impressed by Stephen’s renovation work and says: ‘There is nothing quite like it available anywhere in this area or anywhere in Britain.’ individualproperties.co.uk, 01480 421 898.

Britain's most economically divided neighbourhoods have been revealed in a wide-ranging survey of the country's wealth gap. A study by data company CACI found streets where wealthy families in £1m homes live 'cheek by jowl' with some of the most deprived households in the country. Neighbouring streets in St Albans in Hertfordshire, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Liverpool are revealed as among the areas with the biggest wealth disparity. Economically divided neighbourhood: Talbot Road, west London . Affluent: Courtnell Street, which is round the corner from Talbot Road . The analysis was based on factors such as income, savings, investments and property values. Patrick Tate of CACI, which categorises . every household into one of 62 demographic types, told The Sunday Times: 'Our analysis shows the biggest divides are within communities rather than across the oft-quoted north-south divide. 'Britain is most divided at a local level and these social, health and financial disparities will only increase.' One of the sharpest income gaps in the CACI survey was between Kirkstead Walk and Penley Crescent in Liverpool. Only 50 yards apart as the crow flies, they are separated by a railway line so it is a two-mile trip between them. The average income  in Kirkstead Walk is £66,000 and people living there are three times more likely than the national average to be paying higher-rate tax. 1. St Albans - Flora Grove and Shirley Road . 2. Birmingham - Carpenter Road and Ashley Close . 3. Edinburgh - House O'Hill Row and Wester Drylaw Drive . 4.

Across the railway line in Penley Crescent, however, the average income is just £20,200 — a difference of 227 per cent, The Sunday Times reported. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, inequality is back at levels last seen in the mid-1990s. 'The immediate effect of the most recent recession was to reduce inequality in 2010-11 because benefits stayed flat while wages fell, but as tax and benefit reforms come in over the next few years you would expect to see inequality increase again,' said Luke Sibieta of the IFS. Research suggests extreme wealth disparity can have a negative impact on health and wellbeing. A study by York University found that while people in wealthier neighbourhoods generally had better health, this was not true for poor mothers living in affluent areas. Higher incidences of schizophrenia in urban areas have also been attributed to an increase in inequality, according to research by Cambridge University published in the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin.","Study based on income, savings, investments and property values .

With monthly costs to the borough averaging $75,000 for insurance, maintenance, fuel, docking fees and other expenses, the Borough Assembly has directed employees to find the most economical way to shed it. While the borough solicited buyers, it also launched a parallel track to give away the boat to a government organization that met federal requirements. Of those that expressed interest, proposals by Los Angeles County and the U.S. Virgin Islands are still being evaluated by the Federal Transit Administration. Young ship: The vessel was completed in 2011 and born out of a partnership between the borough, which wanted a ferry, and the Navy, which wanted a fast military landing craft . The Susitna project was funded mainly with Department of Defense earmarks wedged into the federal budget by then-U.S. Senator Ted Stevens . On Friday, Russ Krafft, the borough purchasing officer, opened the sole bid, a $751,000 offer from Workships Contractors BV, based in The Netherlands. It wants to use the vessel to support offshore wind farms, according to the borough. ‘I was expecting more offers and higher offers, even if it was just for scrapping the vessel,’ said Marc Van Dongen, the borough's port director. The borough asked the state ferry system if it would want the Susitna. But in a new draft study, the ferry system concluded the Susitna would be expensive to run and that existing docks would need to be reconfigured. The study said the boat can hold 134 passengers but only 20 vehicles, and burns 375 gallons of fuel an hour. A state ferry with a similar capacity, the Lituya, burns 55 gallons an hour. The state ferry system doesn't want the Susitna, the staff report said. The vessel is docked near the Ketchikan shipyard where it was built. The government of the Northern Mariana Islands, a U.S. territory, said it was interested in the Susitna but then seemed to back off. A community college in Seattle inquired about acquiring it to train merchant marines, but that's not a public transit purpose. A fledgling research laboratory in Wisconsin wants it, too. A village of Native Hawaiians sent representatives in an executive jet to Alaska to check out the boat, but federal officials told the borough that the village would have had to partner with the state. And that hasn't happened. At least two governments are still on the list being considered by the Federal Transit Administration, the borough said. Ultimately, the Borough Assembly will decide the Susitna's future. Docked: The vessel is docked near the Ketchikan shipyard where it was built .","The bid was the only entered by .

The father who tucked her into bed at night was also the man who murdered eight women and left clues for police signed with a happy face. This was the truth that Melissa Moore, now aged 33, had to come to terms with as a teenager when her father Keith Hunter Jesperson was convicted of homicide. Ms Moore has spoken of the ordeal of being related to a serial killer in a book which gives a candid account of her adolescence after her father's conviction. Melissa Moore (left) spoke of how she came to terms with the fact that her father was a serial killer (right) CNN reported . how Ms Moore came to terms with being the daughter of the Happy Face . Killer, who killed eight women during his time as a long haul truck . driver in the 1990s. Jesperson, . who was divorced from Ms Moore's mother, earned his notoriety by . sending confessions describing his heinous crimes to police and . journalists and signing them with a smiley face. He often targeted prostitutes and homeless women, sexually assaulting them before killing them with his bare hands. Jesperson murdered his first known victim Taunja Bennett, in 1990, after meeting her at a bar near Portland, Ore. and inviting her back to a house he was renting. He beat her and strangled her to death after they had sex, then went back out to a bar to create an alibi. He later returned to the house to dispose of the body before leaving town. He struck again in August 1992 when he raped and strangled a woman, repeated the crime with a prostitute named Cynthia Lyn Rose a month later, then killed a fourth woman, also a prostitute, named Laurie Ann Pentland from Salem before the year was out. Jesperson claims to have killed hundreds of women, but very few were ever identified as Taunja Bennet and long-time girlfriend Julia Ann Winningham were . Jesperson claimed Pentland set him off when she tried to double her fee and threatened to call the police if he didn't comply. His fifth victim, a Jane Doe living on the streets in Santa Nella, Calif., was discovered in July of 1993. Another Jane Doe who's death was attributed to Jesperson was found in September 1994. In one particularly brutal homicide, he raped and strangled a woman named Angela Surbize who he was driving from Spokane, Wash., to meet her boyfriend in Indiana, then strapped her face-down to the undercarriage of his truck so her face and prints would be ground off by the road while he drove. He was finally caught in 1995 after strangling long-time girlfriend Julia Ann Winningham, who he said did not love him but only wanted his money. He confessed details of his murderous history while in custody, but later recanted much of it. Ms . Moore described her confusion over the two sides to her father. She . remembered playing games with him, having family meals at the local . truck stop and being tucked into bed 'like a burrito' by Jesperson at . night. She said: ‘When I was growing up, my dad had put so . much pride in my last name, and he gave me lessons on how to be a good . citizen. ‘My name was now known for these horrific murders, . and it started to make me wonder if I was like my dad.’ Melissa Moore said her father (pictured with her in the early 1980s) was encouraged her to be proud of her identity and taught her to be a good citizen . But Ms Moore recalled that she had seen her father been violent during her childhood and had beat their pet dog to death in front of her by repeatedly striking it in the head. ‘But I didn't like to remember that,' she added. At the age of 15 she paid her last visit to her father when he was awaiting trial at  Washington's Clark County jail and he told her: ‘Missy, you need to change your last name.' She said: ‘That's when I knew that these things were true.' At the age of 21 she got married and took her husband's surname, deciding to sever all ties with Jesperson, who was serving multiple life sentences.","Keith Jesperson murdered eight women in the 1990s and sent clues to police .

A vicar has ordered Girl Guides to quit the church headquarters they have used for 86 years – because they have failed to attend enough religious services. Angry leaders called the Reverend Stephen Terry ‘completely out of touch’ over his decision to exclude 28 Guides from a hall close to St Leonard’s Church in Hove, East Sussex. They claim he has given the 7th Hove Guides their marching orders over their failure to attend Remembrance Sunday, Palm Sunday, Harvest Festival and Christmas services. Out of touch: Reverend Stephen Terry at St Leonard's Church in Hove has banned Girl Guides after they failed to attend some services . Guide leader Julie Winder, 42, said the youngsters will hold their last meeting at the hall today.Mrs Winder said: ‘We feel we have been treated unfairly. This is very sad after such a long and happy association with the church. ‘We have been told we simply were not attending enough services for us to continue using their hall. But I can’t press-gang the entire troop into going to church. ‘We have never been a scrap of trouble to the church – in fact our girls have happily helped prepare food for both the summer fair and Christmas fair for more than 30 years. ‘I think the vicar is completely out of touch. Half the girls are of a different faith and we also have a Muslim youngster, so a high proportion of the group are not even Anglican.’ The group has used the hall as their base since 1927. More than 1,000 girls between the ages of ten and 14 have served with the 7th Hove at the venue since then. Off colour: The Girl Guides have been forced to find a new home . Mr Terry, the vicar of St Leonard’s since 1998, said he had asked the group to turn up for the four important church services a year. He added: ‘We also asked them to help out at a few church events. It is not the case that we have thrown them out. They have walked away from this standing agreement. It’s sad that it has come to end like this. I really have no further comment to make.’ The decision also affects about 20 Brownies aged between seven and ten attached to the troop, which had been using the hall rent-free. The group has now been offered a room at nearby Portslade Town Hall – and will begin a new era there next month.","Reverend Stephen Terry has been described as 'completely out of touch' with his decision .

Peter enjoys the freedom of the water sport as it provides him with a feeling of independence. He rarely gets nervous or scared about doing it and says he will carry on water skiing as long as he is fit and healthy. The father-of-two, from Southampton, Hants, said: 'I'd always been interested in boats so my friend and I bought a power boat between us. 'He'd done waterskiing before so we rigged up the boat so he could do it but then I thought 'if he can do it, I'll have a go'.

'You could hurt yourself tripping up in the street on your way to the shop - but I've never had any broken bones. 'I don't really feel like I've got a disability - I always try to do things for myself.' At the age of 55, Peter started competing in open age group competitions for disabled people. He beat people much younger than him during his competitive days to claim an array of medals. He even set a world record for jumping a distance of 40ft.

As thousands of gunmen and women gathered in the Arizona desert, homes in the US town where a crazed gunman killed 26 people, 20 of them children, have been receiving automated phone calls from the National Rifle Association gun lobby. They began last week, only three months after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings. Residents said the calls urge people to tell their state legislators to oppose gun control proposals. Politicians are debating whether to ban military-style assault weapons, prohibit high-capacity ammunition magazines and other measures in response to the school shootings. Dan O'Donnell lives in Newtown's Sandy Hook area and said the robocalls were 'ridiculous and insensitive'. 'Our machine gun shooters are not only collectors, but are also into the history,' says the MG Shooters website. 'You . will see things from the very old (Gatling gun) to the very newest . (minigun). They can tell you not only the guns capacities, but in which . wars and battles they were used. 'Fortunately for us, most enjoy talking about them.'

Horse and pig DNA has been found in beef meatballs, lasagne and burgers sold in the UK, fresh testing results revealed today. Official figures released to Parliament showed that of 357 beef products for possible contamination has found two contained horse DNA and three contained pig DNA/ . Environment Secretary Owen Paterson told MPs all five products, which contained more than one per cent horse or pig DNA, have been withdrawn from sale. The three beef meals which were found to contain pork were ASDA Spaghetti and Meatballs, ASDA Beef Cannelloni and Apetito Beef Lasagne. The Food Standards Agency testing also confirmed that horse DNA had been found in Whitbread burgers and IKA meatballs. A further five samples are 'in dispute'. There have been no positive tests to date for the presence of bute in any of the UK food samples found to contain horse DNA, Mr Paterson said. The UK-wide survey of products including burgers, meat balls, minced beef, ready meals and tinned products is in addition to the results of 5,430 industry tests reported on March 4. Testing continues on the contents of processed beef sold in British shops and restaurants, with the next round of results due in early June. Mr Paterson added that although the short term priority had been to focus on the deliberate substitution of beef with horse, 'this does not mean that we have ignored the possibility of beef products containing undeclared pork or pig DNA'. The string of revelations about what is really in the food we buy has raised serious concerns about the security of the food supply chain . He said in a written statement: 'Consumers have a right to expect that all the food they are eating is correctly described. I recognise that even trace levels of pork contamination, below the 1% threshold, are unacceptable to some faith communities. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said testing of processed meat on sale in the UK would continue . 'Where a product is labelled as Halal . and is found to contain traces of horse or pig DNA, the relevant local . authority will investigate each case and take steps to ensure that . consumers are informed. 'It remains the responsibility of all food businesses, including processors, catering suppliers and retailers, to ensure that the food they sell is what it says it is on the label, and Kosher and Halal certification bodies have a part to play in this. 'Any claims on a product certified by a certification body must be accurate. It is for the certification body to set out the standards which a certified product must meet, and for that body to work with food businesses to ensure those standards are adhered to.' The food industry has been rocked by revelations about horsemeat being found in processed beef for months. Last week it emerged pure horsemeat imported from Hungary was sold to British shoppers as 'diced beef'. Nearly half the meat had already been sold to the public before its true provenance was discovered. The Food Standards Agency said that 100kg (220lb) of horsemeat was imported by Hungarian Food Ltd in Preston, Lancashire, and sold on its market stall in town and a shop in Liverpool. The remaining unsold 1kg bags were withdrawn from sale.","Pork found in ASDA beef meals including meatballs and cannelloni .

Following a new report that 29per cent of Americans are trying to cut back on gluten, a woman with celiac disease has launched a plea for people to stop giving it up without a viable medical reason. Elissa Strauss, who was diagnosed with the immune disease 14 years ago, explains that a gluten-free diet is not as healthy - or slimming - as it is hyped up to be. 'I have met many a celiac over the years,' the blogger wrote on Jezebel. 'And I promise we wouldn't all pass your supermarket tabloids ""bikini body"" test.' Just a fad? As 29per cent of Americans cut back on gluten, Elissa Strauss - who was diagnosed with celiac disease 14 years ago - explains that the trendy diet is not worthy of all the hype . In fact, the University of Wisconsin graduate says that a gluten-free diet can actually lead to weight gain, since a lot of gluten-free foods are higher in fat to substitute the missing gluten. But it has its staunch advocates, including high-profile stars such as Miley Cyrus and Gwyneth Paltrow, who openly discuss the benefits of cutting out grains such as wheat, barley and rye. Fashion writer Lauren Sherman, who has been gluten-free for over a year now, is a huge fan of her new lifestyle. She told MailOnline that she first began avoiding gluten following a doctor's recommendation. And now, 'I might not be a size four, but my life has improved tremendously,' she said of the diet. The writer, who noticed she was having stomach issues when she ate wheat, says these days she just sticks to carbohydrates like quinoa and brown rice. Even though Ms Sherman does not suffer from celiac disease, she says eating wheat does make her feel 'pretty crappy'. Still, Elissa Strauss insists that going gluten-free 'is not an almond flour paved path to the GOOP holy trifecta of increased energy, a dewy complexion and perfectly fitting skinny jeans.' ''Going gluten-free is not an almond flour-paved path to increased energy, a dewy complexion and perfectly fitting skinny jeans' Instead, using the diet as an excuse to lose weight only has a damaging effect on people who actually suffer from the disease. She explains that ever since gluten-free . dieting has become trendy, 'Waiters, thinking I am just another . ankle-boot wearing Gwyneth wannabe, no longer take me seriously.' What's more, people who give up gluten when they don't need to could be cutting out healthy foods from their diet. 'Fiber is one of the most important things you can eat for health's sake,' she says, adding that a slice of whole wheat bread is 'by no means worse for you than a slice of teff, garbanzo bean and brown rice fiber bread.' And while celebrities can afford to stock up on expense gluten-free goods, for others it is not so easy. Negative effect: The author (pictured) explains that ever since gluten-free dieting has become trendy, 'Waiters, thinking I am just another ankle-boot wearing Gwyneth wannabe, no longer take me seriously' According to the Dalhousie Medical . School in Canada, gluten-free foods cost on average 242per cent more . than the gluten-containing versions, . Indeed, Ms Strauss notes that it is normal for her to shell out $12 for one whole-grain gluten-free loaf of bread. But there is also a growing concern that people are using a gluten allergy to mask their real eating disorders. While a recent study by the NPD group . shows that 29% of Americans are trying to cut back on gluten, under one . per cent of the population actually suffers from celiac disease. 'I might not be a size four, but my life has improved tremendously since going gluten-free' Since the diet has recently been touted a way to lose weight, it would appear many are trying it out solely for this reason. In any case, there is no doubt that avoiding certain food ingredients goes in cycles, and gluten seems to be the trend of today. In fact, the gluten-free movement is number two on TIME's top ten food trends for 2012. 'Gluten is the pariah ingredient du jour,' says an article in the magazine. 'And there are a lot of healthy people shelling out big bucks for gluten-free food they probably don’t need.' But for real sufferers of celiac disease, the diet is a serious lifetime commitment, not just a temporary fad. 'A little dusting of flour on a piece of flounder equals a few days in bed for me,' says Ms Strauss.","According to a study by the NPD group, 29per cent of Americans are now trying to cut back on gluten .

As peanut butter sales rocket, sweet toothed Britons have also been splashing out on chocolate spread with sales up 24 per cent to £46 million in 2012. Almost one in 10 (seven per cent) Britons have switched from jam or marmalade to peanut butter or chocolate spread. Kiti Soininen, head of UK food and drink at Mintel, said: 'Peanut butter and chocolate spread have become popular choices for the family breakfast, gaining share at the expense of traditional favourites jam and marmalade. 'Both spreads have benefited from increased innovation and marketing campaigns to widen usage occasions. Moreover, growing economic pressure has forced more consumers to cook at home, so variety has become particularly important especially for households with children.' Overall, sales of sweet spreads reached £389 million in 2012, up from £367 in 2010, an increase of six per cent between 2010 and 2012. Despite the increasing popularity of peanut butter and chocolate spreads, the nation remains sweet on jam. Jam is still bought by 67 per cent of consumers and is still the largest sector within the sweet spreads category, with a value and volume share of 30% and 36% in 2012 respectively. But, while jam accounts for the biggest market share, sales have remained flat at £118 million between 2010 and 2012. Traditional: Sales of jam and marmalade are down with consumers opting for jars of peanut butter . But it is bittersweet news for marmalade, which accounted for just 14 per cent of the market value in 2012, with sales down by seven per cent over the past two years to £56 million in 2012. In terms of age, usage of marmalade peaks among the over 55s (57%) compared to 18 per cent of 16-24 year olds. Ms Soininen said: 'While sales of marmalade have suffered, there is no doubt that the market could benefit from an ageing population. 'Steps to enhance the health image of marmalade products by incorporating more added health benefits such as vitamins, energising ingredients, antioxidants and added fibre, could offer product standout.' Honey has shown resilience to rising prices in the sector, growing ahead of the overall sweet spread market. Value sales of honey increased eight per cent between 2010 and 2012, to reach £107 million. 'Honey usage has been driven by its health positioning and natural credentials, as well as premium varieties such as Manuka. 'Honey's natural health associations have given it a more up-to-date image, than other more traditional spreads.'","Sales of peanut butter have increased by 20 per cent in the past two years .

Calorie counts are set to be put on alcoholic drinks in a bid to frighten drinkers – particularly women – into cutting down. Most manufacturers already include information on units of alcohol on labels in a voluntary agreement with the Government, which now wants to extend this to calories. The hope is that appealing to people’s concerns about putting on weight will change drinking habits. The calorie count of alcoholic drinks could be displayed in pubs and shops under plans to warn people about how fattening booze can be . Among the glaring examples that will . concern those watching their waistlines is a 175ml glass of wine, which . has almost the same number of calories – 130 – as two digestive . biscuits, while a pint of lager at 250 is equivalent to eating a slice . of pizza. A survey by charity DrinkAware revealed people’s ignorance of calories in alcohol. Half of those polled knew how many . calories there are in a cheeseburger but just one in three were able to . answer as regards a glass of wine. The calorie count idea has the support . of Public Health Minister Anna Soubry, who has issued a series of blunt . messages about the dangers of obesity. Health minister Anna Soubry is in talks with industry leaders about adding calorie information to alcoholic drinks . The Government has established a . number of so-called Responsibility Deals with the food and drink . industry to encourage voluntary measures to improve the health of their . products and provide extra information to the public. Retailers including Asda, Sainsbury’s . and Tesco are working with the Department of Health on how to display . calorie counts on alcohol. Mrs Soubry said: ‘By the end of this year, 80 . per cent of all alcoholic drinks on shop shelves will include clear . labelling on units and health messages.’ The coalition government has repeatedly ruled out using the law to force food and drink firms to give more information to customers. But using Responsibility Deals it has reached voluntary agreements with leading producers to make clearer how healthy what they sell is. Dozens of companies including McDonald’s, . KFC and Pizza Hut signed up to a deal to provide calorie information on . menus for non-alcohol food and drink. Now the warnings could go further and be added to beer and wine on sale in shops and even pubs. A glass of wine has almost the same number of calories as four cookies while a pint of lager is equivalent to a slice of pizza. A single 25ml measure of spirits has more calories (56kcal) than the same amount of single cream (47kcal), the government warns. A gin and tonic contains 126 calories, a bottle of white wine 555 and a pint of lager or cider around 250. Experts also point out that drinkers also tend to eat high-fat snacks like crisps, nuts, chips and kebabs. A Department of Health survey in 2009 found that one in three people ordered crisps, nuts or pork scratchings with an alcohol drink. The average wine drinker consumes an extra 2,000 calories a month, equivalent to 38 roast beef dinners a year. A survey by Drinkaware, backed by TV presenter Lisa Faulkner, found people have no idea how many calories are in alcoholic drinks despite pledges to lose weight . The government negotiated new EU rules . to allow for ‘at-a-glance voluntary nutrition information in a wide . variety of settings’ including on alcohol. Mrs . Soubry, Public Health Minister said:  ‘We're continuing to work with . industry to take forward the plans we set out in the alcohol strategy on . labelling of alcoholic drinks. ‘By . the end of this year, 80 per cent of all alcoholic drinks on shop . shelves will include clear labelling on units and health messages. ‘Through . the Responsibility Deal we will continue to discuss how to give . consumers more information on alcoholic drinks, including calorie . labelling.’ Retailers including Asda, Sainsbury’s and Tesco are working with the Department of Health on how to display calorie counts on alcohol. The Co-Op already includes some calorie information on its own brand beer, wine, cider and spirits. The Alcohol  Network of the Responsibility Deal is  ‘looking to develop further pledges which  could also support calorie reduction’. As part of a deal with the government, Heineken agreed to reduce the strength of a major brand of beer, removing 100m units of alcohol from our consumption each  year – the equivalent of 5.6bn calories. Now ministers want to develop  similar pledges.","Health minister Anna Soubry confirms that she is in talks with the drinks industry about giving details of how fattening alcohol is .

"By . Press Association Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:54 EST, 17 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:25 EST, 18 March 2013 . A painting hanging in the former home of Sir Francis Drake has been confirmed as a self-portrait by the Dutch Master Rembrandt. For decades the picture, which has been at Buckland Abbey in Devon since it was given to the National Trust in 2010, was thought to have been a portrait produced by one of Rembrandt’s pupils. But years of studying the 17th-century artist’s style and a new investigation of the painting by the world’s leading Rembrandt expert, Ernst van de Wetering, has re-attributed the painting as a work by the Dutch Master himself. Handle with care: Curator at Buckland Abbey David Taylor inspects a confirmed self-portrait of Rembrandt estimated to be worth £20 million . The painting, kept in storage for the . first 18 months it was at Buckland Abbey as there was nowhere to hang . it, is now one of the National Trust’s most important. It has been given a value of £20 million, although as the trust holds items on behalf of the nation forever, the organisation said it can never be sold. The painting was given to the National Trust as a gift from the estate of the late Edna, Lady Samuel of Wych Cross, whose husband Harold, Lord Samuel of Wych Cross, collected a great number of paintings during his lifetime. The self-portrait showing Rembrandt aged 29, “signed” by the Dutch Master and dated 1635, previously belonged to the Princes of Liechtenstein. Its provenance had been shrouded in mystery for 40 years, after Rembrandt specialist Horst Gerson suggested in 1968 that it may well have been painted by one of Rembrandt’s pupils. The real deal: Property Manager Jez McDermott, left, and Curator of Pictures and Sculpture at Buckland Abbey David Taylor gingerly carry the precious picture . In the same year members of the Rembrandt Research Project inspected the painting and came to the same conclusion, publishing their findings in 1989. Mr van de Wetering, Dutch art historian and chairman of the Rembrandt Research Project, said that based on what was known of the painter’s style in 1968, experts decided it was most likely to have been painted by one of his pupils. “But over the past 45 years we have gathered far more knowledge about Rembrandt’s self-portraits and the fluctuations in his style,” he said. An analysis by Mr van de Wetering, based on an X-ray of the painting published in 2005 and newly found circumstantial evidence, increased the likelihood it was by Rembrandt himself. Mr van de Wetering went to Buckland Abbey to look again at the painting, and said he saw the same crude brushwork and painting technique observed in other Rembrandt pictures of that period, leading to the conclusion it was by the Dutch Master. Gently does it: Staff hang the self-portrait in pride of place at Buckland Abbey, near Yelverton . Jez McDermott, National Trust property manager at Buckland Abbey, said: “It’s amazing to think we might’ve had an actual Rembrandt hanging here on the walls at Buckland Abbey for the past couple of years. We never dared think it might actually be an original, and many of our visitors will have just passed by it in what is sure to be a real contrast to the attention it is now going to receive.” David Taylor, curator of paintings and sculpture at the National Trust, said: “Rembrandt was one of the great artists of the so-called Dutch golden age. Former owner: Adventurer Sir Francis Drake lived at Buckland Abbey for 15 years from 1581 . He produced a huge number of self-portraits throughout his career, partly because he had a ready subject matter in himself, through which he could develop his painting technique but also because, as he was already famous, the finished images were highly desirable pictures for collectors. “This portrait is now one of our most important works of art and will be the only Rembrandt in the National Trust’s collection of approximately 13,500 paintings.” The painting will hang in Buckland Abbey for another eight months before being sent for cleaning and further examination to shed more light on its attribution. A full technical analysis, funded by £20,000 from the People’s Postcode Lottery, will include x-rays, examination of paint pigments, infrared testing to examine any drawing under the painting and tree-ring dating of the beech panel it is painted on. Buckland was originally a Cistercian abbey founded in 1278 by Amicia, Countess of Devon and was a daughter house of Quarr Abbey, on the Isle of Wight. It remained an abbey until the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII. In 1541 Henry sold Buckland to Sir Richard Grenville who, working with his son Roger, began to convert the abbey into a residence. Roger died in 1545, leaving a son, also named Richard Grenville, who completed the conversion. He eventually sold Buckland to Drake in 1581. Drake lived in the house for 15 years, as did many of his descendants until 1946, when it was sold to a local landowner, Arthur Rodd, who presented the property to the National Trust in 1948. The abbey has been open to the public since 1951.","The rare picture was found at Sir Francis Drake's home in Devon .

A retired teacher was tormented for a decade by a former pupil who fleeced him out of £75,000 over ten years in a blackmail plot. Graeme Robertshaw befriended the victim, a generous 83-year-old, who was then stripped of every penny he had and made to take out high interest payday loans by his tormentor. Newcastle Crown Court heard Robertshaw threatened to tell police he had been abused by the former teacher if he didn't keep the money coming to fund his heroin habit. Graeme Robertshaw (left) and accomplice Kenneth Price (right) were jailed at Newcastle Crown Court after he fleeced an 83-year-old retired teacher out of £75,000 in a 10-year scam . The scared pensioner, whose identity was protected by the court, was told sob stories and threatened over 10 years, between 2002 and 2012. The blackmail finally came to an end when neighbours saw Robertshaw and accomplice Kenneth Price threatening the terrified victim in his own home in Blyth, Northumberland. As Robertshaw was jailed for five years , Recorder Andrew Dallas told him: ‘He was generous towards you and you turned that to your advantage, you turned the screw on him and kept the screw turning for 10 years. ‘You pestered him on the phone, you sent him letters and this was mixed in with aggression, finger jabbing, holding him by the collar and emotional blackmail. ‘The victim was particularly vulnerable, living alone with a limited income on his pension and you systematically milked him of very large sums of money.’ The court heard Robertshaw had befriended the victim in 2002 when he was 73. Despite the pensioner's generosity and willingness to give him money, Robertshaw began a sinister campaign. At Newcastle Crown Court Graeme Robertshaw was jailed for five years and Kenneth Price was jailed for two years . He threatened to tell the police the former teacher had assaulted him unless he gave him more cash. Tim Gittins, prosecuting, said: ‘The complainant said Robertshaw had attended his home regularly demanding money with the threat he would report and publicise he had been abused. ‘Regular weekly withdrawals of cash had been taken from the man's building society account. ‘It was apparent he had from time-to-time also gone to payday loan companies to top up his pension.’ A total of £40,000 in cash was handed over to Robertshaw and further money was milked from payday loans and pawnbrokers, bringing the total to at least £75,000. After his savings had disappeared, the pensioner was made to take out loans at extortionate interest rate. He borrowed £739 from the Money Shop and had to pay back £1,899. A further 17 loans were taken out at the Cheque Centre for £5,880 and he had to pay back around £7,500. The decade-long plot finally came to an end in December last year when neighbours rang police after seeing Robertshaw and Price force their way into the victim's home in Blyth. The pair had barged in and were demanding money and Price threatened to burn his house down and made a throat-cutting gesture with his fingers. Police arrived soon afterwards and the pair were arrested. Robertshaw, 40, of Plessey Road, Blyth, pleaded guilty to three counts of blackmail and was jailed for five years. Price, 39, of Claremont Terrace, Newsham, Blyth, admitted one count of blackmail and was locked up for two years. Katie Barnes, for Robertshaw, said: ‘He made threats when he became desperate for money for drugs.’ Mark Saunders, for Price, said: ‘He was involved on one occasion. He was living with Robertshaw at the time but didn't know exactly what had been going on.’","Graeme Robertshaw swindled money from 83-year-old man from 2002 .

Tragic news on retiring: Terry Williams was devastated to discover that on the day he retired, his wife Wendy was killed in a crash with an ambulance . It was meant to be the first day of the rest of their lives. Terry Williams had arrived home, laden with champagne and gifts, to celebrate his retirement with his wife after a 40-year career. But their dreams of sharing a new stage of life together were not to be. Thirty minutes later, police arrived with the devastating news that his wife Wendy had been killed in a car crash. This week Mr Williams described the dreadful moment he found out his wife of 37 years was never coming home, when the day that should have been one of their happiest together turned into tragedy. Mrs Williams was killed when her car was hit by an ambulance racing to hospital at 75mph two days before Christmas in 2009. At the inquest into her death, Mr Williams, 63, a former consultant engineer, said: ‘I retired on the same day after 40 years working. ‘I came home with champagne and retirement gifts. Thirty minutes later there were two policemen on the doorstep telling me she’d been killed.’ He described his 60-year-old wife and mother of two as a ‘very active lady’, adding: ‘She always looked forward to Christmas and loved having the family around. I’m sure she was looking forward to the holiday break.’ Mrs Williams was driving her Ford Ka at a busy junction in Lichfield when she pulled out suddenly. Her car was hit by an ambulance, which had its sirens on as it raced at speeds of more than 75mph to help a five-year-old boy who had swallowed a coin. Paramedic Kevin Webster, who was driving the ambulance, was found not guilty of causing her death by careless  driving at a trial in 2011. At the inquest on Monday, South Staffordshire coroner Andrew Haigh confirmed that Mrs Williams, who had lived with her husband in a £300,000 four-bedroom detached house in Castle Bromwich, West Midlands, died as a result of a tragic accident. Giving evidence, paramedic Mr Webster said he had no chance to stop and did not expect Mrs  Williams to pull out at the junction. ‘Initially when I saw the car it was in the junction. As I travelled along the road the car appeared to pull out, stop, then it made a second movement,’ he said. ‘That was the last movement. It pulled out from the junction. Tragic accident: Mrs Williams died when she pulled out just yards in front of an ambulance car at the junction of Tamworth Road and Quarry Hill Lane, Lichfield (pictured) ‘I applied the brakes quite sharpish but unfortunately still impacted the car.’ Mrs Williams’ family has called on West Midlands Ambulance Service to impose speed limits on drivers and bring training in line with that of police emergency drivers. The inquest heard a new ambulance policy advises drivers not to exceed the speed limit by more than 50 per cent, although this is a guide rather than rule. Call for action: Since the accident in which paramedic Kevin Webster was driving (right), Mrs Williams' family have called on West Midlands Ambulance Service to impose speed limits on drivers and bring training in line with that of police emergency drivers . Mr Williams has previously spoken of the family’s concerns about the ambulance involved in the crash that killed his wife. It was travelling at nearly twice the . speed limit despite the fact that the call-out had been listed as a . category C, the lowest emergency rating. ‘Wendy was a beautiful 60-year-old looking forward to retirement with her family,’ said Mr Williams. ‘We hope that something can be done in future to avoid this sort of accident.’","Wendy Williams was killed as she pulled out in front of an ambulance in 2009 .

Drama: Mick Philpott (sketched left) in the witness box at Nottingham Crown Court, where he collapsed during a day of evidence about the events leading to the fire at his home . The father accused of killing six of his 17 children in a house fire admitted yesterday that he and his wife had a sordid sex session with another man on the night their children died. Mick Philpott, 56, sobbed in court as he spoke of his ‘total shame’ that he, wife Mairead, 31, and their best friend Paul Mosley, 46, took part in the ‘degrading’ threesome hours before the fire, which they are alleged to have planned. After the children died, they had three or four further sexual encounters together and smoked cannabis frequently. Philpott said he was ‘finding it very difficult to cope with what was going on’ and added: ‘Having sex and smoking cannabis was one way of blocking it out.’ He and his wife, who wept throughout the hearing, and Mosley are charged with killing the children at their home in Derby in the early hours of May 11 last year. It is alleged that Philpott masterminded the fire in a plot to frame former live-in lover Lisa Willis, 29, after she walked out on him, taking her five children. Prosecutors say the plan, allegedly an attempt to ruin her reputation ahead of a child custody hearing, went ‘horribly wrong’ and the fire swept out of control. In a dramatic day at Nottingham Crown Court yesterday, Philpott, dressed in a grey suit, white shirt and purple tie and clutching a St Christopher necklace, sobbed throughout and at one point collapsed, disappearing in the dock. He admitted that hours before the blaze he and his two co-defendants had a sex session in the house after he drove to a nearby dealer to buy cannabis. ‘I was kissing and cuddling my wife and she was holding Paul. It was just Mairead playing with Paul,’ he told jurors, adding that it only lasted a ‘couple of minutes’. Emotional: As a 999 call from his house was played to the court, Philpott put his head in his hands and sobbed uncontrollably . Drama: The 56-year-old then collapsed, sobbing loudly, as people in the public gallery also cried during evidence played to the jury . Regrets: Mick Philpott on the Jeremy Kyle Show in 2009, where he admitted his wife and girlfriend were pregnant so he needed a new larger council house . He did not initially tell the police . what had happened because they were ‘totally, totally ashamed of what . we’ve done. It’s totally irrelevant to what happened to the children, . it’s degrading’. He added that the sex sessions following the fire were his idea, not his . wife’s. He said he was ‘numb’ at the time. ‘I wanted to die to be with . my kids,’ he added. Philpott also described the couple’s regular dogging sessions, which . involved having sex with strangers in public. One session resulted in . Mairead becoming pregnant by an unknown man. She later had an abortion. In the dock: Mick Philpott, shown crying at a press conference with wife Mairead, started giving evidence today . Trial: Mick Philpott stands in the dock today as defence barrister Anthony Orchard QC asks questions while his wife Mairead wipes her eyes alongside the other defendant Paul Mosley .

Philpott said he and his wife were . sleeping naked in the conservatory when they were woken by the fire . alarm in the house.

Philpott went on: ‘I didn’t do it, on my life. They’re my life, my . heart, they’re everything to me. I wanted to hear them but I couldn’t. I . was hysterical. How do you explain trying to get to your babies? I . wanted to get to them. I shouted at my wife to get out. [She] tried to . get past and I stopped her.’ He went outside and climbed a ladder in an attempt to break the children’s bedroom window. ‘I was screaming for my daughter. The window was shut. I punched it . twice but it wouldn’t break,’ he said. ‘I just wanted to get my babies.’ Philpott managed to break the window with a metal socket set but could . not get in because of the thick black smoke coming from the room. The jury was then played a dramatic 999 call from that night, which led . to Philpott disappearing while sobbing hysterically in the dock. He also admitted hitting both his wife and his lover when they disciplined his children. The court had previously heard how Mosley had sex with Mairead on the . night of the fire. ‘The only thing I did wrong that night was b*** . Mairead over the snooker table,’ he told police.

Police are investigating a theory that the Victoria's Secret worker who suffered horrific acid burns to her face may have inflicted the injuries on herself. Naomi Oni, 20, spent a month in a burns unit and has been left partially blinded from what she claimed was an unprovoked assault by a woman wearing an Islamic niqab. The part-time model said she feared an unknown enemy was 'out to kill her' and wanted to die when she first saw the way her face had been disfigured. Scroll down for video . Emotional: Naomi Oni, 20, pictured with This Morning host Phillip Schofield earlier this month . Shocking: Naomi Oni was returning from a shift at Victoria's Secret in Stratford, when the attack happened . However, police are now investigating . whether the attack may have been self-inflicted after they seized her . computer and found she had searched websites about acid attacks before . she suffered her injuries. She is believed to have researched . Katie Piper, a model who became famous for her bravery after she had . sulphuric acid thrown in her face by an ex-boyfriend in 2008. Miss Oni said she is 'really upset' about the allegation. Her family have accused the police of not doing . enough to catch the true perpetrator and wasting time by instead . focusing on a 'crazy' line of enquiry. Miss Oni was severely scarred on . December 30 following a shift working at lingerie store Victoria's . Secret at the Westfield Shopping Centre in Stratford, East London. Campaigner: Miss Oni is understood to have researched high profile acid attack victim Katie Piper before she was attacked herself . She said she was getting off a bus . close to her home in Dagenham, Essex, at around 12.40am when she noticed . a woman in traditional Muslim clothing, which covered all but her eyes, . 'coldly' staring at her from behind. She then felt something being thrown . at her, she added. 'Before I could feel it burning, I just knew it was . acid. I thought, OK, someone is out to kill me.' Miss Oni suffered horrific burns to . her face, leg, arm and head. She lost her hair and eyelashes in the . incident and has undergone several operations since. Doctors had initially feared that she . would be permanently blinded but following intensive treatment at a . specialist burns unit, she recovered sight in her left eye and partial . sight in her right eye. Miss Oni's story was first reported earlier this month after she went public in a bid to help police find her attacker. She made an emotional appearance on ITV's This Morning, for a reported fee of £3,000. 'I don't want people to see me in . public. I don't want to get the Tube or the bus. If I have to go to the . hospital, I take a taxi,' she said. 'I have no clue why someone would do . this to me.' Her case attracted much sympathy and top American cosmetic surgeon Cap Lesesne offered to operate on her for free. The incident has caused considerable . concern near her home and she and her mother have moved out temporarily . for fear of further attacks. Far right groups, such as the English Defence League, have used the attack to criticise Muslims. By the time she appeared on . television, police had reportedly sought to retrieve Miss Oni's laptop . computer, which was handed over by her disabled mother, Marian Yalekhue. It is believed she had searched . websites relating to acid attacks and the story of Miss Piper, 29, who . campaigns for victims of facial disfigurement. The pair were due to meet after Miss Oni's public appeal. Horrific injuries: Naomi Oni suffered burns to her face, head, arm and leg in an apparent attack in December . Officers have since questioned relatives about whether Miss Oni could have harmed herself. Miss Oni said: 'The police haven't . been able to find anyone. They even asked my aunt if I had done it to . myself, which really upset me. Why would anyone do this to themselves?' Friend Sheila Maclean said it was . 'innocuous' that Miss Oni may have watched a Channel 4 documentary about . Miss Piper on her computer, adding that this would simply have been due . to an interest in make-up. Miss Oni's boyfriend Ato Owede, 23, . said the police are 'concentrating on the wrong things' and 'are just . coming to a silly conclusion'. Police have yet to establish what kind of chemical was used in the attack. No arrests have been made.

A man who went shopping with his wife but then got bored is celebrating after he wandered off and bought a winning lottery ticket. Robin Kiddie, 60, decided to leave his wife Christin, also 60, to get the groceries at Tesco in Ludlow, Shropshire, while he went to get a ticket. His boredom paid off to the tune of £6,299,421 after Saturday's draw when his numbers came up. He only found out about his win on Monday because he fell asleep after getting home from the England vs France rugby match and only 'half-checking' the ticket. Robin and Christine Kiddie will split the money with their four children with whom they were in a syndicate . The couple put their success down to a wish they made at a fountain in Rome while they were on holiday . Initially Mr Kiddie thought he had four or five numbers but it was only on Monday when he looked again that he learned of the good news. He sent a message to his children saying 'I've got good news - we've won the lottery' and it will now be shared among them because they are part of a syndicate. Celebrating their success at Fishmore Hall Hotel in Ludlow, Mr Kiddie said:  'I'm excited, nervous and a bit confused. I was on two days holiday last week and haven't been doing the lottery every week but happened to be in Tesco in Kidderminster. 'I was at a loose end waiting for Christine so I put the lottery on. And it was pay day as well. But I didn't find out we'd won untIl Monday because I was at the rugby on Saturday watching England v France. 'I drove home Sunday so by the time I got back I was pretty knackered. I thought maybe I've got four or five numbers but I went to bed. 'I went to work the next day, logged on to my computer and thought I would check the numbers to see how much we had won. I saw we had six numbers and I checked and I checked and then came off the website and went back on and checked again. 'A colleague was walking past and I . asked him to tell me if the numbers were the same. I text my children . before I phoned Christine. It said something like 'I've got good news, we've won £6.2 million on the lottery'. The couple celebrated their £6,299,421 win at a hotel in Ludlow, Shropshire . Mr Kiddie didn't realise they had won the lottery until Monday morning because he was too tired to check the tickets properly . 'But I got sceptical texts back. Thing like ""oh yeh, I'll have a car"" or ""you can get me a house"". They just didn't believe us.' The couple say they believe their win . may be down to a wish they made while on holiday in Italy at the Trevi . Fountain. They visited Italy in 2008 and vowed to return there 'if they . ever won the lottery.' Mr Kiddie added: 'We took my mother there a few years ago when an opportunity arose. She said she would like to go back and we said we would go back when we won the lottery. 'We threw a coin in the Trevi Fountain just because that's what people do. I don't remember the exact wish but during the holiday we said we wanted to win the lottery so we could come back to Rome - so I suppose it came true.' The couple's £6 million win is part of a family syndicate with their four adult children, who wished to remain anonymous. Describing the moment her husband broke the good news Mrs Kiddie, a bank nurse at Ludlow Hospital, said: 'Robin told me to sit down and said he had something to tell me. He said ""we've won the lottery"". I said ""don't be stupid"". 'I thought he's losing his marbles now. 'So I phoned my mother-in-law because I thought if he's told her then it must be true because he wouldn't dare tell her a lie. The couple hope to go back to Rome after vowing they would return if their numbers came up . 'This only happened on Monday so it hasn't really sunk in yet. I'm just happy for the kids, they're going to be financially secure for the rest of their lives. 'It's nice that we can see them enjoy the money rather than have it after we have gone.' The couple, from Ludlow, who have four grown-up children and five grand-children, now plan to pay off the mortgage and buy a new Mercedes for Mr Kiddie as they decide whether to move house or where to go on holiday. Mrs Kiddie added: 'The children live all around the country but we went for a big family meal on Tuesday night. 'I've barely slept five hours since Monday so we haven't had chance to see friends too much yet. It's all such a shock.'","The winning numbers drawn on Saturday night were 2, 16, 25, 30, 31, 32 .

A banking boss was fined just £2,640 after he risked the lives of his two young children in a high-speed police chase while three times over the drink-drive limit. Scott Jarvis, head of HR and business banking at Barclays, escaped with the paltry fine – equivalent to about a week’s wages – because magistrates said his long hours meant he would struggle to do community service. Isobel, six, and George, three, were in the back of their father’s BMW as, drunk on six cans of premium-strength lager, he swerved uncontrollably across the M1 late on a Saturday afternoon last month. The 35-year-old high-flier, who earns a six-figure salary at the bank, admitted putting their lives at risk. He was caught after police received a 999 call to report his erratic driving. At first he refused to stop, careering away along the hard shoulder, but eventually he gave up. He parked his car at a dangerous angle on the side of the road, with its rear pointing out on to the motorway. Jarvis has since been banned from seeing the children by his estranged wife, Lucy.Appearing in court this week he admitted a charge of driving with excess alcohol and had his licence taken away for two years. He was fined £2,640 – just over a week’s worth of his salary – after magistrates ‘made an exception’. He is believed to earn £125,000 a year. They were told he worked 70 hours a week and was often busy at weekends, so would  find it difficult to do community service, the usual sentence for such a crime. Leicester magistrates’ court heard that Jarvis suffered from depression, and had been drinking ‘with intensity’ since he split from his wife of ten years last summer. On February 2, after drinking six cans of premium-strength lager at lunch, he drove his children from his home in St Albans, Hertfordshire, towards Birmingham, where he was due to meet friends before going on a trip to a theme park the following day. Scene: Jarvis' car was said to be swerving dangerously on the M1 . The court heard how his BMW was spotted ‘swerving from the nearside to the offside’ of the northbound carriageway of the M1. A concerned driver, who called 999, also reported the car ‘indicating left despite there being no turn-off’. Police rushed to the scene and Jarvis eventually stopped. Officers immediately noticed his children were in the car and said he was ‘unsteady on his feet and his breath smelled of alcohol’. Tests showed he was more than three times the drink-drive limit, with 107mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath. At Wednesday’s hearing Jarvis was dressed smartly in a pin-striped suit, white shirt and cufflinks. High-flier: Jarvis escaped community service as it wouldn't 'fit in with his long working hours' He rubbed his hands together nervously as he awaited the court’s decision. Magistrates heard how he had spiralled into depression and was taking medication following the breakdown of the ‘turbulent’ relationship with his estranged wife, with whom he used to share a £650,000 four-bedroom detached home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. He began to drink with ‘intensity rather than frequency’ but failed to acknowledge he had a drinking problem until his arrest last month, magistrates were told. Jarvis accepted the consequences of his offence could have been far more serious and was ‘embarrassed and ashamed’, the court heard. ‘He is looking at what has happened in his life. This has been a real kick and he realises he needs to make changes,’ a representative from the probation service said. Tom Petersen, defending, added: ‘All the events and the depression were triggered by the breakdown of a ten-year relationship. ‘[That combined with] a very busy working life has left us in the position where Mr Jarvis is here today. It is not something he takes other than very seriously. His employer is aware of what is going on. He is dealing with the problem.’ Magistrates heard Jarvis, who describes himself on Twitter as a ‘humanist, atheist’, had been caught driving without due care and attention and without insurance in March 1998, when he was a student.They decided to fine the wealthy businessman after being told he worked more than 70 hours a week and was often busy at weekends. A larger fine of £3,650 was reduced by a third because of his early guilty plea. The final figure of £2,640 included £85 in court costs and a £120 victim’s surcharge. Chair of the bench David Simpson told Jarvis: ‘We are minded to make an exception in this case and give you a fine instead of a community order, which would be the norm. ‘I hope you are able to continue with the work that you are doing with regard to your alcohol issue and wish you the best for the future.’ Jarvis declined to comment after the hearing.","Magistrates said his 'long working hours' meant he would 'struggle to do community service'

A husband has recalled the moment he returned home on his first day of retirement, only to discover that his wife had been killed in a car crash. Terry Williams had arrived home, laden with champagne and gifts, to celebrate his retirement with his wife Wendy after a 40-year career. But their dreams of sharing a new stage of life together were not to be as 30 minutes later police arrived to tell him the heartbreaking news that his wife had died. This week Mr Williams described the . dreadful moment he found out his wife of 37 years was never coming home, . when the day that should have been one of their happiest together . turned into tragedy. Tragic news on retiring: Terry Williams was devastated to discover that on the day he retired, his wife Wendy was killed in a crash with an ambulance . Mrs Williams was killed when her car was hit by an ambulance racing to hospital at 75mph two days before Christmas in 2009. At the inquest into her death, Mr Williams, 63, a former consultant engineer, said: ‘I retired on the same day after 40 years working. ‘I came home with champagne and retirement gifts. Thirty minutes later there were two policemen on the doorstep telling me she’d been killed.’ He described his 60-year-old wife and mother of two as a ‘very active lady’, adding: ‘She always looked forward to Christmas and loved having the family around. I’m sure she was looking forward to the holiday break.’ Mrs Williams was driving her Ford Ka at a busy junction in Lichfield when she pulled out suddenly. Tragic accident: Mrs Williams died when she pulled out just yards in front of an ambulance car at the junction of Tamworth Road and Quarry Hill Lane, Lichfield (pictured) Her car was hit by an ambulance, . which had its sirens on as it raced at speeds of more than 75mph to help . a five-year-old boy who had swallowed a coin.

At . the inquest on Monday, South Staffordshire coroner Andrew Haigh . confirmed that Mrs Williams, who had lived with her husband in a . £300,000 four-bedroom detached house in Castle Bromwich, West Midlands, . died as a result of a tragic accident. Giving evidence, paramedic Mr Webster . said he had no chance to stop and did not expect Mrs  Williams to pull . out at the junction. ‘Initially when I saw the car it was in the . junction. As I travelled along the road the car appeared to pull out, . stop, then it made a second movement,’ he said. ‘That was the last movement. It pulled out from the junction. ‘I applied the brakes quite sharpish but unfortunately still impacted the car.’ Call for action: Since the accident in which paramedic Kevin Webster was driving (right), Mrs Williams' family have called on West Midlands Ambulance Service to impose speed limits on drivers and bring training in line with that of police emergency drivers . Mrs Williams’ family has called on . West Midlands Ambulance Service to impose speed limits on drivers and . bring training in line with that of police emergency drivers. The . inquest heard a new ambulance policy advises drivers not to exceed the . speed limit by more than 50 per cent, although this is a guide rather . than rule. Mr Williams has previously spoken of the family’s concerns about the ambulance involved in the crash that killed his wife. It was travelling at nearly twice the . speed limit despite the fact that the call-out had been listed as a . category C, the lowest emergency rating. ‘Wendy was a beautiful 60-year-old looking forward to retirement with her family,’ said Mr Williams. ‘We hope that something can be done in future to avoid this sort of accident.’","Wendy Williams was killed as she pulled out in front of an ambulance in 2009 .

NASA's Mars rover Curiosity yesterday resumed analysis of a sample of rock powder following a computer glitch that suspended operations for a week. Before the computer problem, results radioed back to Earth revealed that the rock, located near Curiosity's Gale Crater landing site, contains all the chemical ingredients necessary for microbial life, the over-arching goal of the planned two-year mission. Scientists are eager for additional information about the rock sample, which was drilled out from what appears to be a slab of bedrock in an area known as Yellowknife Bay. After back-to-back computer problems, the six-wheel Curiosity rover, seen in this self-portrait, has resumed its science experiments . Curiosity automatically suspended its work on March 17 when it detected a problem with a computer data file. The glitch occurred as the rover was recovering from an earlier, unrelated computer problem. The unplanned work hiatus ended over the weekend, NASA's deputy project manager Jim Erickson said. 'It's a slow recovery process, but we're back doing science,' Erickson said. Analysis of the rock powder will continue for about another week. Beginning April 4, radio communications between Earth and Mars will be blocked by the sun for a month, suspending most of the rover's science operations again.

When the planets re-align for communications after May 1, scientists plan to drill a second hole into the rock to verify the early results and look more closely for signs of organic carbon. The £2billion rover landed on Mars on August 6 to assess if the planet most like Earth has or ever had the chemical ingredients and environments for microbial life.

Alabama authorities are investigating what caused an airport sign in a recently renovated space to fall and kill a 10-year old boy and leave his mother in serious condition. Heather Bresette of Overland Park, Kansas, and several of her children were pinned under a flight display sign weighing 300 to 400 pounds (140 to 180 kg) that fell inside the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport as they traveled home on Friday from a spring break vacation in Florida. Luke Bresette, 10, was killed. His brother Sam, 8, was in good condition on Monday at the Children's of Alabama hospital, and 5-year-old brother Tyler had been released, said hospital spokeswoman Kathy Bowers. Heather Bresette suffered a crushed pelvis and two broken ankles, said the family's priest, Father Don Farnan of St. Thomas More parish in Kansas City, Missouri. Heather Bresette remains in a critical condition after a flight information sign at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport feel on her family and killed her 10-year-old son Luke, right . Crushed: The giant flight status sign, estimated to weigh between 300-400 pounds, pictured resting on the ground of the brand new airport terminal that just opened last week . 'It is horrible. They are trying to . pick up the pieces and go on with life. Ryan has four other children to . take care of,' Farnan said of Ryan Bresette, Luke's father. Airport officials said they would not speculate on the cause of the incident, which remained under investigation. The probe will include talks with . contractors and subcontractors who recently updated the part of the . airport where the sign was hung, airport officials said in a statement. The renovated area opened on March 13, said spokeswoman Toni Bast. Birmingham Mayor William Bell called for a swift review of the 'horrible accident.' 'No parent should have to endure the . death of their child,' he said. 'I have met with the father, and he is . heartbroken and wants and deserves answers. I want a full report on my . desk as quickly as possible.' Ryan Bresette remembered his son on . Facebook over the weekend, asking friends and family to wear their . favorite sports jerseys to church in honor of his sports-loving child. 'He was spunky and energetic and very . bright. Ornery on occasions,' Farnan said on Monday. 'He had one of . those faces, that when in trouble, you had a tough time holding him to . it once he gave you that smile.' Steve Stine, an assistant city . attorney, said the flight information display that killed Luke Bresette . as his family returned home from a Florida beach vacation was a movable . cabinet containing video monitors that didn't require inspection under . municipal codes. He said in emailed response to . questions from The Associated Press on Tuesday that the unit rested on . the floor as a free-standing cabinet, similar to a home entertainment . center. 'The building code does not . contemplate, and the city does not inspect furniture or cabinetry like . this object,' Stine said in the email. The cabinet and monitors, previously . described by authorities as weighing between 300 and 400 pounds, were . installed in a recent $201 million terminal upgrade and expansion at . Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport. Stine also said inspectors were not required to inspect the display because it was not a structural component of the building. The family was flying home to Overland . Park, Kansas, after a weeklong beach trip to Destin, Fla., when the . unit fell in a renovated area of the airport that opened March 13. It's . unclear what made the display fall. Family tragedy: Luke Bresette, 10, was killed after an airport sign collapsed on him, his mom and two younger brothers . Luke Bresette, 10, second from right was the third eldest of five children . Neither the Alabama Department of . Transportation nor Federal Aviation Administration is investigating. They lack jurisdiction over airport terminals. Stine's description of the unit . matched that of Birmingham real estate manager Albert Osorio, who was . inside the terminal and helped other men lift it off the child. 'I saw no bolts, nothing holding the thing to the wall at all,' Osorio said. 'It looked like a bookcase up against the wall.' Osorio said it appeared someone had . applied heavy-duty construction adhesive to the bottom of the unit in a . bid to secure it to the terminal floor. Osorio, who helped hold up the unit . while others tried to aid the injured, said he has a 10-year-old son of . his own and was angered by the boy's death. Airport workers did not have . first aid equipment to help the child, he said. 'The city failed this family,' Osorio said. First responders: The massive flight information board is seen propped up against the wall by rescue workers . Scene: Witnesses reported a loud crash with people screaming in the area before eight to 10 people hurried to lift the massive board off of the family . Rushed away: One of the injured is seen being taken away from the scene on a stretcher . Immediate care: One of the young is taken away from the scene by emergency personnel . Toni Herrera-Bast, a city airport . authority spokeswoman, said the airport has heart defibrillators for . cardiac emergencies but relies on Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service for . emergency medical care. Fire Marshal C.W. Mardis said crews arrived . outside the terminal within five minutes of receiving a 911 emergency . call. Herrera-Bast said she did not know . whether anyone had inspected the flight display before officials opened . the building to passengers earlier this month. She referred questions to . contractor Brasfield & Gorrie-Bloc Global Services Group of . Birmingham, which declined comment . 'Because of the ongoing evaluation, it . would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time,' the . company said in a statement. 'The analysis is being conducted with the . cooperation of the airport authority, design partners and other local . officials.' Ryan Bresette, in a public post on his Facebook page, said he and his wife love their children 'more than they will ever know.' 'It is not fair to have to watch the pain on my children's faces,' he wrote. Closed off: Two workers are seen cleaning in a closed off section of the terminal where the large sign, said to be between 300-400 pounds, fell off the wall . Safety measures: As a precautionary measure barricades have been placed around the airport's other flight status boards, the fallen one is seen here . A witness Tweeting a photo near the scene described it as 'blood everywhere and a mom screaming.' The terminal has since closed with no word yet on when it will reopen. Barricades have since been positioned around the airport's other flight status boards as a precautionary measure. Birmingham's mayor William Bell released a statement immediately after the incident promising his full support in the investigation. Emergency rescue: Fire trucks rushed to the terminal at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport . Crews: Emergency crews rushed to the scene just after 1.30pm on Friday . 'I have offered our full support to the Airport Authority as they . investigate what has occurred this afternoon.

Michael Seraphin, spokesman for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, told KOAA-TV: 'The mountain lion came out from some bushes that are in close proximity to the street that he was walking on, grabbed the Dachshund, and tucked and pulled hard enough to yank the leash out of his hand.' The cougar then killed the small dog and ate it. Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesman Michael Seraphin said the mountain lion was deemed a threat to public safety and a plan was set to capture it after the incident last Wednesday. Several hours after the attack, the mountain lion was successfully trapped. KOAA-TV reported that the animal was euthanized and sent to Fort Collins for a necropsy, where remnants of the Daschund were discovered in the cougar's stomach.

An . unidentified neighbor told the station: 'We know there are mountain . lions in the area, there have been other attacks several years ago. She added: 'Our backyard neighbor - a mountain lion climbed a tree and jumped onto her deck and took her dog.' While the prey of mountain lions is limited mainly to deer, there have been instances where they have attacked people. Colorado Parks & Wildlife officials urge anyone who may come face-to-face with a mountain lion to remain calm and move away slowly from the animal while talking firmly. It's important not to run. If a mountain lion acts aggressively, a person can throw sticks, rocks or branches to ward it off, as the cat will generally not attack prey that fights back.

An Alabama airport is still using a large panel of video monitors just like the one that tipped over and killed a 10-year-old Kansas boy last week. The approximately 9-foot-tall cabinet was flashing flight information on three screens near baggage claim Wednesday, five days after a similar display killed Luke Bresette, 10, one floor above. A small warning sign there tells visitors not to touch the cabinet. A portable metal fence on wheels is in place to keep people away. Scroll down for video . Outrage: Despite Friday's accident, a video monitor cabinet similar to the one that fell on Friday still exists - with a 'don't touch' sign and a barricade in front of it . Tragedy: The sign at the newly renovated Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport fell on a mother and her three children on Friday afternoon . Airport spokeswoman Toni Herrera-Bast says a similar cabinet was removed from another area, but she didn't have any immediate information about the one still in use. The 300- to 400-pound steel cabinet fell on Friday, killing the child as his family returned home from Florida. His mother and two brothers were hurt. On Tuesday, it was revealed that sign was located in a recently renovated space. Heather Bresette of Overland Park, Kansas, and her children were pinned under the flight display sign that fell inside the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport as they traveled home on Friday from a spring break vacation in Florida. Luke was killed. His brother Sam, 8, was in good condition at the Children's of Alabama hospital, and 5-year-old brother Tyler had been released, said hospital spokeswoman Kathy Bowers. Heather Bresette suffered a crushed pelvis and two broken ankles, said the family's priest, Father Don Farnan of St Thomas More parish in Kansas City, Missouri.

They are trying to . pick up the pieces and go on with life. Ryan has four other children to . take care of,' Farnan said of Ryan Bresette, Luke's father. The incident remains under investigation. The probe will include talks with . contractors and subcontractors who recently updated the part of the . airport where the sign was hung, airport officials said in a statement. The renovated area opened on March 13, said spokeswoman Toni Bast. Birmingham Mayor William Bell called for a swift review of the 'horrible accident.' 'No parent should have to endure the . death of their child,' he said. 'I have met with the father, and he is . heartbroken and wants and deserves answers. I want a full report on my . desk as quickly as possible.' Ryan Bresette remembered his son on . Facebook over the weekend, asking friends and family to wear their . favorite sports jerseys to church in honor of his sports-loving child. First responders: The massive flight information board is seen propped up against the wall by rescue workers . Scene: Witnesses reported a loud crash with people screaming in the area before eight to 10 people hurried to lift the massive board off of the family . 'He was spunky and energetic and very . bright. Ornery on occasions,' Farnan said on Monday. 'He had one of . those faces, that when in trouble, you had a tough time holding him to . it once he gave you that smile.' Steve Stine, an assistant city . attorney, told the Associated Press on Tuesday that the unit rested on . the floor as a free-standing cabinet, similar to a home entertainment . center. 'The building code does not . contemplate, and the city does not inspect furniture or cabinetry like . this object,' Stine said in the email. The cabinet and monitors, previously . described by authorities as weighing between 300 and 400 pounds, were . installed in a recent $201million terminal upgrade and expansion at the airport. Stine also said inspectors were not required to inspect the display because it was not a structural component of the building. The family was flying home to Overland . Park, Kansas, after a weeklong beach trip to Destin, Florida, when the . unit fell in a renovated area of the airport that opened March 13. It's not clear what made the display fall.

Stine's description of the unit . matched that of Birmingham real estate manager Albert Osorio, who was . inside the terminal and helped other men lift it off the child. 'I saw no bolts, nothing holding the thing to the wall at all,' Osorio said. 'It looked like a bookcase up against the wall.' Osorio said it appeared someone had . applied heavy-duty construction adhesive to the bottom of the unit in a . bid to secure it to the terminal floor. Osorio, who helped hold up the unit . while others tried to aid the injured, said he has a 10-year-old son of . his own and was angered by the boy's death. Airport workers did not have . first aid equipment to help the child, he said. 'The city failed this family,' Osorio said. Toni Herrera-Bast, a city airport . authority spokeswoman, said the airport has heart defibrillators for . cardiac emergencies but relies on Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service for . emergency medical care. Rushed away: One of the injured is seen being taken away from the scene on a stretcher . Immediate care: One of the young is taken away from the scene by emergency personnel . Fire Marshal C.W.

An official for the association, which represents 64,000 police union members, told the television station on Friday that the conditions for the reward had not been met because Dorner was not arrested.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 11:35 EST, 20 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:35 EST, 20 March 2013 . The U.S. government is abandoning a legal battle to require that cigarette packs carry a set of large and often graphic warning labels depicting the dangers of smoking and encouraging smokers to quit. Instead, the Food and Drug Administration will go back to the drawing board and create labels to replace those that included images of diseased lungs and the sewn-up corpse of a smoker, according to a letter from Attorney General Eric Holder. The government had until Monday to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review an appeals court decision upholding a ruling that the requirement violated First Amendment free speech protections. Graphic: The U.S. government is abandoning a legal battle to require that cigarette packs carry a set of large and often graphic warning labels, like those pictured depicting the dangers of smoking and encouraging smokers to quit . 'In light of these circumstances, the Solicitor General has determined... not to seek Supreme Court review of the First Amendment issues at the present time,' Holder wrote in a Friday letter to House Speaker John Boehner notifying him of the decision. Some of the nation's largest tobacco companies, including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., sued to block the mandate to include warnings on cigarette packs as part of the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act that, for the first time, gave the federal government authority to regulate tobacco. The nine labels originally set to appear on store shelves last year would've represented the biggest change in cigarette packs in the U.S. in 25 years. Tobacco companies increasingly rely on their packaging to build brand loyalty and grab consumers — one of the few advertising levers left to them after the government curbed their presence in magazines, billboards and TV. They had argued that the proposed warnings went beyond factual information into anti-smoking advocacy. The government, however, argued the . images were factual in conveying the dangers of tobacco, which is . responsible for about 443,000 deaths in the U.S. a year. Drawing board: Instead, the Food and Drug Administration will go back to the drawing board to create new labels, according to a letter from Attorney General Eric Holder, pictured . The nine graphic warnings proposed by the FDA included color images of a man exhaling cigarette smoke through a tracheotomy hole in his throat, and a plume of cigarette smoke enveloping an infant receiving a mother's kiss. These were accompanied by assertions that smoking causes cancer and can harm fetuses. The warnings were to cover the entire top half of cigarette packs, front and back, and include the phone number for a stop-smoking hotline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW. In a statement on Tuesday, the FDA said it would 'undertake research to support a new rulemaking consistent with the Tobacco Control Act.' The FDA did not provide a timeline for the revised labels. 'Although we pushed forcefully ... (the) ruling against the warning labels won't deter the FDA from seeking an effective and sound way to implement the law,' Dr. Howard Koh, assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, wrote in an blog post Tuesday afternoon. Floyd Abrams, a noted First Amendment lawyer who represented Lorillard Tobacco Co. in the challenge said he wasn't surprised by the Justice Department's decision not to appeal. 'The graphic warnings imposed by the FDA were constitutionally indefensible,' he wrote in an email.Warning labels first appeared on U.S. cigarette packs in 1965, and current warning labels that feature a small box with text were put on cigarette packs in the mid-1980s. Factual: The government argued the images were factual in conveying the dangers of tobacco, which is responsible for about 443,000 deaths in the U.S. a year (stock photo) The share of Americans who smoke has fallen dramatically since 1970, from nearly 40 percent to about 19 percent. But the rate has stalled since about 2004, with about 45 million adults in the U.S. smoking cigarettes. It's unclear why it hasn't budged, but some market watchers have cited tobacco company discount coupons on cigarettes and lack of funding for programs to discourage smoking or to help smokers quit. In recent years, more than 40 countries or jurisdictions have introduced labels similar to those created by the FDA. The World Health Organization said in a survey done in countries with graphic labels that a majority of smokers noticed the warnings and more than 25 percent said the warnings led them to consider quitting. Joining North Carolina-based R.J. Reynolds, owned by Reynolds American Inc., and Lorillard Tobacco, owned by Lorillard Inc., in the lawsuit were Commonwealth Brands Inc., Liggett Group LLC and Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company Inc. Richmond, Va.-based Altria Group Inc., parent company of the nation's largest cigarette maker, Philip Morris USA, which makes the top-selling Marlboro brand, was not a part of the lawsuit. The case is separate from a lawsuit by several of the same tobacco companies over other marketing restrictions in the 2009 law. Last March, a federal appeals court in Cincinnati ruled that the law was constitutional. The companies in October petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review that case.","Had until Monday to ask the U.S. Supreme .

A church-going 83-year-old widow has . been handed a suspended jail sentence for 'waging psychological warfare' on her soldier neighbour and his young family after a football landed . in her garden. In a shocking campaign of harassment, . 'vile' pensioner Ethel Watkins – known as The Duchess on her middle-class estate because of her smart dress and aloofness – 'visited mental torture' on the sergeant . major, his wife, and their two sons after they moved in next door. Watkins branded them 'scum' and . 'hooligans', deprived the youngsters of sleep by repeatedly banging on . the walls, and made up foul-mouthed songs about the family. 'Vile': 83 year-old Ethel Watkins leaves Loughborough Magistrates Court today after being found guilty of breaching a restraining order and told she may face jail . The great-grandmother, a member of the . Royal British Legion's Women's Section for 66 years before she was . kicked out for the offences, even set off her own burglar alarm to . disturb the peace. She also taunted the young mother about the loss of a . six-month-old baby and said she hoped her husband 'wouldn't come back . from Afghanistan' following a tour of duty. In a bid to stop the abuse, Watkins . was given a five-year restraining order in July last year preventing her . from contacting the family, who cannot be named for legal reasons, or . any visitors to their home in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. She was handed the ban, and a fine, . after admitting a charge of harassment at Loughborough Magistrates' Court, and was told she had only just escaped jail because of her age. But incredibly, Watkins ignored the . warning, and was arrested again within 24 hours of her court appearance . for resuming her reign of terror on the quiet residential street. Harassment: Ethel Watkins, 83, launched a shocking campaign against a young family after a child's football landed in her garden . Watkins pleaded not guilty to . breaching the restraining order on four separate occasions - even . claiming that she was singing hymns instead of being abusive. But JPs at the same court rejected her denials and convicted her of the offences last December. Chairman of the bench Ben Faust adjourned sentence so psychiatric reports into Watkin's mental state could be prepared. Lisa O'Driscoll, defending, said . medical reports showed Watkins was suffering from the early stages of . dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and claimed this explained much of her . erratic behaviour. But Mr Faust said it was clear Watkins 'retained the capacity to know right from wrong'. He added: 'Your actions had a . significant impact on the children living next door to you. The family . were victimised by you to such an extent they had to leave home.' Mr Faust told Watkins that if the . family had remained at home, she would have been sent to prison because . it would have been the court's duty to protect them from further harm. Instead, she was given a 26-week jail . term, suspended for two years, and ordered to pay the family £2,000 in . compensation, as well as prosecution costs of £620. She was also reminded by magistrates that the existing five-year restraining order remained in place. At an earlier hearing, the court heard . the family, who now live in Cyprus where the Sgt Maj is based, moved in . next to Watkins in 2011 wanting to make a 'fresh start' after the loss . of their baby, and initially got on well with their new neighbour. The mother even confided in Watkins, . who lives alone, about the death of the child - but the relationship . turned sour after a ball the children were playing with landed in . Watkins' garden. Carol Huston, prosecuting, said the . trouble then escalated rapidly, with Watkins setting off her own burglar . alarm to prevent the children from sleeping. Abusive: The pensioner would pass the house ans swear at the house, as well as sing vile songs and abuse her neighbour about the death of her baby and that she hoped her husband would be killed in action . The hearing was told Watkins, who had . lived in her semi-detached home since 1991, would regularly insult the . mother with songs she had made up. Mrs Huston added: 'She would repeat . over and over things like ""You are poison, you are evil, you won't win, . go back to where you came from, you are nothing but a tramp"".' Mrs Huston said that on occasions, the taunts referred to the dead child. She said: 'Watkins would shout words similar to, ""What kind of life would the child have had if it lived?""' The family were asked by police to log . every incident to build up a dossier of evidence against Watkins. Pictures the family took included the widow, who lives alone, flashing a . V sign as she passed their home. She was eventually arrested and . appeared in court on July 25 last year, where she admitted harassment . and was given the restraining order. However, just a day later Watkins committed her first breach. Watkins went on to commit three . further breaches of the restraining order in early September. She made . retching noises at the family, called the mother 'scum', and insulted . the children. After Watkins was found guilty of the breaches, victim impact statements from the family were read out. One female magistrate wept as the . court heard how Watkins' behaviour had left the mother 'depressed, . exhausted, and on the verge of a breakdown'. In her statement, she said Watkins had . waged 'psychological warfare against her and her family', adding she . was 'barely able to function without the support of her wider family'. In a new statement read before Watkins . was sentenced, her husband asked the court what steps would be taken to . protect his family from her when they return to the UK in two years' time. He added it would be very difficult to sell their home, as he would feel 'honour bound' to tell potential buyers about Watkins.","Pensioner Ethel Watkins branded neighbours 'scum' and .

Devastated: The husband of Sandra Layne, 87-year-old Fred Layne openly wept as the verdict was read on Tuesday . Following the verdict, Ms Hoffman told the Detroit Free Press that she was happy that her mother had been found guilty. She added: 'I know my son is in heaven and that is a place she’ll never see.' Hoffman had been living with his grandparents since 2011 when his parents divorced and moved to Arizona. The elderly woman's husband Fred Layne wept in court as his wife was shackled and taken away by officers. Layne struck grandson Jonathan Hoffman with six of . ten shots fired over a six-minute span on May 18, 2012. During the two-week trial, the jury heard a recording of . the 17-year-old's desperate call to 911 and even more shots while he was . on the line. 'My grandma shot me. I'm going to die. Help. I got shot again,' Hoffman told a dispatcher as he gasped for air. Tragic: Jonathan Hoffman, 17, was shot dead by his grandmother last spring . Prosecutor Paul Walton told jurors that Layne never rushed out of the West Bloomfield Township home, despite claiming to be afraid of her grandson, and never called for an ambulance to help him. She claimed that she shot him after Hoffman struck her during a heated argument about money and a plan to flee Michigan because of a failed drug test. 'She told the court last week: 'I wanted him to pay attention to me. He had to listen. ''It wasn't a conversation. It was arguing. Swearing.' But Walton pointed . out that Layne never complained to police about being attacked. A . hospital nurse who examined her after her arrest said Layne had no . injuries and spoke lovingly about Hoffman. Defense attorney Jerome Sabbota asked jurors to view the incident through the eyes of a woman in her 70s. He said Layne was taking care of a teen . who had used drugs and brought strangers to the home. Hoffman's parents . were in Arizona during his senior year of high school.

During her emotional testimony last week, Sandra Layne said that it was a difficult arrangement, especially after her grandson was treated in a hospital for using hallucinogenic drugs. Layne said Hoffman was deeply upset on the day of the shooting after testing positive for so-called synthetic marijuana. She said she had to stop the car three times on the way home to calm him down. 'He's got to sit down. We've got to make a plan,' Layne told the jury. 'He's got to talk to people, his mother, his father. 'We're screaming at each other. He said, ''I'm getting out of here. They're going to put me in jail.'' ... He had to stay here. We had to resolve things here.' Layne said she shot the teen during another argument later at her home.

"By . Paul Bentley . PUBLISHED: . 17:02 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:09 EST, 2 March 2013 . Whistleblower: Bosses tried to silence Sandra Haynes Kirkbright . A whistleblower claimed last night that she was hired by an NHS hospital to fiddle its shocking death rates. As hundreds of patients died needlessly, Sandra Haynes Kirkbright says she was headhunted by hospital bosses and asked to 'fix' the figures. She claims 'every rule in the book' was broken to try to improve mortality rates – without saving lives. The data recorder says she was suspended after refusing to take part in a cover-up, and even claims she was ordered not to put her concerns in writing in case they reached the Press. The astonishing allegations – which are denied by the hospital – have emerged days after the chief executive of another NHS Trust, in Bolton, was forced aside over a possible cover-up of high death rates. Experts have warned similar incidents could be happening in hospitals across the country. The fresh allegations are yet another blow for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson, who refuses to resign despite widespread condemnation from MPs, doctors and patients since last month’s damning Mid Staffordshire report. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright was hired by the Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals NHS Trust as a ‘health coder’, an administrative role which involves recording data detailing patients’ care in hospitals. Coders do not need medical qualifications, leading critics to argue that they have disproportionate power to affect how hospitals are seen to be performing. Mrs Haynes Kirkbright, from Texas, said she was approached following concerns over the shocking number of weekend deaths, which had contributed to the Trust scoring one of the highest mortality rates in the country. Damning: Mrs Haynes Kirkbright added that patient care at Wolverhampton was as bad or worse as at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital (pictured) She said she ‘wouldn’t even send a dog’ to Royal Wolverhampton Hospital and claims patient care was as bad or . worse as at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital, where as many as 1,200 . patients died needlessly. But instead of making efforts to . improve care, bosses at the Trust were convinced that the high death . rate could be ‘fixed’ by fiddling statistics, she said. She . claimed they offered to almost double her salary to £54,000 a year to . distort mortality figures, mistakenly believing she had been doing the . same at her former employer, Stafford. ‘They wanted me to fix it. But they didn’t want me to fix it properly,’ she said. She took the job in October 2011 – but  said that when she realised what hospital bosses wanted her to do, she refused. However, she claimed others at the Trust were ‘breaking every rule in the book’. The allegations are another blow for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson (pictured) For example, recording that a patient was being treated by the palliative care team means their death, effectively, does not alter the mortality rate, because it is classed as unavoidable. She claims the Trust used any excuse to code patients’ deaths as unavoidable, even if they were never seen by palliative care doctors. The Trust angrily denies this claim – . yet between 2009 and 2011, Wolverhampton’s death rate dropped by 13 per . cent, from very worrying levels to the national average. This coincided . with the number of deaths recorded as ‘palliative care’ soaring from . 2.19 per cent to 20.3 per cent, about double the national average. The . whistleblower said the Trust also hired an independent company in 2011 . to advise coders on how to make deaths count for less on the mortality . score – yet said she made sure this was not acted on. And she also claims she accused bosses of fraud as the Trust was making money by charging the local Primary Care Trust for expensive procedures they had not done. In response, she says a senior figure warned her not to put allegations in writing because ‘the Press can get hold of it through Freedom of Information’. After four months at the Trust, Mrs Haynes Kirkbright was suspended for alleged bullying and harassment – which she denies. She says the real reason she was suspended was to silence her. She is still suspended pending a disciplinary hearing, but decided to speak out despite fearing the repercussions. The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust strenuously denied Mrs Haynes Kirkbright’s allegations. Protest: People gather calling for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson to resign . Chief executive David Loughton said . ‘every Trust in the country looked to Mid Staffs’ at the time to learn . how to reduce death rates – but denied hiring Mrs Haynes Kirkbright to . ‘fiddle’ death rates. ‘We categorically deny the allegations,’ he said. ‘The suggestion of any wrongdoing is simply not true. Improvements in the hospital’s mortality rates have been audited and . independently verified.’ The Trust admitted, however, they had been coding against national guidelines, but said they corrected this as soon as they became aware of the mistake. The Trust added that it was ‘categorically false’ to suggest palliative  care patients had been coded incorrectly to alter overall death rates. They explained the fall by saying 200 fewer patients had died.","Sandra Haynes Kirkbright hired due to concerns over high number of deaths .

They were saying 'where's your stuff' and 'give us your stuff'. One of them turned the light on and saw Sue was wearing a Rolex. 'She tried to tell them that she would give them the watch but they were trying to tear it from her wrist. I sat up and tried to grab one of them and, with his left hand but he hit me across the head with the hammer and shouted 'where's yours'. 'Blood went everywhere and the blow really knocked me back. Mr Schofield, from Greater Manchester, said: 'The incident was absolutely terrifying' 'It was very quick they took the watches and some other jewellery and then started shouting that they wanted our mobile phones. 'I told them that the phones were downstairs so they ran downstairs and then left. I saw them driving off in my Porsche.' The couple have lived together at the detached property in rural Greens Arms Road, Turton, near Bolton, Greater Manchester, for around 12 months. About 30 officers attended the incident and crime scene investigators spent all day searching the area and CCTV from local properties is being reviewed. Miss Evans said: 'It was awful, we were petrified. I could hear Mark's head smash and there was blood everywhere. He could have been killed . 'I got out of bed and kept pressing the panic button to our alarm. One of the men put the hammer on my hand and he took the Rolex off my wrist.' The gang dropped Mr Saunders' wallet and a jewellery box on the driveway as they ran for the Porsche. Lancashire Police said the burglars had arrived in a white Ford Fiesta which was later found dumped in nearby Chapeltown. It is thought the gang arrived in the stolen car and crept through a nearby field to approach the house from the rear. They then broke in to the property through French doors. Detective Sergeant Marc Saunders, said: 'This was a nasty and unprovoked attack on a couple while they were sleeping. They were lucky. 'We believe the Ford Fiesta had been stolen about 7pm the night before the burglary. We believe the vehicle had been abandoned by the thieves who left the scene in the Porsche Cayenne.' 'I appeal for anyone who saw anything suspicious in Turton in the days leading up to the burglary to come forward.'","Mark Schofield, 57, and his 58-year old partner Sue Evans were asleep .

Guillotine operator Shane Fitzpatrick the ex-husband of one of the women was later jailed for life for murdering Guilfoyle then hiding his body. But despite extensive searches of . waters and woodland across east Lancashire including a search of a . reservoir by police divers, Guilfoyle's corpse was never found. Then last year Fitzpatrick, now 43, . contacted police from Garth Prison near Leyland to reveal how he killed . Guilfoyle and was taken from his cell to pinpoint where he buried his . victim's body in woodland at Bolton-by-Bowland. He later told an officer he had .

He also said he was willing to meet . Guilfoyle's family and personally explain 'how and why he killed David', . as he wanted to help them and himself to 'come to terms with what he . had done'. Guilfoyle's body was discovered following a two day search. At an inquest in Blackburn, . Lancashire, Guilfoyle's daughter Samantha, 23, wept as a coroner paid . tribute to both her and police for never giving up hope of finding of . her father's body. The victim was said to have a . £1million fortune and owned a number of properties which were rented . out. He also travelled the world, including Egypt, Brazil and Australia . and was a championship pool player who represented England in the sport. But Guilfoyle was also described as a black market 'wheeler dealer' selling illegally-imported cigarettes, pirate DVDs and counterfeit clothing. Friends said he often kept up to £30,000 in his home and had lots of enemies. Fitzpatrick had married teaching assistant Debbie Fitzpatrick  in 1995 and the couple had three children but their marriage was stormy. The factory worker was said to have a 'possessive jealousy' towards Ms Fitzpatrick, believed she was having an affair with a work colleague and beat her leaving her with various injuries including black eyes and fractured cheekbone. Ms Fitzpatrick eventually moved out of their home in Hapton, near Burnley, Lancashire, and in November 2002, began an affair with Guilfoyle who was already dating another woman.

Ed Miliband’s hopes of becoming Prime Minister will be fatally undermined unless he makes big gains in next month’s local elections, senior Tories have warned. The Labour leader who has boasted of being a One Nation politician is challenged to make gains of at least 1,000 council seats on May 2, including proving he can win in the south of England.  A confident Tory Cabinet minister declared: ‘Bring it on.’ Almost 2,400 seats in will be contested in 35 areas, mostly council councils where Tories and Liberal Democrats will be pitted against each other in head-to-head fights which could threaten coalition harmony. The Tories swept the board in 2009, turning the electoral map almost entirely blue. Four years on they are under pressure from Labour, the Lib Dems and UK Independence Party . However, the Tories are determined to cast the vote as major test of Mr Miliband’s ability to win outside Labour’s northern comfort zone. Conservative strategists point out that in 2009 the Tories were as far ahead in the polls as Labour are now. In 2009, the Tories won 35 per cent of the vote with Labour under Gordon Brown 13 points behind on just 22 per cent, pushed into third behind the Lib Dems. Today opinion polls put Labour up to 10 points ahead of the Tories. According to Tory analysis, on a straight poll swing Labour would expected to win 1,500 seats. A senior source said: ‘They won’t get that but anything other than 1,000 Labour gains will raised big questions for Miliband. ‘He said they are the One Nation party – in which case he they have to be able to operate in the south and the south east. ‘Two years from now he is expecting to be walking into Downing Street and he cannot do that without living in the south.  These local elections are the biggest test to show he can lead a One Nation party.’ Labour hopes to build on gains made in local elections since Ed Miliband became leader, but the party has made little progress in the south of England . Mr Miliband has adopted the One Nation slogan but failed to make breakthroughs in the south of England . However, in the early skirmishes of expectation management, Labour today sought to play down the idea of making big gains. 'We think 200 seats would be a good result for us,' said a source close to Mr Miliband. Aides highlight that just nine of the 35 councils being contested on May 2 have ever been Labour controlled. And in areas where the party once . dominated it suffered catastrophic losses in 2009, including losing 28 . of 44 seats in Lancashire and 29 or 32 seats in Staffordshire. Other councils where Labour is expected to make strong gains are all in the north of England, including Derbyshire, Durham, Nothumberland and Nottinghamshire. The source added: 'We did so badly at the last election that there is a significant mountain to climb.' However, Tories are braced for hundreds of losses after gaining control of seven councils and 244 seats in 2009. Just a year before the general election which forced Mr Brown out of power, Labour lost of four councils and 291 seats. The Greens gained eight seats in net terms while the UK Independence Party made a net gain of seven seats. After . being humiliated by the UK Independence Party in the Eastleigh . by-election, the Tories will seek to portray UKIP as being allies of . Labour, warning a vote for any party other than Conservatives will lead . to council tax rises. Write caption here . Voters . will be told that backing UKIP will allow Labour to gain control of . councils and drive up bills. ‘If you want to put up your council tax, . vote UKIP or Labour,’ will be a key message. Tories admit the elections will be ‘tough’ after securing a ‘once-in-a-generation high' in 2009. UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage today began a Commons Sense tour to woo disaffected voters ahead of May's elections . The Liberal Democrats are confident of . making gains against the Tories in the south, even hoping to regain . Somerset County Council. ‘Taking them will be a bit of a stretch,’ said a senior Lib Dems source. ‘But they are not out of reach. ‘The South West is where we feel strongest in our battles against the Tories.’ Three-quarters of seats the Lib Dems are contesting are straight fights against the Conservatives. UKIP leader Nigel Farage today started a two-week Common Sense tour of market towns and cities where he hopes to make gains in the local elections. It kicked off in the South West of England, where UKIP has traditionally been strongest, taking in Callington in Cornwall, Tiverton in Devon and Taunton in Somerset. UKIP will focus on local democracy, energy policy, wind farms and planning to widen its appeal beyond its anti-Brussels message. The party currently has around 50 councillors at all levels of local government. The party is fielding record numbers of candidates, and hopes to more than double its share of the vote from the five per cent it won in 2009. A UKIP insider said: ‘I would be disappointed if we are not on 13 per cent.’","Tories say Labour must gain 1,000 seats to prove they are on the up .

A dead newborn baby girl was discovered by a dog in Oklahoma City on Saturday and the family pet carried her body home in its mouth. The dog's unnamed owner was out of town so the pet, Luke, returned the infant's body to the house-sitter at the property just off South Air Deport Road. The mixed breed was carrying the three to five pound dead baby, which had been wrapped in plastic, in his mouth and placed it by the woman's feet around 8am, KFOR reports. Scroll down for video . Gentle: Luke, a six-year-old mutt, is a gentle dog that would never have hurt the child, his owner insists . Returning home: The dog called Luke brought the plastic wrapped baby's body back to this home in Oklahoma City . Police do not believe the dog was in any way involved in the baby's death but merely stumbled across the abandoned body. 'He was carrying it just like a momma pup and laid it at my feet,' the house-sitter told the station . 'I believe [Luke] found it, picked it up and brought it. There was no trauma you could tell he inflicted.' Police are now desperately searching for the infant's mother, who they believe may be suffering from health problems following the birth. They are also examining the body to try and establish whether the baby was born alive or was a still-birth. Police Captain Dexter Nelson told the broadcaster: 'We don’t know where . the baby came from. If it was born in the area outside or if someone . brought the baby out there to dispose of it.' Luke tends to roam over a large area making things even more complicated for police. Gentle: Luke returned home carrying the baby harmlessly in its mouth 'like a mamma pup,' his caretaker said . Luke's owners are out of town and he is being cared for by a house sitter . No crime? Police Captain Dexter Nelson said medical examiners are trying to determine whether the baby was alive when she was dumped or whether she was stillborn . Oklahoma has a 'safe haven' policy which allows a mother to anonymously leave a child which is less than a week old at a designated place without fear of questioning. No one has reported a missing baby in the area or come forward with information this week. Police are now going door to door and are combing the area to try and find discarded evidence. 'We are asking anyone in the public who knows someone who was pregnant not too long ago who is not pregnant now or if they believe this child could be that child or involved in that situation to call us,' Nelson told the Oklahoman. 'We don't know if the baby was stillborn or what the cause of death was in this particular case, but that's why homicide is investigating.' 'We do not even know at this time if a crime has even occurred.' 'Due to the condition that the child was found, we believe that the mother could be at risk of health problems,' he added. The baby was described as white and her mother would have been in her third trimester.","A family dog called Luke discovered the body wrapped in plastic in Oklahoma City on Saturday morning .

A woman who broke her back in a horror sledging accident is suing a council for not fencing off the land where the crash took place. Kate Parkin careered down a snowy hill with her young son John when they both hit a drainage ditch near Silksworth Ski Slope, Sunderland in January 2010. John, then aged 11, escaped with minor injuries, but the 31-year-old mother suffered devastating injuries including crushed vertebrae and feared she would never walk again. Kate Parkin, 31, from Sunderland, who broke her back in a horror sledging accident in January 2010 when her sledge hit a drainage ditch near Silksworth Ski Slope . Ms Parkin underwent two operations in which surgeons inserted rods into her back to strengthen her spine and bone was taken from other parts of her body to repair the damaged vertebrae. She then spent two months with her upper body in plaster before she was able to have physiotherapy. Doctors later told her she could have been paralysed had the injury been centimetres higher. Following the devastating crash, she had to learn how to walk again and found herself in debt after she lost her job at a jewellery store. After talks with Sunderland City Council broke down, Kate has launched legal action to prevent other families going through the same ordeal - despite being warned it could cost £10,000 if she loses the case. She has called for the local authority to fence off the drainage ditch where she crashed. Recovery: Kate Parkin underwent two operations, spent two months in an upper body cast, and still required 28 pain killers a day. Pictured with son John, who was also on the sledge at the time of the accident . Ms Parkin, of Monkwearmouth, Sunderland, who is mother to John, now 14, has had to endure a further operation to remove rods from her spine after they started to move and needs to take up to 28 painkillers a day and still has a 4in scar on her back. She now devotes her time to volunteering as a counsellor and has passed her driving test but says the sledging accident changed her life. Ms Parkin said: 'If there had been a fence around it or a danger sign I would not have taken my son there. I thought it was safe but it obviously was not.' Despite still being in constant pain, Ms Parkin said she has tried to stay positive throughout her ordeal. She added: 'I got depression and anxiety, which I've never had before, because I went from being a really active parent to not being able to do anything. 'I felt like I had let my son down for two years. I will never be able to run or jump again, or carry anything heavy, but I've been trying to rebuild my life.' Now the family are building their case up and have appealed for other people who have been injured near to the ski slope to come forward. Mr Parkin, who works with young offenders, said: 'We heard a 33-year-old man had an accident there on January 20 this year and we would like him to get in touch.' Sunderland City Council said it would be inappropriate to comment while legal proceedings were active.","Kate Parkin careered down a snowy hill with her young son John .

Resolution: President Barack Obama has signed a new law restricting U.S. government agencies from buying computer technology made in China . President Obama has hit back at Beijing's alleged hacking campaign against U.S. businesses by banning government from buying Chinese computer technology. The new rule, which was buried in a spending bill signed this week, comes after a string of hacks traced back to China hit some of America's most important companies. It will only be in effect until the end of the fiscal year on September 30, but could yet pave the way for broader, more permanent changes in how the U.S. government buys technology. 'This is a change of direction,' said Stewart Baker, a former senior official at the Homeland Security Department who now works for the legal firm Steptoe and Johnson in Washington. 'My guess is we're going to keep going in this direction for a while.' U.S. computer security firm Mandiant in March released details on what it said was an aggressive hacking campaign on American businesses by a Chinese military unit. Since then, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has used high-level meetings with Beijing officials to press the matter. Beijing has denied the allegations. Lawmakers tucked the provision into the latest budget resolution, which enables the government to pay for day-to day operations for the rest of the fiscal year, under the innocuous heading 'section 156'. It bans the Commerce and Justice departments, NASA and the National Science Foundation from buying hardware 'produced, manufactured or assembled' by any entity 'owned, operated or subsidised' by the People's Republic of China. The agencies can only acquire the technology if, after consulting with the FBI, they determine that there is no risk of 'cyberespionage or sabotage associated with the acquisition of the system'. 'Source of attacks': Unit 61398 is located in Shanghai's Pudong district and is staffed by perhaps thousands of people proficient in English as well as computer programming and network operations, the report said . Ground zero: The building, used by the People's Liberation Army, is located on the outskirts of Shanghai . Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he supports the restriction and doesn't think it would be too cumbersome for federal agencies. The Defense and Energy departments already are mindful of how its networks are built. A secretive Chinese military unit is believed to be behind a series of hacking attacks on the U.S. government as well as aerospace, communications and energy companies, a report claimed last month. U.S. security firm Mandiant identified the People's Liberation Army's Shanghai-based Unit 61398 as the most likely driving force behind hundreds, if not thousands of cyber attacks. It said says an office block housing the unit is linked to stolen technology blueprints, manufacturing processes, clinical trial results, pricing documents, negotiation strategies and other secret data from more than 100 companies. More alarmingly, it claims the unit, known online as the Comment Crew, has also made incursions into the computer networks that control oil pipelines, power grids, water plants and other pieces of key state infrastructure. 'The nature of Unit 61398's work is considered by China to be a state secret,' Mandiant said in a report released at the end of February. 'However, we believe it engages in harmful ""Computer Network Operations"". 'It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that threat effectively,' it said. The Chinese Foreign Ministry dismissed the report as 'groundless' and said the government firmly opposed hacking. 'Hacking attacks are transnational and anonymous. Determining their origins are extremely difficult. We don't know how the evidence in this so-called report can be tenable,' said spokesman Hong Lei. 'Arbitrary criticism based on rudimentary data is irresponsible, unprofessional and not helpful in resolving the issue.' 'Anything we can do to call awareness to the fact that we're continuing to be cyberattacked, we're continuing to lose jobs, and that billions of dollars in American money is being stolen,' Mr Ruppersberger said yesterday. He and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Republican, released a report late last year urging U.S. companies and government agencies to drop any business with Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei Technologies and ZTE because of the security risks they pose. 'Any bug, beacon or backdoor put into our critical systems could allow for a catastrophic and devastating domino effect of failures throughout our networks,' Mr Rogers said in a statement accompanying the report. But a blanket prohibition on technology linked to the Chinese government may be easier said than done. Information systems are often a complicated assembly of parts manufactured by different companies around the globe. And investigating where each part came from, and if that part is made by a company that could have ties to the Chinese government could be difficult. Huawei, the world's third-largest maker of smartphones, says it is owned by its employees and rejects claims that it is controlled by the communist government or China's military. Depending on how the Obama administration interprets the law, Baker said it also could cause problems for the U.S. with the World Trade Organisation. The WTO's members include U.S. allies like Germany and Britain that might rely on Chinese technology to build computers or handsets. But in the end, Baker says it could make the U.S. government safer and wiser. 'We do have to worry about buying equipment from companies that may not have our best interests at heart,' he said.","New rule bans agencies including Nasa from buying Chinese computers .

His impromptu walkabouts and trips on the bus have already garnered him a reputation as the People's Pontiff. Now Pope Francis has bolstered his humble reputation by shunning the Vatican City's papal apartment preferred by his predecessors for a simple suite at a hotel-style building. The grand apartment on top of the Apostolic Palace, featuring more than 12 rooms and a terrace, is ready for the newly-elected head of the Catholic Church to move in to. Staying put: Pope Francis is still living in a two-room apartment in the Vatican City's Domus Santa Martha building even though the top-floor apartment in the Apostolic Palace is ready for him to move in to . Simple: The bedroom of Pope Francis current, and preferred, residence at the Domus Sanctae Martae building . But Francis has shown no desire to move in, preferring the 130-room Domus Santa Martha building, where he stayed during the conclave that elected him on March 13. His initial tenure at the residence had been in a miniscule single room but he recently upgraded to a more spacious suite to work and host visitors. Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said the pope had given no indication of when he would move out of the two-bedroom residence. Mr Lombardi did not however say that Francis is using rooms at his palace apartment to conduct meetings and audiences. Luxury: Pope Francis in the top-floor apartment at the Apostolic Palace where he is holding business meetings but has refused to move in . Francis, who is the first South American and Jesuit pontiff, has already signalled a move towards a less formal papacy. The decision to eschew the more glamorous property is in keeping with his desire for the religion to become a 'poor church, for the poor' and to prioritise disadvantaged groups. It also follows from his time as the Archbishop of Buenos Aires, when he opted for a simple apartment over the official archbishop's palace - also wearing old shoes and using the bus as a chosen form of transport. Francis has set a more austere tone for . the papacy than his predecessor Benedict XVI, who gained a reputation . for sumptuous costumes. Mr Lombardi says the new pope enjoys his current residence's community atmosphere where he lives alongside other clergy. The pope says mass in its chapel every morning and invites Vatican workers and other guests to attend. 'I can't make long-term predictions, . but for now it seems he is experimenting with this type of simple . co-habitation,' Lombardi said. 'It is still a period of getting used . to things, of experimentation. Certainly in this phase he has expressed . the desire to stay where he is,' he said. Lombardi said the pope will be using . the offices in the Apostolic Palace and its grand, frescoed reception . rooms to meet heads of state and delegations, and will continue to . appear each Sunday to deliver a blessing from the window of the papal . apartments overlooking St. Peter's Square.

A child witness, whose evidence saw a man locked away for 23 years for the murder of a New York rabbi he didn't commit, has spoken of how police told him to identify the wrongly accused man. Menachem Lieberman was 13 when he was shown a line-up of suspects accused of the murder of Rabbi Chaskel Werzberger in a diamond robbery that went wrong. His decision to reverse his statement saw wrongly convicted David Ranta released from a maximum security jail yesterday after 23 years behind bars. Scroll down for video . ID parade: This is the line-up which led to David Ranta's life imprisonment. Menachem Lieberman last night told how police led him as a 13-year-old witness and told him to wrongly select Ranta . Guilt: Menachem Lieberman said he was haunted by guilt as Ranta remained behind bars for 23 years. He decided to speak out in 2011 and Ranta was freed yesterday . Now living in Montreal, the 36-year-old last night spoke of how police told him to select Ranta saying he should 'choose the one with the big nose'. In an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN Lieberman said: 'As I was walking into the room to the line-up, they told me I should pick the guy with the biggest nose. I was too young back then to realize that this was a set-up. I never saw a line up before - I thought it was part of the process'. Unemployed drug addict Ranta was sentenced to 37-and-a-half-years in prison after being found guilty of the killing of Rabbi . Chaskel in Williamsburg on February 8, 1990. That day a man attempted to rob a diamond courier and when it went wrong hijacked Rabbi Chaskel's car - shooting him in the forehead and leaving him for dead. The murder rattled the Hasidic Jewish community in Brooklyn . and prompted calls for swift justice for the perpetrator.

Long walk to freedom: David Ranta leaves Brooklyn Supreme court in New York on Thursday after being set free . New life: David Ranta, (center),was cleared by Lieberman's revelations and other evidence that his conviction was unsafe . Then just a schoolboy, Lieberman was . one of the witnesses to the man's escape and his positive ID of Ranta . saw him get locked away in 1991. Over the years he realized that his selection had been influenced and . in 2011 - 20 years on - he decided he had to share those suspicions. 'As . years went by, I remembered someone had told me,' he told Cooper. 'The . more and more I saw on the news innocent people getting let free - I . started to think back to the trial I was involved in,' he explained. 'I . didn't tell anyone in the world but as I grew older and saw more and . more of these wrongful convictions it really bothered me. Two years ago I . decided I had to get it off my chest. 'An innocent man was in jail and is now set free - . the sad part is the killer never met justice. I feel I was set up as a . kid and I just wanted to do my part for justice.' Smiling: David Ranta was overjoyed on being freed after a reinvestigation of his case cast serious doubt on evidence used to convict him in the cold-blooded shooting of a Brooklyn rabbi in 1990 . Murdered: Rabbi Chaskel Werzberger, (center right), attends a wedding in the Williamsburg section of the Brooklyn borough of New York . The detective in the case Louis Scarcella still denies any wrongdoing and says there were no attempts to frame Ranta. However, other problems were discovered when the Conviction Integrity Unit looked into the case. Paperwork was found to be missing and other leads didn't seem to be investigated. One . key suspect was cocaine addict Joseph Astin. His wife testified in 1996 . he had admitted the murder to her on the day but he died two months . later. In all, this convinced the court it was time to release 58-year-old Ranta, a father-of-three. 'Sir, you are free to go,' state Supreme Court Justice Miriam Cyrulnik told Ranta at a Brooklyn courthouse yesterday. Relatives, including his youngest daughter who was an infant when he was jailed, erupted in tears and shouts of joy. Prosecutors had joined Ranta's . defense attorney, Pierre Sussman, in asking Cyrulnik to vacate Ranta's . conviction 'in the interest of justice.' Courtroom: David Ranta heard the decision to release him in court as his family wept with joy . 'The . evidence no longer establishes the defendant's guilt beyond a . reasonable doubt,' said Assistant District Attorney John O'Mara, the . chief of the conviction integrity unit. He left the court carrying the belongings he had kept in his prison cell. Asked by reporters outside what he would do, Ranta said, 'Get the hell out of here.' 'I'm overwhelmed. I feel like I'm under water, swimming. As I said from the beginning, I had nothing to do with this case.' His family were overcome with joy. 'I just want to get him in my hands and I'll be happy,' said his son, David Ranta Jr., 36, to the New York Post. Grief: Thousands carried the coffin bearing the remains of much-loved rabbi Chaskel Werzberger . Rabbi Chaskel was a much-loved member of his Brooklyn community. Thousands of people attended his . funeral, and the then Mayor David Dinkins offered a $10,000 reward for . any information that led to an arrest. When Ranta was arrested the police car carrying him to jail was surrounded with people chanting, 'Death penalty!'. Despite . the prosecution and the defense agreeing that conviction was not safe relatives of Werzberger were shocked that Ranta was released. 'For this to happen 23 years later is mind-boggling,' said Isaac Abraham to Fox News.

Cristina Kirchner attempted to inflame relations with the UK once again by claiming that a three-year-old child would find Britain's ownership of the islands 'unsustainable' Argentine president Cristina Kirchner has attempted to inflame relations with the UK once again by claiming that a three-year-old child would find Britain's ownership of the Falklands 'unsustainable'. The 60-year-old took to Twitter to launch her latest attack in a bid to reclaim the South Atlantic islands. In a provocative post, Mrs Kirchner wrote: ‘An English territory more than 12,000 kilometres away? The question is unsustainable, even for three-year old children.' She also claimed that 'the world' is encouraging talks between the two nations regarding the future of the islands. The outspoken politician wrote: 'The UN, the Decolonisation Committee...the world...are demanding dialogue, ALL TOGETHER.' Mrs Kirchner also claimed that Latin America supported Argentina’s claims to the Falklands ‘without reservations’. Tensions between the Argentine and British governments grew last year as the 30th anniversary of the war for control of the South Atlantic islands approached. In a recent referendum, all but three of the 1,517 islanders who voted said they wanted to remain an ‘overseas territory of the United Kingdom’. But in another confrontational outburst, Mrs Kirchner refused to accept the referendum results and  suggested that the islanders' were akin to squatters seeking to remain in a building. She claimed: ‘It’s like a consortium of squatters voting on whether they’re going to continue illegally occupying a building or not. The result was a foregone conclusion.’ A Latin American delegation led by . Argentine Foreign Minister Hector Timerman met UN Secretary-General Ban . Ki-moon in New York earlier this week, demanding talks with Britain on . the sovereignty of the Falklands. Meeting: Mrs Kirchner meeting newly elected Argentine Pope Francis, who she suggested should intervene to encourage dialogue between Argentina and Britain . The referendum results were passed to the UN in New York last week, with Britain’s UN ambassador Mark Lyall Grant saying it is ‘untenable’ for Argentina to reject the islanders 99.8% vote. No talks: David Cameron has refused to engage in dialogue with Argentina over the islands' future . Mike Summers, a member of the Falkland Islands Assembly, said: 'The referendum result makes it clear that we have no desire to be governed by Argentina. 'Continued harassment of our economic development and intimidation of those who want to do business with us and invest in the Islands will not change this fact.' ‘The more Argentina presses our small community, the harder will be our resolve.' In spite of the islanders' decision and David Cameron's reluctance to engage with the Argentine Government, Kirchner has continued to seek discussions. Many believe that potential for offshore drilling rights is a key factor in the renewed political tussling regarding the islands. Kirchner has even sought to involve the newly-elected Pope Francis. In an address following the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires's election, she said: '(We hope) that (his mission) takes the message to the major powers in the world to participate in dialogue... that the great powers in the world, who have arms and financial power, can be convinced to finally heed the emerging countries and that they commit to a dialogue of civilisations where things are resolved by diplomatic channels rather than by force.'","She claimed that a child would find British ownership 'unsustainable'

"By . Mario Ledwith . PUBLISHED: . 15:26 EST, 8 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:36 EST, 9 March 2013 . Training: Army ranger Michael Maguire, 21, was hit by a stray bullet while standing in a designated safe zone during a training exercise at Castlemartin Ranges in West Wales . A popular tourist beach may have been sprayed with bullets during a botched army training exercise in which a soldier was shot dead. Machine gun fire was directed towards Freshwater West beach in West Wales, located outside a seaside resort. Michael 'Mike' Maguire, 21, was hit in the temple by a single bullet last May while standing in a designated zone at Castlemartin training ranges where the Army trains recruits. The beach, which is well known to surfers, is . situated less than one and a half miles (2.4km) away from from the area. An inquest into the Army ranger's death heard evidence today . suggesting that civilians who may have been relaxing there could also have been hit. Soldiers at the shooting ranges are . put through highly realistic exercises designed to be as close to battle . conditions as possible. Rifles, machine guns and hand . grenades are used in what are supposed to be . strictly controlled conditions. Ranger Maguire, originally from County Cork, Ireland, who was a member of the 1st Battalion, was hit by a bullet thought to have been fired from 0.6 miles (1km) away. He was standing in a safe zone beyond where live fire training was taking place having just finished an exercise himself. An inquest jury in Cardiff has previously been to the sprawling series of shooting ranges to see where the tragedy happened. They have heard that soldiers shoot out to sea and within specific map co-ordinates that restrict firing to a narrow channel. Evidence suggests a fellow soldier firing a machine gun at a designated target placed on the range hit ranger Maguire. Popular: An inquest into the ranger's death heard that machine gun fire could have been directed towards Freshwater West beach in West Wales . Captain Gary Palmer, an Army weapons expert, investigated the tragedy in parallel with the police to ensure later recruits were trained safely. He said that soldiers under the command of Lieutenant Jonathan Price had shot outside the safe areas specified, in particular an area designed to ensure bullets were no danger to other soldiers. Ranger Maguire, relaxing 0.6 miles (1km) away without his protective helmet and armour, fell within the range, while other soldiers on similar live fire exercises were also likely to have been unwittingly shot at. Freshwater Beach was also within the same potentially deadly area, with Captain Palmer saying the 'full weapon danger area' for the machine gun was 1.8 miles (2.9km). Vale of Glamorgan Coroner Mary Hassall said: 'It is about 2.5 kilometres to the beach from Tenby, therefore by pointing north west the general purpose machine gun (GPMG) was within the full weapon danger area. 'That means a bullet could go from the gun to Freshwater beach.' Nearby: The beach, which is described as a surfer's paradise, is situated less than one and a half miles (2.4km) away from from the training area . Capt Palmer replied: 'Yes. If it had clear line of sight without hitting anything on the way. Very plainly within the full weapon danger area of the range.' Miss Hassall asked Captain Palmer: 'But how could someone get this so wrong?' He said that he had never investigated . such an error and could not explain it, adding: 'The assumption here . must be purely disorientation.' The Visit Pembrokeshire website describes the beach, which has featured in a number of films, as 'a surfers’ paradise'. The inquest has previously heard that the officer in charge on the day of the death had been recommended for supervision. Lieutenant Price had passed a training course allowing him to plan and carry out live fire strategic training exercises. Examiners on the course, completed nine months before Ranger Maguire’s death, advised he should receive 'increased levels of supervision'. In evidence earlier this week Lt Price, the range conducting officer (RCO), dismissed a suggestion he failed to take on the responsibilities of a RCO. He insisted that he had carried out his duties safely and had understood what he was doing. He claimed to be unaware of the supervision advice. Officers either pass or fail a course. He had been passed, the inquest heard. The inquest, which is scheduled to run for up to three weeks, continues.","Michael Maguire hit in the temple during exercise at Castlemartin ranges .

Accusations: Anastasia Volochkova, 37, claimed that female dancers were forced to have sex with wealthy men or face losing their jobs at the theatre . Its standing as one of the world's most famous theatres has been overshadowed by the recent acid attack on its artistic director amid stories of vicious infighting. But Russia's Bolshoi Ballet has suffered another blow to its reputation, as a former prima ballerina claimed that its director general had turned it into a 'giant brothel'. Anastasia Volochkova claimed that female dancers were forced to have sex with wealthy men or face losing their jobs at the theatre. Miss Volochkova, 37, who was fired from the Moscow theatre for being 'too fat', said: 'Unfortunately, the Bolshoi general director has turned the Bolshoi theatre into a giant brothel. 'It mainly happened with the corps du ballet but also with the soloists,' she claimed in a talkshow on Sunday, later repeating the claims in a radio interview . She added: 'Ten years ago when I was dancing at the . theatre, I repeatedly received propositions to share the beds of . oligarchs. 'The girls were forced to go along to grand dinners and given . advance warning that afterwards they would be expected to have sex. 'When . the girls asked: 'What happens if we refuse?', they were told that they . would not go on tour or even perform at the Bolshoi theatre. Can you . imagine?' The 236-year-old theatre's general director Anatoly Iksanov rubbished the allegations, describing the claims as 'dirt and ravings'. Miss Volochkova won a legal case against the Bolshoi after being fired in 2003, having become a prima ballerina in 1998. After her dancing career came to an end, she became a prominent  television personality and even tried entering the world of politics. Scroll down for video . Claims: Miss Volochkova who was sacked from the Moscow theatre in 2003 said ballerinas were forced to sleep with oligarchs in a television interview . The former star's claims will add to growing tensions within the theatre, following an attack on artistic director Sergei Filin in January. Mr Filin was left with third degree burns and was nearly blinded when acid was thrown on his face outside his home by a masked man. Top Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko has been charged with masterminding the acid attack. He has admitted in court that he ordered a physical attack on Mr Filin but denies that he had any involvement in the acid attack. Sacked: The dancer, who was made prima ballerina in 1998, was sacked in 2003 for being 'too fat' and later won a  lawsuit against the company . Attacked: Sergei Filin dries his eyes during the press conference at the university hospital in Aachen, Germany, as he speaks about his determination to return to the Bolshoi when his sight returns . An alleged accomplice, Yuri Zarutsky, is accused of accepting 50,000 roubles, around £1,080, from Dmitrichenko to attack Mr Filin. But a group of hundreds of dancers from the theatre has suggested that lead soloist Mr Dmitrichenko was set up in an open letter to President Vladimir Putin, in which they also protest his innocence. The saga has gripped the Russian public with a constant stream of revelations and accusations by those involved or linked to the incident. It recently emerged that Mr Filin was displaced as Mr Dmitrichenkoas as the company's trade union head. At a press conference last week, Mr Filin said he would return to work as soon as he had recovered, despite suggestions from some that the attack had been organised by a more senior member of the theatre.

A grandfather drowned as he battled to save his five-year-old granddaughter after she was swept out to sea by a freak wave, an inquest heard today. Lara Lewis was collecting seashells when she ran towards the water and the huge wave dragged her into rough waters on a Portuguese beach. Her grandfather Brian O'Dwyer, 66, and his wife Jill tried to save their granddaughter but Mr O'Dwyer drowned. Bravery: Brian O'Dwyer, 66, died while trying to save his five-year-old granddaughter Lara Lewis when she was swept out to sea at Praia do Salgados beach, in western Portugal . Risk: An inquest heard that Lara unexpectedly ran towards the water on the beach where red warning flags had been flying . Mrs O'Dwyer, who was forced back by the huge waves, could only watch on with her four-year-old grandson as the tragedy unfolded. In a statement to North London Coroner's Court, Mrs O'Dwyer described the incident as she frantically waved for help before fainting. Mrs O'Dwyer, who lived in Portugal with her husband, said: 'At a certain stage, my granddaughter ran towards the water. The sea was rough and my granddaughter was taken by the water.' Sudden: An inquest at North London Coroner's Court heard that Lara, pictured with her mother Sian, 36, suddenly ran towards the water on the beach where red warning flags were flying . The pair had been walking with their grandchildren on Praia do Salgado beach, in western Portugal, while the children's parents, Philip Lewis, 46 and his wife Sian, 36, were sunbathing on a beach nearby. Mrs O'Dwyer added: 'My husband attempted to rescue her but was unable to and as a result got into difficulties himself. 'I tried to enter the water but was forced back by a wave. I looked around for help and waved frantically but I don't remember anything after that as I must have fainted.' Fisherman Antonio Ribelo raised the . alarm after finding Lara's brother wandering along the beach . crying and calling out for his parents. While trying to locate the boy's parents, Mr Ribelo noticed Mrs O'Dwyer where she had collapsed on the shore. Recalling the ordeal on August 21 last year, Mr Ribelo said: 'I noticed a little boy crying for his mother, so I asked him where his mother was. I took the boy towards the south to see if we could see anyone.' After noticing Mrs O'Dwyer lying on the sand he ran towards the scene before noticing a 'body floating in the sea'. He added: 'Then I saw another body, which looked like that of a child, where the waves were breaking.' Mr Ribelo rushed to pull Lara from the sea and a fellow fisherman dragged Mr O'Dwyer on to the sand. Holiday: The children had been holidaying in Portugal with their parents who were sunbathing elsewhere at Salgado beach when the tragedy unfolded . Accident: Coroner Andrew Walker recorded that both Mr O'Dwyer and Lara died as a result of an accident . He said Mr O'Dwyer, who was described in court as a a chief executive for agriculture, showed no signs of life and he focused his revival efforts on the girl until paramedics arrived. The inquest heard red flags had been flying on the beach on the day of the incident. The O'Dwyers and their grandchildren were around 400 metres outside the cordoned off safe swimming area when Lara ran towards the sea unexpectedly. 'We found the bodies on the beach which had been retrieved from the sea with no signs of life', said Portuguese investigator Manuel Jorge Mesquita da Fonseca. 'Even those resuscitating using advanced life support techniques for 45 minutes got no response.' Mrs O'Dwyer, who was treated for shock, initially believed her grandson had also been swept into the sea when she collapsed and fainted. Mr Lewis, a professor at University College London, and his wife who were holidaying on the Portuguese coast with the O'Dwyer's, had to identify the bodies. Lara, who turned five a month before her death, had recently started at Rushmore Primary School, near the family's home in Clapton, east London. Coroner Andrew Walker recorded that both Mr O'Dwyer and Lara died as a result of an accident. 'A short time after 13.30 hours, Brian Gillespie O'Dwyer went into the sea to rescue his granddaughter who had run into the sea, where he drowned', he said. 'Lara Lewis was drowned having run into the sea, and I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that she died as a result of an accident.' He added: 'Members of the family know about the inquest but have set out that they didn't wish to attend.'","Brian O'Dwyer, 66, battled to save Lara Lewis but was overcome by waves .

War Horse author  Michael Morpurgo has criticised plans to build a wind turbine on the land that inspired his celebrated novel. The writer said that building a 145ft (44.5m) turbine would 'despoil' his home village of Iddesleigh, Devon, of its tranquility. The rural community was the setting for Morpurgo's book that spawned a stage play and, subsequently, a Hollywood blockbuster directed by Steven Spielberg. Objection: Michael Morpurgo, 69, criticsed plans to erect a a 145ft (44.5m) turbine near the village of Iddesleigh, Devon . Plans have been submitted to West Devon Borough Council to install a £600,000 wind turbine at a farm near the village hall. The 225 kilowatt turbine will tower over the Tarka Trail, nearby the hall that sets the scene for the story of a young farm boy and his horse Joey. Mr Morpurgo, 69, has described the area as an 'oasis of peace and wonder, a paradise', which is 'still far from the madding crowd'. But the writer said the construction of a turbine would 'cast a shadow' over the village. Scenic: The 225 kilowatt turbine will tower over the Tarka Trail, nearby the hall that sets the scene for the story of a young farm boy and his horse Joey . Hit: Morpurgo's book spawned a stage play and, subsequently, a Hollywood blockbuster directed by Steven Spielberg (pictured) In a letter to the council, he wrote: 'As a result of the recent film and play based upon my book, War Horse, many more people are discovering the unique character of this corner of England, the farming country where Joey grew up before he was taken off as so many farm horses were to the First Word War. 'However, the proposed wind turbine threatens to despoil the entire area - it will be intrusive to eye and ear, it will disturb the tranquillity and cast a shadow over all who come here, city child or visitor, and over those of us who live here and love this place.' The turbine, which could be constructed at Coombe Farm, has already attracted dozens of objections. The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) claims Torridge now has more wind turbines than anywhere else in the county. Criticism: The writer said the construction of a turbine would 'cast a shadow' over the village . Penny Mills, chairman of the CPRE in Torridge, said turbines are 'a great investment but at a high cost to the countryside'. She said: 'A large, noisy industrial machine such as this is completely inappropriate, the impact would be enormous and it is so unnecessary. 'Our wonderful countryside and landscape is very valuable and we need to protect it for future generations to enjoy.' English Heritage has also complained of a lack of suitable environmental consideration under the development's consultation consultation, which ended last Friday. A spokesman for the council said: 'We are asking the applicant to provide an historic environmental impact assessment as English Heritage has told us that there is not enough information to make an informed assessment.'","Michael Morpurgo, 69, criticised planned turbine in Iddesleigh, Devon .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 06:38 EST, 2 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:28 EST, 2 April 2013 . Pope Francis has made an emotional pilgrimage into the ancient necropolis beneath the Vatican to visit the tomb of St Peter. The 76-year-old is the first pontiff to tour the site, where pagans and early Christians were buried, since extensive archaeological excavations in 1965. The 45-minute 'visit of devotion to the tomb of St Peter' was private, the Vatican said, but it later released photographs and a video showing Francis walking through the streets of the city of the dead. The basilica was built over the location where early Christians would gather in secret, at a time of persecution in ancient Rome, to pray at an unmarked tomb believed to be that of Peter, the apostle Jesus chose to lead his church. Going underground: Pope Francis in the necropolis beneath the Vatican where he visited the tomb of St Peter . Prayer: The Pope kneels before an altar in the main basilica after he concluded his visit to the necropolis . The Vatican first said Francis would pray at Peter's tomb, but later said he prayed instead in the basilica. The new pope 'paused in silent prayer, in profound and emotional meditation' in the Clementine Chapel in the vast basilica that is 'the closest place (in the basilica) to the tomb of the Prince of the Apostles,' it said. During a tour of the necropolis conducted by its director and an Italian cardinal, the pope 'climbed up a bit, got closer to the place where the tomb of St. Peter lies, exactly under the central altar and the dome of the basilica,' the Vatican said. Francis walked down the entire main street of the ancient city of the dead, the statement said. The streets of the necropolis are similar to those of ancient Rome, only they are flanked by tombs instead of shops and apartments. The Vatican said Francis walked to the necropolis entrance from the hotel on the Vatican grounds where he lives, took the tour and later - after paying homage at the tombs of several popes in another underground level known as the grottoes, including Pius XII, Paul VI and John Paul I - strolled back to his residence. The underground excursion was a sharp . departure from how popes in past years often spent the day after Easter, . known in Italy as 'little Easter.' Those pontiffs would head to Castel . Gandolfo, the Vatican palace in the Alban Hills, a short drive from . Rome. But that oasis of . sprawling gardens and strolling paths in the quaint hill town is . occupied by the predecessor of Francis, Benedict XVI, who spent the last . hours of his papacy there before becoming the first pope in 600 years . to retire. Benedict is staying in Castel Gandolfo until a monastery at . the Vatican in Rome can be readied for him. Unusual: The site was excavated in 1965 but no Pope since then has visited the tombs. The Vatican said that the pilgrimage was private and 'a visit of devotion' City of the dead: The necropolis resembles ancient Rome but instead of shops and houses, the streets are lined by tombs . Many Italians spend 'little Easter' by having a picnic lunch in the countryside or in city parks, and Francis told Romans and tourists who gathered in St. Peter's Square at noon Monday to see him to 'have a good lunch.' Francis said he was praying that Easter would inspire the faithful so that 'hatred gives way to love, lies to truth,' and that it would especially comfort those in 'most need of trust and hope.' He spoke to them from the studio window of the apartment in the Apostolic Palace overlooking the square. Benedict and popes before him lived there, but so far Francis, who stresses simplicity, has declined to move into the quarters. Instead, he has continued to stay at the Vatican hotel, where, as Buenos Aires archbishop, he stayed with fellow cardinals to elect Benedict's successor. They chose him, Jorge Bergoglio, the first pontiff from South America. St Peter's mission was to continue to preach the message of Jesus and reach more souls. Francis, as a Jesuit, is steeped in the evangelising mission of the church, and the necropolis tour brings him back to the origins of the church in its simplest years as a community of Christians professing their faith in defiance of the crackdown by Roman emperors. Peter himself was among the Christian martyrs during Nero's reign. He is believed to have been crucified, head down, on the Vatican hill. Easter blessing: Francis addresses the crowds in St Peter's Square on Sunday. He is spending the week in Rome . Popular: The new pontiff has drawn huge crowds every time he has appeared in public since taking up the post last month . Constantine, the first Christian emperor, had an early basilica built on the slopes of the Vatican Hill, burying the pagan and Christian cemetery - necropolis means `city of the dead' - that surrounded Peter's burial site. The current basilica, named after St. Peter, was constructed over the earlier basilica that was deemed unsafe and demolished in the late 15th century. The Baroque master architect Bernini designed the bronze canopy over the central altar over the spot of Peter's burial site. The current basilica was planned as an awe-inspiring monument that would project the image of a powerful church. Under popes of the last century, extensive excavations were carried out of the sprawling necropolis. In 1965, archaeologists said they had found the bones of Peter in an area near an ancient Greek inscription saying 'Peter is here.' Part of a nearby necropolis came to light in 2003 during construction of a parking lot. A few years ago, the Vatican unveiled the largest and most luxurious of the pagan tombs under St Peter's Basilica - that of a family of former slaves. Guided tours of the necropolis, upon appointment, have been one of the most sought-after attractions for tourists to the Vatican.","First pontiff to visit the necropolis since excavations in 1965 .

NBC has not confirmed anything regarding a Tonight Show transition - Leno's contract expires next year and it is known that Fallon, 38, is a favorite of the network, where he presents 'Late Night'. NBC officially denies the claim, although sources told The Hollywood Reporter earlier this month that the network is looking to announce his departure in May. That would make the next season of the show his last. Last Wednesday, The New York Times reported that the change-around was being planned for next year and ever since Leno has been on the offensive.

A suspended Roman Catholic priest accused of making more than $300,000 in methamphetamine sales out of his Connecticut apartment while running an adult video and sex toy shop pleaded guilty Tuesday to a federal drug charge. Kevin Wallin, 61, of Waterbury, admitted to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine and was scheduled to be sentenced June 25. Both sides agreed on a sentence of 11 to 14 years in prison. Prosecutors said the 61-year-old Wallin had meth mailed to him from co-conspirators in California and sold the drugs out of his Waterbury apartment last year. Concerns: Former colleagues of Monsignor Kevin Wallin have said he was struggling with his faith before his fall from grace . He also bought an adult video and sex . toy shop in North Haven named Land of Oz & Dorothy's Place, . apparently to launder the drug money, authorities said. Wearing a beige prison jumpsuit and . sporting a goatee and close-cropped hair, Wallin acknowledged in court . that the drug operation involved nearly four pounds of methamphetamine. He said 'yes' several times as the judge asked whether he understood the consequences of his plea. Wallin, former pastor at St. Augustine . Parish in Bridgeport, appeared to have no supporters in the courtroom. He was led out of the room in handcuffs and remains detained. Charges against four other people arrested in the case are pending. 'We're glad to have resolved this part . of the case,' Connecticut U.S. Attorney David B. Fein said outside the . courtroom. 'It's a serious conspiracy charge involving a very dangerous . drug.' Trusted: Msgr Wallin served as the pastor at St. Augustine's in Bridgeport for nine years before taking a sabbatical in 2011 for health and personal reasons . Wallin's public defender, Kelly Barrett, declined to comment. Dubbed in some media as 'Monsignor . Meth,' Wallin was pastor of St. Augustine Parish for nine years until he . resigned in June 2011, citing health and personal reasons. He previously served six years as pastor of St. Peter's Church in Danbury until 2002. Arrested: Wallin was last month charged with dealing crystal meth . 'Monsignor Wallin's guilty plea . represents an important step in his coming to terms with his own actions . and their impact on others,' the Diocese of Bridgeport said in a . statement. 'It is a difficult moment for all of . us but we hope it is also the first step in rebuilding his life. We pray . that he moves toward healing and wholeness.' The diocese had suspended him from . public ministry last May amid concerns by church officials about a . number of problems with Wallin, including sexually inappropriate . behavior with other men in the church rectory, Wallace said. Church leaders weren't aware of . Wallin's involvement with drugs at the time of the suspension, diocese . spokesman Brian D. Wallace said. Wallace said Wallin now faces the prospect of removal from the priesthood by the Vatican, a process called laicization. Wallin was arrested in January, and a grand jury indicted him and four other people on drug charges. An undercover officer bought meth from . Wallin six times from September 20 to January 2, paying more than . $3,400 in total for 23 grams of the drug, authorities said. Federal agents said they learned through wiretaps and informants about other sales Wallin was making. Wallin allegedly bought the Land of OZ sex shop to launder his drug money . On social media, people couldn't help . but compare Wallin with Walter White, the main character on the TV show .

The ex-convict suspected in the killing of Colorado's prison chief who was mistakenly released from prison four years early slipped off his electronic monitoring bracelet, but parole officials didn't realize he had fled until just hours before the slaying. A corrections computer system recorded that Evan Spencer Ebel's bracelet stopped working on March 14, according to documents released on Tuesday. Officers learned he had fled on March 19, the day Colorado prison chief Tom Clements was fatally shot as he answered the front door at his home. The detail is the latest example of how Ebel fell through the cracks of the criminal justice system in the years before his January release. On Monday, court officials acknowledged that a clerical error allowed Ebel to leave prison four years early because his most recent felony conviction was incorrectly recorded on his record. Victim: Nathan Leon, left, was shot by Evan Spencer Ebel, a convict that was accidentally released early from prison and now Leon's widow Katherine (right) is speaking out for the first time . Heartbroken: Mrs Leon said that she doesn't know what to tell her twin daughters who lost their father because of a 'clerical error' that let a felon go free far too early . Happier days: Katherine and Nathan Leon, seen here on their wedding day, have twin girls who are 4-years-old . Police believe that Evan Spencer Ebel . killed Domino's Pizza delivery man Nathan Leon in Denver just days . before he killed Colorado prison chief Tom Clements. The widow of the pizza delivery man who . was killed by a ex-convict who was accidentally released early from . prison four years early is furious with authorities for dismissing his . death as a 'clerical error.' Leon's widow said that the impersonal . apology from the state- that Leon's family only heard about through the . media - wouldn't cut it for the death of her husband and the father of . her twin girls. Worrying: Officials said that Evan Spencer Ebel, pictured, was released from jail in January four years early . 'It ain't going to bring Tom Clements . back. It's not going to bring my children's father back. How do I tell . my 4-year-olds, ""Daddy was murdered because of a clerical error""? Katherine Leon said. Officials said yesterday that Ebel's previous felony conviction had been inaccurately recorded and his release in January was a mistake. In 2008, Ebel pleaded guilty to . assaulting a prison officer. As part of the plea deal, Ebel was to be . sentenced to up to four additional years in prison, to be served after . he completed the eight-year sentence that put him behind bars in 2005, . according to a statement from Colorado's 11th Judicial District. However, the judge did not say the sentence was meant to be 'consecutive,' or in addition to, Ebel's current one. So . the court clerk recorded it as one to be served 'concurrently' or at . the same time. That's the information that went to the state prisons, . the statement said. On January 28, prisons officials saw . that Ebel had finished his court-ordered sentence and released him. They . said they had no way of knowing the plea deal was intended to keep Ebel . behind bars for years longer. On March 21, Ebel was killed following . a  shootout with authorities in Texas. The gun he used in the gun battle . was the same one used to shoot and kill Mr Clements two days earlier. Victims: Police believe Ebel also was involved in the death of a Domino's Pizza delivery man, Nathan Leon, left, in Denver. Prisons chief Tom Clements  right, was also believed to have been killed by Ebel . Irate: An emotional Mrs Leon said that she never even received a phone call of condolence from the Department of Corrections . 'The court regrets this oversight and . extends condolences to the families of Mr. Nathan Leon and Mr. Tom . Clements,' said a statement signed by Charles Barton, chief judge of the . 11th Judicial District, and court administrator Walter Blair. The statement, which Mrs Leon says they never were given directly, does not assuage any of their anger over the situation. Injured: Evan Spencer Ebel was first pulled over by Montague County Sheriff's Deputy James Boyd, pictured, before he was shot by police in the Texas shootout . 'We want to know who is going to . stand up and be accountable. I don't mean by saying we send condolences. Who is going to stand up and be accountable to my daughter? To my . grandchildren,' her mother and Nathan's mother-in-law told local station . 9News. 'He was the greatest person I ever had the pleasure of meeting,' widow Katherine Leon said. The court officials vowed to review their procedures to ensure the error isn't repeated. 'We commend both the 11th Judicial District and the DOC for . reviewing their own internal processes and procedures,' Governor John . Hickenlooper's spokeswoman Megan Castle said in a written statement. The attack that led to the plea deal took place in 2006. According to prison and court records, Ebel slipped out of handcuffs while being transferred from a cell and punched a prison officer in the face. He bloodied the officer's nose and finger, and threatened to kill the officer's family. 'If Mr. Ebel was prosecuted for an assault on an officer, it had to be pretty severe, because in the course of day-to-day work, correctional officers are regularly assaulted or threatened,' said Pueblo County Commissioner Buffie McFadyen, who is executive director of the correctional officer group Corrections U.S.A. Death: This picture shows the scene of the crash and shootout which killed Evan Spencer Ebel . Father and son: Jack Ebel, pictured with his . son, raised Evan Ebel in a middle-class Denver suburb.

Gunned down on his own doorstep: Tom Clements, executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections, lived near Monument, Colorado, pictured above, and was killed at the door . 'It sounds like a horrific . oversight,' she said of the mistake that led to Ebel's release this . year. 'It's a tragic clerical error.' Ebel . spent much of his time behind bars in solitary confinement and had a . long record of disciplinary violations. Records show he joined a white . supremacist prison gang. Ebel's . early release was just the latest twist in a case full of painful . ironies. His father is friends with Hickenlooper and had testified . before the Colorado Legislature about the damage solitary confinement . did to his son. Clements was worried about that very issue.

A mother whose desperately ill baby was treated at Leeds General Infirmary’s children’s heart centre told how she believed his life was only saved when she insisted on transferring him to another unit. All children’s heart surgery was suspended at the hospital last week, after mortality rates were said to be twice the national average. This followed The Mail on Sunday’s story last week exposing the scandal. Hollie Pearson, 19, watched her son George’s condition steadily worsen after he was born 14 months ago in Leeds with four heart defects. Hollie had been told that her baby George could never be cured by Leeds Hospital. But, when she moved him to Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, they said his heart condition could be fixed . After an operation at eight weeks old, George was placed on a ‘palliative care pathway’, meaning his life could be prolonged but his condition would not be cured. Hollie and her mother, Nicola Garbutt, 42, became concerned at George’s listless state, frequent breathlessness and bluish pallor, but trusted the doctors caring for him. But in January 2013, Hollie’s elder sister Emily, 22, home from university, urged her mother: ‘Mum, act quickly please, George looks dead.’ Nicola said: ‘I’d done my homework and spoken to other parents and they just told me to get him to Newcastle, so that’s what I did. ‘I insisted to LGI that they transfer him. Although they did try and put us off and said it was a bad idea because it could take days for all the notes to be sent, they did refer him there. Hollie with her 14-month-old son George. The mother said that his personality has come out since receiving treatment in Newcastle . ‘But my point is that patients shouldn’t have to push for that – they should always be offered a second opinion somewhere else in complicated cases.’ Just two days after he arrived at Freeman Hospital in Newcastle, George’s astonished family were told his poorly heart could be fixed. Nicola said: ‘At this point we had lived a year knowing George was on palliative care only.  The thought he could be taken away at any time is any parent’s nightmare.’ Hollie, a student nurse from Skipton, North Yorkshire, whose studies were put on hold by George’s arrival, said the transformation in her son since his operation was amazing. ‘I’ve really got to know him in the last few weeks and he’s developed a personality which you couldn’t really see before as he was always crying or asleep. He’s a different boy and I’m so glad my mum pushed for us to be transferred.’ This week George, who has had to be fed through a tube all his short life, will have it removed from his nose for the first time as he gets stronger. Mrs Garbutt added: ‘I wasn’t surprised that they suspended operations at Leeds this week, but I do feel for all the children and families waiting for treatment.’ The Mail on Sunday has also learned that a four-year-old girl died at the unit ten days ago after a relatively straightforward procedure to remove muscle from her heart. The girl’s angry mother wrote on Facebook last week: ‘I will fight to the end to find out who did this to her as the surgeon couldn’t tell me how it happened. I have raised money to keep Leeds open myself and I wish I could take it all back.’ The suspension of operations at Leeds was sparked by a Mail on Sunday inquiry. Last week we reported that one of two consultant surgeons at the unit had been secretly banned from operating. The hospital’s failure to announce that decision until contacted by the MoS raised questions over the NHS Transparency Agenda, partly brought in following the Bristol heart scandal in which more than 30 children died. Archbishop of York Dr. John Sentamu wants Jeremy Hunt to intervene over the Leeds general Hospital scandal . The Archbishop of York has called on Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to intervene over the controversial decision to suspend children's congenital heart surgery at Leeds General Infirmary (LGI). The hospital is carrying out an internal review after data suggested a death rate twice the national average. Doubts have been cast over the reliability of the mortality figures after it emerged they did not include scores of operations carried out by the unit. Dr John Sentamu, who has backed campaigners in their battle to keep children's heart surgery in Leeds, visited the unit today in a 'pilgrimage of prayer and trust'. Speaking at the hospital, the archbishop asked Mr Hunt to 'speedily' conduct his own review into the unit, which was ordered after opposition to plans to stop surgery in Leeds. Dr Sentamu told ITV News: 'The data on which it was based to close these surgical procedures needs to be analysed fast and quick. 'If it turns out not to be accurate then somebody's got to come clean about it. 'They should carry out what the court has asked and what the Secretary of State has embarked on and do it speedily and quickly and without any bias at all. 'I'd ask the Secretary of State really to intervene and come in pretty fast.' Dr Sentamu said he believes medical director of NHS England Sir Bruce Keogh would have ""a lot of questions to answer"" if the mortality results proved inaccurate. He added: ""All I can say is that if the data and the research hasn't been properly analysed, I would have thought you would have paused, come to the actual clinic and see what's going on. 'I hope Mr Bruce has the facts but if he hasn't then he's got a lot of questions to answer.' Campaigners have criticised the . suspension of surgery and its timing, which came 24 hours after a High . Court judge ruled the decision-making process to close the children's . unit was 'legally flawed'. A spokesman from NHS England said . tonight: 'We agree with the trust's decision to launch this review. It . is really important that this review is carried out in a sensible, . effective and decisive way. 'For that to happen it needs to follow a proper and complete process. It cannot be conducted in the media. 'The data and other information that . triggered this precautionary pause have raised questions but they have . not provided answers. That is the job of the review. 'It is important that the review is allowed to do its work properly and reach a decisive conclusion on behalf of patients.' The surgeon’s suspension, due to ‘concerns over his practice’, left the unit with only one permanent consultant surgeon – who was on holiday – and two locums. Matters were so desperate a surgeon from Denmark had to fly in at weekends. One expert described the unit as ‘dangerously dysfunctional’. Former heart tsar Professor Sir Roger Boyle, who heads the central unit analysing cardiac mortality data, was informed of the surgeon’s suspension by the MoS last Saturday as Leeds had not announced the move. He alerted NHS chiefs not only to the death rates at the unit, but also the crisis sparked by the suspension. Sir Roger said: ‘I would not have been able to sleep this weekend knowing that there were people who might have been operated on in a potentially unsafe environment.’ He passed on his concerns to Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, medical director of NHS England, who ordered that surgery be suspended on Thursday. Campaigners have criticised the suspension of surgery and its timing, 24 hours after a High Court judge ruled that the decision-making process to close the children’s unit was ‘legally flawed’. But the accuracy of the mortality figures has been questioned after it was claimed that the results were preliminary.","Holly Pearson moved her son George to Freeman Hospital in Newcastle .

And one anaesthetist has certainly put his quiet hours to good use. Peter Morris, an anaesthetist at Castle Hill Hospital, in east Yorkshire, has managed to write a novel while his patients were unconscious. Bound with New Ropes, a 480-page love story, follows the tale of a university lecturer who falls for one of his students. Anaesthetist Peter Morris wrote the novel while his patients were unconscious . It tracks his downfall as he is eventually found guilty of harassing her. That the author, who is a staff grade anaesthetist, according to The Independent, uses the ‘Acknowledgements’ page to explain how he had time to write the book, according . Dr Morris writes: ‘Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust kindly paid me to write it while simultaneously giving anaesthetics. 'Many of their tardy surgeons unwittingly helped by making simple operations last for hours.’ Anaesthetists are required to send patients to sleep and then to monitor their vital signs while the operation is being carried out. However, they are reputed to have more time on their hands than the surgeons themselves. Consequently, many are said to be very well read and excel in puzzles such as Suduko. The anaesthetist says it was possible to write the book because 'tardy surgeons' made 'simple operations last for hours' (posed by model) On the first page of Dr Morris’ novel, which is self-published and for sale for £10, he writes: ‘She wore a plain black skirt, a white blouse with a slightly lacy collar and an open pale blue cardigan with its sleeves pulled back a little. ‘Although her behaviour was not forward, I sensed in her unstilted conduct some wish to engage with me. ‘Her navy nylon jacket slid off her shoulder-bag onto the cold flag-stones. We both stooped to pick it up and our heads almost collided.’ The novel, which is described on Amazon as exposing 'the modern ropes of duplicity and fake virtue' is currently placed at 370,777 in the best-seller ranking. On a grey blustery December afternoon, I sat marking essays in my study in Elgan College. It was dull stuff and gradually, as twilight fell, recurrent distractions stole into my thoughts. For instance, out of the blue I found myself puzzling over girls who had tried to dominate me and who – had I allowed it – would then have despised me. I sipped tea from a patterned blue and lilac glazed mug, twirled round and stared out through the long floor-length window. Dusk had engulfed the roof-tops of the town, but down in Noonham Gardens, where some cast-iron street lamps flickered, I glimpsed Deana Sleight strutting home, perhaps in an irritable mood. Back in the spring I had taken her out, not out of love but out of emotional loneliness or lust, for if sullen and sour she had a sexy inciting shape. Deana was the secretary in the Archaeology Department and at twenty-nine, three years older than myself. Beneath her loosely gathered dark hair and her glinting thick-length belted black leather jacket, I could dimly make out the hem of her pleated tartan skirt, her black tights and her glistening black high-heeled leather boots. Again the paradox had been that despite bullying me, deep down she had wanted to be mastered. I watched her provocative hour-glass outline swaying along beside a set of iron railings until it receded through a soot-blackened archway.","Peter Morris wrote Bound With New Ropes while working in the operating theatre of Castle Hill Hospital .

Lovebirds who take to Twitter and Facebook to proclaim romantic feelings are a turn-off, a study claims. Nearly a quarter of Britons have felt annoyed by VDAs – virtual displays of affection – research found. Although nearly half those quizzed admitted to changing their Facebook status to ‘in a relationship’, couples who express their love for each other via social media commit a major faux pas, says the survey by dating website match.com. Online agony: Posting about break ups on Facebook has been revealed as a major dating faux pas (file photo) It found that 33 per cent had read an online comment about a painful break-up, but 58 per cent would rather not know. And explicit posts were the biggest turn-off, with three-quarters of women saying they dislike that level of sharing. No love loss: The survey found people feel annoyed by virtual displays of affection on sites like Twitter . Kate Taylor, the website’s relationship expert, said VDAs had replaced PDAs – public displays of affection – as cringe-inducing annoyances. ‘There’s nothing wrong with letting your close friends know you’re happy, but it’s important to keep in mind who you’re sharing it with,’ she said. ‘What might seem a sweet comment in the eyes of you and your friends could come across as sounding unintentionally smug.’ The study also found one in three people say they would rather not see people call their other halves by their pet names on social networking sites. However, not all online displays of affection are balked at as 90 per cent of those quizzed said they don't mind seeing a shared profile picture of a friend and their boyfriend or girlfriend. Kate Taylor added: 'Remember, VDAs invite a similar reception to PDAs, while you might think nothing of a quick smooch on public transport, but it can make observers feel uncomfortable. 'Try to limit your personal messages to a private and secure site, rather than sharing them over social media. In this context, your VDAs remain moving and romantic and you won't be accused of attention-seeking.'","Half of those quizzed admit changing Facebook status to 'in a relationship'

The Queen has received a £5million rise in funds she receives from the taxpayer to carry out her official duties. The Sovereign Grant, which covers the running costs of the Queen's Household, replaces the Civil List and is up 16 per cent on 2012. It has been set at £36.1million for the 2013/14 financial year. The figure has increased from the £31million allocated during the previous 12 months which included £1million to cover the extra costs of the Diamond Jubilee. The Sovereign Grant replaces the old funding system of the Civil List and grants-in-aid and came into full effect at the start of the new financial year which began yesterday. It also covers the maintenance of the royal palaces in England and the cost of royal travel for official engagements in the UK and overseas tours. Under the new grant the Queen receives 15% of the profits from the Crown Estate, but from funds two years in arrears. The Crown Estate's 2011/12 accounts revealed profits of £240.2million and the final figure for the grant was rounded up to £36.1million - very close to the estimated amount - by the Royal Trustees in December. The Sovereign Grant has been set at £36.1million - up from £31million in 2012, which included £1million for the Diamond Jubilee . The money is used partly for maintenance on the royal palaces including Buckingham Palace, pictured . Royal accounts released last year showed the cost to the taxpayer of supporting the monarchy rose marginally during 2011/12. The Queen's official expenditure increased from £32.1million in 2010/11 to £32.3million in 2011/12. Around £10million is spent on the salaries of the Queen's staff, from footmen to chefs in the royal kitchen - but wages have been frozen for a number of years. The figure for official expenditure does not include the cost of providing security and police protection for members of the monarchy. A Buckingham Palace spokesman stressed that the £36.1million sovereign grant awarded for this financial year was 15 per cent less in real terms than the royal household's expenditure five years ago. He said during this period the household reduced its expenditure in line with reductions in funding. Because of this, key building and conservation works were postponed, resulting in a maintenance backlog. The increased funding could be used to give royal staff, pictured at Buckingham Palace, their first pay rise in years . The spokesman said the majority of the grant would therefore be spent on addressing the backlog of property works which need to be undertaken across the occupied royal palaces. He added: 'Such works will see the funds spent in the real economy creating work and opportunities.' The money pays for the maintenance of Buckingham Palace, St James’s Palace, Clarence House, Marlborough House Mews. It is also used for the upkeep of parts of Kensington Palace, Windsor Castle and the buildings in the Home and Great Parks at Windsor, and Hampton Court Mews and Paddocks.","The Sovereign Grant has been set £36.1million for 2013/14 financial year .

He normally does his mud-slinging in the House of Commons. But David Cameron has told how he got waist-deep in a different kind of muck when he dived into a swamp to save a sheep. The Prime Minister rescued the ewe near his home outside Chipping Norton. Now nicknamed ‘Swampy’, she had become stuck trying to save her two lambs, both of which sadly drowned. Mr Cameron, whose two armed police guards also pitched in, said: ‘I helped my neighbour with his lambing one weekend and that gave me more pleasure than anything I’ve done for a long time. ‘He lost one of his ewes and so we were bottle-feeding some of his lambs and then one of his sheep got stuck in a swamp. ‘Sadly two lambs had died and obviously she’d gone in to rescue them and they’d drowned. 'We managed to get the ewe out. Some of the staff with me joined in. 'We all jumped in and were up to our waists in the swamp. ‘So this ewe is now alive and well. I’m not saying I’m going to be a farmer, but I do love the countryside.’ Mr Cameron heard Swampy’s desperate bleating at 6pm on a Friday evening as he left neighbour Julian Tustian’s farm. Mr Tustian said: ‘When I got there, David was in the swamp, waist-deep in mud, along with the two police, who had all gone in there to help drag this sheep out. ‘He was brilliant, pulling, pushing and shoving. He was covered in mud, he looked a mess. It’s nice to see, really - the police didn’t have to do that and neither did David Cameron.’ The ewe has now fully recovered from her ordeal last month. Mr Tustian said: ‘She’s very happy. She’s got no kids now so she’s having a summer off.’ Mr Tustian, 43, said the prime . minister often liked to visit his farm during lambing, having grown up . with sheep himself, as way to have some quiet time away from it all. ‘If I’m lambing, he will often pop in’, he said. ‘He likes to get away from the real world.’ Mucking in: David Cameron, pictured planting trees last week, described how he jumped into the swamp to save the sheep's life . Mr Cameron was speaking about the incident to mothers invited to the Mum of the Year awards at Number 10, when asked what he will do after his life in politics. Cameron had spent 30 minutes in the lambing shed with the farmer and his partner Shen Paget before heading home for the evening. Mr Tustian then got a call from the prime minister alerting him to a sheep he had spotted in the swamp with two lambs. ‘I got there and the three of them were . pulling this ewe, and he [Cameron] was concentrating on getting this . sheep out. He was covered in mud. 'I was glad he was there doing it, not . me. It was very wet weather and getting dark.’ Cameron the hero: The ewe, now nicknamed Swampy, was saved by David Cameron and some of his staff who got 'waist-deep' into the mud (file photo) Mr Tustian said the death of the two lambs had been’ ‘the start of a bad year’ in which his farm had lost several lambs to the freezing Spring weather. It is not the first time Mr Cameron has given him a helping hand with his sheep. In 2007 he acted as assistant to Mr Tustian while he delivered twin lambs which had become breached. The Prime Minister helped him for a frantic 15 minutes with his pedigree ewe Patsy, as they had to push one of the lamb’s legs back in again.

A funeral director's wife, whose husband was yesterday jailed for life for her murder, left a diary detailing his infidelity and her concerns over their marriage. John Taylor, 61, was told he must serve at least 17 years behind bars after a jury unanimously found him guilty of killing Alethea, 63, his wife of 16 years, despite her body never having been found. He had callously ‘spun a web of lies’ to cover his tracks, telling friends his wife had developed ‘some form of dementia’ and vanished without warning. Murder: Funeral director John Taylor, left, has been convicted of killing his wife Alethea, right . In fact, he had fallen in love with . widow Alison Dearden, 53, after organising her husband’s funeral, and . murdered his wife and hid her body so they could be together. After a month-long trial at Worcester Crown Court, a jury yesterday saw through his ‘blatant lies’ and convicted him of her murder. They had earlier heard how the funeral director’s relationship with his wife had become strained after he she discovered he had embarked on an affair with Mrs Dearden in the summer of 2011. In a diary discovered by officers, she had written of her concerns that her husband had become 'besotted with a certain widow'. Michael Burrows, prosecuting, said Taylor had used the couple's joint bank account to buy a 'love nest', which he was renovating so he could eventually move in with his mistress. Diary: Mrs Taylor wrote in this document of her suspicions that her husband was having an affair . Jailing him, Justice Julian Flaux told him: 'Since her body has never been found, only you know what became of her. 'The jury has rejected your defence that you were not responsible. 'You clearly perceived her as an obstacle to happiness with Alison.  She had discovered the affair and as her notebooks bear out you were scared she might reveal it. 'There is a dark and violent side to your personality, which perhaps only Alethea knew. Your anger and frustration boiled over. 'You attacked her either in the bedroom where her blood was found or elsewhere and put her, bleeding, on the bed then smothered her with a pillow. You then drove her body away in your car. Alethea Taylor helped solve her own murder from beyond the grave - by writing diaries where she branded her evil husband 'Mr Nasty' 'You have lived all your life in rural Herefordshire and were well able to find an isolated place where she has not been found. 'A particularly serious aggravating feature is the concealment. You have even now failed to disclose her whereabouts with all the agony that causes her family and friends. 'You have shown no remorse because you continue to deny you murdered her.' Mrs Taylor went missing in January last year and her disappearance was reported to police by her husband. Officers found her blood on bedding at the couple's home and on the rear seats of Taylor's car. The . funeral director claimed the blood was from a nose bleed, but a . forensic scientist said it had not dripped and probably resulted from . direct contact with the sheets. Taylor was also seen vacuuming the . boot of his vehicle outside his home - despite telling police he was . somewhere else at the time. Taylor . claimed his wife was still alive when he left their home in Orleton, . Herefordshire, on the morning of January 19, but that she then . disappeared. He claimed . to have tried to contact his wife by telephone several times after she . went missing but cell site analysis showed that he had only called her . once and hung up after eight seconds. Taylor maintained that if his wife was dead, he was not responsible. Mrs Taylor's nightdress was missing from the house but her glasses, passport, bank cards and a bracelet were all left behind. Taylor was 'keen to spread around' the idea she was 'in some way losing her mind' to cover up for her . disappearance, the court heard. Bedroom: Mrs Taylor's blood was found in the couple's home in Orleton, Herefordshire . Evidence: Specimens of the Mrs Taylor's blood were also found in the BMW owned by her husband . He . told police he had once found his wife 'crying and disorientated' in a . lane, but never took her to see a doctor despite his professed concerns. And Mrs Taylor had not confided in friends about any problems with memory loss, the jury was told. Rita . Tetsill said she had known her for 40 years and was 'gobsmacked' when . Taylor told her his wife was 'suffering with dementia'. Mrs Tetsill said she had 'never' seen anything to make her fear for her friend's mental health. She . added that Alethea 'always sent everyone cards, birthday, anniversary, . Easter and New Year - she never forgot, but since she went missing I . haven't received one letter.' Both . Mrs Tetsill and a second friend, Eve Martin, told the jury they were . surprised when Taylor told them separately his wife had 'wandered off' on occasion. Search: But despite a major police operation, Mrs Taylor's body has still never been found . The court heard Mrs Taylor's first marriage ended in the 1980s when her then husband had an affair. After the break-up Mrs Taylor met her future husband. Taylor left his then wife and later moved to a bungalow in Orleton with Mrs Taylor, whom he married in 1996. David Elliott, Sector Crown Prosecutor from West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said Taylor had ‘spun a web of lies in order to avoid justice’. ‘A jury today has seen through his deceit,’ he added. ‘Taylor was unhappy in his marriage and he was having an affair. His wife found out and in a diary which was recovered from the house, Mrs Taylor highlighted her concerns at her husband’s infidelity and the future of their marriage. ‘We will never know how Mrs Taylor was killed or where her body has been concealed. Only the defendant has the knowledge and answers to these questions. ‘We would encourage him to inform the authorities of where he has hidden the body so that Mrs Taylor can be finally laid to rest and her family and friends can get some form of closure in this tragic case.’","John Taylor, 61, will serve at least 17 years for murder of wife Alethea, 63 .

Transport officials are understood to be considering several other possible projects including an upgrade to the A1 North of Newcastle which would link London and Scotland by dual carriageway for the first time; the A303 in southwest England, and the A47 running through the Norfolk Broads. The M4 scheme was first considered in 1989 and plans were unveiled almost ten years ago, but shelved five years later due to spiralling costs. It is now expected to be the centrepiece of an infrastructure package, after the Chancellor announced an extra £3.3billion a year in funding for major projects to boost jobs and growth. But it will take three years of . preparation and 15 years to build and is not expected to open until the . year 2031, highlighting the problems the government faces with getting . major works underway. George Osborne announced £3billion extra a year in infrastructure spending in last month's Budget . David Cameron claimed the controversial High Speed 2 railway line – opposed by many of his backbenchers - was ‘vital’ if Britain was to compete in the ‘global race’. But the first fast trains to Birmingham will not run until 2026 and the second phase to Manchester and Leeds will not be ready until the mid-2030s. The anticipated announcement in this summer’s Comprehensive Spending Review follows a Government row about whether to embark on major and costly infrastructure investment to take advantage of low interest rates, to create jobs and improve the local economy. The M4 project, 14-miles stretch of dual carriageway as a relief road between junctions 23 and 29, is intended to end notorious bottlenecks at the Brynglas Tunnels on the outskirts of Newport. It has a budget of £830million over 15 years, and a toll will be operated by the Welsh Government to pay it back. It is not without controversy as while ministers claim it will boost the South Wales economy as the roads are predicted to become more congested, campaigners warn it could backfire. AA president Edmund King said introducing tolls could deter motorists, which he said had been a problem on the UK’s first tolled motorway, the 27-mile M6 toll near Birmingham. He said: ‘We have seen with the M6 Toll that drivers can be turned off by the imposition of charges. 'There is already a toll to get into Wales on the Severn Crossing but no toll to get out. There is no doubt that the M4 around Newport needs improving. At the moment if there is a bad accident and the road is closed there is no real alternative for drivers. ‘But if the road is tolled it reduced its economic effectiveness as a lot of people will be put off using it and will simply avoid it.’ The A303 is controversial due to environmental objections as it would run through scenic countryside and it has been claimed it could disturb archaeological remains at Stonehenge. But the A47 in Norfolk, an accident blackspot where dozens of motorists have died, would be welcomed.","Chancellor 'set to announce new toll road along the M4 in South Wales'

An affluent cul-de-sac outside of Charlotte, North Carolina, has been left reeling after a poetry-loving 50-year-old shot dead his neighbors on Friday allegedly over a dispute over trees in his backyard. Anthony Charles Hardy opened fire on his neighbors Daniel Thomas Kirchner, 42, and Gary Wade Stocks, 64, in the backyard of Kirchner's home, in front of Kirchner's wife and two young daughters and then later shot himself dead following a standoff with Cabarrus County SWAT team members stationed outside his own home. Despite being described as a 'gentle spirit' by those who knew him, Hardy, who lived alone, had a history of aggressive behavior towards his neighbors and spent one year on probation for assaulting one resident prior to Kirchner or Stocks taking up residence. Scroll Down for Video . Officials said 50-year-old Anthony Charles Hardy shot and killed neighbors Daniel Thomas Kirchner, 42, and Gary Wade Stocks, 64, in the backyard of Kirchner¿s house at 7791 Coachman Court . On Good Friday, police say that they received a phone call at 4 p.m. from Kirchner's wife Lisa to say that Hardy was firing a weapon in her backyard, shooting her husband and Stocks and that she had escaped inside with her two daughters. Immediately after shooting his neighbors, Hardy ran to his own house and holed himself up there for over six hours, exchanging fire with SWAT officers at least twice, before shooting himself dead. During the terrifying stand-off, the residents of Coachman Court, in the neighborhood of Windsor Forest, cowered in their homes as police units in tactical gear attempted to negotiate with Hardy while paramedics tried in vain to rescue Kirchner and Stocks. While police have not yet offered any motive for the shocking shootings, some neighbors suggested to the Charlotte Observer that Hardy, who was known to be reclusive and secretive was angry that pine trees had been cut down behind his house. Anthony Charles Hardy (left) shot dead neighbor Daniel Thomas Kirchner (right - with a girl believed to be one of his daughters) inside his home on Good Friday - with no apparent motive clear to police . The affluent cul-de-sac has been rocked by the apparently senseless murders following the shootings on Good Friday . Kirchner was president of the Windsor Forest homeowners association and Stocks was also a board member. The trees were obstructing power lines behind Hardy's home and both victims were on the board that approved the removal of the trees. However, neighbors such as Chris Duffell said there was no such feud. Resident Judy Porson, who lives two doors away from the Stocks, said she didn’t believe there was any sort of argument between Hardy and his neighbors over the pine trees either. Adding to the mysterious circumstances surrounding the shooting, Porson recalled how Hardy and Stocks had been chatting in recent weeks and that there was no sign of any ill-feeling. 'There was no argument, no animosity among them,' she said to The Charlotte Observer. 'Obviously he (Hardy) was disturbed. None of us can understand why he did this.' Hardy's Linkedin and Facebook pages list him as the president of Anthony C. Hardy Enterprises, which says that he provides pharamcist staffing solutions. Officers and SWAT teams rushed to the Coachman Court address on Friday afternoon after being called by Daniel Thomas Kirchner's wife, Lisa . One friend of Hardy's who used to meet him at his poetry meet-up group said that she had called him a month ago because he had stopped coming to the group. Diana Engel said to WCNC.Com that she hadn't seen him in over a month. 'He said, I'm really struggling with something right now,' said Engel. Hardy had never married and did not have children, but those who knew him through poetry and creative writing groups described him as an accomplished writer with a 'gentle spirit'. David Radavich, the president of the Charlotte Writers Club said to WCNC.Com that Hardy had been chosen at least twice as one of the top poets among the groups 220 members. Engle also said that she had known Hardy for seven-years and that he was a hunter and politically conservative. Hardy's victim Daniel Thomas Kirchner was an insurance agent and the father of two young daughters. Harrisburg, North Carolina Mayor Tim Hagler said that the community was devastated by the tragic and senseless shooting . Neighbors also revealed that Stocks had even called 911 on Hardy's behalf when he thought that he was having a heart attack - picking him up from the hospital later on. Stunned neighbors recalled how Coachman Court was known for its block parties and family-orientated atmosphere. One unidentified neighbor said, 'Dan (Kirchener) is a nice man. If you met in the aisle in the grocery store, he would be the guy that would move his cart so you could get to the shelf. Speaking to the Charlotte Observer, he added that 'Gary (Stocks) was a really, really friendly guy. He'd always stop and say 'Hi'. The neighborhood's residents said that the cul-de-sac was known for its community spirit and frequent block parties . Neighbors who have lived nearby to Hardy for more than ten-years revealed he frequently got into arguments about landscaping with the previous owner of Kirchner’s house. Court records show Hardy was found guilty of assaulting that man in 2004. And on Sunday, in the aftermath of the tragic shootings, Tim Hagler, the mayor of Harrisburg, issued a call for the community to pull together. 'We're like family so when one hurts, one family hurts, we all hurt,' said Hagler. 'The good thing about Harrisburg is we all pull together, and we're here for support.'","Officials in Harrisburg, North Carolina said 50-year-old Anthony Charles Hardy shot and killed neighbors Daniel .

A major hospital was so overrun by patients and queuing ambulances that bosses had to erect a major incident tent normally used to treat casualties after disasters such as air and rail crashes. Up to 15 ambulances were kept waiting outside the A&E department at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital on Easter Monday. Some stood more than three hours before patients were admitted. Up to 15 ambulances were kept waiting outside the A&E department at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital on Easter Monday. A major incident tent was put up so paramedics could drop off patients . The delays spanned an eight hour period with some stood more than three hours before patients were delivered . The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital was one of the first to be built under the controversial Private Finance Initiative schemes introduced by Labour. Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) hand financing of large-scale buildings or infrastructure schemes, such as new schools and hospitals, from the Treasury to developers. The company owns the building and leases it back to the public sector over a period of a minimum of 25 years. The benefit to the public sector is that there is no up-front burden on the taxpayer and crumbling buildings can be restored or scrapped and completely re-built. The benefit to the private sector is that the repayment interest rates are usually high. Some companies charge interest rates of up to 70 per cent. As such, many hospital trusts have struggled with the crippling annual PFI repayments - which run into multi-millions -  at a time when the NHS must make savings of £20bn by 2015. In 2006, the public accounts committee revealed that two years after Norwich and Norfolk was completed Barclays, Serco, Innisfree and John . Laing decided to refinance their joint working company, Octagon, so that . they could take early profits. By increasing the size of the borrowings - from £200m to more than £300m . - and the time taken to repay that money from the year 2017 to 2037, . they managed to take out a windfall of £115m. It was reported they gave only £34m of that to the hospital trust and kept the rest for themselves. The situation got so bad that a major . incident tent similar to a field hospital was put up so paramedics . could drop off their patients. Frustrated ambulance staff said the . emergency tent was normally reserved for plane and train crashes and . putting it outside the hospital was 'unheard of'. But hospital bosses said it was only . erected 'as a precaution' for 1 hour and 45 minutes and in the end . no-one had to be treated in it. The hospital faced a similar problem last month when all 17 ambulances were left queuing outside A&E. On that occasion the East of England . Ambulance Service was left unable to attend 12 other 999 calls and . ambulances had to be drafted in from further afield. The latest incident came after the . hospital's director of medicine and emergency care, Chris Cobb, said . they should be able to cope with 15 ambulances turning up at once. One ambulance crewman said: 'We are . so fed-up with getting slated and being made to look as if the ambulance . service is to blame for the delays - but it's not us, it's A&E. 'They want to get out and save lives. That's all they want to do and they are getting caught up in a political row. 'The tent is usually used at plane . crashes and big events, such as the Lord Mayor's parade. To put it up . outside the A&E is unheard of.' Another ambulance worker, who also asked to remain anonymous, said: 'It's a mini-hospital in a tent.' 'It will usually have in it treatment . bays, drugs, oxygen, the same stuff on board an ambulance but inside a . tent - which is a lot colder.' Ambulance service spokesman Oskan . Edwarson said: 'Between 11am and 8pm the trust had an average of between . six and 15 vehicles queuing for up to three plus hours. Frustrated ambulance staff said the emergency tent was normally reserved for plane and train crashes and putting it outside the hospital was 'unheard of' (stock image) 'Clearly this led to ambulances not being available to respond to other patients in the community. 'We worked closely with the hospital . and clinical commissioning group throughout the afternoon and deployed . the the trust major incident tent to help release ambulances back on to . the road. 'The trust is pleased that this issue . is now resolved following much hard work by the hospital and the . ambulance service and that in the end no patients were required to be . treated in the major incident tent at this time.' Hospital chief executive Anna Dugdale said: 'We were extremely busy over the weekend. 'We made a decision with the ambulance trust to put the tent up simply as a precaution at about half-past six last night. 'We agreed by quarter-past eight that we didn't need it. 'The demand on emergency services . over the bank holiday weekend had been exceptionally high and the . ambulance tent was erected for a short period as a precautionary . measure.' Now a local MP has demanded answers . from the hospital and called for an investigation to ensure patients at . the hospital receive the appropriate care. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter, MP . for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, said: 'This is clearly some . unacceptable poor standard of care for 999 patients in Norfolk and . Suffolk. 'Front line paramedics are doing . their best to get their patients into the care of the Norfolk & . Norwich and it seems the hospital system of triage is not up to . standard. 'It is time the hospital management learned lessons and improve triage process.
