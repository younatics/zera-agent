"Attorney General Eric Holder promised Saturday to do all in his power to protect Americans' right to vote. Speaking at the annual conference of the National Council of La Raza in Las Vegas, he praised the group and encouraged it to keep holding politicians' feet to the fire. La Raza is the largest national Latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States. ""Despite the truth and transformative power of the American Dream and despite all the progress we've made over the last 236 years, our nation's struggle to overcome injustice and eliminate disparities remains far from over,"" Holder said, according to a copy of his prepared remarks. Speaking on behalf of the U.S. Justice Department, which he helms, he said, ""We'll do everything in our power to stand vigilant against any and all measures that threaten to undermine the effectiveness and integrity of our elections systems -- and to infringe on the single most important right of American citizenship: the right to vote."" Florida's voting standoff deja vu? Holder is likely to make similar comments next week at the annual convention of the NAACP in Houston, Texas, where he is scheduled to speak. Addressing the La Raza conference, the attorney general discussed how his department has responded over the last 18 months to proposed laws that could make it more difficult for some voters to cast ballots. For example, the Justice Department in March blocked a controversial new Texas law requiring voters to present personal identification before going to the polls, saying it could have a discriminatory effect on Hispanics and other minorities. Texas is among eight states to require official photo identification in an effort to stop what officials say is voter fraud. Opponents of the laws say they disenfranchise poor, minority and disabled voters. A similar voter ID law in South Carolina was blocked by the Obama administration in December. Texas and South Carolina then had the option of asking a federal court in the nation's capital to review the laws, and allow them to be enforced this election year. A trial is scheduled to start Monday in Washington before a three-judge federal court on the proposed Texas ID law. ""In each of the jurisdictions where proposed changes can be shown to have no discriminatory purpose or effect, we'll follow the law and approve the change. Where jurisdictions cannot meet this threshold, we will object -- under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and other laws -- in order to guarantee that all eligible citizens have unrestricted access to the ballot box,"" said Holder. The landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 gives the federal government the power to oversee any changes in voting procedures in states and jurisdictions with a history of voter discrimination. Justice Department lawsuit challenges Florida voter purge . Toward the beginning of his speech in Las Vegas, the attorney general joked that it was nice to be ""outside of Washington,"" a possible reference to the pressure he's been under there because of Fast and Furious -- a discredited gun-running operation that has become a sharp point of contention between Democrats and Republicans. The House of Representatives voted last week to hold Holder in contempt for refusing to turn over documents tied to the program. President Barack Obama has asserted executive privilege in the case, and Holder will not face criminal prosecution.

"(CNN) -- One day before U.S. President Barack Obama's Canadian visit last week, Canadian fighter jets intercepted two Russian bombers near Canadian air space, the defense minister said Friday. Canadian jets intercepted Russian TU-95 Bear bomber aircraft last week similar to this one. ""At no time did Russian planes enter Canadian air space, but within 24 hours of the president's visit here ... we did scramble F-18 fighter planes from NORAD in Canada command,"" Peter MacKay said in a news conference in Ottawa. The Russian planes were in international waters, about 118 miles (190 kilometers) northeast of Tuktoyuktuk, in Canada's Northwest Territories. ""It was a routine flight over international airspace,"" Yevgeniy Khorishko, a spokesman at the Russian Embassy in Washington, told CBC news. NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, is a joint U.S.-Canadian agency in charge of aerospace control for the North American continent. ""As has been done on previous occasions, (Canadian pilots) sent very clear signals that are understood, that (the) aircraft was to turn around, turn tail and head back to its own air space, which it did,"" MacKay said. The Russian planes were identified as TU-95 Bear aircraft by NORAD spokesman Michael Kucharek.","Russian bombers were in international waters when Canadian jets intercepted them .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Ann Nixon Cooper, the Atlanta centenarian whose name Barack Obama invoked in his post-election speech as a symbol of America's struggles and progress, died Monday. She was 107. In his victory speech in Chicago, Obama said of Cooper, who was African-American: ""She was born just a generation past slavery ... when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons -- because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin. ""At a time when women's voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot."" When Obama was sworn in as president, Cooper called it one of the greatest days of her life. ""There was a time when they thought they could just kick us around,"" she said on Inauguration Day. ""Now, it has changed."" Cooper, who was just 19 days shy of her 108th birthday, died at her home surrounded by loved ones, friend Sally Warner told CNN. Cooper was born in Shelbyville, Tennessee, in 1902 and grew up in Nashville with uncles and an aunt who worked as domestic help for wealthy whites. She married Albert Cooper, a prominent dentist, in Nashville in 1922, and the couple moved to Atlanta, where they raised four children and were members of black society. She co-founded a Girls Club for African-American youths and taught community residents how to read in a tutoring program at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached. ""Our days and nights were just social affairs,"" she recalled to CNN in 2008. Celebrities, including the late singer Nat King Cole, dropped in to visit. Three of Cooper's four children have died; her surviving daughter, who was by her mother's side Monday, is 84. When asked about the secret to her longevity, Cooper told CNN, ""I don't know how it happened, but being cheerful had a lot to do with it. I've always been a happy person, a giggling person -- a wide-mouthed person!"" To young people, Cooper offered this advice: ""Keep smiling. No matter what, you get out and vote. Vote your choice.""","Ann Nixon Cooper died at her home 19 days shy of 108th birthday .

"(CNN)  -- Officials have uncovered a common grave in Paraguay that contained at least two bodies of victims believed tortured and killed under former strongman Alfredo Stroessner, authorities said. Human remains are discovered Thursday in an Asuncion, Paraguay, neighborhood. Speaking at the grave site Thursday, President Fernando Lugo called it the remnants of a ""painful period"" in Paraguay's history. Stroessner held power from 1954-89 and was known as a brutal dictator whose regime tortured and killed hundreds of government opponents. The bodies were found in Tacumbu, a neighborhood in Paraguay's capital city, Asuncion.","Grave found in Paraguay with bodies believed tortured under former regime .

"Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi, the only person convicted in connection with the Lockerbie airline bombing that killed 270 people, died Sunday, the Libyan government and family members said. He was 60. The former intelligence officer, who had suffered from prostate cancer, will be buried Monday, according to a Libyan foreign ministry spokesman. Al Megrahi's cousin, Omer al-Gharyani, told CNN he was at a Tripoli hospital with al Megrahi when he died. His death came more than two-and-a-half years after he was freed from a life sentence in Scotland because he was said to be dying. His brother said the family refers ""to the deceased as 'the convicted innocent.'"" ""May God bless his soul,"" he added. Relatives of those killed in the bombing expressed relief and, in some cases, anger. ""He was a mass murderer. I feel no pity,"" said Susan Cohen, whose daughter was among the 189 Americans killed. Lockerbie victims' families: Relief, anger . The destruction of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 was the deadliest act of air terrorism targeting Americans until the September 11, 2001, attacks, according to the FBI. American and British investigators who painstakingly pieced together the wreckage concluded it was destroyed by a bomb. Authorities in those nations claimed al Megrahi -- once the security chief for Libyan Arab Airlines -- and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah were Libyan intelligence agents who planted the explosive. They were charged in November 1991 on 270 counts of murder and conspiracy to murder. That indictment set off the first battle over al Megrahi, until Libya handed him and Fhima over in the face of international pressure. Eight years after his trial and conviction, a fresh uproar arose when he was released from a Scottish prison because he was battling terminal prostate cancer. He received a hero's welcome upon arriving home in Libya. And last year, as rebel fighters advanced and, ultimately, toppled Moammar Gadhafi and his regime, the debate was revived as some called for al Megrahi's extradition back to Britain or to the United States. But even after new leaders took power, he remained in Libya. CNN Senior International Correspondent Nic Robertson tracked al Megrahi down last August at the palatial villa Gadhafi had built for him. Apparently in a coma and near death, al Megrahi's family said then that his son and mother were trying to care for him with oxygen and an intravenous drip, but with no medical assistance. His death may make it impossible ever to get the full story behind the Lockerbie bombing. In an interview with Reuters last October, al Megrahi vowed ""new facts"" would come to light. The truth will come out ""one day, and hopefully in the near future,"" he said. 2011: Convicted Lockerbie bomber says truth will eventually come out . Reacting to news of the convicted killer's death, British Prime Minister David Cameron on Sunday reiterated his belief that ""he should never have been released from prison."" ""Today is a day to remember the 270 people who lost their lives in what was an appalling terrorist act,"" Cameron at the NATO summit in Chicago. ""Our thoughts should be with them and their families for the suffering they've had."" Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond -- the top Scottish political figure -- likewise expressed sympathy for the attack's victims, while asserting that al Megrahi's death puts ""to rest some of the conspiracy theories which have attempted to suggest that his illness was somehow manufactured."" Despite widespread criticism, ""extensive scrutiny"" has found that Scotland released al Megrahi on ""compassionate grounds alone,"" Salmond said in his statement. His release -- and the celebrations that greeted him in Libya -- sparked condemnation from the United States and British governments, and from some victims' families. U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, accused ""the Scottish government, perhaps with the participation of the British government, (of creating) a major injustice when they let him out."" ""This man was a horrible man,"" Schumer told CNN on Sunday. ""It would have been better had he not died in freedom, but died in prison. That's what he deserved."" ""The only legacy we have is in the memory of all those who were lost,"" Schumer added. ""...We have to just make sure we continue this battle against terrorism on airplanes. We made great progress and we have to keep it up."" When Washington and London blamed al Megrahi and Fhimah for the attack, Libya refused to hand them over. That led the U.N. Security Council in April 1992 to slap sanctions on the north African nation, clamping down on arms sales and air travel. The FBI put the two men on its 10 Most Wanted fugitives list -- the only time officers of a foreign government have ever been so named, spokesman Ken Hoffman said. Two years later, Libya floated the idea of trying the men in an international court, which the United States and Britain rejected. Libya made a new proposal in summer 1998: that the men go on trial in the Netherlands, albeit under Scottish law. By the end of that year, matters came to a head when then U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met Gadhafi in Tripoli. Ten days later, a U.S. Appeals Court ruled that families of Americans killed in the bombing could sue Libya for possibly sponsoring the attack. The next day, Libya agreed to let the men face trial. They were handed over April 5, 1999, to the United Nations, which suspended its sanctions the same day. Two months later, U.S. and Libyan officials met face-to-face for the first time in 18 years. Libya later agreed in 2003 to pay $2.7 billion to victims' families, though Gadhafi was always cagey about admitting official Libyan involvement. After a nine-month trial, al Megrahi was convicted in 2001 of the murders after prosecutors dropped lesser charges. He was sentenced to life in prison, having to serve a minimum of 27 years. Scotland does not allow the death penalty. Fhimah was found not guilty. For his part, al Megrahi continued to fight to clear his name. In June 2007, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission allowed one appeal to go forward, ruling it uncovered new evidence and that al Megrahi ""may have suffered a miscarriage of justice."" Before that appeal was heard, however, it emerged al Megrahi had terminal prostate cancer. Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill, who had authority over the case because the convicted bomber was jailed in Scotland, ordered him freed in August 2009. Some family members of Lockerbie victims swiftly complained that, with the legal process ending after al Megrahi dropped his appeal, they'd never know the full truth. British press, meanwhile, alleged the release was tied to oil deals with Libya. British and Scottish officials denied that claim, making public more than 100 pages of previously secret documents to make their case. The papers included a handwritten letter from al Megrahi to MacAskill, pleading that he be allowed to see his family before he died, and continuing to proclaim his innocence. The documents also showed that senior Libyan officials warned their Scottish and British counterparts it would be ""catastrophic"" for British-Libyan relations if al Megrahi died in prison. Gadhafi's son, Saif al-Islam, Gadhafi's son and heir apparent who accompanied al Megrahi back to Libya on August 20, 2009, said  Libya was ""very angry"" at British efforts to keep al Megrahi out of a separate prisoner transfer agreement. But he said, ultimately, the bomber was released for a different reason. It was ""not because of business deals,"" Saif al-Islam Gadhafi told CNN in early September, two months before he himself was captured in Libya. ""The guy is sick, seriously sick. He has cancer, and, because of that, they made their decision.""","A Lockerbie victim's mother says she has ""no pity"" for a ""mass murderer""

"Do you crave the seclusion of your own private island, but hate being tied down in one place? If so, an Austrian firm has developed the solution to your troubles -- a man-made floating ""island"", complete with two small diesel engines for whenever you fancy a change of scenery. The oval-shaped ""Orsos Island"" has been designed to combine the mobility of a yacht with the comfort of a house. It offers six bedrooms spread over three floors and 1,000 square meters -- nearly four tennis courts -- worth of luxury living space. Although it doesn't come with an actual tennis court, those longing for some sub-aquatic snooker will be relieved to learn that there is a large games room in the island's ""hull."" The underwater karaoke suite, meanwhile, is ideal for those whose singing voice is best kept a safe distance from civilization. The island also comes complete with all the usual ocean-bound comforts of the mega-rich: Jacuzzi, barbeque, sun loungers, minibar, stately dining room and, of course, aquarium. The price tag for all of this is certainly more than you'd expect to pay for a mainland mansion but, at $6.5 million, it falls well below the average cost of the gigayachts and Caribbean islands currently favored by the fabulously wealthy. ""Since we launched there has been an unbelievable amount of interest in the island. Everyday I get inquiries from people all over the world including the U.S., Europe, Middle East and China,"" said Elizabeth Recsy, Orsos Island's head of communications. ""So far there doesn't seem to be a typical customer. I have spoken to private people looking for a luxury retreat, investors looking for a good deal and hotel chains who want to branch out and try something different,"" she added. The island is the passion project of Hungarian-born entrepreneur Gabor Orsos, a former hotelier who wanted to combine the best features of luxury hotels with the flexibility that a superyacht provides. Measuring 37 meters long, the island can be anchored anywhere in the world its owner fancies. But, although it resembles the ""Millennium Falcon"" from ""Star Wars"", the ""Orsos Island"" is unable to reach tropical destinations at lightening speed, as its diminutive diesel engines are equipped for short journeys only. Instead, the company recommends that its owners use a towboat or cargo ship for long haul moves. To boost its green credentials, the designers have incorporated 160 square meters of solar panels on the roof, as well as wind generators that can produce 28-30 kilowatt hours of power (kwh) -- the average daily consumption of a family household. ""The maximum power usage that can occur on the island when everything is used at the same time is calculated to be 45 kwh. In those cases the two diesel engines are used to cover the increased energy needs,"" said Recsy. If the island's owners inadvertently find themselves as island castaways, the vessel also has its own desalination system, capable of converting 12,000 liters seawater to drinking water, using the process of  ""reverse osmosis."" According to Recsy, the design phase of the island was completed over a month ago and the company is currently in the production preparation phase: ""We have several pre-orders and we are starting to build the islands early next year in our facilities in central Europe."" With the production time set to drop from 24 months to under a year as the company expands, the floating ""Orsos Islands"" might very soon become a not-too-permanent fixture on the horizon.","""Orsos Island"" offers 1,000 square meters of luxurious living space over three levels .

"Google Plus, Google's much-chided version of Facebook, celebrated its first birthday last week. That probably means one of two things to you. If you're a tech geek: ""That site's still around?"" Or if not: ""What the heck is Google Plus?"" Both of those reactions, however, may be missing the point. Here's a look at a few -- and unexpected -- reasons Google Plus is clinging to relevance in the Facebook era. (Disclosure: If you'd like to see where this post began, check out a conversation on my Google Plus page. I'm still a sometimes-active user of the site). 'Social glue' for the rest of Google . Google last week released a few updates to its social network -- including an Events feature and new methods of live photo sharing with small groups. Perhaps more importantly, it underscored the idea that the company doesn't see Google Plus as a social network at all. Google's Vic Gundotra told the blog Mashable that ""Google Plus is just an upgrade to Google."" On one hand, this seems convenient, since Google Plus is losing the numbers game to Facebook. (More on that soon). On the other, it might be really smart. Google Plus has the potential to be the ""social glue"" that binds all of Google's already-interesting and already-used products together, writes Richard MacManus, from the blog ReadWriteWeb. ""One year ago, I think we all expected Google+ to turn into a better standalone product than what we've got now. But despite that, Google+ has turned out to be incredibly useful to Google,"" he says. ""If I was to project what Google+ will be like in July 2013, I'd guess it will be even less about being a standalone social network and even more about supporting YouTube, Google search et al."" You may have noticed this showing up in all kinds of small ways on your version of the Internet. If you have Google social search turned on, you see links friends have posted on Google Plus. It's now possible to log into YouTube using the network. Google Reader's ""share"" feature coordinates with Google Plus these days -- and even e-mail lists can be pulled from Google friend ""Circles."" The rest of Google's products, especially search, are popular, even if Google Plus isn't on its own. Passionate audience . OK, so the numbers. Facebook is clearly winning that war. Google Plus has 150 million monthly active users -- compared to Facebook's 900 million. And there's evidence, some of it from independent traffic monitors, that Facebook users engage much more frequently and for longer than Google Plus users, at least in public posts (A comScore report in January said Facebook users spent an average of 7.5 hours on the site, compared to 3.3 minutes on Google Plus."") As The Atlantic put it: ""People are 'on' Google Plus, but they are not really ON Google Plus. The infrastructure is there. The street signs are there. People own plots of land. But there's nobody actually visiting town."" Or, more cuttingly, BuzzFeed's version: ""Logging into Google+ feels like logging into a seminar, or stumbling into the wrong conference room at an airport Marriott. It looks like a cubicle farm and smells like a hospital. Posting anything on Google+ is like talking into a pillow."" Forbes wrote a eulogy for the network in 2011. Google Plus does, however, have some passionate users. In a comment on my feed, a person identified as Tristan Cunha wrote that the site may have gotten a slow start but now ""it's so easy to find lots of interesting people to follow/interact with that if you can't find someone, you're probably just missing the point. Either that, or you want to connect with your long lost friends from high school, which is something that FB probably does better."" And from another commenter, Colleen Lynn, wrote: ""Google+ cannot be dead with so many of us here! It is true that I have not gotten many Facebook friends to join, but as (another user) said, Google Plus is international. If one is interested in learning and sharing in a much broader space than Facebook, Google Plus is the place to be!""﻿ . Mobile apps . Mobile apps are another area where Google Plus has been making up ground. As a blogger at the tech site VentureBeat put it: . ""Google Plus is better than Facebook -- at mobile."" Jennifer Van Grove goes on to say the Android tablet app for Google Plus makes Facebook's apps ""look as if they were built in the MySpace era,"" adding: ""Mobile is Facebook Achilles' heel, and it certainly doesn't look good for the newly public company to lose to Google in a mobile face-off."" That's especially troubling given that Facebook execs have said mobile is one of the company's investment areas moving forward. Video chats . Google Plus's group video chatting feature, called Hangouts, has long been one of the (only) things that made the site fundamentally different from Facebook and Twitter. The free service lets friends and/or strangers talk in a group. You can also record the conversations and take live questions from an audience, which makes the feature popular with news sites, celebs and politicians. President Obama hosted a Hangout earlier this year. To drive this point home in adrenelline-filled fashion, Google streamed a video from a skydiver (who was wearing Google's version of ""Terminator"" glasses) at a recent press conference in California using a Hangout. ""As a social network competing with Facebook it's a flop, but its video-chat tool Hangouts is a winner,"" Heather Kelly, now at CNN Tech, wrote for VentureBeat in May. New features and product integrations . Timed with its one-year anniversary, Google announced a few new Google Plus features -- and most of them, as other tech writers have suggested, integrate with Google's other products. The Events feature, for example, automatically coordinates with Google Calendar. It also lets attendees at a party or gathering post photos from the event and host Hangouts beforehand. Here's how the company describes the feature in a blog post: ""Today's online event tools are really just Web forms that ask, 'Are you going?' Worse yet, they bail when you need them the most: during the actual event, and after everyone leaves. In life we plan, we party and we keep in touch. Software should make all of this more awesome."" A ""live slideshow"" feature lets hosts display photos from the event as they're taken. Do you think these updates are enough to save Google Plus? Do you use it? Do you still see it as a Facebook competitor? Let us know what you think in the comments section -- or, if you want to get super meta, on Google Plus.","Google Plus celebrates its first birthday, launches new features .

The company is positioning the network as an extension of Google .

"(CNN) -- Sri Lanka's cricket team returned home to Colombo early Wednesday, as police in Pakistan searched for at least 12 gunmen believed responsible for the attack that left seven people dead. Sri Lankan player Thilan Samaraweera is taken aboard an ambulance Wednesday in Colombo. Police in Lahore on Wednesday confirmed six police officers and a driver of a van carrying umpires were killed after earlier reports had put the death toll at eight. Six team members were wounded by glass and shrapnel, and two -- Tharanga Paranavitana and Thilan Samaraweera -- were shot in the chest and leg, respectively. Both men were being treated in Colombo and in stable condition, officials said.

Watch Sri Lankan's foreign minister condemnation of the attack » . Teams have long stayed away from Pakistan, concerned about the security situation in a country that is battling an escalating pro-Taliban insurgency. But Sri Lanka -- a country enduring its own civil war with separatist rebels -- agreed in December to visit for a series of matches, after the Indian cricket team called off its tour following the deadly terror attacks in Mumbai in November. Indian authorities blamed those attacks on Pakistan-based militants. The Pakistan Cricket Board had said it was set to lose more than $16 million as a result of India's cancellation, but the Sri Lanka visit was to help it recoup most of the costs, officials said. The Sri Lankan offer to tour was a reciprocal gesture. Pakistan was one of two countries that agreed to tour Sri Lanka during the 1996 World Cup tournament, while other countries refused to travel there because of security concerns. With this attack, fans now worry that Pakistan won't be able to co-host the 2011 Cricket World Cup with India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Morgan said the ICC's board will be meeting in April to consider whether the Cup will include stops in Pakistan. ""The board will have to think very carefully about the extent to which Pakistan will be used for that event,"" Morgan said.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Low visibility was to blame for a helicopter crash that killed 10 Americans on Monday in western Afghanistan, the U.S. Army said Wednesday. The crash in Badghis province killed seven U.S. service members and three U.S. civilians. It also injured 14 Afghan service members, 11 U.S. service members and a U.S. civilian, the military said. The helicopter crashed about 3:30 a.m. Monday when it lifted off after a successful operation to disrupt arms smuggling and narcotics trafficking in the Qadis district, the Army said. ""Thick dust stirred up from the initial takeoff and overwhelmed the visibility of the helicopter crew,"" an Army statement said. ""While trying to correct the aircraft's movement, it struck a tall structure, causing it to crash. Militants did not fire at the helicopter at any point during the departure or crash."" Names of the dead service members will be released pending notification of next of kin, said the Army, which continued to investigate the crash. It was one of two fatal incidents Monday involving helicopters. In all, 14 Americans died in the two crashes, the largest number of Americans killed in Afghanistan in a single day in more than four years, according to CNN records. In the other crash, four U.S. service members died when two helicopters apparently collided in the air in southern Afghanistan. Two other NATO service members were injured.

"The International Criminal Court postponed a key hearing in the case against Laurent Gbagbo, the former Ivory Coast president who is facing charges of crimes against humanity. A confirmation of charges hearing originally planned for Monday is rescheduled to August 13, the court said in a statement.  His lawyers asked for a delay to give them more time to prepare for an effective defense. The hearing is to allow judges to hear arguments from both sides to determine whether there is sufficient evidence for the  case to proceed to trial. Gbagbo is accused of crimes against humanity after he rejected election results and refused to step down when current president,  Alassane Ouattara, was declared the winner in the 2010 poll. The standoff sparked months of violence between supporters of both sides, leaving thousands dead. The former leader is accused of the crimes for actions committed by forces loyal to him during the standoff. He says he is not guilty. ""Mr Gbagbo allegedly bears individual criminal responsibility, as indirect co-perpetrator, for four counts of crimes against humanity, namely murder, rape and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and other inhuman acts,"" the international court said in a statement last year. It said the alleged crimes occurred between December 2010 and April 2011. Authorities arrested Gbagbo in April last year, ending the standoff. In November, he was flown to The Hague, Netherlands, where the court is based.

"(CNN) -- A man described as ""one of al Qaeda's most dangerous members"" was arrested in Yemen, the Yemeni military, an embassy official and state-run news agency Saba said. Mohammed Abdu Saleh al-Haudali, 35, is ""one of the most dangerous terrorists wanted by the security forces,"" according to a Yemeni military Web site, citing a security source. Al-Haudali was arrested Wednesday in the village of Deer Jaber in the Bajel district, northeast of the Yemeni capital of Sanaa, said Mohammed Albasha, spokesman for the Yemen Embassy in Washington. Al-Haudali exchanged fire with security forces before his arrest, Saba reported, citing Hodeidah province security officer Abdul-Wahab al-Radhi. However, the Yemeni military site quoted the security source as saying al-Haudali was caught when he attempted to open fire on authorities. In addition, Albasha told CNN, Mohammed Ali Al-Henk, ""a wanted al Qaeda operative,"" was captured in the Arhab district north of Sanaa. Yemeni air forces have raided al Qaeda hideouts in Sanaa along with Abyan and Shabwa governorates, killing dozens of al Qaeda suspects, Saba reported. It did not say when the raids took place. Following the raids, the Interior Ministry told its offices to raise security alerts and tighten defense procedures nationwide in anticipation of operations, Saba said. The arrests come after a Nigerian man allegedly attempted to detonate an explosive device on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit, Michigan, December 25. Yemen-based Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the attack. Suspect Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab spent time in Yemen, sources have said. His father, Umaru AbdulMutallab, contacted the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria several weeks ago to report his son had ""become radicalized,"" and had gone to Yemen to participate in ""some kind of jihad,"" a family source said. A federal security bulletin obtained by CNN says the explosives used in the incident were obtained in Yemen. A U.S. government official said that between August and October, extremists in Yemen were discussing operations and mentioned a person called ""the Nigerian."" The source said that U.S. intelligence officials also had a partial name for the person: Umar Farouk.","35-year-old described as ""one of the most dangerous terrorists"" in Yemen .

"The first commercial mission to the International Space Station ended Thursday with the SpaceX Dragon capsule splashing down after a flight the company's founder declared a ""grand slam."" The Dragon drifted beneath parachutes to the surface of the Pacific Ocean, about 560 miles off Baja California, on Thursday morning. It hit the water about a mile from its target, SpaceX founder Elon Musk told reporters. ""This has been a fantastic day,"" Musk said, adding, ""I'm just overwhelmed with joy."" He said recovery crews have reached the capsule and report it ""looks really good."" Splashdown came at 8:42 a.m. (11:42 a.m. ET), about two minutes earlier than expected, SpaceX and NASA reported. Musk was on hand at the company's mission control center near Los Angeles as operators monitored the descent, and called the mission a ""grand slam"" in a briefing later Thursday. Splashdown came nine days after it took off on its historic mission, during which it delivered food, clothing, computer equipment and supplies for science experiments to the orbital platform and returned with about 1,300 pounds of cargo -- everything from trash to scientific research and experimental samples. The space station's robotic arm released the Dragon at 5:35 a.m. ET. A thruster burn a minute later pushed the spacecraft away from its host, according to SpaceX, the private company that built and operates the vessel. Alan Lindenmoyer, NASA's head of commercial space systems, said the space agency is waiting to recover the spacecraft's cargo and will review post-flight reports. But he told Musk, ""We became a customer today.""""We've been waiting for this day, and it certainly is a tremendous day,"" Lindenmoyer said. ""We're looking forward now to routine, regular cargo service."" Space analyst Miles O'Brien said the flight was a demonstration of the company's capabilities, and the spacecraft wasn't carrying critical equipment or supplies. ""If none of this cargo had gone up or down, the show would have gone on,"" said O'Brien, a former CNN correspondent. Its next mission, expected later this year, ""will be a for-real cargo with mission-critical items."" ""As time goes on, there will be more important stuff that will go up and down on Dragon,"" he said. The Dragon's re-entry mimicked the way Apollo capsules returned to Earth after putting men on the moon in the 1960s and 1970s, but which fell out of use during the space shuttle era. Recovery divers were waiting on boats just outside the projecting landing area, ready to secure the spacecraft and tow it to a barge with a crane to hoist the space vehicle aboard. SpaceX calls its capsule is ""the only spacecraft capable of returning a significant amount of cargo from the space station,"" saying that other vehicles that deliver cargo to the International Space Station are destroyed after they leave the station. The Dragon is designed to be re-usable and ultimately, to carry as many as seven people into orbit. SpaceX Dragon triumph: Only the beginning . The mission began May 22, when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched the capsule into space from Cape Canaveral, Florida. NASA collaborated with SpaceX on every part of the mission and gave final authorization for the flight. Dragon reached the station Friday and was ""captured"" by the station's robotic arm. The mission, hailed by NASA Administrator Charles Bolden Jr. as a step toward a new future of private innovation in the space industry, comes as government funding of the space program decreases. It also marks the culmination of six years of preparation to bring commercial flights to the space station after the retirement of NASA's space shuttle fleet in 2011, which left the United States with no means of independently sending humans into space. Without the shuttle, NASA relies on the Russian space agency to ferry U.S. astronauts to orbit and has limited capabilities to send supplies to the station and bring them back. Dragon fills a need in taking significant payload back and forth, current ISS astronaut Don Pettit said. NASA: The end of the galaxy as we know it? In December 2008, NASA announced it had chosen SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon to resupply ISS crews after the shuttle's retirement. The $1.6 billion contract involves a minimum of 12 flights, with an option to order more missions for additional cost, according to SpaceX. SpaceX is one of a few of private companies receiving NASA funds to develop the capability for commercial transport of astronauts into space. Musk, who founded the internet service PayPal, has said the commercial program's fixed-price, pay-for-performance contracts make fiscal sense for taxpayers and fosters competition among companies on reliability, capability and cost. Astronaut Joe Acaba, also aboard the space station, called the mission a great first step in the commercialization of spaceflight, and Pettit agreed. ""Commercial spaceflight will blossom due to its own merits, and doesn't really hinge on one mission,"" Pettit said. ""It will hinge on the viability of launching many missions over a long period of time and being able to provide useful commercial goods and services in the low-Earth orbit arena."" SpaceX is now developing a heavy-lift rocket with twice the cargo capability of the space shuttle and hopes to build a spacecraft that could carry a crew to Mars.","""This has been a fantastic day,"" SpaceX founder says .

"(CNN) -- In the physical world, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is a wanted man. In the virtual world, his website is under attack and on the run. There isn't much question that the person who obtained the WikiLeaks cables from a classified U.S. government network broke U.S. law and should expect to face the consequences. The legal rights of a website that publishes material acquired from that person, however, are much more controversial. There are many prominent Americans -- and a great many ordinary Americans -- who have made their views clear over the past week that WikiLeaks' ""cablegate"" website should not be considered constitutionally protected speech.  Others, however, believe equally strongly that now that the material is out, news media and website owners have the right to publish the material. What is troubling and dangerous is that in the internet age, public discourse increasingly depends on digital spaces created, owned and operated by private companies. The result is that one politician has more power than ever to shut down controversial speech unilaterally with one phone call. After suffering aggressive cyber attacks last weekend, Assange removed his ""cablegate"" site from servers in Sweden and purchased a new home for it on Amazon's web hosting service. On Tuesday, Amazon talked on the phone with the office of Sen. Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate's committee on homeland security. Shortly thereafter, Amazon booted WikiLeaks. The senator responded with a statement: ""I wish that Amazon had taken this action earlier based on WikiLeaks' previous publication of classified material. The company's decision to cut off WikiLeaks now is the right decision and should set the standard for other companies WikiLeaks is using to distribute its illegally seized material."" This is not the first time Lieberman has demanded that an American internet company take down controversial material. Last time, the outcome was different. In 2008, Lieberman wrote to Google CEO Eric Schmidt, demanding immediate removal of ""content produced by Islamist terrorist organizations from YouTube.""  While YouTube did remove a few videos that violated community guidelines against violence and hate speech, it refused to remove most of them. Google's lawyers determined that the material Lieberman wanted removed, while upsetting to many Americans, was clearly protected under the First Amendment. ""While we respect and understand [Lieberman's] views, YouTube encourages free speech and defends everyone's right to express unpopular points of view,"" Schmidt wrote in his response. He continued: ""We believe YouTube is a richer and more relevant platform for users precisely because it hosts a diverse range of views, and rather than stifle debate, we allow our users to view all acceptable content and make up their own minds."" The New York Times editorial page chimed in: ""While it is fortunate that Mr. Lieberman does not have the power to tell YouTube that it must remove videos, it is profoundly disturbing that an influential senator would even consider telling a media company to shut down constitutionally protected speech."" Amazon's dumping of WikiLeaks at one senator's request brings into stark relief one of the core problems Americans have grappled with since before our country even existed: Where is the right balance between security, on one hand, and civil liberties, on the other? We have always disagreed passionately. Much of American politics and a large number of constitutional battles center on this question. One might even argue that our political and legal systems are designed to enable this argument to continue indefinitely as new technologies and challenges arise. But the WikiLeaks Amazon case also highlights a new problem for American democracy -- and ultimately for the future of freedom and democracy more globally. A substantial if not critical amount of our political discourse has moved into the digital realm. This realm is largely made up of virtual spaces that are created, owned and operated by the private sector. As far as the law is concerned, Amazon is off the hook. Speech within the kingdom of Amazonia -- run by its sovereign Jeff Bezos and his board of directors with help from the wise counsel and judgment of the company's executives -- is not protected in the same way that speech is constitutionally protected in America's public spaces. The law gives Amazon the right to set its own rules. The company's terms of service clearly state that it ""reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content in its sole discretion."" By clicking ""agree,"" the customer has legally consented to ""represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content,"" and that said content ""will not cause injury to any person or entity."" Given that citizens are increasingly dependent on privately owned spaces for our politics and public discourse, however, the fight over how speech should be governed in a democracy is focused increasingly on questions of how private companies should or shouldn't control speech conducted on and across their networks and platforms. We are facing new questions on which Americans have no clear consensus, and which were not covered in civics class: How will decisions made by private internet and telecommunications companies about what content they will or won't allow affect the ability of citizens to carry out informed debate on important matters of public concern? What are the private sector's obligations and responsibilities to prevent the erosion of democracy? While Amazon was within its legal rights, the company has nonetheless sent a clear signal to its users: If you engage in controversial speech that some individual members of the U.S. government don't like -- even if there is a strong case to be made that your speech is constitutionally protected -- Amazon is going to dump you at the first sign of trouble. Let's hope that there will always be other companies willing to stand up for our rights as enshrined both in the U.S. Constitution and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- and by extension their right to do business with us. The future of freedom in the internet age may well depend on whether we the people can succeed in holding companies that now act as arbiters of the public discourse accountable to the public interest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rebecca MacKinnon.","Rebecca MacKinnon says many differ on whether media should publish WikiLeaks cables .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- The impact of the oil spill in the Gulf Coast is starting to be made vivid by the steady flow of still images and video that capture this catastrophe. For example, Phillippe Cousteau, the grandson of Capt. Jacques-Yves Cousteau, dove into the oil spill, wearing protective gear. He captured horrifying video images of what has been taking place beneath the sea. A debate is already unfolding about whether President Obama has been effective in his response. Is this Obama's Katrina, as some commentators have asked? The president has come under fire, primarily from Republicans, but also from a growing number of environmental advocates, for being too slow to act. Recent news reports have revealed the Obama administration has been as negligent in its oversight of drilling as the previous administration. The debate over President Obama's performance will continue, and his success or failure at stopping the gusher will determine how much damage this disaster inflicts on his presidency. But there is another, more significant, question that Democrats and Republicans in Congress must address -- and that is the policy origins of this disaster. Indeed, one of the most important aspects of Katrina was not simply how President Bush did or did not handle the aftermath of the hurricane, but rather, how American politicians in both parties had allowed a once-vibrant city to decay so dramatically over the past decades. Many Americans were shocked to see the kind of devastating poverty in which so many New Orleans residents lived. With the BP spill, the question revolves around deregulation. As with the financial meltdown in the fall 2008, the oil spill highlights the cost of weakening regulations -- in this case, those rules that had been adopted to safeguard the environment. For over four decades, some conservatives and centrist Democrats have waged war on the environmental infrastructure that was put into place during the 1960s and 1970s (including under Republican President Nixon). At first, President Reagan hoped to directly overturn as many environmental regulations as possible. He appointed James Watt as secretary of Interior and Anne Gorsuch as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, both of whom opposed many aspects of the environmental movement. Yet Reagan's efforts to eliminate the regulatory apparatus largely failed. He ran up against an environmental movement that was far more powerful than he expected. His efforts against the regulations in fact stimulated the movement to become even more active. The next strategy for his administration was to start weakening oversight, using administrative decisions to protect industry and undermine the quality of the agencies responsible for these programs. Watt and Gorsuch, for example, didn't fight against proposed budget cuts that would clearly strain the capacity of their employees and accepted cost-benefit analyses that favored industry. Gorsuch boasted that under her leadership, the EPA reduced the size of the clean water regulations manual from six inches to half an inch The EPA didn't make sure that companies were complying with regulations such as requirements to use modern pollution control equipment. This pattern continued under President George W. Bush. As the contributors of my forthcoming book, ""The Presidency of George W. Bush: The First Historical Assessment (Princeton University Press)"" have argued, Bush administration officials frequently rejected scientific expertise when making decisions and staffed bureaucratic positions with people who were not sympathetic to the goals of their own organization. The Minerals Management Service is a poster child for the effects of these policies. This MMS, which had the responsibility of monitoring these oil rigs, has been rendered ineffective. Engineers have dominated decision-making over the scientists. When some U.S. policymakers were insisting on the use of a better shut-off mechanism a few years ago, the MMS, convinced by the complaints of the oil industry, rejected their proposals. Congressional hearings recently revealed that the agency let industry officials complete their own inspection forms. They also accepted gifts from the companies they were supposed to be monitoring. Though he ran on a campaign of change, President Obama's administration has essentially allowed this deregulatory strategy to continue. Not long before the spill, Obama had announced his support for an expansion of offshore drilling. According to The New York Times, that announcement caught even oil industry officials by surprise. They were expecting new restrictions, and after the spill, the Times reported, the government continued to give environmental waivers to Gulf oil drilling projects. Even worse, it has done so for projects using the same kind of techniques that were used by BP in the Gulf.  Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar has come under fire as well for suggesting that his agency did not envision any major change in oil and gas production. Even some Republicans are slowly rethinking the consequences of deregulation in this area. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, desperate for the help of the government that he has so often derided, has complained that the president has not done enough. Jindal's spokesman said that ""while BP is the responsible party, the federal government needs to ensure that they are indeed held accountable and responsible ..."" June 11 would have been Jacques Cousteau's 100th birthday. Certainly Cousteau would be weeping if he could see the kind of damage that is being caused by the spill. President Obama must not only stop this immediate leak, but must be certain to fix the policies that allowed this kind of risky drilling to take place. This does not just entail putting new rules on the books but also making sure they will be enforced. Only then can the government diminish the risk of this happening again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer.","For decades, some have argued for deregulating industries such as the oil industry .
Julian Zelizer says lax regulations helped set the stage for the massive Gulf oil spill .
He says Obama administration had largely followed Bush administration in lax regulation .

"(CNN) -- MTV's ""Teen Mom"" Amber Portwood faces felony domestic violence charges in her Indiana hometown because of incidents on her reality TV show -- where she is seen shoving, punching, slapping and choking her boyfriend, a police spokesman said. Two of the three charges are felonies because the couple's 1-year-old child apparently witnessed the violence, according to Anderson, Indiana police spokesman Mitch Carroll. The charges were outlined in a probable cause affidavit filed by police, but Portwood, 20, will not be arrested until the Madison County, Indiana, prosecutor files formal charges, Carroll said. The investigation began seven weeks ago after MTV aired an episode of the reality series ""Teen Mom"" showing incidents captured over the summer, he said. Gary Shirley, the 24-year-old boyfriend, and Portwood gave statements to police last month admitting to the incidents, he said. ""According to police documents, on August 14, 2009, Portwood shoved Shirley against a wall, slapped him on the face and choked him,"" Carroll said. ""The incident was witnessed by the couple's 1-year-old child who sat in a child seat on a nearby bed."" Another incident, captured by cameras in June, showed Portwood ""slapping Shirley five times, punching him three times and kicking him at least once,"" he said. A July videotaped incident showed Portwood ""in the presence of their child slapping Shirley in the face, and punching him several more times in the face and upper-body,"" the police spokesman said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The political furor escalated over President Obama's high-profile rebuke of a recent Supreme Court ruling on campaign advertising Thursday, as Democrats pounded the high court decision. Democrats rallied around Obama the day after the president committed a rare breach of political etiquette, criticizing the controversial ruling in his State of the Union address as members of the high court sat only a few feet away. That triggered something equally unusual. Justice Samuel Alito, a conservative backer of the ruling, frowned and appeared to mouth the words ""not true."" Alito's apparent reply was a rare flash of emotion among Supreme Court justices who typically sit stony faced and refrain from even clapping during State of the Union speeches. The actions of both men may be unprecedented, according to one longtime court observer. The court's 5-4 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, issued last week, removed long-established legal barriers preventing corporations and unions from spending unlimited sums of money to influence voters in political campaigns. Democrats fear the decision has given the traditionally pro-business GOP a powerful new advantage. ""With all due deference to separation of powers, last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates for special interests -- including foreign corporations -- to spend without limit in our elections,"" Obama told a packed House of Representatives chamber Wednesday night. ""I don't think American elections should be bankrolled by America's most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people. And I'd urge Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to correct some of these problems."" Alito, part of the court's conservative majority, could be seen apparently frowning and quietly mouthing the words ""not true."" Supreme Court justices rarely express any hint of emotion or opinion during the president's State of the Union speech. On the Senate floor Thursday morning, Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said the ruling ""goes to the very core of our democracy and it will allow major corporations -- who should have law written to control their effect on America -- instead control America. That is not the America I grew up in."" Leahy, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, ripped Alito for what he claimed was hypocrisy in preaching the virtues of judicial restraint while backing a decision overturning decades of legal precedent. ""In his confirmation hearing, Justice Alito ... testified that the role of the Supreme Court is a limited role,"" Leahy said. ""That was then when he was seeking confirmation. This is now."" A spokesman for the high court had no comment when reached by CNN. Read the Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. FEC . Vice President Joe Biden, appearing Thursday on ABC's ""Good Morning America,"" argued Obama ""didn't question the integrity of the court. He questioned the judgment of it."" Biden called the decision ""outrageous"" and said ""we have to correct it."" Most Republicans have defended the ruling, calling it a long overdue recognition of First Amendment rights. Former Federal Election Commission Chairman Bradley Smith, who supports the ruling, called Obama's remarks the act of ""a fairly desperate president who's trying to remake himself."" In the process, Smith claimed, Obama is ""willing to essentially say things that are not true."" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters he thought ""calling out the Supreme Court when they're sitting right there trying to impassively listen ... was a little over the top."" Lyle Denniston, a writer for the Web site Scotusblog.com who has covered the Supreme Court for five decades, told CNN he could not recall ever seeing a president rebuke the high court in such a high-profile forum. But Alito's apparent reaction, he argued, was ""quite inappropriate."" Obama ""was talking about the consequences of the opinion,"" Denniston said. Once the justices issue a decision, ""they really need to let the political branches or the people deal with it as they will."" Jeffrey Toobin: Alito's reaction was fair . Denniston noted that Justice John Paul Stevens, the longest-serving current member of the high court, never attends State of the Union addresses. Attending such a speech, Denniston said, involves the justices in a ""political circus"" that can damage a justice's image of impartiality. CNN's Ted Barrett, Mark Bixler and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Democrats rallied around Obama after his criticism of ruling during State of the Union speech .

"(CNN) -- British TV host Piers Morgan will take over Larry King's prime-time hour with ""a candid, in-depth newsmaker interview program"" starting in January, CNN announced Wednesday. Morgan, best known to American viewers as a judge on NBC's ""America's Got Talent,"" has most recently hosted ""Piers Morgan's Life Stories"" on television in the United Kingdom. ""Piers has made his name posing tough questions to public figures, holding them accountable for their words and deeds,"" said CNN-US President Jon Klein. ""He is able to look at all aspects of the news with style and humor with an occasional good laugh in the process."" Morgan's show, which was not named in the CNN news release, will air live on CNN-US at 9 p.m. ET and will air worldwide on CNN-International in more than 200 countries, the network said. Morgan will be based in New York, but also will work from Los Angeles and London, CNN said. King announced this summer that he was stepping aside from CNN's ""Larry King Live,"" a show he began hosting in 1985. ""I have watched 'Larry King Live' for much of the last 25 years, and dreamed of one day filling the legendary suspenders of the man I consider to be the greatest TV interviewer of them all,"" Morgan said. Morgan, 45, began his journalism career as a newspaper reporter in the United Kingdom for The Wimbledon News. In 1994, when he was 28, Morgan became the youngest editor ever at Rupert Murdoch's News of the World. He moved to the Daily Mirror as editor-in-chief in 1995, a post he held for nine years. He left the Mirror under a cloud of controversy in 2004, after the publication of photos purported to be of abused Iraqi prisoners. The newspaper later acknowledged the images were faked, saying it was the victim of a hoax. Morgan went on to become a television personality, hosting interview programs on the BBC and ITV. Simon Cowell hired Morgan as on a judge on the top-rated ""Britain's Got Talent."" His print journalism career continued beyond the Mirror, including a monthly interview column for GQ magazine. Morgan also writes two regular columns for the Mail on Sunday newspaper, which he will continue. In addition, he will provide regular columns to CNN.com, the network said.","Morgan ""made his name posing tough questions to public figures,"" CNN-US chief says .

"(CNN) -- HLN's Nancy Grace announced on her program Monday night that she had surgery to remove a solid mass that doctors had feared could be cancer. The operation last Tuesday, which Grace said took ""hours and hours,'' revealed that the mass was not malignant, she said. Speaking by phone to substitute host Jean Casarez of In Session, Grace said she is recovering at home with her husband, David, and their 3-year-old twins, John David and Lucy Elizabeth. A nurse administering an ultrasound test to Grace during a routine gynecologist visit discovered the growth, Grace said. Grace had felt no symptoms and scheduled the appointment based on ""a hunch,'' she said. During the ultrasound, the nurse called in the doctor who looked at the results and said he wanted to speak to Grace in his office. ""He was very calm and very honest and he told me they had discovered a mass,'' Grace said. When the doctor said it could be cancer, Grace described it as ""that moment you see in movies and you hear about that always happens to somebody else but not to you."" Surgery was scheduled for a few days later at Northside Hospital in the Atlanta, Georgia, area. ""It seemed like the world just stopped because you know when you wait a long time for happiness...it always just feels like it could be taken away,'' she said, referring to her marriage and the birth of her children. ""I think what bothered me most was thinking about watching the twins on the other side of life and seeing them grow up without a mother,'' Grace said. ""And I think about it so many times on our show because we have stories of children who endured so much and don't have anybody to love them."" Saying she was ""the lucky one,'' Grace urged women to make appointments for routine exams even if they feel fine. The former Fulton County, Georgia, prosecutor and Court TV host joined the HLN prime-time lineup in February 2005. Grace said she hopes to return to work next Monday.","An ultrasound test discovered the growth, Grace says .

"Washington (CNN) -- A suspect in an alleged Russian spy ring was arrested Tuesday in Cyprus a day after 10 other suspects in the case were arrested in the United States. Robert Christopher Metsos was arrested at Larnaca airport in Cyprus after an Interpol ""red notice"" was served on him for suspected espionage and money laundering, Cypriot police told CNN. Authorities in Washington were being notified so extradition proceedings can begin, police said. Metsos, 55, is free after paying 20,000 euros (about $24,000) in cash as bail, but he is not allowed to leave the country, police said. Metsos received money from a Russian agent and buried it in a park in northern Virginia, according to a court document. Two other suspects later showed up at the park to dig up the money, the document said. The Justice Department announced Monday that 10 people were arrested on charges of being Russian agents involved in a long-term mission in the country. Five of the arrested suspects appeared in a New York courtroom Monday. Four of the five, including a longtime U.S.-based columnist for the Spanish-language El Diario newspaper, were advised of their rights and ordered held due to flight risk, with their next hearing scheduled for July 1. The other defendant, identified in a court document as Anna Chapman, was denied bail, and her next hearing was scheduled for July 27. The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement the arrests are ""unfounded and have unseemly goals."" ""We do not understand the reasons why the U.S. Department of Justice has made a public statement in the spirit of the Cold War,"" said the statement, posted on the ministry's website. ""Such incidents have occurred in the past, when our relations were on the rise. In any case it is regrettable that all these things are happening on the background of the 'reset' in Russian-U.S. relations announced by the U.S. administration."" Asked about the incident Tuesday in an appearance with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman in Jerusalem, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, ""We still have not received an explanation. ... I am hopeful we will get an explanation."" He said the timing of the announcement was significant but did not elaborate. Asked about the matter again following the news conference with Lieberman, Lavrov said, ""I have already said everything."" Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Farbiarz said search warrants in the case were being executed ""across the country."" He called the initial criminal complaint ""the tip of the iceberg."" ""These people are trained together,"" Farbiarz said of the defendants. ""At the core of this is deception."" Separate hearings for the other detained suspects were expected later Monday in other states. A Russian Embassy spokesman said Monday that he was unaware of the reports of the arrests, and said he was seeking more information from Russian officials. The suspects were ""trained Russian intelligence operatives,"" a Justice Department spokesman said, and information from court documents alleged they were part of a mission to plant ""deep-cover"" agents in the United States. The Justice Department said the 10 people arrested and another person not yet in custody were supposed to recruit intelligence agents, but were not directly involved in obtaining U.S. secrets themselves. All were charged with acting as agents of a foreign government, and nine also were charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering. The charges include conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government without notifying the U.S. attorney general, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison, the Justice Department said. Conspiracy to commit money laundering has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The case resulted from a ""multiyear investigation"" conducted by the FBI, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Justice Department's National Security Division, according to a Justice Department statement. The 11 suspects were charged in two separate criminal complaints. Last week, President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev spoke of strengthened ties between the former Cold War foes after their meeting at the White House. However, court documents and Justice Department officials described a Russian intelligence operation straight out of a 1950s spy novel. According to the court documents, some of the suspects adopted phony identities, including those of dead Americans, and posed as married couples. The suspects engaged in secret communications including exchanges of bags, money drops and use of invisible ink, as well as more modern touches such as private wireless computer networks between specific laptops, the documents said. A decrypted message from Moscow to two of the suspects said they were sent to the United States for ""long-term service,"" one of the documents said. ""Your education, bank accounts, car, house, etc. -- all these serve one goal: fulfill your main mission, i.e, to search and develop ties in policymaking circles in U.S. and send intels (intelligence reports),"" the document said. The Russian operation was believed to date back to the 1990s, the court document said. It added that the FBI conducted extensive electronic surveillance of the suspects for years, including secretly recording and videotaping them and surreptitiously entering residences to take photographs and copy documents. One of the suspects is Vicky Pelaez, a columnist for ""El Diario"" for more than 20 years covering politics, immigration and other issues, her lawyer confirmed. Pelaez is married to Juan Lazaro, another of the suspects arrested Monday, and the couple resided in Yonkers, a New York suburb. Pelaez, Lazaro, Chapman and two other suspects -- identified as Richard Murphy and Cynthia Murphy -- appeared in the New York courtroom. The other suspects were identified in court documents as Donald Howard Heathfield, Tracey Lee Ann Foley, Michael Zottoli, Patricia Mills and Mikhail Semenko. Another suspect, Christopher R. Metsos, was still being sought. Semenko and Chapman allegedly conducted the private wireless computer links to communicate with a Russian government official, one court document alleged. In one instance, Chapman was in a bookshop and the Russian government official drove by in a van to make the wireless connection, the document said. Another document described alleged efforts to secretly get money to the suspects to fund their clandestine activities, including money drops involving exchanged bags in public places and other subterfuge. In one incident, Metsos, the suspect still at large, received money from a Russian agent and buried it in a park in northern Virginia, the document said. Mills and Zottoli later showed up at the park to dig up the money, the document said. CNN's Jill Dougherty, Carol Jordan, Michael Schwartz and Arkady Irshenko contributed to this report.","NEW: Man arrested at Cyprus airport after Interpol alert .

"Little Rock, Arkansas (CNN) -- In the shadow of the William Jefferson Clinton Presidential Library, an ironic occurrence is taking shape. As the former two-term president traverses the country, rallying support for Democrats facing tough electoral prospects, his party is bracing for severe losses in his home state of Arkansas. Embattled two-term Sen. Blanche Lincoln faces a bleak outlook in her bid for re-election, while Reps. Vic Snyder and Marion Berry are opting to retire, opening the door to Republican takeovers of their seats. A Republican and a Democrat are in Arkansas' two other congressional districts, and they're considered safe for the incumbent parties. Democrats here in Arkansas and elsewhere in the South are buffeted by constituent anger toward President Obama and his legislative initiatives like health care reform and the stimulus, regardless of how they voted on the issues. Arkansas supported John McCain over Obama in the 2008 election by more than 20 percent. Lincoln is portraying herself as a Capitol Hill power broker who can easily maneuver between the two parties, touting her independence while also proud to be the Senate's deciding vote in support of health care reform. ""Without a doubt, they identify so clearly with the problem that exists in Washington, where you have Democrats in one foxhole and Republicans in another, and very few people like myself who are willing to come onto the battlefield and look for the common ground,"" Lincoln told CNN at a campaign stop in North Little Rock. According to an analysis by CNN, there are 62 Democrats in Southern states facing re-election this cycle, all House members except for Lincoln. Nearly half of those, 28, are considered in jeopardy. These members consist mostly of white men whose districts went for McCain over Obama. ""I don't think Southern Democrats are in danger,"" Snyder said. ""I think this is a very robust election year in a battleground state in battleground congressional districts. And are we at risk of losing elections in battleground districts? You always are in a robust election year."" Snyder also takes a pragmatic view of the fierce competition in the old Confederacy, believing that a thriving democracy, while not a cure-all, is the best medicine. ""This is one of those periods of American history that are very important. When the intensity and challenges facing our country are great, the intensity is on different sides. And that's why democracy works."" Arkansas has bucked the trend among Southern states by electing Democrats to all seven statewide offices and giving them control of both legislative chambers. And despite a public sentiment leaning toward Republican candidates, incumbent Democratic Gov. Mike Bebee appears to be coasting to victory. Republicans in this state are anxious for change, though they admit it might take longer than the election on November 2. ""We're seeing the same trend down ballot. Obviously, the governor's race will be a challenge, but we're seeing a flip all the way down the ticket. Things will go from blue to red like this state has never seen before,"" said Alice Stewart, spokeswoman for the Arkansas Republican Party. Observers agree that Democrats will probably retain control of both the Arkansas House and Senate, but with much slimmer majorities. One reason for the slow change: tradition. ""There is a tradition at the lower level, that my granddaddy was a Democrat, my great-granddaddy, so I'm going to be one too,"" said Max Brantley, editor of the Arkansas Times. And the Democrats selected by voters tend to be a mix of moderate and conservative on economic and social policy. ""The local officials have not been Democrats recognizable as Democrats to a national Democrat in New York. They are liberals by no means."" Brantley is not prepared to predict a dramatic realignment in the electorate, but he believes Arkansas is finally catching up to the rest of the South by electing more Republicans, regardless of the help provided by favorite son Clinton, who has come to the state three times this year to campaign for Lincoln. ""Bill Clinton's great, and he is great in enthusing the base. But he's not going to decide the election. It's good that he's out there, because he's more popular than Barack Obama. But he can't turn the voter tide."" The question of whether Arkansas triples the number of Republicans it sends to Washington won't be decided until Election Day, but Dr Janine Parry of the University of Arkansas urges caution in reading too much into what a potential electoral switch means. ""One election does not a pattern make,"" Parry said. ""But then of course, political scientists declare a pattern 10 years after everyone else has already declared.""

"(CNN) -- Ken Savage says that, at first, he welcomed his wife's new interest in Facebook. She had recently recovered from a bout with depression and dependence on prescription drugs, and he thought reconnecting with old friends would help get her out of her rut. But he says he became increasingly suspicious of her social networking activity when she began hiding her computer screen when he entered the room. Savage soon discovered his wife was using the site to meet up with an old boyfriend -- an increasingly common occurrence as more and more adults join Facebook. Savage, 38, of Lowell, Massachusetts, is the creator of FacebookCheating.com, a website he started in 2009 shortly after he discovered his wife's affair in an effort ""to help others cope with someone cheating on them as well as shine light upon someone who is using Facebook to cheat."" A recent survey by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers found that 81 percent of divorce attorneys have seen an increase in the number of cases using social networking evidence during the past five years. More than 66 percent of those attorneys said the No. 1 site most often used as evidence is Facebook with its 400 million registered users. Another recent survey by Divorce-Online.co.uk of more than 5,000 divorce petitions says Facebook is mentioned in about 20 percent of divorce cases. ""As everyone continues to share more and more aspects of their lives on social networking sites, they leave themselves open to much greater examinations of both their public and private lives in these sensitive situations,"" Marlene Eskind Moses, president of the AAML, said in a statement of the survey's results. Savage, who says he has nothing against Facebook and uses it regularly to connect with childhood friends, told HLN's ""Prime News"" Wednesday that the networking site is simply ""a tool for an affair."" He says that if there is trouble within a marriage or a relationship, ""the affair's going to happen anyway,"" but Facebook ""makes it much easier."" Andrew Noyes, a spokesman for Facebook, says the website is not responsible for breaking up marriages. ""It's ludicrous to suggest that Facebook leads to divorce and we would suggest that anyone who purports to have conducted surveys about the topic also ask respondents about other popular communication channels, such as text messaging, chat sites and email, before jumping to conclusions,"" Noyes said. Stacey Kaiser, a psychotherapist and relationship expert, says she estimates Facebook plays a much larger factor in divorces. ""It's not just your everyday affair,"" Kaiser told ""Prime News."" ""When it comes to something like Facebook, you are reconnecting with a long-lost love. All those teenage feelings, those college feelings come back again, you feel young again, and it drives you to do something you don't normally do."" Savage, who is separated and living apart from his wife, says communication with your spouse is key to keeping your Facebook page as a place to network, not coordinate illicit rendezvous. ""In the beginning when we first got on Facebook, we would openly talk"" about shared friends' new babies and other milestones posted on the site, Savage told HLN. ""When it got real quiet, that was the problem,"" he said. Brenda Wade, a clinical therapist whose self-proclaimed mission is to cut the divorce rate by half, says the mistake most couples make is placing priorities on material things rather than partnership. ""We need to put that energy, that time, that money into the relationship,"" she told ""Prime News."" ""That's where you want to feel the excitement and the rush.""","NEW: Facebook responds to the idea of social-networking sites leading to divorces .

"Crews have found the bodies of the Turkish pilots killed in last month's downing of their jet by Syria, an incident that prompted an outbreak of hostile rhetoric between the two nations that continued Wednesday. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, in an interview published in the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet Wednesday, lambasted Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan for interfering in Syrian internal politics. And Turkey's foreign minister disputed some of al-Assad's assertions Tuesday about the downing of the jet. Syria shot down the F-4 Turkish Phantom jet on June 22, intensifying the animosity between the countries, whose once-close relationship has eroded since the al-Assad regime begain cracking down on opposition forces 16 months ago. ""We would never allow outsiders to interfere in our affairs,"" al-Assad told the newspaper. ""This initial desire to interfere in our internal affairs, unfortunately, made Turkey a party in all the bloody activities in the later process. Turkey has supplied all kinds of logistic support to the terrorists who kill our people."" Al-Assad: I wish the Turkish jet shootdown didn't happen . Al-Assad accused Erdogan of ""acting with sectarian impulses."" Most of the populations of Turkey and Syria are Sunni, but the al-Assad regime is dominated by Alawites, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Erdogan, whose government is hosting anti-Assad opposition groups and thousands of Syrian refugees fleeing Syria's violence, wants ""terrorists to be free in Syria,"" al-Assad said, asserting that the prime minister is ""very excited about the Muslim Brotherhood movement in Syria"" -- a Sunni movement. ""The impulse to help and defend Muslim Brotherhood constituted the real starting point and basis of the Syria policy that Erdogan has been following,"" al-Assad said, accusing the Turkish prime minister of a setting a double standard in his foreign policies. ""For example, why does he cry for the Syrian people in a hypocritical way but (is) not crying for those killed in the Gulf countries?"" he asked. ""Why doesn't he meddle with the democracy problems of those countries?"" Al-Assad's published comments came as the Turkish military reported finding the bodies of the two Turkish pilots of the downed jet. The bodies of Capt. Gokhan Ertan and First Lt. Hasan Huseyin were ""found at the bottom"" of the Mediterranean Sea, ""shot by Syria in the international waters,"" the military said in a statement. Turkish crews were working to retrieve the bodies, the military said. In the first installment of the interview with the Syrian president, published Tuesday in Cumhuriyet, al-Assad expressed regret over the plane incident. He said his soldiers had thought it was an Israeli warplane. ""The Turkish people are our brothers and something that would make them sad would never make me happy and it did not. If this was an Israeli plane, of course, I would have been happy,"" he said. The plane was using the same flight corridor that Israeli planes had used three times before, he said. ""Since we couldn't see it on our radars and no information was given either, the soldiers downed it. We learned that it belonged to Turkey after shooting it down."" But Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in an interview with the Turkish newspaper, asked, ""How many times have they fired at an Israeli plane before? Moreover, they are legally at war with Israel. That they launched such an attack on our plane even when no such attack has been launched against an Israeli plane shows that they do not have any goodwill towards us."" Davutoglu also disputed al-Assad on the radar claim. ""Either the Syrian air defense is not as powerful as he claims or what he says is a clear lie.  As soon as our plane takes off from Malatya, all the countries in the area can monitor the movements of it. This is not a secret but an open mission, and the profile of the flight is one that can be monitored by countries even with the simplest airspace systems. It is also wrong that they say they couldn't determine its identity because we also have records that they identified it. ""They say we would not shoot it down if we knew it was a Turkish plane. Let's say they didn't know the RF-4 was a Turkish plane, then why did they open fire on the Casa plane that was going for help? It was obvious that it was coming from Turkey,"" he said. Turkey scrambles jets as Syrian choppers near border . Davutoglu said he agreed with just one of the comments made by al-Assad in the Tuesday interview. ""That is when he says, 'If I knew it would be for the good of my country, I wouldn't stay even for a day.' That is very correct and he should do what this requires as soon as possible. He should not stay there even for a day,"" Davutoglu said. Meanwhile, at least 70 people -- including 10 children and three women -- were killed Wednesday in Syria, opposition activists said. The carnage has spiked in recent days, with at least 109 people killed Sunday, 114 people Monday and 71 Tuesday, opposition activists said. The regime maintains it is fighting against ""armed terrorist groups."" Opposition activists and many world leaders say regime forces have been attacking cities nationwide in an attempt to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. His family has ruled Syria for more than 40 years. This week, Syrian authorities ""stormed terrorists dens"" in the Homs countryside and seized a warehouse containing explosive devices, the state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported Wednesday. CNN cannot independently confirm the reports of casualties or violence because Syria restricts access by international journalists. Syrian opposition leaders who have been meeting in Cairo said they support the rebel Free Syrian Army and oppose negotiations with the al-Assad regime. They said they believe U.N. and Arab League envoy Kofi Annan's six-point peace plan needs to be strengthened so it can be executed effectively. The opposition supports Annan's plan in theory, but say it has to be improved. That sentiment comes on the heels of a plan laid out by global diplomats in Geneva over the weekend that called for a transitional government to be established. According to the plan, backed by Russia and China as well as the West, such a government ""could include members of the present government and the opposition and other groups and shall be formed on the basis of mutual consent."" The Syrian Foreign Ministry issued a statement of general support for the plan, but didn't address the transitional government issue. ""We have noticed the vagueness of several points in the final document, which need explanation,"" the ministry said. ""However, since the participants adhere to the fact that the Syrian population alone is the final decision maker with regards to its future with no foreign intervention, then all matters are negotiable in a national dialogue."" More than 14,000 people -- most of them civilians -- have been killed since the Syrian uprising began 16 months ago, opposition groups said. A spokesman for the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Wednesday that the group had tallied the total killed at 16,757. Of them, 11,657 were civilians, 4,227 were members of the military or security forces and 873 were defectors or members of the opposition Free Syrian Army, said Rami Abdulrahman, the spokesman.

"(CNN) -- South African Dr. Sonnet Ehlers was on call one night four decades ago when a devastated rape victim walked in. Her eyes were lifeless; she was like a breathing corpse. ""She looked at me and said, 'If only I had teeth down there,'"" recalled Ehlers, who was a 20-year-old medical researcher at the time. ""I promised her I'd do something to help people like her one day."" Forty years later, Rape-aXe was born. Ehlers is distributing the female condoms in the various South African cities where the World Cup soccer games are taking place. The woman inserts the latex condom like a tampon. Jagged rows of teeth-like hooks line its inside and attach on a man's penis during penetration, Ehlers said. Once it lodges, only a doctor can remove it -- a procedure Ehlers hopes will be done with authorities on standby to make an arrest. ""It hurts, he cannot pee and walk when it's on,"" she said. ""If he tries to remove it, it will clasp even tighter... however, it doesn't break the skin, and there's no danger of fluid exposure."" Ehlers said she sold her house and car to launch the project, and she planned to distribute 30,000 free devices under supervision during the World Cup period. ""I consulted engineers, gynecologists and psychologists to help in the design and make sure it was safe,"" she said. After the trial period, they'll be available for about $2 a piece. She hopes the women will report back to her. ""The ideal situation would be for a woman to wear this when she's going out on some kind of blind date ... or to an area she's not comfortable with,"" she said. The mother of two daughters said she visited prisons and talked to convicted rapists to find out whether such a device would have made them rethink their actions. Some said it would have, Ehlers said. Critics say the female condom is not a long-term solution and makes women vulnerable to more violence from men trapped by the device. It's also a form of ""enslavement,"" said Victoria Kajja, a fellow for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the east African country of Uganda. ""The fears surrounding the victim, the act of wearing the condom in anticipation of being assaulted all represent enslavement that no woman should be subjected to."" Kajja said the device constantly reminds women of their vulnerability. ""It not only presents the victim with a false sense of security, but psychological trauma,"" she added. ""It also does not help with the psychological problems that manifest after assaults."" However, its one advantage is it allows justice to be served, she said. Various rights organizations that work in South Africa declined to comment, including Human Rights Watch and Care International. South Africa has one of the highest rape rates in the world, Human Rights Watch says on its website. A 2009 report by the nation's Medical Research Council found that 28 percent of men surveyed had raped a woman or girl, with one in 20 saying they had raped in the past year, according to Human Rights Watch. In most African countries, rape convictions are not common. Affected women don't get immediate access to medical care, and DNA tests to provide evidence are unaffordable. ""Women and girls who experience these violations are denied justice, factors that contribute to the normalization of rape and violence in South African society,"" Human Rights Watch says. Women take drastic measures to prevent rape in South Africa, Ehlers said, with some wearing extra tight biker shorts and others inserting razor blades wrapped in sponges in their private parts. Critics have accused her of developing a medieval device to fight rape. ""Yes, my device may be a medieval, but it's for a medieval deed that has been around for decades,"" she said. ""I believe something's got to be done ... and this will make some men rethink before they assault a woman.""","Doctor distributes anti-rape female condom during World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of the U.S. diplomatic cables obtained and published by WikiLeaks cover a worldwide phenomenon that has been persistently troubling to the United States: drug trafficking. And those cables come not just from Mexico City, but from many corners of the world -- including Cuba and several embassies in West Africa. Perhaps most revealing is the cooperation between the United States and Cuba over trafficking through Jamaica. A cable from August 2009 talks about multiple contacts between the U.S. Coast Guard and Cuban Interior Ministry. The Cubans were complaining that Jamaican smugglers were using ""both Cuban airspace and waters to transport narcotics ultimately destined for the United States, but their repeated attempts to engage Jamaica on the issue have been ignored."" Cuban officials had shown one plane to a U.S. Coast Guard official. On their way to a rendezvous in Bahamian waters, the crew had made an emergency landing after allegedly dumping 13 bales of marijuana in a rural area of Cuba. In another case, information from the U.S. Coast Guard helped the Cuban Border Guard intercept a vessel carrying 700 kilograms of marijuana. The cable says that Cuban officials ""collectively and continually ... express frustration over the GOJ's [Jamaica's] consistent ignoring of Cuban attempts to increase the flow"" of drug-related information between the two island nations to increase interdictions and avoid ""being surprised by drugs."" Despite translating information on boat and aircraft movements from Spanish to English, Cuban officials said their Jamaican counterparts rarely took action. But the Cubans were not about to give their ideological enemy a free pass. ""GOC [Cuban] officials ultimately blame the United States for this problem due to the high demand for illicit narcotics by United States consumers,"" concludes the cable. There seems as much concern about narcotics trafficking on the other side of the Atlantic, with Ghana becoming a focus. One cable from last year even reports the request of Ghanaian President John Atta Mills that screening devices be used for senior officials leaving the country ""to avoid any surprises if they are caught carrying drugs."" ""The President told the Ambassador that he knows elements of his government are already compromised and that officials at the airport tipped off drug traffickers about operations there,"" according to another cable from 2009. But the cable notes that previous scanning devices, known as itemizers, deployed to the VIP lounge at Accra airport had been sabotaged. It quotes one British official involved in combatting drugs in West Africa as saying ""the filters were removed."" ""He noted that the cost of maintenance on the itemizers is less than the cost of diverting flights on which passengers suffer drug overdoses. Within the last few months ... KLM has diverted to Spain two flights from Accra to Amsterdam because passengers started vomiting drugs. In both cases, the passenger died."" Another cable notes that the Ghanaian police had ""lost a large amount of drugs kept in their possession that was to be used as evidence in future trials."" The United States was building a secure room at police headquarters in which to store evidence. But there had also been some successes. One day last year, a container that had arrived at the Ghanaian port of Tema marked as ""chewing gum"" raised the suspicion of customs officers ""because it originated in Ecuador rather than the Far East, as usual."" They opened the container and found 71 kilograms of cocaine. Last year, three men were extradited from Ghana to face trial in New York for alleged links to Islamic extremists and drug traffickers, the ""unholy alliance"" that concerns U.S., United Nations and European officials in West Africa. Two were from Mali, which also comes under scrutiny in the leaked cables. One, from February this year, covers the history of an ancient Boeing 727 variously registered in Saudi Arabia and Guinea-Bissau that had somehow become stranded at a desert airstrip in northern Mali in October 2009. Not much surprise in that, as its airworthiness certificate had long ago expired. But that had not prevented someone from flying it across the Atlantic between Colombia and a dried-up lake bed in northern Mali, according to officials from Guinea-Bissau quoted in the cable. Just what the plane was carrying, and who was operating it, was still a mystery months after the crash because ""not even the Drug Brigade of the Malian Judiciary Investigation Police was allowed to make inquiries"" -- and the regional U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime was not informed of whatever investigation was carried out. Another cable from July of last year demonstrates the widespread concern of diplomats in West Africa about ""the institutionalization of drug and criminality in several West African countries, especially along the coast."" One British diplomat ""indicated that the UK has a good understanding about how the drugs arrive to West Africa, but not how they go North from there and how they are related to terrorist issues."" At the same meeting, a U.S. diplomat expressed concern that ""Hizbollah networks in West Africa might tap into the drug trade due to its high levels of profit."" The Lebanese guerrilla movement has established connections in West Africa and South America, according to drug enforcement sources.","Cubans complained to Jamaica about drug smuggling .

"(CNN) -- It's unlikely that you've heard of PJ King, despite the fact that he's about to set himself apart from most humans who've ever walked the planet. In as soon as 18 months, King could be launching into space as a paying commercial space tourist. King, a 41-year-old Irish businessman, is one of hundreds of travelers who've signed up and trained to be among the first paying passengers aboard Virgin Galactic's trips to suborbital space -- 62 miles above the Earth. ""One of the reasons I'm doing this is precisely because I want these things to be ordinary,"" King said. ""Part of the problem with space travel is that it is special."" King believes the $200,000 he and other passengers pay for a seat on a Virgin Galactic spacecraft will help create a new future when ""flights like this are happening every week, when lots of people go, and the cost has been massively reduced due to the economics of scale."" Prices are coming down, even before space tourism has started taking off. Russia charges private travelers $40 million to ride on its Soyuz spacecraft and spend a few days aboard the international space station. For a much shorter journey, Virgin Galactic wants $200,000 for a flight to suborbital space. But Space Adventures advertises suborbital trips for about half that price: $102,000. King says he knows people who've taken out mortgages to buy their spacecraft tickets. The plunging prices are opening doors to consumers which have been all but closed for half a century to everyone except ""right stuff"" supermen and superwomen with names like John Glenn, Neil Armstrong and Sally Ride. ""I believe in this,"" King said. ""This is not a just a bunch of rich people going into space for fun."" About 360 paying passengers have signed up to be among Virgin Galactic's first travelers, CEO George Whitesides said. After the initial launches, he expects that number to grow to thousands and tens of thousands. ""That's a fundamental shift,"" he said. ""A whole bunch of our major assumptions about space travel are undergoing a major shift."" This past year has seen important strides toward this shift. Washington licensed Jacksonville, Florida's Cecil Field as the nation's eighth non-government spaceport in January. New Mexico's Spaceport America, where Virgin Galactic plans to permanently base its space flights, completed a nearly 2-mile spacecraft runway this month. Virgin Galactic test-flew its spacecraft Sunday. A firm that arranges private space travel, Space Adventures, announced private partnerships this year with Boeing and Texas-based Armadillo Aerospace, a rocket development firm headed by John Carmack, the programmer-businessman behind the famed ""Doom"" video games. Boeing: Come fly to space with us . King recalls the exact moment when he decided he wanted to go. When he was a youth in Ireland's countryside, far from city streetlights, the Milky Way laid out a virtual welcome mat for him. ""I remember thinking how strange it was that after man had conquered the moon, we appeared to have given up afterwards,"" said King, who built and sold his Clockworks International software company during the booming 1990s. ""I think a lot of people imagined there would have been more progress in terms of space flight."" Virgin Galactic plans for each traveler to undergo a three-day pre-flight launch preparation program immediately before each mission. But many who've signed up, including King, have undergone centrifuge training to experience in-flight stresses stronger than gravity, known as G-forces. ""At six Gs, talking is extremely difficult,"" King said. ""It feels like you've got a weight on your chest and your head is stuck to the back of the seat."" King refers to himself and his Virgin Galactic colleagues as astronauts, a job title Col. Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, is quite familiar with. ""I don't think these space tourists should be called astronauts,"" Aldrin said. ""That term was created by the U.S. military. My suggestions would be star-traveler or starflyer."" Aldrin says he hopes his high-profile activities like competing on TV's ""Dancing with the Stars"" and his new iPhone app will spur continued interest in space. ""In general, the private companies are more efficient ... but I think the government has its hands full trying to do exploration."" Virgin Galactic owner Sir Richard Branson and a virtual hall of fame of other wealthy business figures have invested much of their vast fortunes in hopes of gaining a toe hold in commercial space. Budget Suites owner Robert Bigelow, PayPal co-founder Elon Musk and Amazon.com's Jeff Bezos are all developing their own space hardware for traveling to -- or living in -- Earth orbit. Working with NASA, their companies are developing space stations, spaceplanes, rockets and capsules for space travelers. Many of these systems are expected to be operating and deployed within the next five years. ""This is a big deal, and the American people should be excited about it,"" said Charles Miller, NASA's senior adviser for commercial space. ""If you get the Steve Jobs and Bill Gates and Sergey Brins of American entrepreneurs working on space travel for the American people in partnership with the U.S. government, that's a good thing, which is why it was done."" NASA's shift toward the privatization of space has been planned since the Reagan administration, Miller said, and it comes as the 30-year-old shuttle program is set to end next year. Shuttle layoffs leave some workers adrift . At the New Mexico spaceport, about 60 miles north of Las Cruces, workers are completing a combination traveler terminal and spacecraft hangar that looks right out of TV's ""The Jetsons."" Tourists will gain access to the spaceport by boarding special buses at welcome centers in the nearby towns of Truth or Consequences and Hatch, said Rick Homans, the spaceport's executive director. Plans call for facilities accommodating about a half-million annual visitors to be finished in 18 to 24 months, including a ""second-to-none"" restaurant, space exhibits and simulators that replicate G-forces and weightlessness, Homans said. Spaceport officials are considering offering flights for visitors to watch Virgin Galactic spacecraft blast into suborbit from 50,000 feet.  ""We want them to be able to talk to inventors, rocket scientists, to see the spaceships and to witness the technology as much as possible,"" Homans said. Visitors may be able to launch model rockets or walk on terrain replicating the moon or Mars. Could these developments in space tourism lead to more practical applications, like a successor to the defunct supersonic Concorde aircraft? Space designers imagine a network of hypersonic spaceplanes that would take off from a runway in New Mexico and land at a Tokyo spaceport 45 minutes later. Is point-to-point hypersonic travel around the globe possible in the near future? ""We're a long way from that,"" Miller said. ""We could do it in a decade if there was a commitment to doing it, but it is not a priority for anybody I know in the U.S. government.""","Traveling to space is just months away for hundreds of paying tourists, experts say .

"The editor of a Mexican newspaper was found dead, her body decapitated and with a note next to it, officials said. Maria Elizabeth Macias Castro, 39, was the editor in chief of the newspaper, Primera Hora.

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Oil companies Shell and BP began evacuating nonessential personnel from their drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday as officials kept a wary eye on a tropical storm churning toward Mexico that could wreak havoc on oil spill cleanup efforts. As much as 2.5 million gallons of oil could flow into the Gulf for two weeks if Tropical Storm Alex forces a work stoppage at the ruptured BP well, the government's disaster response manager said. Adm. Thad Allen said gale-force winds near the well head would prompt an evacuation of the thousands of workers and vessels involved in the oil recovery and cleanup effort. Both Shell and BP were taking precautions ahead of the storm. About 300 people were evacuated from Shell's production platforms and drilling rigs Saturday, company spokesman Bill Tanner said, adding that evacuations will continue Sunday. BP began similar evacuations Saturday from three of its rigs in the far south of the Gulf, spokesman Neil Chapman said. He noted that the evacuations do not include anyone involved in the Deepwater Horizon response efforts. If Alex forces a stoppage in cleanup, however, Allen said it would take 14 days to put everything back in place. That means the containment cap would be off for that period, allowing oil to flow freely. Researchers have estimated that between 35,000 barrels -- about 1.5 million gallons -- and 60,000 barrels -- about 2.5 million gallons -- of oil are gushing into the ocean every day. Anxiety levels rose Saturday as Alex churned toward Mexico with a potential for hurricane-force winds in the coming days. The latest computer models show the predicted path of the storm passing well south of the United States, making landfall in Mexico as a hurricane in the middle of the week, according to the National Weather Service. If it continues on its predicted track, the storm would not directly pass over oil-affected areas -- but forecasters have not ruled out an easterly shift in Alex's path. ""We all know the weather is unpredictable, and we could have a sudden last-minute change,"" Allen said. Alex -- the first named storm of what is expected to be a fierce Atlantic hurricane season  -- formed in the Caribbean on Saturday and had maximum sustained winds near 65 mph. It was heading toward Belize and Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Allen said it would take five days to evacuate more than 38,000 people and 6,000 vessels that are involved in the oil response as well as the two rigs that are collecting about 24,500 barrels of oil a day from the well, Allen said. He told CNN there is ""no playbook"" when it comes to responding to a massive oil spill as a storm brews. ""But I will tell you there's been an extraordinary amount of planning being done,"" he said. BP plans to place a third rig called the Helix Producer at the well site next week, which will increase the amount of oil being captured to 53,000 barrels a day, Allen said. That, too, could be disrupted if Alex affects the area. Gulf Coast residents feared that high winds and storm surges could spread the slick and push more oil ashore into bays, estuaries and pristine beaches, exacerbating the oil disaster triggered by BP's ruptured well. ""The greatest nightmare with this storm approaching is that it takes this oil on the surface of the Gulf and blows it over the barrier islands into the bays and the estuaries,"" Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, told CNN. ""And that is where you really get the enormous destruction, because it's just very difficult to clean up those pristine bays."" Also Saturday, Americans took to beaches from coast to coast to protest offshore oil drilling. They held hands and formed lines in the sand. ""I believe Americans need to stand together and take our energy future back from the grip of the oil industry,"" said Dave Rauschkolb, a restaurant owner from Seaside, Florida, who founded Hands Across the Sand. Deepwater drilling could resume by the end of July after U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Thursday denied a request to keep a six-month moratorium imposed by President Barack Obama on May 27 in place, pending a government appeal. The government has 30 days to show it is beginning to comply with Feldman's order and start issuing permits. The appeals process can continue, but until the appeal, the government must act as if Feldman's order will be upheld. While protesters lined the sand, Alex moved toward Mexico, no one knowing whether it would make a sudden turn north into the open Gulf. CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said the ""preferred scenario"" actually would be for Alex to head to northern Florida. That's because the oil spill has been gradually rotating counterclockwise. If the storm heads to the east of it, it would send the oil farther out to sea. If the storm heads more directly towards the central Gulf and Louisiana, it might push the oil toward Florida. ""We've never been in this situation before,"" Maginnis said. ""We've never seen an oil spill that encompassed the Gulf like this, end up so close to shore."" A powerful storm would also complicate efforts to clean up miles of coastline. ""It's going to mean we're going to have to find a way to maneuver all our resources, change things,"" said Grover Robinson, chairman of the Escambia County Commission in Pensacola, Florida. ""We won't be able to fight the oil for a couple of days. And we have no idea about winds and current and what it will do to the oil in the gulf. So obviously, it's a very big concern for us."" Allen said he and some top Obama administration officials, including Vice President Joe Biden, will be headed back to the Gulf region next week to assess the oil relief efforts.

"(CNN) -- Lavish weddings on soap operas are commonplace -- beautiful, wealthy characters united amid copious tears, heaps of flowers and exquisite attire. Actresses Tamara Braun and Eden Riegel take part in the wedding as depicted on ABC's ""All My Children."" Monday's ceremony on ABC's ""All My Children"" was much the same, except for the couple: Bianca Montgomery and Reese Williams, both wearing designer dresses, united in daytime television's first lesbian wedding. ""When my character did first come out of the closet, there was a lot of negative reaction,"" said Eden Riegel, the actress who plays Bianca. Her character is the daughter of Erica Kane, a longtime mainstay on the show played by Susan Lucci. ""People were very protective of Erica Kane's daughter, and I think that the beauty of the show is that we were able to reach people and get people sort of used to the idea,"" Riegel said.  Watch the actress talk about her character and the wedding » . The ceremony, portions of which were posted on a Web site dedicated to ABC daytime television and SOAPnet.com, featured both women wearing designer dresses and holding red roses. ""I promise to love you and devote myself to you,"" says a tearful Reese, played by Tamara Braun, during the ceremony, her hands in Bianca's. ""Because standing here with you, it's where I belong."" Lucci said, ""Once Bianca came out and said she was gay, Erica said, 'But no! You won't get married!' Well, now that Bianca is getting married, you know, the other part of Erica is like, 'Hooray!' You know? 'I get to plan my daughter's wedding after all!' "" At least one religious group, however, expressed its disapproval of the nuptials. ""I think it is really important to understand that there are a lot of things that people don't really want to see and don't want coming into their homes, and lesbian weddings are certainly one of them,"" said Glenn Stanton of the group Focus on the Family. But gay and lesbian groups hailed the televised wedding as a victory. ""It's reality,"" said Neil Giuliano, president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). ""So when we see a lesbian couple getting married on daytime drama, it simply reflects what's happening in the real world."" Actress Braun said, ""If you are brave enough to want to get married, especially with the divorce rate as high as it is, then you should have that right no matter what sex you are, who you love, what color you are, how many extra toes and feet you have ... equal rights for all people."" Recent high-profile same-sex weddings included that of talk show host Ellen DeGeneres and her partner, actress Portia de Rossi, last August. However, same-sex marriage remains a hot-button issue in many states -- particularly California. The state was one of several to ban same-sex marriage in the November 4 elections. But unlike the others, California had been issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples since a May 15 ruling by the state Supreme Court legalized the unions. However, California's Proposition 8, the measure outlawing same-sex marriage, passed with about 52.5 percent of the vote. Three groups -- the American Civil Liberties Union, gay-rights group Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights -- filed a legal challenge to the vote, asking the state Supreme Court to rule the ballot-initiative process was ""improperly used"" to strip away a right protected by the state constitution. The court has said it will hear the appeal, but will not block the implementation or enforcement of the law in the meantime. Arguments in the case could be heard as early as next month. Same-sex marriage is legal in Massachusetts and Connecticut. Rhode Island recognizes same-sex marriages from other states, and Vermont, New Jersey and New Hampshire allow civil unions.

"The naked celebrities seem to be everywhere lately. Last week, hackers allegedly stole nude photos from actress Scarlett Johansson and then plastered them all over the Internet. Before then it was the rapper Kreayshawn, who wrote on her blog that her Twitter account was hacked in August when naked photos of her showed up there. In March, Vanessa Hudgens of ""High School Musical"" underwent a similar ordeal after photos were reportedly stolen from her Gmail account. Finally, in December, police in Germany alleged two young men had used computer-hacking skills to get access to the e-mail accounts and photos of more than 50 celebrities, according to Britain's The Telegraph, including the likes of Lady Gaga and Ke$ha. In the wake of all this juicy Hollywood hoopla, people have started to assume these photo leaks are the newest front in the so-called ""hacktivist"" wars, as waged by big-name hacking rings such as Anonymous and LulzSec. Those groups have claimed responsibility for taking down bank and government websites. But security experts said connections between celeb hacks and groups such as  Anonymous are thin or nonexistent. Such groups ""would feel this kind of thing is beneath them,"" said Graham Cluley, a senior technology consultant at Sophos, a computer security company. ""It's obviously to gain media exposure, right?"" said Kevin Mitnick, a hacker turned security consultant and author of ""Ghost in the Wires."" ""It's like everyone is trying to one-up Anonymous and one-up LulzSec. So somehow celebrities are becoming a target."" The celebrity hacks aren't sophisticated, he said. He added: ""It's not surprising to me. It's, like, old news."" The first real case of a celebrity attack was in 2005 when hackers logged into Paris Hilton's phone and stole photos of her, said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, another computer security company. Those hackers reportedly were able to break into Hilton's phone by correctly guessing the not-so-secret answer to her security question, which was ""tinkerbell,"" the name of her pet Chihuahua. The real issue here, the researchers said, is the prevalence, and accessibility of, nude photos. If celebrities didn't take and store nude photos of themselves on their phones or on computers, they wouldn't be stolen and published online. ""Everyone has a camera on them all the time, so the tendency to send something kinky to that hot guy you're trying to date might be too great,"" said Cluley, who, coincidentally enough, writes a blog called ""Naked Security"" for Sophos. His advice: ""If you see someone pointing a camera at you and you're not wearing any clothes, go and hide behind the wardrobe."" Who is behind the recent string of stolen celebrity photos -- and how exactly they got them -- remains unclear. The FBI office in Los Angeles has opened an investigation into the incidents of computer hacking but declined to elaborate on the cases involved. Some people have pointed to a supposedly new hacker ring called Hollywood Leaks, which operates a Twitter feed to discuss these sorts of incidents. On Monday, the group wrote that it didn't have anything to do with the Johansson photos: ""WE DID NOT LEAK THE SCARLETT JOHANSSON PICS, WE WOULD HAVE RELEASED IT HERE FIRST! So stop the speculating!"" the group wrote. ""I don't think there's a clear link"" between the celebrity hacks and hacking groups such as Anonymous and LulzSec, said Hypponen, ""but obviously these groups are amoebas, and they change shape and they're so different from each other."" Their motives are also unclear. As a teenager, Mitnick said he used to make a game out of hunting down celebrity phone numbers and then calling them. (He remembers saying this to Lucille Ball, whose number he found: ""Hey, Lucy, oh hi. I just wanted to let you know I'm a really big fan of your show. I won't call you again -- don't worry."" And then he hung up). He sees the celebrity photo stealing as an extension of this sort of pranksterism. The hackers are likely out for money, said Cluley, since these photos could be sold to tabloid or adult websites. Or celebs could be leaking the photos to get attention. ""I think we have to consider that as a possibility,"" he said. Flip that argument around, and you'll notice hackers have become a popular scapegoat for celebrities and politicians who spill information by accident. Remember former U.S. Rep. Anthony Weiner? When nude photos of the New York congressman surfaced on Twitter, ""he initially blamed a hacker,"" Cluley said. ""It wasn't so much the picture of him in his pants that did him in. it was more the cover-up."" Weiner later admitted to sending the photos himself and resigned. If one thing's clear, it's that this kind of celebrity hack isn't going away soon. ""It's going to escalate,"" Hypponen said. ""After people saw what happened to Scarlett Johansson, you can damn well bet there are people out there who are trying to do the same thing to other pretty actresses."" Well, at least until the pretty actresses stop taking nude photos.","Hackers have been stealing and posting photos of naked celebrities .

"Authorities have killed almost 5,000 dogs in one Chinese city after rabies was blamed for the death of five people, China's official Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday. Municipal authorities in Baoshan, in the southwestern province of Yunnan, culled 4,900 dogs and vaccinated 100,000 in its anti-rabies campaign, Xinhua reported. The report said that four people died from rabies in August and one in July following dog bites. Rabies outbreaks had been relatively rare in the past five years, Xinhua said. In 2006, at least 16 people died of the disease in the eastern province of Shandong. China often orders stray dogs to be culled in an effort to prevent outbreaks of rabies but, as dog ownership has become more popular in affluent areas, some animal activists have decried the practice, calling for animals to be vaccinated or sterilized to keep dog numbers down. According to the World Health Organization, rabies is a virus that spreads to human through close contact from animals, usually a deep bite or scratch. It spreads through the central nervous system, leading to fatal inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Effective treatment with a course of vaccines can prevent the onset of symptoms and death.","City in southwest China kills almost 5,000 dogs .

"(CNN)Sitting down with Mastercard's President of International Markets, Ann Cairns, here at the World Economic Forum in Davos, I was reminded how fortunate I am to cover this event each January. I had already experienced two ""Davos moments"" in the Swiss mountain town: as I entered the congress center I passed Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and then IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde. ""You can have it all, despite what you're reading in all the magazines that you can't,"" Cairns told me as I interviewed her for CNN's Leading Women series. She's just one of many high-profile women attending WEF this year, and rejects the notion that working mothers can't have successful careers. Davos is a gathering of great minds and change-makers from across the globe, and its theme this year is ""The New Global Context"". The focus takes in everything from fighting terror to addressing the growing income divide.  But this year just 17% of participants at this invitation-only summit are female; an increase on 15% in 2014, but still far too small a number. Meanwhile, on the Fortune 500 list, just 3.4% of corporations have female CEOs.  Clearly, there is work to do. In 2010 WEF introduced a new policy allowing corporations to bring a fifth senior leader to the summit (as opposed to the general limit of four), as long as both men and women were in the delegation. Progress has been made with initiatives like this, but the event remains dominantly male. Facebook's VP of global marketing Carolyn Everson thinks change will come. She told Fortune, ""In the coming years, the number of attendees who are women will rise, as the conversations that are taking place all around us today are going to fundamentally impact the path for women in the future."" Based in London, Ann Cairns told me she believes the ""U.S. is a few years ahead of Europe"" in seeing women rise up the corporate ladder. ""When it comes to corporate boards, she is torn on the question of whether or not there should be quotas. ""I think it's a very difficult area, because I would like to see more women on boards.  I would hate to think I got onto a board because of a quota, and I think most women would feel that way. ""Is it moving fast enough? I think it could probably move faster."" Ertharin Cousin, executive director of the World Food Program, explained why the World Food Program focuses so much on women.   ""Because women make the difference, in all the communities that we serve; even in our households, women have big voices."" Cousin runs the $5.4 billion aid program -- but the path to her position was filled with hurdles. She recounted an experience in law school when she was given advice on how to excel in a job interview.  ""Ensure that your client doesn't see you as a woman,"" she was told, ""because that was still seen as a detriment. ""It was still seen that if you were a woman you would not have the ability to go into a courtroom and represent a client; that you needed to be sexless."" Clearly she didn't take that advice.  ""I went in for a job interview. I wore a red coat dress; because I said if they're going to hire me it won't be because of what I'm wearing, and they need to know from the time I sit down in the chair to when I walk in the door that they're hiring a woman; a woman who is capable of performing the work."" There's a lot of work -- game-changing work -- being done by the women here at WEF. This is a place that humbles just about everyone because it's hard to digest the caliber of many of the attendees and the magnitude of change for the better they are striving for. There are also remarkable men here focused on women.  The youngest of the 1,500 business leaders from over 100 countries here is 22 year old Alain Nteff from Cameroon, who has created an app called Gifted Mom dedicated to the health of pregnant women.  It is helping to lower the death rate among expectant mothers and newborns in his country. WEF's mission statement says it is ""committed to improving the state of the world through public-private cooperation.""  And as Ann Cairns tweeted:  ""men and women make truly productive teams.""  Let's hope in the coming years they will also be equal in number. The opinions expressed in this story are solely those of Poppy Harlow.","CNN correspondent Poppy Harlow reports from Davos on the lack of female presence .

"When DC Comics relaunched its fictional world from scratch last fall, some aspects of the DC mythos temporarily fell by the wayside, such as the notion of parallel worlds featuring different versions of the company's iconic heroes. ""Earth Two,"" a new series by writer James Robinson and artist Nicola Scott, reintroduces the concept by putting a new spin on the original versions of characters like the Green Lantern, the Flash and Superman that diverges notably from the past several decades of DC lore. In the second issue of the comic, in stores June 6, Robinson and Scott prove just how different this world is by revealing that their version of Alan Scott, the first Green Lantern introduced back in 1940, is an openly gay man. Up until recently, a middle aged version of Alan Scott was one of the stars of ""Justice Society of America,"" a comic series featuring the 1940s versions of DC's heroes set in the present day. The new versions of these characters in Earth Two have all been aged down considerably, to the point that Scott's gay superhero son Obsidian had to be sacrificed. Robinson says he was inspired to write Scott himself as a gay character to make up for that loss. ""The logical leap that I made was, oh, why don't we make Alan Scott gay?,"" he says. ""To DC's credit, there wasn't any hesitation. [Co-publisher] Dan DiDio was like 'Oh, that's a great idea, let's do it!'"" Robinson's version of Green Lantern differs from his counterpart in the regular DC Universe in ways other than his sexual orientation. ""He has a ring which he uses to help manifest his powers, but he doesn't have a lantern,"" he says, noting that the mainstream Green Lanterns are members of a corp of space police who draw their energy directly from their own willpower. ""He is the receptacle, the conduit for the energy of the Earth, which is this green energy."" Unlike previous versions of Scott dating back to the Forties, wood will not be a weakness for the new Green Lantern. ""He is the earthly powerhouse, and when you see him in terms of his power level, he's up there close to Superman."" Though Marvel Comics' gay hero Northstar is set to face some intolerance from his peers following his marriage to his long term boyfriend in the pages of ""Astonishing X-Men,"" Robinson and Scott are planning on portraying an idealized world in which Alan Scott is judged only by the quality of his character. ""He doesn't come out in issue two; he is already a gay man,"" Robinson says. ""Alan Scott is super-heroic, he's super gallant, he'll die for the earth, he'll die for its people, he's everything you want in a hero. I imagine he's such a Type A character that when he realized he was gay, he was like, 'Okay, I'm gay, now I'm just gonna go on with my life.' He's so accepting of it himself and he's such a compelling person that the world knows Alan Scott's gay. He's such a leader, he's such a good man, that the Justice League don't care. And that's a healthy depiction of a team and how it should be."" Scott says her instructions from Robinson were to make this version of the Green Lantern as heroic as possible. ""With Alan, the brief was very clear,"" she says. ""He needed to be a big, strapping, handsome man that everyone would instinctively follow and love. Alan strikes me as an incredibly open, honest and warm man, a natural leader and absolutely the right choice to be Guardian of the Earth. His sexuality is incidental.""

"Police say he strikes in the early morning hours, often before the sun comes up, and his method is usually the same. While on foot, he approaches his female victims, many of them minors, as they walk alone to school or wait at a bus stop, and he strikes up a casual conversation with them. Then he quickly brandishes a knife or gun and forces his victims to a secluded nearby area, where he sexually assaults them. And just like that he is gone. But he leaves behind his DNA and -- for his victims -- the memory of a teardrop tattoo on his face. Dubbed the ""teardrop rapist,"" the man is one of Los Angeles' most prolific criminals. Since 1996, police believe the same man assaulted girls and women 35 times throughout a broad swath of the city center. Then in 2005, he stopped. For seven years, the case went cold until November when, according to recent DNA tests, the man attacked again. Now, just seven months later, he has struck yet again making his capture a top priority for the Los Angeles Police Department, which has launched a massive manhunt to end the assaults. Read the police alert . Police Deputy Chief Kirk Albanese has this warning for residents citywide: ""For families that have teenage daughters walking we have had several occurrences where the victim has been as young as 14, 15 years old. We are asking parents to ensure that their young teenage daughters are accompanied."" The attack that put this cold case back in the spotlight occurred at 5:30 a.m. in the morning hours last November when a 15-year-old Latina was walking in a residential neighborhood. The suspect approached the victim by asking for directions, then pulled out a gun and forced her into a yard, where he sexually assaulted her. At the time, it was initially investigated as another sexual assault case. Then, a couple of months later, the DNA results matched 10 other sexual assaults that police have linked to the same man, known as the ""teardrop rapist."" After investigating some leads, police decided last month to go public with the DNA findings that showed the ""teardrop rapist"" had struck again after an apparent six-year hiatus. Now, a task force of 20 police detectives is following new leads and resurrecting any clues from previous cases dating back to 1996. The latest assault attempt in the case was June 15, police said. Authorities plan to canvas Hispanic neighborhoods on Thursday. The suspect has been described as a Hispanic male, 40 to 55 years old, with brown eyes and brown hair. His height ranges between 5 feet 2 inches and 5 feet 6 inches tall, and his weight is believed to be 130 to 170 pounds. He has possible teardrop tattoos below one of his eyes and has been seen wearing a dark-hooded sweatshirt as well as a baseball cap or a dark-colored beanie on his head. Detective Jesse Alvarado, who is leading the task force with fellow detective Sharlene Johnson, said the suspect often goes unnoticed in the neighborhoods where he has targeted his victims. ""He can walk up to somebody and spark up a conversation, and the victim doesn't feel threatened until the weapon is seen,"" Alvarado said. ""So he blends in, and nobody is saying, 'What is this guy doing in our neighborhood?' "" The pattern of attacks shows the suspect never strikes in the same place twice, Alvarado said. ""He's just all over the place, and he appears to be familiar with the area -- whether he lives in the area, has family (there) or works in the area."" DNA evidence has linked 11 of the 35 victims, who range in age from 14 to 41.  The remaining 24 cases are tied together by the similarities in the attacks and descriptions of the suspect. The locations of the attacks are spread out in a wide area concentrated through the center of Los Angeles. Map of ""teardrop rapist"" attacks (PDF) Inside Los Angeles police headquarters, the Special Assault Section resembles a command center for an emergency operation. On a wall there are poster boards with the latest leads written on them. Detectives are busy combing through some 700 boxes of old and closed cases, visiting old locations and even re-interviewing victims to shake out any possible clues. Johnson insists the task force will leave no stone unturned. ""We have decided to completely re-investigate it from the beginning, going through all of the original cases, all of the original follow-up investigations that were done,"" she said. The detectives have already uncovered a previous composite sketches by going through some old cases. All 11 sketches depict the teardrop rapist through the years, but some are very dissimilar: In some sketches, he has a teardrop tattoo on the left side of his face, while it's on the right side in others; some sketches have two teardrops, and others have none at all. Police admit the wide variation of composite sketches can be confusing but said at this point they cannot narrow a sketch down to just one. The detectives stressed the sketches are simply a guide and another tool to help make the community aware, with the hope that they might lead to someone recognizing the suspect. Johnson said these attacks ""happen very quickly,"" explaining the different descriptions of a suspect who police believe is the same man. ""There is a knife involved, there is a gun involved; every person focuses on something different,"" she said. Despite the massive police investigation, Alvarado said he believes ordinary citizens will help crack the case. ""It's gonna be that one little thing where someone says, 'It looks like that guy I used to work with,' "" Alvarado said. To get the public's attention, Los Angeles police are sending out community alerts with a description and composite sketches of the suspect, and the city has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. Johnson said she won't be able to rest until police get their man. ""We will figure out who this is; we will arrest him, and we will make sure he gets prosecuted, and we will do the best that we can to make sure he doesn't victimize any women again."" For Alvarado, the case hits close to home. ""I'm a parent, I have a daughter; my thing is it's happened here, and it could happen where I live,"" he said. ""So our job is to find this individual no matter what it takes.""","Police plan to canvas L.A.'s Hispanic neighborhoods Thursday .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A fortnight after Japan's Kei Nishikori became the first Asian man to play in a grand slam final in the Open era -- going down in straight sets to Croatia's Marin Cilic at Flushing Meadows -- he sat down with CNN in Hong Kong to talk the U.S. Open, his new-found stardom and the impact his new coach Michael Chang has had on his game. To make that U.S. Open final, you had to get past Novak Djokovic in the semis. How did it feel to beat the world's top player at a major? It was amazing, also playing my best tennis. It's my second time beating him, but it's different in a grand slam. Everybody's trying to play 100%. So when I beat (world No. 6 Milos Raonic), Stan (Wawrinka, world no. 4) and Nole (Djokovic), it was a great feeling. Was there anything different about the way you approached that big match? Not so much. I don't think I was feeling a lot of pressure, just (taking) one match at a time. I was really relaxed, but also really concentrating every match. Even if the match was going three or four hours, I was still concentrating well, and that was the key. How has life changed since then? Not much. It was a little bit crazy in Japan, a lot of people came to the airport when I landed. But what I do is always the same. Train hard, always play my tennis. Maybe all the players look at me in a different way now. They may care a little more, they study what I do. You're a hero in Japan since the U.S. Open -- there were people saying they wanted to name their future children Kei. How have you found that experience? They always want to motivate me. The U.S. Open was played completely at the opposite time, but they were cheering for me throughout the night and the early morning. When I was walking in the street (in Japan) these couple of days, they'll say congratulations to me and it's always a pleasure to feel something like that. The Japanese people aren't too aggressive so they (usually) won't say too much -- but this time was different. They were trying to say hi to me and congratulate me. Do you feel an extra sense of pressure to be representing the hopes of many Asian fans? Not too much. I always think to just play my tennis. I'm very honored to be the number one player in Asia. You see more junior or young guys coming up, and women are always there -- like Li Na ... but not for men. So I hope I can get leadership and this will help for sure in Asia to go to finals in grand slams. I broke one of the goals. I think people can believe a little more that they can do it. You've been coached by former French Open champion Michael Chang since January. What changes has he made to your game? He's definitely helped my tennis. My tennis is really growing very strong and is a little more aggressive than before. I'm trying to, (with) the short ball, step in a little more. More things to do than before, but it's working really well. I spend more time with him on the court, more practice and more training -- that's why I could play seven matches in the U.S. Open, even though I played two (that went to) five sets. It's really improving. Who is your tennis hero? Roger Federer is the one I respect the most. I always love to play him and also to watch his tennis. Sometimes we don't know what he does -- he does amazing things. I think a great serve, great strokes, everything is perfect. He doesn't have many weaknesses. Let's talk diet. Andy Murray is known to eat a lot of sushi, Djokovic is big on gluten-free food. Do you have a special diet or a personal chef? Not yet. I try to eat a good balance -- a lot of carbs before the match, also vegetables, a lot of fruit. But I don't really stress too much. Sometimes, I eat whatever I want. I try to eat simple and good. What do you like to do with your time off the court? I like to go shopping and I love to sleep. Sometimes when I have an off day I'll sleep to midday. I play golf sometimes and love to watch sport. Your home prefecture in Japan, Shimane, recently offered you an award in the wake of your U.S. Open performance, but you turned it down. Why was that? It's the second time they've offered. It's always a pleasure that they honor me like that -- but I think I'm still on my way to my goal. It's not like I've done everything. I think there's still more things to do and I'm still young. So I think if I get maybe a grand slam I can receive that. Do you see yourself winning a grand slam one day? I think it's getting close, because I was almost there. But I know how tough it is to get to the semis in grand slams. It's still far away I think, but you know, I'm in the top 10 right now and I think I can be there. I have enough power and talent to get to the final -- so I hope I can get there again some time.","Kei Nishikori's strong performance at the U.S. Open has seen him heralded in Japan .

"Hosts Brazil enjoyed a triumphant finale to the troubled Confederations Cup with a 3-0 defeat of world champions Spain in the Maracana Sunday. A tournament marked by nationwide protests, ended with a reminder of Brazil's enduring quality as a football powerhouse, which has previously served as uniting factor for the entire nation. Certainly those packed inside the famous stadium in Rio de Janeiro for the final of the eight-team tournament, a rehearsal for next year's World Cup, would have been filled with optimism. Protesters outside the iconic ground, with reports of clashes with riot police amid tight security, have been complaining about the cost of staging the global showpiece against a backdrop of poor public services and alleged corruption. But Luiz Felipe Scolari's men did their best to make sure the headlines would be made by their exploits as they dominated a team holding both the World Cup and European Championship trophies. For as well as Brazil played, Spain's performance was below standard, with Fred's early goal after a Neymar assist all too easy. Spain could offer little in return and the home side went further ahead just before the break as Barcelona-bound Neymar received a pass from Oscar and beat Iker Casillas with a thunderous shot. Only two minutes were on the clock in the second half when Fred beat Casillas again with a first-time shot and Spain's hopes were all but over. Their night continued to go from bad to worse and after they won a penalty, Sergio Ramos, the hero in the semifinal shoot out win over Italy, sent his effort wide. With Brazil threatening to add further goals, Gerard Pique hacked down his soon to be teammate Neymar and was promptly shown red. At the final whistle, the stadium erupted in a sea of yellow to greet a success many will see as a prelude to Brazil winning back the World Cup in 2014. ""Nobody expected such an emphatic result, not against the world champions,"" said Brazil's coach Luiz Felipe Scolari after the match, in quotes carried by Fifa.com. ""But let's not get carried away. This is more than a title because we've shown that we're on the right path and that we can now take a little more confidence with us as we travel down it."" With the tournament overshadowed by ongoing unrest across the country, Scolari said he hoped the result would bring some relief. ""It's a message for the whole of Brazil. We have to get along and stick together to make sure things move forward."" His opposite number, meanwhile, was philosophical in defeat. ""Obviously this defeat hurts, but I think deep down that we've had a good Confederations Cup,"" Vicente Del Bosque told reporters. ""I'd rather take the positives away with me today. I've been with an exceptional group of players who have given their all in what have been a fantastic 28 days together."" Earlier, Italy beat Uruguay 3-2 on penalties to claim third spot after the game ended 2-2 after extra time in Salvador.","Brazil beat Spain 3-0 in Confederations Cup final .

"(CNN)Chocolate buffs are clamoring for the Hershey Co. to ""gimme a break"" after the chocolate manufacturer reached a settlement with an importer to stop distributing British-made candy bars. Let's Buy British Imports, one of the nation's top distributors of popular food brands from the UK, South Africa and Australia, agreed last week to stop selling confections like Maltesers and Toffee Crisps to stateside retail outlets and restaurants. Hershey, which was established in 1894, has more than 80 brands worldwide, including brands like Reese's and York. Hershey initially filed the lawsuit in August, citing trademark infringement because some British candies have similar packaging to a Hershey product and thus could be ""misleading"" to the consumer. ""Given the immeasurable value of our brands, we work hard to protect these important intellectual assets and defend them against infringement,"" said Jeff Beckman, a Hershey spokesman. The owners of Tea & Sympathy, a New York shop that stocks UK goods, aren't buying it -- even urging fans to contact Hershey's CEO about the matter. ""May we politely suggest that if you think Toffee Crisps look like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups your eyesight is a much bigger problem than your chocolate bar confusion,"" the shop wrote on its Facebook page. Hershey lawsuit angers fans of British chocolate in U.S. Many chocolate lovers have taken to social media to share a similar sentiment, some even calling for drastic action with the hashtag #BoycottHershey. Hershey holds the license to manufacture Cadbury chocolate products in the U.S., so the import ban also includes UK-made Cadbury and Kit Kat products, which are made differently in the United States than across the pond. To qualify as milk chocolate by UK law, a product must contain at least 20% cocoa and milk solids and at least 25% fat. In the U.S., the required percentage in both is less. Fans melt down over Cadbury creme egg change . At the time of publishing, close to 15,000 people have also signed a petition against the ban.","British chocolates won't be imported after an agreement with Hershey .

"Patty Andrews, the last surviving member of the Andrews Sisters, died at her Northridge, California, home Wednesday, her publicist Alan Eichler said.  She was 94. The Andrews Sisters began singing on Minnesota radio stations in the 1920s, but after several years on the Vaudeville circuit they began a recording career that made them one of the most successful female groups ever. The sisters performed with ""Patty always singing the lead, Maxene the high harmony and LaVerne the low harmony, inventing a unique blend that came from their hearts, since none of the girls could read music,"" according to the official biography released by Eichler. One of their biggest hits was ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,"" which became a World War II anthem.  The Recording Industry of America Association and the National Endowment for the Arts placed it as the sixth on its ""Songs of the Century"" list in 2001. Other major songs included ""Bei Mir Bist Du Schon,"" ""Don't Fence Me In,"" ""Apple Blossom Time,"" ""Rum and Coca Cola,"" and ""I Can Dream, Can't I?"" Their family lived in Mound, Minnesota, when Patty was born on February 16, 1918. Sister LaVerne, who was seven years older, died of cancer in 1967, while Maxene, two years older than Patty, died of a heart attack in 1995. ""They had begun to sing together at home, with LaVerne teaching her younger siblings the 'hot' songs of the day, like the Boswell Sisters rendition of 'Dinah' and 'When I Take My Sugar to Tea,' "" the biography said. Patty Andrews was just 10 when Larry Rich, who saw the sisters sing at the Orpheum Theater in Minneapolis, offered them a spot on his traveling show. ""It was always important to the girls that they were the children of immigrant parents, and when their father's business was wiped out during the Depression, the sisters left school and went out on the road to sing, using their music to support their family as best they could,"" the biography said. They later performed in New York with Jack Belasco's orchestra and toured on the Vaudeville circuit with Ted Mack. Their recording career began in New York in 1937 just as they were ""literally at the end of the road""  and ""stranded in New York City,"" the biography said. ""Through an arranger they had met on the road, Vic Schoen, they landed one show, for one night only at the Edison Hotel with The Billy Swanson Orchestra, where they sang exactly one verse of one song,"" the bio said.  ""As luck would have it, that part of the show was being broadcast on the radio, and the head of Decca Records, Jack Kapp, was getting into a taxi that had the radio tuned to that station.  The next day, Lou Levy, who would soon become their manager and later the husband of Maxene, was sent to the Edison Hotel with instructions to find 'those girls.' "" The sisters performed on troop ships, in airplane hangars and at battlefields for the USO during the World War II. They appeared in 16 films during the 1940s, including ""Buck Privates,"" ""In the Navy,"" and ""Hold That Ghost"" with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, ""Hollywood Canteen"" and ""Road to Rio"" with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, as well as in a number of musical films. The sisters enjoyed a resurgence in the 1950s when they were booked at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, which led to television appearances and more recording.

"Crumpled, grubby bank notes could soon be on their way out in the UK, according to the Bank of England. By 2016, the UK will be switching its £5 and £10 bills to polymer bank notes as they're more durable, harder to forge, and cheaper in the long run. For over 300 years the Bank of England has been printing bank notes, and despite the growth of credit and debit cards and online transactions, there's more cash in circulation than ever before. The challenge is how to keep ahead of the counterfeiters, and this has prompted the Bank of England to follow recent technology in converting some of its notes. ""The key part of a bank note is 'I promise to pay' and people need to believe the bank will always promise to pay, but they also need to believe the notes they hold are genuine notes and not counterfeited notes,"" explained Victoria Cleland, chief cashier of the Bank of England, to CNN's Nina Dos Santos in an interview. The UK will be one of just a handful of currencies produced this way. Already, Australia and Canada have been moving away from paper to polymer in order to crack the counterfeiters and ensure the notes last longer. A key security feature of the polymer note is a window you can look through. Another feature of the plastic note is that it's quite thin and flexible, and still includes the raised print which people seem to prefer, said Cleland. ""One of the advantages of polymer notes is that they will hold their shape a lot more and they're more durable,"" Cleland explained to Dos Santos, showing CNN the slick new, washing-machine proof notes being printed. While the process of converting traditional notes to a plastic form will be an expensive endeavor, the Bank believes a polymer note will last at least two and a half times longer than paper. The £5 note will get the first facelift in 2016, followed by the £10 note. Winston Churchill will become the face on the £5 note, while Jane Austen will grace the £10 note. A polymer note is more expensive to produce initially and there will be some transitional costs, but Cleland said that over a 10 year period of switching the £5 and £10 notes, the Bank will save at least £100 million, a lot of it because of the increased longevity of the notes. And it's not just British notes which are getting a makeover. The Royal Mint has proposed a new design for the one pound coin, with state of the art anti-counterfeiting technology embedded into the metal which they claim will make it the most secure coin in the world. The Royal Mint has been casting coins for over eleven hundred years, producing coins and medals for up to 60 countries and supplying about 15% of global demand. The £1 pound coin has been used for 30 years but has become increasingly vulnerable to counterfeiters, with 45 million coins -- or 3% of the coins in circulation -- now being forgeries. ""The current electromagnetic signature in a coin can wear over time making forgeries harder to detect,"" said Andrew Mills, director of circulating coin sales at the Royal Mint. The new £1 coin, which is set to be introduced in 2017, will have the ISIS Technology -- Integrated Secure Identification Systems -- which has been used in bank notes for 20 years. This will enable enhanced security throughout the cash cycle, said Mills, protecting the public, vending machine operators, retailers and the banking system. With all the talk of a cashless society, it seems that cash is here to stay, albeit in its new plastic format.","By 2016, the Bank of England will be printing polymer £5 and £10 notes .

"(CNN)America's immigration debate has become red hot because President Obama's critics not only believe that he lacks the authority to act without the consent of Congress, but also that he must not change internal enforcement priorities before first ""securing the border."" The truth is, the single most important thing Congress can do to meaningfully improve our border security is pass comprehensive immigration reform. Too often, border security is viewed as preventing the illegal entry of people and goods across state lines. However, border security also is about ensuring the safe, efficient flow of commerce and increasing international trade. Comprehensive reform will do both, while our current approach serves neither objective. I say this as someone who has made countless trips to the U.S.-Mexico border. I've seen firsthand how our current approach to policing the border is based on muddled objectives and unmeasurable benchmarks that mask failure. Our failure to secure the border is not for a lack of trying. Congress has passed at least four laws since 1986 authorizing increases in Border Patrol personnel. In 1980, there were 2,268 Border Patrol agents at the southwest border; under President Obama, that number grew to an all-time high of 21,730. There was 14 miles of fencing on the border in 1990; under this administration, we've erected nearly 651 miles of new fencing and dramatically increased our mobile surveillance capabilities. Yet there is scant evidence that we can spend our way out of this problem. Recent studies by Princeton University and the University of California at San Diego reach desultory conclusions about our ability to stop illegal border crossings. We have been able to stop only about 30% of those attempting to cross our border between 1996 and 2009, according to the studies. Simply spending more money and adding more agents will not secure the border, but it will complicate trade. Nations cannot seek maximum security without shuttering trade, but nations cannot have fully open borders if they want real security. We can build more fences, identify more tracks, and inspect more vehicles, but only if we are prepared to greatly diminish the free flow of commerce. Our nation has wisely opted for a balanced approach. The central reason we will not be more effective at achieving our national security border goals is because U.S. policy, since the 1980s, effectively treats all border incursions as equal threats to the homeland. This diminishes our ability to prevent true threats -- such as drug cartels, human traffickers and potential terrorists -- from ""flooding the zone"" and gaining passage into the homeland. These criminals know that a small percentage of their goods and vehicles will be inspected and seized. For them, this is the cost of doing business. Unless we begin to prioritize threats and facilitate the legitimate entry of validated economic migrants, the cost-benefit analysis will remain in their favor. Border security professionals tell me the vast majority of illegal entrants are Mexicans seeking temporary work in the United States. All illegal crossings undermine border integrity, but temporary, work-seeking migrants do not pose a significant national security threat to the homeland. The best way to strengthen border security without stifling trade is for Congress to establish a system whereby migrant workers can apply for validated, biometric entry keys to cross our border safely and legally. This will free up our border security cadre to focus on preventing cartels, traffickers and terrorists from exploiting holes in our current system. Furthermore, channeling economic migrants to efficient legal crossings will reduce threats to their own safety, improve human dignity, and give interdiction operators the bandwidth to respond to a higher percentage of tripwire incursions across our nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. We need a new risk-based approach, informed by intelligence and emphasizing information sharing and international cooperation. Fortunately, there is a precedent that offers great hope. The Transportation Security Administration's Trusted Traveler/PreCheck Program is a model of risk-based screening that is increasing our security and facilitating commerce. The TSA approach allows approved, prescreened travelers to establish they are not security threats and move more nimbly to transact international business. This allows TSA officers to focus their attention on more consequential threats to aviation security. This risk-based approach is better for the traveling public and provides more security at less cost. We can adopt a similar approach to our land border with Mexico, if the Congress acts. As a nation, we do not accept a system where more than half of terror plots will be successful; we prioritize threats and go after terror cells with zeal. We need to embrace the same strategic approach to border security and abandon a system that does not adequately distinguish between worker crossings and true dangers to U.S. security. By normalizing the process for work-seeking migrants to legally enter the country, we will legalize a critical segment of our labor force and empower security professionals to focus on the true risks to our homeland. This will be good for our economy and our security. Now is the time for Congress to act.","To meaningfully improve our border security, Congress should pass immigration reform .
Migrant workers should be allowed to apply for validated, biometric entry keys to cross our border safely and legally ."
"(CNN) -- On Friday afternoon, Kasper Ilaug was inside his summer house, a cabin on Norway's Storoya Island, watching the Tour de France when the television broadcast was interrupted by a news flash -- a bomb had exploded in nearby Oslo. The bicycle race was almost over, and the 53-year-old computer programmer clicked through other channels in an attempt to keep watching the race. No luck. ""I was a little annoyed"" they were all focused on the explosion, he told CNN by phone. But his interest picked up when he saw that the building that had borne the brunt of the blast was Oslo's Government House, where his father used to work and his ex-wife and her new husband currently work. He texted his daughter to find out how her mother was. She returned his query. Fine. Then his phone rang -- a friend who lives 22 kilometers (14 miles) south of Olso sounded agitated. ""He said, 'You have to get in the boat of a friend of ours and rescue people from Utoya (Island), because something terrible is happening there,'"" said Ilaug. ""I thought he was joking with me."" But Ilaug grabbed his iPad and cell phone, and donned a bright-yellow jacket, a red helmet and red water-shoes to protect himself from the driving rain. He then ran down to the 18-foot fishing boat, and its 50-horsepower engine. The temperature outside was a brisk 15 degrees C (59 degrees F). Within 15 minutes, he was at Utoya Island. He saw people in a handful of other private boats that had lined up along the shore. ""We saw some youngsters laying there and waving to us,"" he said. ""They were terrified."" Along the shore were children crouched behind rocks and buildings and shrubs. ""They waved to me,"" he said. ""Then I got this text message from one of my friends that said there's a lunatic out there shooting people."" Then he saw helicopters flying overhead. By now, he had realized it was no joke. Ilaug brought the boat along the shore and children clambered in, as many as the boat could handle without sinking. The children -- most of them in bathing suits or half-dressed -- were shivering. ""Of course, they were in shock,"" he said. He observed one group of children behind rocks. ""I tried to wave to them and to get their attention, but I didn't get a response,"" he said. ""I thought, maybe they are still in shock or laying behind that rock for shelter."" He understands now that they were dead. ""They asked if I was police. I said, 'No, I'm just a private person. Our objective is to go to shore, and you will get blankets and you will find police and medical attention.'"" Then, several of them told him that a policeman had shot at them. He focused on the matter at hand -- promising those whom he could not accommodate that he would return soon, then motoring toward the mainland, about a half mile away. There, dozens of ambulances were lined up along the shore to receive them. ""I think I made three trips,"" he said. ""They were so grateful. These youngsters, they said, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.' One girl started crying."" He tried to keep her from causing others to panic. ""We have to have an agreement,"" he told his passengers. ""We should keep quiet until we get out of here."" He knew he'd placed himself in a vulnerable position. But the danger didn't deter him. ""I realized that me sitting there in the boat with my red helmet and yellow jacket would be a perfect target,"" he recalled. ""I thought, well, we are here and we have some things to do and I am happy that we managed to get so many of the youngsters."" After he had delivered his final group and could see no more children along the shore, he returned to the island where he has his summer home, opened the golf house for police to use, then went back to his cabin. There, he prepared a cup of coffee and some bread ""and I suddenly understood what I had been through."" Ilaug texted his daughter that he was OK, sent a message to his sister on holiday in Greece and to his niece ""and told her that we were doing what we had to do."" Hours later, he considered his efforts nothing special. Not in Norway, a place he said is full of calm, down-to-earth people. ""There's a lot of other people as well here who have done the same thing that I have done,"" he said. ""We're pretty earth-like, grounded people."" ""We're just 4.7 million people. Nothing much happens here. Even in a catastrophic situation like this, we keep calm. I'm just an ordinary Norwegian people. I expect that other Norwegians would do the same thing for me in a same or similar situation."" By early Saturday, he was still awake -- and still did not know who had won the latest stage of the Tour de France.","Kasper Ilaug was watching TV on an island near Oslo when he heard news of the bombing .

"(CNN)Portuguese photographer Daniel Rodrigues had always dreamed of visiting the Amazon rainforest in Brazil, and he finally got his chance last year. After two years of fundraising and wrestling with government bureaucracy, Rodrigues arrived at a place some might call a version of Eden: the Alto Turiacu reserve where the Awa-Guaja roam. ""I wanted to show the daily life in the world's most endangered tribe,"" he said. The Awa-Guaja's way of life is being threatened by relentless loggers who are illegally encroaching on their land, according to Brazil's National Indian Foundation. Many Awa Indians have had little to no contact with the outside world, but that is beginning to change, the foundation reports, as loggers continue to destroy the forests their existence depends on. Rodrigues set out to document the tribe's existence -- pure, pristine and, tragically, fleeting. ""I had traveled to Africa and other remote places where people at least knew what a camera was,"" Rodrigues said. ""Here I was, in the 21st century, with other humans who (until recently) had never seen a camera, a computer ... never seen a shower and were shocked when they saw a helicopter. And yet they are extremely happy."" Calling themselves Awa, Tupi-Guarani for ""man,"" the tribe is made of forest foragers and dexterous hunters. Challenges abound, said Rodrigues, who was forced to communicate with hand gestures for several weeks because the tribespeople did not speak Portuguese. ""I pointed this way to say the sun is setting and made hand signs to ask questions about hunting,"" Rodrigues recalled. ""They were incredibly friendly, and I was very well-received."" Spending weeks without uttering words, Rodrigues immersed himself in the visual resplendence of the Awa-Guaja life in the forest. Twelve-hour hunting expeditions were common, cutting through thick jungle growth during the monsoon rains. Nature's orchestral sounds rang behind every moment, something his photographs seem to allude to. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Detouring from the use of formal portraiture often seen in ethnophotography, Rodrigues' black-and-white photos are filled with an honesty that could only come as a result of an amicable pact with his subjects. The Awa clearly trusted Rodrigues' camera, and in the resulting work we can clearly see how well-versed he became with the ins and outs of the Awa way of life. The cinematic quality of some of the shots in the hunting scenes is a testament to the photographer's endurance and appreciation of a highly spiritual form of sportsmanship. ""We walked and walked for hours, slashing through the forest overgrowth to look for the prey,"" Rodrigues said. ""The Awa were barefoot the whole time."" Rodrigues nonchalantly talked about a dangerous situation while hunting for the indigenous red puma. ""The hunter had missed a shot, and the puma jumped right over towards me,"" he said. ""In the meantime, I was having an allergic reaction to a spider bite. It wasn't easy."" There are several groups of the Awa-Guaja in this part of the forest. Some have been known to exist since the 1970s. Others have been contacted in the early 1980s. Many are believed to still be in hiding. Earlier this month, Brazil's official news agency reported that three isolated Awa Indians had made contact with the other mainstream Awa-Guaja. The group's leader, Amakaria, reportedly said that loggers were marking trees and threatening to kill them. The Brazilian government has launched a massive military operation into the states of Para and Maranhao, today the epicenter in the war between loggers and Indians. Latest satellite imagery shows that new logging tracks are constantly being carved. Monitoring and preserving such a large expanse of tropical forest is a challenge. In the meantime, how can the so-called civilized world understand what is being lost? Rodrigues tries to explain: . ""Getting out of my comfort zone, my comfortable bed, to walk for hours through virgin forest, crossing rivers and rapids with water up to my neck ... hearing the triumphal songs of the hunters as they walked home a large prey to share with their brethren -- this experience can completely change a human being."" Daniel Rodrigues is a photographer based in Portugal. You can follow him on Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr.","Photographer Daniel Rodrigues spent time with an endangered tribe in the Amazon .

"(CNN)The asteroid that flew close to Earth Monday didn't come alone. NASA images released Monday reveal the asteroid, officially known as 2004 BL86, has its own small moon. The grainy, black and white photos show the asteroid, about a third of a mile in size, spinning through space, with its 230-foot-wide moon trailing behind. Asteroid 2004 BL86 came about 745,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Earth, or about three times as far away as the moon, just after 11 a.m. ET Monday, according to NASA. It was far enough that it didn't pose a threat to Earth, but close enough to give scientists and amateurs a chance to observe a large asteroid up close. It was the closest known asteroid this large to pass near Earth until 2027, when an asteroid called 1999 AN10 flies by. Observers on the ground didn't see much when the asteroid was closest to Earth Monday morning, because it wasn't at its brightest. Only a portion of its illuminated side was visible, according to Sky & Telescope magazine. The asteroid brightened as it got farther from the Earth because its face became more fully illuminated, the magazine said. The best chance for viewing was from 8 p.m. ET Monday to 1 a.m. ET Tuesday. NASA scientists snapped radar-generated images of the asteroid using the Deep Space Network antenna at Goldstone, California, and the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. ""While it poses no threat to Earth for the foreseeable future, it's a relatively close approach by a relatively large asteroid, so it provides us a unique opportunity to observe and learn more,"" Don Yeomans, the recently retired manager of NASA's Near Earth Object Program Office at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, said in a NASA news release. Yeomans retired on January 9 after 16 years of tracking asteroids. Paul Chodas has been designated as the new manager. ""We should be getting some great radar images of this asteroid,"" Chodas told CNN before the asteroid passed. ""Radar would be the key to study the asteroid's surface, give an idea of its shape, whether it has rocks and that kind of stuff on it. It'll be really exciting."" Observers without binoculars or a scope watched from their computers on The Virtual Telescope Project 2.0. The asteroid was discovered on January 30, 2004, by a telescope of the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research survey in White Sands, New Mexico. Want to know more about asteroids?

"New York (CNN)""Oh please, mind your language, show some restraint: it was not a French September 11!"" wrote Olivier Roy last week, in an otherwise nuanced article on the French Muslims and the emergence of extremists. This brilliant intellectual, a researcher on Islam, meant there was no comparison between the 17 victims of Paris and the nearly 3,000 dead in the United States 14 years ago. The size and intensity of the crime and trauma, the level of destruction, defies the comparison. But so do the consequences. French President François Hollande may have enjoyed a miraculous boost in the polls, he may pace on the deck of an aircraft carrier with a strange Bush-like swagger amid the chorus of sacred national union, but he won't bend the course of world history because of an attack on his territory. Still, he looks at France now and finds matters of tremendous reflections, along with some similarities. Coping with anger is one of them. In the 10 days after September 11, three innocent men were killed in Arizona, Texas and California, just because they looked Muslim in the eyes of the shooters. One was a Sikh store owner who was targeted because he wore a turban. France has had no murders but saw more anti-Muslim attacks -- ranging from insults to depredation of mosques -- in the rest of the country from January 7-20 than in all of France in 2014. Then there's the institutional furor. I remember vividly in 2001 the cases of Muslim foreigners deported for spurious reasons, such as mere accusations of having made anti-American statements, not even related to terrorism, in reported private conversations. Some were jailed in secret on the most outlandish suspicions. A Pakistani man with heart disease, locked up under the pretext of his overstaying a visitor's visa, died alone in a New Jersey cell of a heart attack. Others were forgotten behind bars for months. The Cartesian French may have criticized America's hysteria at the time, but they have little to brag about lately. A week after the Charlie Hebdo attack more than 50 individuals had already been charged  -- and 10 of them sentenced to prison terms -- for the crime of incitation to terrorism. One of them is a man arrested for driving under the influence who got a 14-month sentence, due in part to his previous arrests, after mentioning the fate of the three police officers killed. Another is a man with psychiatric problems who received three months for his rants, even though the prosecution itself recognized his place was less in prison than in a treatment facility. French comic Dieudonné, accused of anti-Semitism, which he denies, but convicted nine times for inciting racial hatred and similar charges, will be judged by an anti-terror court for his apparent condoning on Facebook of Amedy Coulibaly, the killer at the kosher store in east Paris. Dieudonné is a pathetic merchant of hate -- not a terrorist. Neither seem to be six other people sent to prison, one of them for two years, for their ugly posts on social network, in accordance with the same law originally aimed at jihadist propagandists on the Internet. After September 11, Americans resented ""having been too kind"" in the prevention of terrorism, and many commentators urge Paris not to fall into the trap of its own patriot act. But the French have long had a set of anti-terror laws that have been the envy of America's police and intelligence departments. Attacks by opposition politicians stating that the legal hurdles of France's ""soft on crime"" and ""socialist"" government -- which they claim prevented phone taps of the terrorists -- are a joke. Our police let the terrorists off the hook this summer for a number of reasons. Firstly, they had nothing on them but petty violations of counterfeit laws. Secondly, they had plenty of other fish to fry -- namely 5,000 other potential French jihadists whose tracking would demand a minimum of 10 detectives per suspect. There's also the fact that more than 900 people have left France to join the ranks of ISIS in Iraq and Syria -- a mindboggling number. America discovered in 2001 the extent of the hate brewing in the Muslim world through the acts of 19 killers -- some of whom had spent more than a year in their country. France has to look inward, which may be even more painful, and scrutinize the three ""children of the republic"" born and raised in its civilization. And it does. One of the first moves by the government was to grant citizenship in a week after the supermarket attack to the young Muslim employee, an immigrant from Mali, who had hidden captives during the siege at the kosher store. The second was for Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who emigrated from Spain as a child, to decry the ""apartheid"" France's Muslim population suffers. The word may be shocking, but it conveys, officially for once, the long known reality of our ghettos, the failure of integration in France and the incapacity of our school system. Racism? France had and still has its share of bigots, theoreticians and enforcers of the worst discriminations. But this shows more simply what American liberals would call ""a lack of sensitivity"" -- an incapacity, being such a diverse society, to accept that the cultural rules of the white male majority may not be entirely palatable, or accessible, by other members of the population. Sexism, denied in the name of the rejection of American-style political correctness, is an example. Race and culture barriers are another manifestation of this orchestrated blindness. At a moment when ghettos promote the surge of religious devotion as a remedy to the denial of ""Frenchness,"" the gap is getting even wider, and the rage more dangerous in the eyes of the most violent of the downtrodden and hopeless. The so-called ""Laicité,"" the official secularism of the French Republic, bears a deep responsibility. The concept has always been a political expedient, an offshoot of anti-clericalism that justified even in part the denial of the right to vote for women until 1945, out of fear their obedience to the Catholic Church would endanger the Republic. It has later, for too long, been directed at the most different and disadvantaged immigrant population from the Maghreb region. A glorious façade of the denial of differences, one which let discriminations and injustice fester for decades, prevented any affirmative action or simple recognition of diversity. Long before September 11, Bill Clinton, speaking of race and class relations, said that ""there is nothing bad in America that cannot be solved with what is good in America."" The same must be true in France as the horror of January makes us look at the truth about our country.","France has had no murders but has seen more anti-Muslim violence since Paris attacks .

Padgett killed one student this week at Reynolds High School in Troutdale, about 12 miles east of Portland. He also injured a teacher, before turning the gun on himself. ""I, Michael Padgett and my ex-wife, Kristina, are grieved in our hearts for the tragic event that involved our beloved son Jared at Reynolds High School. We are finding it very difficult to put into words our state of mind and emotions,"" the father wrote in a letter he gave to CNN affiliate KPTV. He offered condolences to the family of the student his son killed, 14-year-old Emilio Hoffman, and apologized to the teacher. Authorities have said there is no known link between Padgett and his victims. They have declined to comment on a possible motive. ""We are at a loss as to how and why this tragedy unfolded.

"Washington (CNN)Neera Tanden, one of Hillary Clinton's longtime confidants and former policy adviser, dropped whatever coyness was left regarding the former secretary of state's all-but-certain presidential run at an event on Tuesday night. Addressing an audience of about 150 people at an Asian-American and Pacific Islander Ready for Hillary event, Tanden -- president of the Center for American Progress -- said she was looking forward to seeing everyone in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada. ""I am really exited for these next two years. With any Clinton adventure, it is a roller coaster. It is going to be very exciting,"" Tanden said. ""She is really going to need all of us to step up, step in, be involved, fight for her, be a voice for her."" Tanden closed the speech with a call to action for the crowd by referencing Clinton's failed 2008 campaign. ""I look forward to seeing you on the campaign trail, in Iowa. I still have PTSD,"" she said, referring to the fact that Clinton finished third in the caucus. ""So maybe I will be spending my time in New Hampshire, Nevada. I will say one thing about Hillary, she always remembers, she always remembers her friends, in good times and in bad, so I know it will be an adventure, but I am glad we will all be doing it together."" Tanden, who has worked with Clinton since 1997, is very close with the former first lady. The two regularly speak and because of their relationship, Tanden has been sheepish in the past to comment on her possible 2016 run. When Clinton ran for Senate in 2000, Tanden was her deputy campaign manager and issues director and went on to serve as legislative director in Clinton's Senate office. When Clinton ran for president, Tanden served as policy director and adviser. ""When you are making decisions, whether you are secretary of state, or senator, first lady, or future president, it matters who is at that table,"" Tanden said at the event. ""I can tell you, we will be at that table if she is president."" Rachel Rosen, a spokeswoman for the Center for American Progress, said that Tanden was ""kidding about spending time in those states — she's not going anywhere."" SEE ALSO: Clinton prepares for 2016 with staff picks, meetings . ""Neera wasn't saying [Clinton] would run, but what it would be like if she did run,"" she said. Of course, it is the worst kept secret in Washington that Clinton is running for president. In the past two months, the former first lady has hired a number of top staffers and been meeting with advisers to chat out a strategic course for a presidential run. Tanden has not said whether or not she would leave the think-tank and join the likely Clinton campaign. The Washington Post reported in 2013 that Tanden would not return to a hypothetical campaign. Politico, on the other hand, reported that Tanden was ""likely to play an informal role if she [Clinton] runs."" The think-tank president has been equally coy about whether or not Clinton will run at all. ""I honestly believe that whoever runs for president,""  Tanden told the Post, ""is going to have to have a vision of how to grow this economy in a way that's more shared than it has been.""

"Japanese fishermen have captured a rare albino dolphin and killed 11 other dolphins in a shallow cove, according to conservation activists protesting the hunt. The albino dolphin currently sits in a small holding pen where it is being trained to eat dead fish and adapt to human interaction, said members of the Sea Shepherd conservationist group, which monitors dolphin hunts in the region. They speculate the rare dolphin will be sold for up to $500,000 to be displayed in captivity. The controversial hunt takes place annually between September and March in Taiji, Japan. Most dolphins are killed for their meat, while some are sold live to aquariums around the world. Locals defend the hunt, a long-held tradition, as no different than slaughtering any other animal for meat. But activists say the hunt is driven by greed. ""This brutal hunt is carnage carried out in the name of profit, not culture,"" said Melissa Sehgal, a Sea Shepherd campaign coordinator. ""These dolphins do not belong to Japan; they belong to the ocean."" The group says that 15 pods of Risso's dolphins have been slaughtered in the cove since this year's hunting season began, with approximately 170 Risso's dolphins killed. The Taiji Town Office declined CNN's request for comment on Sea Shepherd's newest report. READ MORE: Dolphins killed as Taiji's controversial hunting season resumes .

"While senior U.S. officials say they are now less worried about Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki launching a coup to stay in power, they still predict he'll try to obstruct the political process to keep his designated successor, Haider al-Abadi, out of office. One senior U.S. official compared al-Maliki to former President Richard Nixon -- a paranoid leader who grew more mercurial as his political fortunes collapsed. Al-Maliki has vowed to fight al-Abadi's nomination. Al-Maliki could bide his time and try to divide Iraqi politicians to make it difficult for al-Abadi to muster enough support to form a government over the next 30 days as Iraq's Constitution outlines. But the officials say they don't think he has enough backing to do that. A large portion of the Shia bloc, including most of his own party, is behind al-Abadi, and that gives the United States some confidence a government can be formed within the prescribed time frame. Iraq's political power struggle reached a breaking point on Monday when President Fuad Masum named al-Abadi, the deputy speaker of Parliament, to replace al-Maliki. President Barack Obama publicly endorsed al-Abadi, calling his nomination a ""promising step forward."" Both Obama and Vice President Joe Biden called him to express their support. As a further incentive to quickly form a new government, the Obama administration is promising additional financial and military support in its fight in northern Iraq against the Islamic State, militants formerly known as ISIS. Airstrikes and airdrops . Secretary of State John Kerry said in Australia on Tuesday the United States ""stands ready to fully support a new inclusive Iraqi government."" Despite frustrations with al-Maliki's leadership, the United States has increased military aid to his government over the past year to combat militants. That assistance has been stepped up over the past two months as ISIS forces claimed large areas of territory in northern Iraq in a brutal campaign. Just last week, Obama ordered airstrikes against militant positions and humanitarian airdrops to aid thousands of the Yazzidi minority under threat from the extremist group and trapped in the Sinjar Mountains. On Tuesday, he decided to send more than 100 additional military advisers to that region in a move the United States said was necessary to look at additional humanitarian relief options. Washington has sought to separate the need for urgent support to combat militants from support for al-Maliki. The administration is also helping covertly arm Kurdish Peshmerga forces battling ISIS. More help possible . Kerry said the United States was ""prepared to consider additional political, economic and security options as Iraq starts to build a new government"" noting that the aid was ""very much calculated to try to stabilize the security situation, expand economic development and strengthen the democratic institutions."" The United States has been encouraged by unprecedented cooperation between the Iraqi military and Kurdish forces in fighting ISIS and helping the civilians in the north. Officials said it gives them hope that Iraq's long-divided ethnic groups are finally uniting in the wake of the Islamic State threat. But with its military support, Washington also risks fueling Iraq's sectarian divide. Between additional backing for a new Iraqi Shia-led government and its direct support for the Kurds, the United States risks pushing Iraq's Sunni population toward the Islamic State, which is also Sunni, because they will see that support as taking sides in what is widely viewed as a civil war. And with Sunnis already disenfranchised from the Shia-led government, U.S. airstrikes are only likely to exacerbate those political differences. Al-Abadi is a Shia, from the same party as al-Maliki, serving at one time as his aide. But can he unite the country and fight off the sweeping Islamic State advance? ""Abadi has never been involved in personal controversy, he is someone who really has tried to tow a straight line,"" said Kurt Sowell, editor of the newsletter Inside Iraqi Politics. ""I think he is someone who will try to be inclusive and work with people. But at same time he's never been someone to push for reform."" Showing political skills . While al-Abadi may not be viewed as a transformational figure, the United States has been impressed with the way he stood up to al-Maliki politically and accumulated support of many Shia. ""Sometimes what is needed is a good bureaucrat who can get things back on track,"" one senior State Department official said. ""We don't need anymore personalities."" What happens, however, if al-Maliki is able to keep al-Abadi from forming a government? Iraqi politicans would be back to Square One and the United States would be forced to choose between supporting al-Maliki's caretaker government, despite its stated reservations about him, or waiting until a new prime minister is designated who can form a government.

"(CNN)For several days after receiving a letter from the Indonesian president rejecting his plea for clemency, Myuran Sukumaran couldn't paint. ""I felt really sorry for him,"" said award-winning Australian artist Ben Quilty, who has been mentoring Sukuamaran, a convicted drug smuggler, in Bali's Kerobokan prison since late 2011. ""But I also said, 'Myuran, what are you doing? Are you just going to sit around and wait for this? You've got nothing else to do, go back to work and start making paintings.'"" So he did. In the last week or so, Sukumaran has thrown himself into his painting and the prison art classes he set up and leads five days a week. He knows that in the days or weeks ahead, he could be led out of his cell with Andrew Chan, his co-conspirator in a failed 2005 drug plot, blindfolded and shot by an Indonesian firing squad. The men, now aged 33 and 31, can only wait and hope that a final legal bid succeeds in saving their lives. Later this week, the men's Indonesian lawyers hope to file what's known as a PK to request a second judicial review. Australian lawyer Julian McMahon said there's a ""strong basis"" for another review to be granted. ""The first PK was filed four years ago and was eventually rejected, however, so the next step was the clemency process under the clemency law and the constitution,"" McMahon said. However, he said that while the matter was being considered by the offices of the previous and current president, the law changed to allow for a second judicial review. He said,  ""It's not appropriate to file a second judicial review while the matter is sitting with the president. Now, that the letters from the president have rejected clemency, that enables the second judicial review to be brought on."" Lawyers will be pointing to evidence of the men's rehabilitation in prison. During their time behind bars, they've said to have become respected inmates who have built a support network for others around them. ""They're both behaving in a very dignified way,"" McMahon said, who visited them in prison as recently as Wednesday morning. ""They're looking after their families who are visiting and they're both working hard on the same things they've been doing for years; Myuran running an art class and Andrew running a prayer service."" President Joko Widodo has made it clear he won't be stepping in to save the pair -- the only two of the drug gang known as the Bali Nine who were sentenced to death. Widodo told CNN's Christiane Amanpour earlier this week, ""Every day we have 50 people die because of narcotics, of drugs. In one year, it's 18,000 people who die because of narcotics. We are not going to compromise for drug dealers. No compromise. No compromise."" The last time Quilty visited Sukumaran in his prison art class, he said the talented painter had already worked out a succession plan so the classes would continue without him. ""Last time I felt like he wasted an hour with me just talking through the logistics about how the classes would run if he's gone, which was very upsetting,"" Quilty said. ""He pointed out to me in the class quietly who the strong artists were, with the most future in the art practice. ""And he also introduced me to the two young Indonesian men who he's basically mentoring to take over his role if he's gone."" Last weekend, the families of both men made a public appeal for their lives to be spared. ""I'm confident that if (the Indonesian president) knows what they've done and how much they have changed, I'm sure he would not have the heart to order them to be executed,"" Myuran's mother, Raji Sukumaran, said tearfully. The men were arrested in Bali in 2005 after Australian Federal Police told Indonesian authorities that they'd received a tip-off. Four couriers with heroin strapped to the bodies were arrested with Chan as they tried to leave Indonesia. Sukumaran was detained in a Kuta hotel with three others who had been enlisted as mules. On Thursday night, a candlelight vigil organized by Quilty will be held in Sydney's Martin Place as a show of support for the two prisoners. Musicians will perform in a concert called ""Music for Mercy."" Quilty said it's not an attempt to convince the Indonesian authorities to spare them -- ""that's out of my hands"" -- but a personal tribute to his friend, and to show Sukumaran that he and Chan are not alone. ""It seemed like there was a very dark inevitability about what was going to happen to Myuran. And I thought, what can I do?"" ""I thought I can actually show the boys that there are people who care for them, just to give them a sense of dignity, I guess.""","Final legal challenge to be filed to save Australians on death row in Indonesia .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Boko Haram militants have killed scores in a series of raids on dozens of villages in northeast Nigeria's Adamawa state, continuing its violent campaign of terror in the African nation, a lawmaker said. For two weeks, Boko Haram gunmen have sacked dozens of villages in Michika district, close to the border with Cameroon, slaughtering male residents and abducting others, said Adamu Kamale, a lawmaker representing Michika district in the Adamawa state House of Assembly. ""They move house to house, killing people -- including the old, abducting women, and children and burning homes,"" ‎Kamale said Tuesday. He said villages are littered with bodies, and there is no one to bury them because residents have fled -- thousands of them, heading off into the mountains or across the border into Cameroon -- to escape the onslaught. ""They slaughter people like animals,"" he said. ‎""Now, 70% of the people in the district have been dislodged from the homes. Some of them have run into the mountains, while others have crossed into Cameroon or fled to Yola,"" the capital of Adamawa state, Kamale said. The villagers' ordeal is horrific but, sadly, nothing new for Boko Haram. The terrorist group, its name translating as ""Western education is sin,"" has been a force in Nigeria for years. It tries to use religion to justify its actions, which are aimed at imposing its strict version of of Sharia law in Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Boko Haram has intensified its attacks in recent years, standing defiant against the Nigerian military. And it hasn't gone after only government troops or officials, with civilians often becoming victims. The group has been tied to a spate of assassinations, market bombings, attacks on churches and unaffiliated mosques and raids of villages, including those earlier this month in Michika district. Mass kidnappings have also been part of its playbook, most notoriously the taking of more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok last April. Boys and young men have been abducted as well, including 40 between the ages of 10 and 23 reportedly taken captive on New Year's Eve in Borno state, and 97 others kidnapped in and around the village of Doron Baga in August. And whether or not they were former captives, Boko Haram may be boasting about its use of child soldiers in its fight. An organization calling itself Boko Haram's official mouthpiece this week even promoted an alleged military training camp for children on its Twitter feed, posting images of children in formation holding AK-47 weapons. While CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the photos, intelligence sources said the images appear to be real and are consistent with the Islamist extremist group's strategy of forcibly recruiting and training children. And the U.S. State Department lent credibility to the report by tweeting a photo of the young, heavily armed children along with these words: ""Amid its massacres of innocents, Boko Haram running training camps for child soldiers."" The release of these photos and the new Twitter account appear to coincide with an ever-more sophisticated media strategy on the part of Boko Haram.  The change in  tactics appears to emulate ISIS, even down to the use of Islamic chants, or nasheeds. Last week, a video was posted on the same account purporting to be an interview with Boko Haram's spokesman. Both the interviewer and the subject were masked and the production values were  far more sophisticated than anything the terror group has published before. Boko Haram's campaign has left thousands of Nigerians in danger -- in some cases with the central government and others seemingly unable to help. The latest bloodshed began in Michika township, which Boko Haram took over in September and declared to be part of its caliphate. The insurgents then moved into villages including Murva, Bororo, Ghumci, Garta-Kasa, Kamale, Boka, Futu and Kwabaride‎. Humanitarian workers have been unable to reach residents who fled into the mountains, said Mohammed Kanar, head of the National Emergency Management Agency for northeast Nigeria. ""We are aware there are people trapped in the mountains but they are inaccessible. The security situation is a challenge in reaching them and offering them humanitarian assistance,"" Kanar said. Kamale said the military has not responded to complaints that he and other community leaders lodged, calling for its intervention. ""Sometimes we alert the military when they are advancing on villages before they attack, but no action is taken to stop them,"" he said. ""These insurgents have been killing with impunity. When they attack a village, they will sleep there for the night after the slaughter and move on the next morning,"" the lawmaker said. There has been no reaction from the military to Kamale's specific allegation. Amnesty International on Wednesday leveled a similar accusation, saying it had evidence that the Nigerian military was warned repeatedly about impending Boko Haram attacks on civilians late last year on Bogo and Monguno. ""These attacks are an urgent wake-up call for the Nigerian leadership, the African Union and the international community,"" said Amnesty's Netsanet Belay. ""It is essential to protect hundreds of thousands of civilians in northeast Nigeria from Boko Haram's continued onslaught."" The Nigerian Defense Ministry responded by calling the allegation ""misleading,"" saying that Amnesty's use of ""these unfortunate activities of terrorists to find fault with the counterterrorism operations, as usual, is inaccurate and unfair."" The Defense Ministry said its forces have enhanced their intelligence abilities, troop deployment and coordination, and logistics capabilities. ""In actual fact, the protection of civilian populations is the essence of the entire counterterrorism operation,"" the ministry said. ""... Indeed, the troops were prepared and duly engaged the terrorists in all the instances referred to by Amnesty International."" Journalist  Aminu Abubakar reported from Nigeria, and CNN's Greg Botelho wrote this report from Atlanta.

"Rock Hill, South Carolina (CNN)A long walk for justice will end soon for nine African-American men who pioneered the ""jail, no bail"" strategy during the lunch counter protests of the civil rights movement. The men, dubbed the Friendship Nine after the Rock Hill, South Carolina, college that eight of them attended, were looking to make a statement about the plight of the segregated South. And that's just what they did. On Wednesday, the attorney who represented the men almost 5½ decades ago is scheduled to return to court to have their names cleared. In a poetic twist, Circuit Court Judge John C. Hayes III, who will preside over the hearing, is the nephew of the judge who originally sentenced these largely unsung civil rights heroes. The prosecutor who pushed for this momentous day, 16th Circuit Solicitor Kevin Brackett of Rock Hill, leans on a quote from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. when asked why he was motivated to take up the cause of the Friendship Nine: ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice."" Lunch counter protests had become the cause celebre the year before, in 1960, just two hours up the road in Greensboro, North Carolina. African-Americans, many of them students, sought to break the barrier of segregated lunch counters by sitting in ""white-only"" sections. As the protests spread from Greensboro to other parts of the South, protesters were arrested and charged. Civil rights groups had to pay the mounting bails and fines that the protesters were incurring. The men of Friendship College wondered whether paying fines and bail -- to the very people who were oppressing them, no less -- was the best course of action. Rather than pay the $100 for their release, the men felt they could make a more profound statement by accepting the full punishment for trespassing: 30 days of hard labor. ""It showed that this was a moral crusade against injustice,"" Rolundus Rice of The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta said. ""Most of the support came from working-class African-Americans, so it was very expensive to bail out a lot of protesters. So, in a sense, what they did is turn the system on its head. So if you are going to incarcerate me, you are going to pay for it,"" Rice said. On the evening of January 30, 1961, Clarence Graham, a student at Friendship and civil rights organizer, sat down to write a letter to his parents. ""By the time you read this, I suppose you both will be upset and probably angry, but I hope not. I couldn't tell you, but this morning I wanted to, but just didn't know how."" He and his cohorts had been planning for months. They were ready on the morning of January 31, 1961, and just after 11 a.m., they arrived at McCrory's 5-10-25 cent Variety Store in downtown Rock Hill. Local authorities had caught wind of their plans and awaited their arrival. The men stood outside, protesting for a spell before entering. The details of exactly what happened inside were disputed in court, but what is known is that 10 men walked in and -- in defiance of the era's Jim Crow laws -- sat at the counter where people of their skin color were forbidden. They were taken to jail, where they sat until their quick trial on trespassing charges. ""Try to understand that what I am doing is right,"" Graham wrote to his parents before his arrest. ""It's not like going to jail for a crime like stealing, killing, etc., but we're going for the betterment of all colored people."" They spent the night thinking and praying, hoping that what they did next would shock the conscience of a nation. Ernest Finney, a young African-American civil rights attorney from the area, represented the group. Records of the trial have long since been destroyed, so it's not clear who said what in the courtroom, but the group was found guilty and offered a choice of paying a $100 fine or being sent to a labor camp for 30 days. Nine of the men chose the labor camp. One chose the fine. ""Jailers and the municipalities were receiving these funds to perpetuate the oppression, right?"" Rice asked. ""It was a practical reason behind the 'jail, no bail' (movement)."" The men were shipped out to the York County Prison Farm to begin their sentences, but according to local news reports, many of the Friendship Nine were sent to solitary confinement. Pictures from local newspapers document how the prison farm became a rallying point for protesters. It was a shot in the arm for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Congress of Racial Equality and NAACP, Rice said, because the authorities were saying, ""OK, we have to have another strategy to confront this."" The group served 28 days at the camp and was released early -- not for good behavior, but because local officials wanted to get them out before the national press arrived. On Wednesday, the national press will shine a spotlight on the men, in a reminder of the country's checkered history on civil rights. Hayes is expected to right the wrong of his uncle by clearing the men's names and vacating their sentences. Author Kimberly Johnson, who wrote a children's book about the men, ""No Fear for Freedom,"" was integral in getting the Friendship Nine's case on the court docket. She met the still-living members of the Friendship Nine at a local restaurant in 2011, and after listening to their story, found herself surprised that she had never heard of them. ""I was proud to be African-American because I looked at them and thought what a wonderful thing they had done to open the path for me as a children's author,"" she told CNN. ""I know I would not be where I am today if folks before me had not forged the way, so I was very honored to be in their presence."" After reading a speech from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. addressing how demonstrators arrested for nonviolent protests weren't disobedient in the broad sense of the word, but rather, ""just being disobedient to the immorality of what that law represented,"" she began thinking about what she could do to help vindicate the Friendship Nine, she said. She shared her thoughts with Brackett and asked whether the men could get a pardon, a request Brackett had field before. But he had his reservations. ""A pardon is an act of forgiveness, and what these guys needed wasn't forgiveness because they didn't do anything wrong. What these guys needed was justice, and a pardon didn't really speak to the underlying problems with the fact of the conviction in the first place."" Having their convictions vacated would attack those underlying issues head-on, he felt, and while he's proud to be able to ""play some small part in history"" by exonerating the men, don't call him a hero. ""The real act of heroism was done by these men 54 years ago,"" he said. The men of the Friendship Nine, based on their activities and accomplishments both during and after their 1961 stand, are an impressive bunch. Here's a little about them from James Felder, author of ""Civil Rights in South Carolina: From Peaceful Protests to Groundbreaking Rulings"": . -- John Gaines was the NAACP president at Friendship during the 1961 protests. He went on to get his law degree at Howard University in Washington, then joined the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. He is now retired and living in Florence, South Carolina. -- Thomas Gaither was a CORE field organizer who traveled to Rock Hill to help organize the protests. He is the only one who did not attend Friendship. In the summer of 1961, he helped organize the Freedom Riders in the South. After a stint in the Army, he became a biology professor. He is now retired and lives in Pennsylvania. -- Clarence Henry Graham was CORE's chief organizer. After school, he joined the Air Force, then went on to become a social worker for South Carolina. He has now retired and lives in Rock Hill. -- W.T. ""Dub"" Massey graduated from Friendship and went on to get his master's degree from nearby Winthrop University. He spent his career teaching in public schools. He's now semiretired (he still picks up a class or two as a substitute teacher). -- Robert McCullough, the valedictorian of his high school before going to Friendship, was known by many as ""brilliant"" and was a natural leader for the group.  After college, he joined the Air Force. He earned degrees from Winthrop University in business administration and political science before returning to Friendship to teach. McCullough died in 2006 at age 64. -- Willie McCleod was involved in the protest movement before coming to Friendship. After college, he volunteered for the Army and came home to Rock Hill after his service and started a business. He lives in Rock Hill and occasionally speaks to community groups about the events of the 1960s. -- James Wells graduated from Friendship and went on to enlist in the Air Force. After his time in the military, he went back to school and earned a law degree from the University of Illinois. He practiced law in Columbia, South Carolina, before retiring in Rock Hill. -- David Williamson Jr. moved to the North after school before returning to the Carolinas, where he became a banker and property manager. He has retired from full-time work but still works as a substitute teacher at Rock Hill schools. -- Mack Workman moved to New York after school and worked with troubled children as part of the state Office of Children and Family Services. He retired in 2006 and still lives in New York. CNN's Victor Blackwell and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.","The members of the Friendship Nine were convicted of trespassing in 1961 for a lunch counter sit-in .

"Moscow (CNN)As Alexander Litvinenko lay dying on his bed in a London hospital in November 2006, he was in no doubt as to who was to blame for his imminent death. The 43-year-old former Russian agent turned Kremlin critic pointed his finger directly at Vladimir Putin, then as now, Russia's strongman president. ""You may succeed in silencing me but that silence comes at a price,"" Litvinenko said in the statement from his deathbed. ""You may succeed in silencing one man but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr. Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life."" READ MORE: Did Russia put polonium in spy's tea? It's an allegation the Kremlin has never really managed to shake off. Officials have always dismissed the charge as ""nonsense,"" but suspicions linger. The Kremlin's case isn't much helped by the compelling evidence against it. The poison used to kill Litvinenko is a rare radioactive isotope, polonium-210. It occurs naturally, but scientists say the high concentrations found in the Litvinenko case indicate production at a nuclear reactor, or perhaps a particle accelerator. The kinds of facilities, in other words, controlled by a state. Russia isn't the only country capable of producing polonium-210. But the radioactive trail left by the substance -- literally a trail of detectable radioactive material -- was traced across London, while three British Airways aircraft that had flown a number of routes, including London to Moscow, were reported to be contaminated with small traces of an unnamed radioactive substance. The two prime suspects in the poisoning, Andrei Lugavoi and Dmitry Kovtun, are Russian nationals. Both are former agents of the Russian security services. But both deny involvement and the Russian government refuses to extradite either to Britain to face trial. Litvinenko had many enemies. He was a former agent of the Russian Federal Security Service, the FSB, the post-Soviet successor of the feared KGB. His last job at the agency was heading up its anti-corruption department. It was in the chaos of the 1990s, in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union that may well have brought him into conflict with ruthless colleagues. After leaving the FSB, he blamed the service for orchestrating a series of apartment bombings in Russia in 1999 that left hundreds dead and led to Russia's invasion of Chechnya later that year. Litvinenko's wife also claimed her husband was in the pay of the British security services after moving to the UK in 2000. All or any of the above may have been sufficient reason to kill a man seen by his former FSB colleagues as a traitor. There are some questions that even the public inquiry now underway in Britain may never be able to answer. Why, for instance was polonium-210 chosen to kill Litvinenko? It would have been a costly and complicated task to produce the quantity used in the murder. A bullet would have been much cheaper. Perhaps the killers hoped it would not have been detected by British investigators. Or perhaps they wanted to send a message, pointing the police towards an executioner they knew would never be held to account? But the biggest question of all is whether the killing was ordered by the state, or was the work of rogue elements within it. Perhaps only President Putin, himself a former KGB agent, has the answer to that.","Alexander Litvinenko died in 2006 after being poisoned by radioactive material .

"(CNN)It's like a plot line ripped from the scripts of ""The Walking Dead"" -- if the show's cast were made up of cats and took place in Florida. A Tampa, Florida, cat found seemingly dead after he was hit by a car showed up alive in a neighbor's yard five days after he was buried. ""We have seen many amazing cases at our full-service veterinary clinic, but this situation may take the cake,"" the Humane Society Tampa Bay, where the cat underwent surgery Tuesday, said in a release. Bart, or ""zombie cat"" as the feline is now being referred to on social media, was discovered ""unresponsive"" by his owner last week lying in a pool of blood.  His body was cold and his face was severely disfigured. ""If we'd seen that cat on the road, we'd assumed he was dead,"" Nash McCuthchen with the Humane Society told CNN. Bart's owner, Ellis Hutson, along with the help of a neighbor, buried his beloved pet in his yard. Five days later, a different neighbor found Bart walking in her yard, after he seemingly clawed his way out of the grave. The neighbor returned the cat to Hutson, who called the Humane Society for help. Bart was in bad shape, McCutchen said, with maggots covering open wounds on his body, and he had difficulty walking.  The cat was dehydrated, his left eye ruined. But remarkably, McCutchen said, the kitty had no internal injuries, making the Humane Society able to treat him. Bart had surgery Wednesday to remove his left eye and wire his jaw shut. ""He seems to be a little fighter,"" McCutchen said. Despite all the trauma of getting hit by a car, being presumed dead and buried alive, McCutchen said Bart is a very friendly and affectionate cat.  He loves to be petted and purrs at visitors, she said. Bart is expected to recover and could return to his owner as early as next week. Puppies?

"New York (CNN) -- The clock is ticking in Washington on the bipartisan super committee, those 12 members of Congress tasked with finding at least $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction by Thanksgiving. More than 140 of their colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, are encouraging them to be bold and go bigger -- reaching $4 trillion of deficit reduction in order to put the U.S. on stable long-term fiscal footing and avoid another round of downgrades. But if their colleagues' counsel isn't persuasive, there's an additional voice the super committee could find inspiration from -- the original founding father, George Washington. In his farewell address to his fellow countrymen in 1796, George Washington set out his lessons for future generations. It was penned as the ""warnings of a parting friend,"" and in it, Washington laid out the long-term dangers that his understanding of history and human nature dictated could undermine the independence of our democratic republic. Washington warned about the dangers of what we would today call hyper-partisans: ""They serve to organize faction, to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put, in the place of the delegated will of the nation, the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community."" These platoons of polarization have driven us to the paralysis we are now in, too often unable to reason together even in the face of crisis. Crucially, Washington understood that out-of-control debt could undermine American independence. He warned that we must ""cherish public credit ... avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertion in time of peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear."" Put on your decoder rings and you'll see that Washington's wisdom could have referred to our own time. After all, much -- though certainly not all -- of the deficits and debts accumulated over the past decade came from two foreign wars. The Afghan war was necessary in retaliation for the attacks of 9/11 -- but the war in Iraq, as we now know, was far from ""unavoidable"" -- it was a war of choice. Moreover, as Sen. John McCain and others pointed out, it was the first time in U.S. history that we did not raise revenues in order to pay for wars. Instead we cut taxes and turned a hard-won surplus into a deficit, which grew exponentially after the stimulus bill under President Obama. George Washington understood that dealing with debts was government's responsibility, but leaders would be unlikely to make unpopular choices in a democracy unless the public was both enlightened and understanding: ""The execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives,"" he said -- meaning the members of Congress. ""But it is necessary that public opinion should co-operate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should practically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must be revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant."" In other words, man up and deal with math. Paying down debts means raising revenue as well as cutting costs. It is a basic profit and loss ledger. Whining endlessly about taxes ignores their central role in securing our civilization. So sayeth not some commie hippie but George Washington himself. That speaks to the impasse the super committee is at right now -- whether to include any revenue increases to pay down the deficit and the debt. Outright tax increases -- even restoring the Bush tax rates on people who make more than a million dollars a year -- is apparently not on the table right now. More ambitious tax reform is seen as a bridge too far given the limited time frame left. Nonetheless, there are some slight signs of progress. Sen. Pat Toomey -- former President of the Club for Growth -- deserves credit for recently saying he was open to revenue increases, albeit combined with the reduction of the top tax rate from 35 to 28 percent. This was met with some derision from Democrats who are increasingly hearing from their constituents that the growing gap between the rich and poor in the nation is unsustainable. Democrats have more readily crossed their partisan Rubicon, offering support for modest entitlement reforms as a way of bending the long-term cost curve. The most hopeful declaration of independence that has occurred in recent weeks is the growing number of Republicans willing to break ranks with anti-tax absolutists. They are putting the Pledge of Allegiance over the no-tax pledge advanced by conservative activist Grover Norquist. ""There is a lot of talk about pledges,"" Ohio Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette said. ""It's time to put the pledges in a bonfire."" In some ways what we face now is a choice between George Washington and the Grover Norquists of the world. It is a choice between the long-term national interest and the short-term special interest. The goals are clear and the path is known. We have the Bowles-Simpson Commission, the Rivlin-Domenici Commission and the Gang of Six plans to look at. We now have a Gang of 140 members of Congress from both parties encouraging the super committee to be bold and go big. While reaching $1.2 trillion in deficit reduction is far better than the automatic cuts to defense and discretionary spending that will take place if the super committee fails, it alone cannot be regarded as a success. It is a stay of execution. Because we'll be right back at the negotiating table in a few months, trying to forestall yet another downgrade. As the clocks ticks closer to the deadline, the super committee should have the words of George Washington's farewell address echoing in their heads, adding to their sense of urgency, determining not to ungenerously throw ""upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear."" If they are driven by such a sense of generational responsibility, they can declare independence from their respective special interests, forge a constructive compromise and present a balanced bipartisan plan that serves the national interest. They have it in their power to put patriotism over partisanship -- we are waiting to see if they have the will. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Debt super committee facing a pivotal choice for America's future .

"When the developers of the ""Uncharted"" video games sat down to brainstorm their latest adventure, the first thing they decided was that they had to have a cargo plane and a cruise ship. No matter that they didn't have a story, script or setting yet. The designers and programmers immediately went to work on what reviewers say are the most memorable scenes in ""Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception."" The PlayStation 3 game, published by Sony Computer Entertainment and developed by Naughty Dog, is set to hit stores on Tuesday. ""Yeah, that would be pretty cool. Let's do it,"" Naughty Dog co-president Christophe Balestra recalled saying then. In an interview this week, he and creative director Amy Hennig offered a look at his studio's unusual storyboarding process. Their goal at the start of each game's production is to ""try to come up with these set-piece moments that aren't just for show,"" Hennig said. ""In many ways, they become the signature pieces of the game."" Those segments also take the longest to plan and build, which is why they need to be conceived as early in the process as possible. A memorable scene from ""Uncharted 2: Among Thieves"" was planned in the same way. It involves a firefight atop a moving train, and it's a moment that is often referenced when reviewers compare the Uncharted games to blockbuster action films. Naughty Dog executives have said that the train scene took a long time to get right and that they considered cutting it in order to make Sony's launch deadline. After determining a game's centerpieces, Naughty Dog's brass then choose where the story will take place. They ask themselves, ""Where can we go that's physically different?"" Hennig said. Previous games have sent the protagonist, Nathan Drake, to uncharted territories that include jungles and snowy tundras. For ""Uncharted 3,"" the Drake character will explore sand dunes. Next, Hennig had the unenviable task of figuring out how in the story a giant boat fits together with a desert locale. ""I can't start off with a big script,"" she said. ""I'd rather be given the weird challenge of, 'OK, we're going to do a desert and a cruise ship. Figure out how.'"" Hennig is familiar with atypical assignments. At Electronic Arts in the early 1990s, she was the lead designer for ""Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City,"" a game that placed the basketball great into a Super Mario-style adventure, fiery basketballs in hand. (Hennig dodged working on a sister project called ""Shaq Fu,"" which has ranked on countless worst-video-game-of-all-time lists.) Naughty Dog takes pride in its games having ""character-driven stories,"" rather than employing mindless action or scattershot plots. Hennig spurns the use of a ""silent protagonist."" However, character development, which she says is the game's most important element, still has to bend to the parameters set earlier in the development process. ""The story has to be the most flexible thing in the whole production,"" Hennig said. ""It's way more like working on a television show."" It's a show that many people are tuning in to. ""Uncharted 2: Among Thieves"" has sold nearly 5 million copies. That beats the original game, which sold 3 million units, not a disappointment by most standards. The expectations are high for the upcoming game, and the initial reactions have been very positive. Still, the technical improvements in ""Uncharted 3"" aren't quite as drastic as the leap Naughty Dog made between the first and second games, Hennig said. The latest edition incorporates features the developer has wanted to have since the original, she said. ""We're pretty run down,"" Hennig said. ""Not only does it get physically harder as you get older, it gets emotionally and spiritually harder."" Naughty Dog doesn't expect to put out another game for at least two years, Hennig and Balestra said. (A different studio is making ""Uncharted: Golden Abyss"" for the PlayStation Vita.) They said executives haven't decided whether the next game will be part of the Uncharted franchise, or another Naughty Dog series like ""Crash Bandicoot"" or ""Jak and Daxter"" -- or something completely new. Whatever it is, you can bet the development process will begin with an epic helicopter flight or car chase or explosion of some sort.","Sony's ""Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception"" for PlayStation 3 hits stores on Tuesday .

"Air traffic control technology is getting a major upgrade in the United States that is scheduled to be completed in 2014, but the new systems are susceptible to potentially dangerous manipulation, according to a security researcher. The actual flaws might seem mild compared to everyone's worst fears and common Hollywood plot lines. Planes cannot be forced from the sky or dangerously redirected. But the researcher says the system can be tricked into seeing aircraft that are not actually there. Messages sent using the system are not encrypted or authenticated, meaning anyone with the basic technology and know-how could identify a plane and see its location. Computer scientist Andrei Costin, a Ph.D. student at Eurecom, gave a talk on the weaknesses of the new air traffic system at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday. He did not mention any known hacks of the system, but did demonstrate the potential negative scenarios. Old radar systems are being replaced with a new technology called Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast system, or ADS-B. The traditional radars work by sending a signal that triggers an aircraft's responder to send back its position. The new system uses the global satellite navigation system to continuously broadcast the locations of planes. The information is sent to other aircraft and ground stations; the ground station sends the location to air traffic controllers. The new system will open up this flight information to a new player: the general public. ""There are various applications which you can go to and basically see, online, in real time, all the airplanes which broadcast their information,"" said Costin. According to Costin, the chance of these security holes being exploited for terrorism is unlikely, but he says they still have the potential to be used by pranksters, paparazzi and military intelligence organizations interested in tracking private aircraft or confusing air traffic control systems on the ground. Intercepting the messages, jamming the system or attacking it by adding false information does not require advanced technology; the necessary software-defined radio retails for under $800. One of the technology's makers downplayed the threat. ""We are quite familiar with the theory that ADS-B could be 'spoofed,' or barrage jammed by false targets. There's little new here. In fact, just about any radio frequency device can be interfered with somewhat,"" said Skip Nelson, the president of ADS-B Technologies, which is one of many companies making these components. ""I obviously can't comment on countermeasures, but you should know that this issue has been thoroughly investigated and international aviation does have a plan."" In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said it already has a process in place for addressing potential threats to the system, and it does conduct ongoing assessments of vulnerabilities: ""An FAA ADS-B security action plan identified and mitigated risks and monitors the progress of corrective action. These risks are security sensitive and are not publicly available."" The FAA has sunk millions of dollars into the system. The benefits of the ADS-B are that it will show more precise locations of aircraft and pilots will have access to more information about surrounding aircraft while in the air. The FAA also says it is more environmentally friendly by making flight routes more direct and saving on fuel. Given the large time and financial investment, the FAA is not going to abandon the new technology. However, it isn't throwing out the old system completely, just in case. ""The FAA plans to maintain about half of the current network of secondary radars as a backup to ADS-B in the unlikely event it is needed,"" the FAA said in its statement.","Researcher: Hackers could trick new air traffic control systems into seeing fake aircraft .
The new system will be rolled out in the United States by 2014 .

"Republican presidential candidates Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann said at Saturday's foreign policy debate that they would renew the use of waterboarding, the controversial practice banned by President Barack Obama. ""I don't see it as torture. I see it as an enhanced interrogation technique,"" Cain said. His comments were met with loud cheers of support from the debate audience. Bachmann, meanwhile, called the practice ""very effective"" and said Obama ""is allowing the ACLU to run the CIA."" After the debate, Romney aides told CNN that he does not believe waterboarding is torture. But this issue doesn't divide neatly along party lines. During the debate candidates Ron Paul and Jon Huntsman outright opposed the practice. ""Waterboarding is torture,"" Paul said. ""It's really un-American to accept, on principle, that we will torture people that we capture."" The next day both Sen. John McCain and President Obama criticized the pro-waterboarding rhetoric and reaffirmed their opposition to the practice. The United States has also been historically inconsistent on this issue. Although the use of waterboarding was widespread in the aftermath of 9/11, in the aftermath of World War II the United States not only condemned but prosecuted and convicted a number of Japanese troops and officials for subjecting United States troops to waterboarding. So which is it: Illicit torture or an acceptable interrogation practice? And how should we decide? Recently my colleagues Mary-Hunter McDonnell, visiting assistant professor of law at Northwestern, and George Loewenstein, a behavioral economist at Carnegie-Mellon, and I examined the psychology behind how we evaluate enhanced interrogation tactics. Our experiments revealed several insights that can inform the debate on waterboarding and other so-called enhanced interrogation techniques. Most countries define torture in terms of pain severity. For example, the United Nations Convention Against Torture, of which America is one of many signatories, abjures the use of torture, which it defines as ""any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person."" This means that, legally speaking, whether waterboarding is illicit torture or an acceptable interrogation practices depends on the amount pain and suffering waterboarding inflicts. Because most policymakers have never experienced waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation tactics for themselves (Sen. McCain aside), they must rely on their inexperienced intuitions about how painful these practices seem. This task has become all the more difficult with the advent of enhanced interrogation techniques such as prolonged sleep deprivation, social isolation, and exposure to cold temperatures, which are designed to induce physical and psychological distress without inflicting enduring harm. Yet over the past 15 years, psychologists have discovered that people who aren't enduring a painful experience have a hard time estimating just how painful it is. This finding is known as an empathy gap, and it helps to explain why doctors underestimate their patients' pain and why patients themselves underestimate how painful upcoming procedures will be. To test the idea that empathy gaps might distort the evaluation of torture policy, we asked people to evaluate common enhanced interrogation tactics like sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, and exposure to cold temperatures. Some participants (the control group) evaluated these practices under normal conditions, while others (the experimental group) made their judgments while experiencing a mild version of the pain associated with those techniques. These participants submerged their hand in ice water (exposure to cold temperatures), felt social exclusion by being rejected by a group (solitary confinement), and were tested at the end of a three-hour night class (sleep deprivation). In each case the experimental group estimated the interrogation tactics to be significantly more painful, less ethical, and less acceptable as a practice than participants who made their judgments free of pain, as policymakers normally would. These findings suggest that policymakers (and the concerned public) suffer from a fundamental bias when evaluating waterboarding and other interrogation tactics. It appears that the legal standard for evaluating torture is psychologically untenable. Policymakers simply cannot appreciate the severity of interrogation practices they themselves have not experienced, a psychological constraint that in effect encourages torture. Indeed, in several well-publicized incidents, public figures who denied that waterboarding was torture volunteered to experience it themselves, and almost instantly changed their minds. In combination, a range of empirical evidence points to the need for a more restrictive legal standard for evaluating the ethicality of interrogation techniques.","Three GOP presidential candidates say waterboarding is not a form of torture .
So which is it: Illicit torture or an acceptable interrogation practice? asks Loran Nordgren .

"(CNN)Even two-tonne, spike-horned, armor-skinned rhinos need a helping hand sometimes. Fortunately, they can rely on one committed defender: eight-year-old Alyssa Carter. ""When I heard that rhinos were being killed, they were my favorite animals and I wanted to start this,"" says the elementary school pupil. Her campaign, Alyssa's Save the Rhinos, has raised thousands of dollars to protect her favorite animal -- South Africa's poacher-threatened rhinoceros -- and fund an innovative scheme aimed at tracking the hunters who would do them harm. Carter, South Africa National Parks one-and-only ""Rhino Champion,"" sells homemade chocolates for 10 rand ($0.85) at her school. So far, she has raised over $23,000 through a combination of chocolate sales and donations from the growing number of people -- young and old -- who have filled halls to hear the young campaigner speak. Picture perfect . It all started in May 2013 when Carter -- then aged six-and-a-half -- came home from school and drew a picture: the same crayon image of long-horned rhino beneath a rainbow that is now stamped on her campaign's sweets and chocolate. Her father, Brian Carter, says she'd been taught about the plight of endangered animals, and burst out crying when she heard rhinos were being butchered by poachers. At home that night, the family resolved to do something to help, settling on the chocolates as a good place to start. Her father was her first customer. ""Originally she just wanted to do something to help,"" he says. ""The idea was to sell to anybody that would buy, so we started off by selling to friends and family, grannies and grandpas and people at church."" For over a year, she has been selling chocolates every Friday at her supportive Johannesburg primary school -- and has now grown her stall with rhino-branded lollipops, stickers, biltong, and a range of knitted rhino toys created by a well-wisher who had heard about her fundraising efforts. Carter knows her most enthusiastic customers: singling out one particularly generous schoolmistress, Teacher Phuti, and an exceptionally sweet-toothed class of her schoolmates as her biggest supporters. Dogs take bite out of poaching . ""What Alyssa wanted to do was to give the money toward buying trained sniffer dogs to go into the Kruger National Park,"" says dad Brian. There, across an area the size of New Jersey, park rangers fight a desperate battle with poachers to prevent the extinction of the rhinoceros, whose horn is prized for its supposed value in traditional Asian medicines. Highly trained canines are a new addition to the park, first arriving in 2012. ""If they find a rhino lying dead, they can sniff out where the poachers are,"" explains Alyssa Carter -- allowing rangers track poachers, just as the poachers themselves stalk prey. Dogs will soon patrol the park's entrance points, too, detecting weapons that poachers attempt to smuggle in, and contraband -- including rhinoceros horn -- being transported out. At Kruger, South Africa's largest wildlife reserve, park authorities report an increase in contact with suspected poachers, with rangers claiming before Christmas that 164 had been arrested in the park over the year. With each dog's purchase, training and kennel costs running to over $8,000 per dog, they aren't cheap, but the young ""rhino champion"" can now proudly boast to have already added two new K-9 enforcers to the battle. Rhino spotting . But why rhinos? ""They're nice and, with their big-horns, they look beautiful, and I like looking for them in the wild,"" explains Carter. Before starting Alyssa's Save the Rhinos, the Johannesburg resident had never seen a rhinoceros in its natural habitat. Now, she's been to Kruger several times, she says -- on invitation to meet the park's other Honorary Rangers, on a few occasions, and recently visiting two sniffer dogs in training last summer. She eagerly snaps photographs of every animal she sees in the park but rhinos hold a special place: ""It's really nice because I know I'm doing something,"" she says. Carter says she keeps count of each of the rhino she sees -- and is up to ""130-something,"" so far. Carter is keen to talk to others about her experiences with rhinos, standing up in front of 700 students at a school in December, and nearly 300 adults at a development conference earlier that year. She says it's just as easy to talk to grown-ups as kids -- as long as her father is by her side. The elder Carter says he wasn't involved in conservation before Alyssa started her campaign, and that the whole family has caught the young activist's enthusiasm. The ambition now is for Alyssa to talk at more corporate events, including business golf days where she has found success encouraging businesspeople to give to the cause. ""The bottom line is we need to raise more money,"" says Brian, ""and we need to sell more chocolates."" Read this: School boy's website helps tourists spot big beasts .

"On a Spring day in 1970, just five days after National Guard troops opened fire on anti-war demonstrators at Kent State University, a restless president awoke in the pre-dawn hours, strolled to the Lincoln sitting room, and sat down to listen to some music. From the window, he could see student protesters gathering on the grounds of the Washington Monument. A White House attendant asked the president if he would like coffee or hot chocolate. He declined. What happened next is the stuff of political legend. President Richard M. Nixon, the strategic, calculating -- and some say paranoid -- architect of his own rise and fall, took an uncharacteristic gamble. He asked his attendant if he had ever seen the Lincoln Memorial at night, then led a small entourage on an unplanned visit to the Lincoln Memorial, where he talked to young anti-war protesters. ""I have never seen the Secret Service quite so petrified with apprehension,"" Nixon said a few days later. ""I insisted however no press be informed and that nobody in our office be informed."" But Nixon, aware of the historical nature of the event and of the potential for favorable publicity, soon thereafter dictated his recollections to aide H.R. Haldeman, suggesting they give the information to someone who could write it up. On Thursday, the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum released Nixon's 45-minute Dictabelt sound recordings in which the embattled president gives his firsthand account of the May 9, 1970, visit. Combative Nixon defended legacy to grand jury . For Nixonologists, Nixon's pre-dawn conversation with young students, under the stone-faced gaze of another wartime president, is part political theater and part history. ""I'm telling you this is beyond belief,"" enthused Timothy Naftali, director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. ""If Hollywood created this, you wouldn't believe it."" The visit came at a time when the country's deep divide over the Vietnam War was reaching new depths. Days earlier, Nixon announced the United States would attack the enemy along the Vietnam-Cambodia border. ""This is not the invasion of Cambodia,"" he said in a speech. ""We will not allow American men by the thousands to be killed by an enemy from privileged sanctuaries."" Then, days later, Kent State. Then, Nixon's trip to the Lincoln Memorial. In his tape-recorded dictation, Nixon said his car arrived at the memorial about 4:40 a.m., and he walked up the steps to the Lincoln statue. He showed his White House attendant, a recent citizen, the engraved inscriptions that surround the monument. ""By this time, a small groups of students began to congregate in the rotunda of the memorial,"" he said. ""I walked over to a group of them and shook hands. They were not unfriendly. As a matter of fact they seemed somewhat over-awed and of course quite surprised."" That first group consisted of about eight young men, about half from upstate New York, Nixon said. To ""get the conversation going,"" Nixon asked how many had been to Washington before. ""I told them that it was a beautiful city and I hope they enjoyed their visit there, that I wanted them, of course, to attend the anti-war demonstration, to listen to all the speakers and that I hope they had the time to take a tour of the city and see some of the historical monuments."" Two or three of the students volunteered they had not heard Nixon's press conference the previous evening. ""I said I was sorry they had missed it because, as I had tried to explain in the press conference that my goals in Vietnam were the same as theirs -- to stop the killing, to end the war, to bring peace. Our goal was not to get into Cambodia by what we were doing, but to get out of Vietnam,"" Nixon said. Nixon said he realized that most of the students did not agree with his position. ""I said, 'I know you, probably most of you think I'm an SOB, but, ah, I want you to know that I understand just how you feel."" Then, in an apparent attempt to relate with the students, he told them of his background. He said he came from a Quaker background, ""as close to being a pacifist as anybody could be in those times."" He said he was inspired by  British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's calls for peace, and ""I thought at that time Chamberlain was the greatest man alive."" When he read Winston Churchill's criticism of Chamberlain, ""I thought Churchill was a madman,"" Nixon said. ""In retrospect, I now realize that I was wrong. I realize that Chamberlain was a good man but that Churchill was a wiser man,"" Nixon said. ""I then tried to move the conversation into areas where I could draw them out,"" Nixon said. He asked where they were from, and encouraged them to travel throughout the United States and the world. He sought common ground, discussing the plight of the environment and of minorities. ""I pointed out that I knew that on their campus, their campuses, a major subject of concern was the Negro problem. I said this was altogether as it should be, because the degradation of slavery had been imposed upon the Negroes, and it was, it would be impossible for us to do everything that we should do to right that wrong. But I pointed out that what we had done to the American Indians was in its way just as bad. We had taken a proud and independent race and virtually destroyed them. And that we had to find ways to bring them back into, into decent lives in this country."" By this time, Nixon recounted, the group had grown to about 30 people. And the meeting evidently became more contentious. One protestor spoke up, telling Nixon, ""I hope you realize that we're willing to die for what we believe in,"" Nixon recalled. He said he responded, ""I certainly realize that. Do you realize that many of us when we were your age were also willing to die for what we believed in and are willing to do so today. The point is that we are trying to build a world in which you will not have to die for what you believe in, but you're able to live for it."" Nixon said he discussed the importance of cleaning up the environment, but said that, alone, would not cure the world's ills. ""I just wanted to be sure that all of them realized that ending the war and cleaning up the city streets and the air and the water was not going to solve the spiritual hunger which all of us have and which of course has been the great mystery of life from the beginning of time,"" he said. By that time, the president's press secretary Ron Ziegler had arrived, and Nixon saw the Secret Service ""was becoming more and more concerned as they saw the crowd beginning to mount."" ""They probably feared some of the more active leaders would get word of my visit and descend upon us,"" he said. As the first rays of sun began to show, Nixon shook hands with those nearest to him and walked down the steps.","Richard Nixon library releases tapes made by the late president .

"Iraq and Turkey have agreed to allow flights between their countries, ending a mutual ban that began with a dispute about how an Iraqi government oil company owed millions of dollars to Turkey, Iraqi officials said Thursday. Turkish planes resumed flights to Iraq on Thursday and were landing at the Baghdad airport, Iraq's Ministry of Transportation said. Iraqi airliners will begin landing in Istanbul on Friday, officials said. On Monday, Iraq banned all Turkish flights from landing in the country, including the semiautonomous Kurdish region, as a response to a similar ban last week in Turkey against Iraqi flights. However, a Turkish government official denied that Ankara blocked Iraqi planes. The official did say that Turkey warned that if Iraq's State Oil Marketing Organization did not pay the $3 million owed to his country, the country would ban Iraqi aircraft. Both countries agreed to drop the bans after negotiations. After years of the U.S.-led war in Iraq, Turkey's flagship carrier Turkish Airlines was one of the first international companies to begin direct flights to Baghdad. Increasingly, Turkey has grown as a major international gateway for commerce and travel to and from its Iraqi neighbor.","Iraq and Turkey agree to drop flight bans against each other .

"Maputo, Mozambique (CNN)They say no one can resist its chicuembo, an invocation to the ancestral spirits. It will get you off your seat. It will get you dancing. The magic happens when you listen to Marrabenta, Mozambique's distinctive national music, an energetic mix of local dance rhythms and folk music from Portugal. The word itself is derived from the Portuguese verb rebentar, meaning ""to break"". Some say this refers to the instruments used to play the music, originally tin-can guitars and wooden boxes with strings. Due to the flimsy nature of their improvised construction, they were particularly prone to breaking. Others suggest it describes the dancing style: sprightly, bouncy, best approached with a ""dance until you break"" attitude. But according to Dilon Djindji, an 85-year-old Marrabenta legend whose career can be traced back to 1938, it was his very showmanship that spawned the term: his intensity on stage was such that it could break the emotional barrier with the audience. Whatever the truth, Marrabenta has a meaning in Mozambique that goes well beyond words. Mozambique was a Portuguese colony until 1975, when it gained its independence after a decade-long war. During the colonial period, the regime extended its influence to the arts and culture, demanding that only Portuguese music be played and danced to. Music therefore became a means of self-expression and conservation of cultural identity for many Mozambicans. Marrabenta was born in the late 1930s, and on top of classic themes like love and everyday life, it also offered social criticism and commentary to major events. The lyrics are often in Portuguese, still the official language of Mozambique, but also in local languages such as Shangaan and Ronga. Its musical pattern merges European influences and local styles, from Mozambique as well as neighboring countries. The originators of Marrabenta were ordinary Mozambican men and women, who played guitar and sang at gatherings. But what really defines the genre is not the rhythm, the guitar, or the language: ""What defines Marrabenta is the dance,"" says Dilon Djindji, ""The dance has its own steps. It has its own style. There is also a specific way to play the music. The singing must match the dance and the melody. That is what shows you it's Marrabenta."" Marrabenta's undisputed superstar of this generation is Neyma, ""the Beyonce of Mozambique"". At the Mozambican Music Awards in 2013 she won several awards including Best Artist and Album of the Year, confirming that the genre hasn't lost its luster. ""I have also performed other styles besides Marrabenta, but Marrabenta is where I find myself. Because I'm African, because I'm Mozambican,"" says Neyma. ""And I've realized that other artists haven't explored this music genre much. It used to be seen as though it belonged to older generations. As a style, it was made by older artists. So I want to break with that."" Marrabenta is well known beyond Mozambique's borders, but for some artists there's still more to be done before it can gain international stature. ""We don't want our music to reach Mozambique only,"" says Wazimbo, one of Marrabenta's most influential artists. ""We want our music to be known in all corners of the world. But we haven't reached that goal yet, because we don't have a recording industry. ""We are fighting to make it known, to publicize it. But we realize we also need to establish an industry, we need good promoters, people to take our music to where we want it to go."" Marrabenta might represent the tradition of Mozambican music, but it's also strongly influencing its future. A new style, popular with the youngest generations, is a mix of Marrabenta and Ragga. One if its up-and-coming stars is a man who goes by many names: Mr Cizer Boss, Mr Guiriga, Owner of ""Bazucas"", ""Essa dama uma goia"", and ""Martelo 4Pause."" He defines Pandza as ""a fusion between Marrabenta, some hip- hop, and some rhythms from our neighbor South Africa... some national and international dances. We create a pleasant fusion, the Pandza style that is ours. Just ours."" Pandza has more groove, it's more aggressive, and it's richer in scope, incorporating additional instruments on top of Marrabenta's guitars and drums. It is just a decade old, but it's gathering followers rapidly. And yet, this doesn't mean that Marrabenta will soon be a thing of the past. It's all still there. Deeply etched into the groove.

"(CNN)Lawmakers in the Philippines have called for an inquiry into allegations that public funds were used to ""hide"" homeless families at a resort during the Pope's recent visit. The Philippines Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) has confirmed that 340 members of 100 homeless families were removed from Roxas Boulevard, a major Manila thoroughfare, and temporarily relocated to a beach resort about 90 kilometers (55 miles) away for the duration of the Papal visit. The families returned after the Pope's departure. A resolution before the Philippines House of Representatives has called on the government to summon the head of the DSWD for a probe into whether $97,600 spent on the six-day training course at the resort in Nasugbu, Batangas, amounted to a misuse of public funds. Rep. Terry Ridon, one of the lawmakers behind the resolution, said in a statement he was concerned that the families had been rounded up from Roxas Boulevard, which the Papal convoy traveled several times during the Pope's January 15-19 visit. He said the episode highlighted the ""frivolous manner"" in which the government implemented anti-poverty programs. The training course at the resort had been been funded as part of a program with the objective of ""keeping families off the streets by training them how to live in a house,"" read the resolution, which was also sponsored by Rep. Antonio Tinio and Rep. Isagani Zarate. However, ""after the papal visit, the families who participated in the 'training' were returned to the streets,"" raising questions about the program's effectiveness in terms of its ""supposed objective of reducing poverty,"" said the resolution. In an unrelated Senate hearing Tuesday, DSWD Secretary Dinky Soliman was asked about the issue, and confirmed that homeless families from the boulevard had been sent to the resort. She said the department had already intended to enroll the families in the training program, and had considered the period of the Pope's visit would be the ideal time to do so. ""To prepare for Pope Francis' arrival... local governments wanted to make sure that Roxas Boulevard was in a secure and safe state, and so were the (homeless) people... with the influx of people in the area,"" she told the hearing. ""So when we reached out to the families on Roxas Boulevard, since we were already planning to register them to the Modified Conditional Cash Transfer Program, we thought it could be the right time to hold the orientation from January 15 to 19."" The government's Modified Conditional Cash Transfer (MCCT) Program is described on a government website as a ""complete package of assistance to street families ... with access to social services and economic opportunities for the improvement of their living conditions."" Ridon's resolution alleged that the resort stay was ""not the first time that DSWD (had) made an attempt to cover up the massive inequality in the country."" It claimed that during the World Economic Forum on East Asia held in Manila in May last year, families were relocated to another resort for similar training. The plight of the poor, particularly street children, was a touchstone during Pope Francis' visit to the predominantly Catholic country. At a Sunday Mass, the Pope embraced former street children, who asked him why God had allowed them to suffer.","Allegations are made the the Philippines hid homeless families during the Pope's visit .

"If beauty is indeed truth, as John Keats claimed, then this story ought to be true: The logo on the back of your iPhone or Mac is a tribute to Alan Turing, the man who laid the foundations for the modern-day computer, pioneered research into artificial intelligence and unlocked German wartime codes. His death, a decade after the end of the war, provides the link with Apple. Unrecognized for his work, facing jail for gross indecency  and humiliated by estrogen injections intended to 'cure' his homosexuality, he  bit into an apple he had laced with cyanide. He died in obscurity on June 7, 1954, 10 years and a day after the Normandy landings, which made copious use of intelligence gleaned by his methods. And so, the story goes, when two Stanford entrepreneurs were looking for a logo for their brand new computer company, they remembered Turing and his contribution to their field. They chose an apple -- not a complete apple, but one with a bite taken out of it. Sadly, the truth is rarely as simple, or beautiful, as we would like. I first researched this story in 2005 and was assured by someone at Apple that it was indeed true. The article struck a chord and several people got in touch to say how pleased or touched they were to hear the story. A few years later I mentioned it to another Apple employee, who immediately said that he thought it was a myth.  It may have started around the time of the 2001 film about the Bletchley Park code breakers, Enigma, or it may have just resurfaced then. He checked with Apple headquarters, and although they were non-committal, it was clear that that Turing story was not official Apple history. Other theories were advanced. The apple represented knowledge, as in the biblical story of Adam and Eve, or referenced the falling fruit that led Sir Isaac Newton to the concept of gravity. Supporters of the latter theory note the name of Apple's handheld PDA, the Newton, but that was more than a decade after the creation of the logo. Sadly, the evidence now points in a more prosaic direction. In a 2009 interview with CreativeBits, Rob Janoff, the man who drew the logo, reflected on the theories about his work. He dismisses Sir Isaac or the Bible as source material and, while he says he is charmed by the links with the Turing story, he says he was unaware of them at the time. ""I'm afraid it didn't have a thing to do with it,"" he said. ""It's a wonderful urban legend."" Janoff says that he received no specific brief from Steve Jobs, and although he's hazy about how he settled on the simple outline of an apple, the reason for the bite is crystal clear: it's there for scale, he says, so that a small Apple logo still looks like an apple and not a cherry. It wasn't long before Janoff discovered the first happy coincidence of his design, when a colleague told him that ""bytes"" were the foundation stones of computing. The more romantic myth-making would follow soon behind. I was disappointed when the Turing story was first cast into doubt, but grew to enjoy the uncertainty. Limbo seemed a fitting, even poetic state, for the tale of a man who lived in the shadows. Even his tribute was now floating between life and death, like Snow White after she swallowed her own mythical apple. I hope that a similar respect for beauty over cold, hard fact lay behind Steve Jobs' silence on the matter. He could have dismissed the creation myths inspired by his company, but he chose not to. More than most, he appreciated the value of a beautiful story.","Holden Frith says one story recounts how the Apple logo was a tribute to Alan Turing .

"California Gov. Jerry Brown has vetoed a bill that would have prohibited police in that state from conducting warrantless searches of the cell phones of people under arrest. ""This measure would overturn a California Supreme Court decision that held that police officers can lawfully search the cell phones of people who they arrest,""  the governor's brief statement said. ""The courts are better suited to resolve the complex and case-specific issues relating to constitutional search-and-seizures protections."" The veto dismayed privacy advocates and others who said it could allow overzealous authorities to trample citizens' constitutional rights. California Sen. Mark Leno, who sponsored the bill (SB 914), responded: ""This veto is very unfortunate. The message from the governor was rather incoherent. When you consider all the information that is accessible on one smartphone, if that same information was contained anywhere else police would need a warrant to search for it. So it makes no sense to carve out a legal exception for smartphone searches."" According to California Assembly rules, state legislators must wait a year before attempting to reintroduce this legislation. Over the summer, SB 914 unanimously passed the California legislature. The bill would have protected against the warrantless search of personal and private information contained in the cell phones of people who have been arrested. This bill was inspired by a California Supreme Court ruling in January in the case of Gregory Diaz. After his 2007 drug-related arrest, an officer with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department checked the text messages on Diaz's phone and found incriminating messages. That state court ruling has privacy implications that reach far beyond text messages. It allows police in California to access any data stored on an arrestee's phone: photos, address book, Web-browsing history, data stored in apps (including social media apps), voicemail messages, search history, chat logs, and more. Also, depending on the use of location-enabled services or apps that store data on the phone, the police might also be able to infer the arrestee's past whereabouts. On October 3, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a petition to hear the Diaz case. So with the governor's veto, the state court ruling stands as law in California. In a blog post about the California veto, law professor Orin Kerr contended that ""Governor Brown has it exactly backwards"" because legislatures tend to move far more quickly than the courts -- an important advantage when dealing with issues that involve fast-changing technology. Kerr also pointed out that there's a conflict of interest when the executive branch, which oversees law enforcement in the state, is in a position to block laws that would limit the powers of law enforcement. What happens next? Hanni Fakhoury, staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (which has been supporting the California bill, and following this issue nationwide) expects an increase in law enforcement ""fishing expeditions"" involving cell phones. ""I think we'll probably start to see more questionable searches of cell phones in arrests that have nothing to do with cell phones,"" he said. He cited a recent case before California's 6th Appellate Court in Silicon Valley, where police pulled over a driver expected of driving under the influence. Once they'd arrested the suspect, they searched his cell phone and found evidence indicating possible drug trafficking activity that was unrelated to the original arrest premise. The court supported this search, so evidence from the phone was legally used in the case. Aside from Fourth Amendment concerns about self-incrimination, Fakhoury and Leno both observed that this veto poses clear concerns for First Amendment and press freedoms in California -- and perhaps elsewhere, as other state governments and courts decide what to do about warrantless cell phone searches. Noting how much the Occupy Wall Street protestors are using cell phones to organize and publicize the demonstrations spreading around the United States, Fakhoury said, ""California police might decide to arrest you for disturbing the peace, or illegal camping, and then check your phone and see messages coming through from organizers."" Said Leno, ""Reporters who are covering protests and other events that attract police attention should be concerned about getting arrested and then having the info they gathered, including info about sources, ending up in police hands."" Since several states are wrestling with this issue, Fakhoury expects it will likely end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. But in the meantime, if you're in California and are concerned about privacy and your constitutional rights, it's a good idea to protect your cell phone and other electronic devices with a password or encryption. In our January story on warrantless cell phone searches, Catherine Crump of the American Civil Liberties Union told CNN that if you keep your phone locked, ""The police can ask you to unlock your phone -- which many people will do. But they almost certainly cannot compel you to unlock your phone without the involvement of a judge."" The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Governor vetoes a bill requiring police to get a warrant to search an arrested person's phone .

"Washington (CNN)Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan fully reversed his anti-abortion position and came out as pro-choice in an op-ed published on Tuesday. ""I have come a long way since being a single, 26-year-old state senator, and I am not afraid to say that my position has evolved as my experiences have broadened, deepened and become more personal,"" Ryan wrote in the Akron Beacon Journal. ""I have come to believe that we must trust women and families — not politicians — to make the best decision for their lives,"" he said. After running for Congress on a pro-life platform in 2002 and initially voting with Republicans on the issue, Ryan, who is Catholic, has shifted leftward on abortion. In recent years, he's drawn criticism from pro-life activists that once supported him for voting to protect public funding for Planned Parenthood and access to contraception. Ryan wrote in the op-ed that his shift was inspired by conversations with women during his political career, but the move also puts him in a better position politically as he contemplates a potential 2016 challenge to Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican. Ryan told Roll Call that ""we're certainly looking very closely at"" a Senate run. And while he's won re-election to his heavily Democratic district with comfortable margins nearly every cycle since 2002, Ryan's pro-life stance could have been an obstacle for him in a Democratic Senate primary in the swing state. Indeed, Portman himself has shifted on a key social issue since he was elected in 2010 with Tea Party support. He came out in favor of gay marriage in 2013, also in a newspaper op-ed, citing his experience with his gay son as partial inspiration for the shift. RELATED: Which GOP hopeful is the most like Reagan? Ryan, however, dismissed speculation that his change of heart was politically motivated. ""I realize that people can be cynical about politics and think this is something tied to a Senate aspiration,"" Ryan told the Plain Dealer. ""The reality is, this is just where my heart is right now. I want to be clear about that. I would be abandoning my own conscience and my own judgment if I somehow led people to believe I was supporting a position I no longer thought was the appropriate position to have.""","Ohio Democratic Rep.

"(CNN) -- Two U.S. marshals and a police officer were shot Tuesday while trying to serve an arrest warrant in St. Louis, authorities said. One of the marshals, John Perry, died, as did the suspected shooter. Perry, 48, had been a U.S. marshal for nearly 10 years. The second marshal was shot in the ankle and listed in fair condition after surgery, according to area police. Federal officials identified him as 31-year-old Theodore Abegg. The police officer was taken to a hospital and treated for a ""graze wound to the face and neck"" before being released, St. Louis police said. A police spokeswoman had previously said his injuries stemmed from a fall, not the shooting. Authorities identified the alleged gunman as Carlos Boles, 35. Police and U.S. marshals went to his residence early Tuesday to take Boles into custody, they said. He began shooting and officers returned fire, killing the suspect, they added. Four U.S. marshals have now been shot while serving arrest warrants this year. One marshal was killed in West Virginia in February, while another was injured in Florida in January.

"(CNN) -- If you're not already celebrating at your local comic book store or glued to Oxygen's 10-hour marathon of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" re-runs, then maybe you don't know. Today is Buffy Anne Summers' 30th birthday. ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" has survived through one feature length film, a cult television series and a comic book. Still a fan favorite and no stranger to controversy, Joss Whedon's influential franchise about a teenage girl who just happened to be naturally good at killing vampires is still inspiring fans. Buffy's birthday is reason for them to celebrate. There was a moment in the episode ""The Gift,"" which aired in 2001, when fans certainly didn't think this powerful girl would make it to 30. That's because Buffy took a swan-dive into a magical vortex from hell and died. At the end of the episode her gravestone is shown, marking her life from 1981 until 2001 with the epitaph, ""She saved the world a lot."" (She was resurrected the next season, when the show moved from the now defunct WB network to UPN.) Few who are aware of the ""Buffyverse"" would argue with that. Buffy saved the world from plenty of ""big bads,"" like vampires, demons and witches, but she did something pretty heroic for the people who tuned in every week to watch her adventures, too. ""(The show) really brought a lot of nerdy girls out of their shell,"" said Andrea Carlson, 27, a dedicated Buffy fan who works for the state of Minnesota. ""It did make it more acceptable to be a female who was into more unconventional sides of society. And I think a lot of guys were suddenly like, 'Hey, these nerd girls are really cute!' Instead of just being the best friend, now we're more accepted as almost sex symbols, thanks to that show."" ""Buffy is the sexy, hot chick that's always slaying everything, but the fact that she has her smart sidekick -- always with the laptop, always researching, I think (the show) did a lot to show that there's more than one type of girl,"" said Janeka Rector, a 32 year old die-hard Buffy fan who works at the University of Texas at Austin as a development specialist. Series writer and ""Buffy"" comic book contributor Jane Espenson agreed. She said the show's central characters (who referred to themselves as the ""Scooby Gang"") gave overt nerdyness ""a lovely coating of coolness and acceptance."" Fans and critics often wondered how a man like Whedon could portray the trials and tribulations of being a teenage girl so accurately. ""We are definitely in tune with our feminine side,"" said ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" comic book artist Georges Jeanty of his collaboration with Whedon. ""I don't think it's so much a respect for women, but it's just the acceptance of a human being."" Jeanty said Whedon broke the stereotype of helpless, attractive girls in horror movies with ""Buffy."" ""He just thought, what if, once the monster did catch up to the blond girl who was screaming and running away into the alley, what if that girl then turned around and really started kicking some ass?"" Espenson sees characters like ""Battlestar Gallactica's"" (a sci-fi television show for which she also wrote) Boomer and Starbuck as homages to ""Buffy,"" as well as ""Torchwood's"" Gwen Cooper. But attractive actors and strong female characters aren't the only reasons fans continue to follow the franchise. ""You can find certain things in the characters that you, personally, can identify with,"" said Kim Frum, a public relations expert for the Maryland state highway system and another Buffy fan. ""Some days I'm having a ""Willow"" day and other days I'm having a ""Xander"" day where nothing goes right, I'm a complete klutz and I'm getting knocked in the head all the time,"" she said. ""Some days I just want to fall out laughing, and I know exactly where to go back to and watch a certain scene. It's still fun to watch even if you know the entire series by heart."" Other fans are rewatching the series and blogging about every episode. Another professed fan of ""Buffy"" is actress and writer Whit Anderson. She's been handed the reins to a Warner Bros. ""Buffy"" re-boot movie (Warner Bros., like CNN, is owned by Time Warner), which has fans and Whedon's cohorts scratching their heads. Whedon is not involved with the upcoming feature film, and addressed the fact in an open letter on E! online in November 2010. ""Buffy is very personal for me,"" Espenson said, ""but really I'm just part of a big machine that exists to allow Joss to realize his vision. If there is work being done that isn't being guided by Joss, then I don't really see that as related to what I do."" ""I'm dubious about her,"" said Rector. ""Maybe she's like the best writer ever, and she (is writing) something so amazing and clever that we will all sit in awe and forgive her, but it's really, really hard to think of 'Buffy' without Joss Whedon."" ""I don't know what she's done before,"" Dark Horse comics writer and editor Scott Allie said. ""I think it's kind of lame. People are restarting franchises every five minutes. Restarts are overlapping at this point."" ""It's weird when the guy that made (Buffy) up and is still really personally involved in the character, for somebody else to say, 'Well, we have this technicality that allows us to do this, so we're gonna go re-boot,' "" he said. Perhaps one reason why a re-boot seems strange to fans and franchise creators alike is that Whedon is still actively telling the ""Buffy"" story. In March 2007, Whedon started the eighth season of ""Buffy"" with Dark Horse Comics. To commemorate her fictional 30th birthday, the last issue of ""Buffy Season 8"" is in stores January 19. Buffy isn't necessarily 30 in the comics, Jeanty said, adding that the comic book medium allows time to move a little differently than in a television show. Jeanty speculated that as of today's issue, Buffy is still around 26 years old. ""We can have armies fighting, which would have been really hard to pull off in the show,"" Allie said. ""Our ability to do monsters that aren't just, like, a tall guy in a rubber suit, we embrace."" Allie said a special effects budget with the Dark Horse version of ""Buffy"" is never an issue; they're only limited by what they can draw. Plenty of action has happened in ""Season 8."" Willow returned from her self-imposed exile, Oz showed up on a mountaintop in Tibet, Buffy had a sexy tryst with one of the girls she trains to slay vampires, Angel proved to be a diabolical villain and -- oh yeah -- Giles dies. Allie assures CNN that Buffy has plenty more adventures left. ""Season 9"" is already in the works. ""I was down in LA this weekend. We had a writer's summit to talk about Season 9, and (Whedon) is so personally invested in this character,"" Allie said. ""Because he's busy with 'The Avengers,' we had laid out this proposal for how we would do Season 9 where he had to do relatively little work. Because we were trying to be pragmatic, we want to do the book, we want to keep it going, we want to follow his vision, but we want to give him room to go do this other thing and come back. ""But we're not going to do that, because he was like, 'well what if we do this other thing?' and the ideas are pouring out (of Joss Whedon) about where to take her next,"" Allie said. ""He loves this girl, he loves her. He created her because he wants her to exist.""","""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" franchise includes a controversial new movie .

"(CNN) -- Are immigrants to the U.S. more likely than the general American population to adopt tablet computers? New research from Rebtel, a global mobile VOIP provider, indicates that this might be true. There are about 37 million foreign-born people living in the U.S. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, these first-generation immigrants represent about 12% of the total U.S. population. In November, Rebtel surveyed 1,340 immigrants residing in the U.S. about their technology habits. In all, 13% reported owning a tablet device, representing about 5 million people in the U.S. Two-thirds of these own iPads -- not surprising, since Apple's tablet has been around the longest and has the strongest global brand presence. In contrast, a recent Pew study found that only 5% of U.S. adults own a tablet. Why the disparity? Part of this might be explained by how Rebtel defined ""tablet."" In its study, this device category includes e-readers like Amazon's Kindle. It's true that some e-readers have some functionality that's also seen in tablets (especially the Barnes & Noble Nook Color, which can be hacked into an inexpensive Android tablet). But frankly it's a major stretch to consider the Kindle to be in the same device class as the iPad. In fact, Pew's study differentiated between tablets and e-readers and found that another 5% of Americans currently own an e-reader. So when you add Pew's tablet and e-reader percentages together, they're not very far under Rebtel's estimate. Still, Rebtel's research begs the question: If immigrants are more likely than the U.S. population at large to buy tablets, why might that be? Rebtel did not speculate on this. However, it occurs to me that many immigrants to the U.S. come from countries where mobile technology proliferated faster and more profoundly than it did here. This might make immigrants more willing to adopt new mobile technology sooner. According to Rebtel, tablet ownership figures did vary by nation of origin: ""French-Americans claim the highest percentage of tablet owners (17%), followed by Mexican-Americans (15%), Nigerian-Americans, and Ghana-Americans at 14% respectively -- rounded out by Ethiopian-Americans at eight percent and Cuban-Americans at seven percent."" Rebtel also noted nation-of-origin differences regarding whether immigrants would purchase a tablet in the near future. Immigrants from Ghana (62%) and India (58%) were most likely to buy a tablet, while only 34% of French Americans and 31% of Ethiopian-Americans indicated this intention. The opinions expressed in this post are solely those of Amy Gahran.","Rebtel surveyed 1,340 immigrants residing in the U.S. about their technology habits .

"His friends used to call him ""Hoss,"" as in Hoss Cartwright from the TV show ""Bonanza."" At 6'2"" and roughly 380 pounds, Mark Rucker once resembled the big, friendly character. Now, they call him ""The Beast."" The nickname is apt. Since February 2011, Rucker has run his first 5K, his first 10K, his first half-marathon and his first marathon. He's completed an Olympic-distance triathlon and lost more than 100 pounds. And on August 26, he'll participate in his first full-length Ironman competition in Louisville, Kentucky. Like they say, he's a beast. ""What he does after this Ironman, I don't know,"" his wife, Annita Rucker, said with a laugh. ""I hope he can find something to focus all this energy on."" From Rucker's DailyMile blog: April 18, 2011 -- ""First day of the Couch to 5K program. That was not good. But at least I did the whole workout"" (1.98 miles/ 32 minutes/ 16:10 pace) Change is a funny thing, Rucker says. Often, the desire to change grows over time. A series of events leads to an ""a ha moment,"" when desire must meet with the proper tools and the right inspiration. In the summer of 2010, Rucker, of Lexington, Kentucky, and his family went to Dollywood in Tennessee. His daughter was 11 at the time, a ""little daredevil,"" and wanted to ride all the roller coasters. Unfortunately, Rucker couldn't fit on any of them with her. ""She was devastated; I was crushed,"" Rucker said. ""But even that wasn't enough to get me started on the journey. I guess I just didn't know how to do it."" Does parenting make us fat? In January 2011, he reconnected with an old elementary school friend, Anita Mills, and the two began talking on Facebook, discussing Mills' 240-pound weight loss. Her transformation was his inspiration. But he still wasn't ready to change. After weighing in at about 365 pounds, he stopped stepping on the scale. He was diagnosed with sleep apnea and put on medication for high blood pressure. He feared that he was diabetic but wouldn't visit his doctor. The day after the 2011 Super Bowl, Rucker woke up in pain. Once again, he had overindulged the night before, and his digestive system revolted. He was tired, sick and unhappy. ""Something clicked,"" he said. ""I realized that if I kept doing it, I would significantly shorten my life."" Rucker took Mills' dieting hints to heart and cut out sugary drinks. He dropped his two-liter-a-day soda habit and picked up water. He stopped ordering McDonald's McGriddles for breakfast and eating peanut M&Ms by the pound. He threw away his Cheez-Its. ""It's hard to say what my daily (calorie) intake was,"" he said, looking back. ""I did it to myself. I was really unhappy with the way my life was, and I think food was that comfort for me."" June 19, 2011 -- ""Last day of Couch 2 5K. I think I'll call it The Father's Day Beastly 5K. I was the only competitor and I finished in 1st place. I can't even begin to explain how I feel right now. And no one or no thing can ever take this away from me. I AM a runner. I AM an achiever. I AM a Beast. On to Bridge 2 10K!!!"" Rucker's job as a real estate attorney kept him sedentary. So he started to walk on his lunch break, using his iPhone to post his distance on DailyMile.com. The site shared his progress on Twitter and Facebook. Friends posted replies that the site's app read aloud to Rucker through his headphones during workouts. Wiring the world to fight obesity . ""That was a huge motivator to me,"" he said. ""Even though I was by myself, I still had people to encourage me."" He ran his first official 5K race, the Great Buffalo Chase, on July 4, 2011, in 39 minutes. Less than a month later, he tackled a 10K, finishing dead last but finishing all the same. His blog that night complained about the cross-country course's hills but promised to begin training for a half-marathon the next day. ""The focus he has, the drive he has ... it's so refreshing,"" Annita Rucker said. ""It's the old Mark I didn't even know -- probably the Mark from law school."" The Ruckers married in October 2000. For 11 years, Annita Rucker watched the man she married -- the dreamer, the achiever -- struggle to maintain his optimism while grappling with a shrinking housing market and a growing body. Their son and daughter -- two children from Rucker's first marriage -- came to visit often, and Annita Rucker found herself entertaining the young kids while her husband remained stationary. ""I used to complain that he was living life on the sidelines, never participating,"" she said. ""Now, he's so active with them. Last year, my father had Parkinson's and was hospitalized for 10 weeks. Mark stepped up to the plate and did all the cooking, the laundry, everything. Before this, that never would have happened."" ""My wife jokes, 'I've got a brand new husband,' "" Rucker said with a long laugh. ""I think she's a lot happier with me ... because I'm much happier."" August 18, 2011 -- ""Three mile walk at work on my lunch break. Some days I gotta dig down deep to find the motivation. Some days it's really hard. Today is one of those days."" Rucker is now training for his first Ironman competition. A typical week includes 4:30 a.m. swims, 6-mile runs after work and hours of cycling on Saturday and Sunday. At 260 pounds, he's stopped focusing on losing weight and started focusing on building muscle. There are good and bad days. Some blog posts sing of the serotonin rushing through his brain. Others show his discouragement of a bad swim or a slow run. He's a beast, but one who feels pain. Ironman champ: The importance of R&R . Still, it's amazing, even to him, that a guy who less than two years ago got winded walking up a flight of stairs can push himself this far, this fast. ""I'm the guy in the overalls (who's) shoveling the coal in the train,"" he said. ""I don't know exactly where it's going, but I'm going to do everything I can to keep it moving."" February 18, 2012 -- ""Woot woot!! I'm a marathoner!!"" (26.4 miles/ 6 hours, 13 minutes/ 14:07 pace) Rucker has rejoined the social world. He volunteers at the Red Cross and is involved in his local Rotary chapter. This year, his family went back to Dollywood and rode all the rides together. Rucker wants to become a motivational speaker, to be that inspiration for others that Mills was for him. Possible title for his speech: ""Be the Beast that you can be.""

"(CNN) -- The smartphone market is pretty competitive, which can make choosing a phone challenging for consumers who just want a clear answer on which of these pricey devices they should buy. Right now, the three leading types of smartphones are running nearly neck-and-neck in the U.S., although Google's Android models may be inching ahead. New data from Nielsen shows that slightly more U.S. consumers are buying Android phones than any other type of smartphone. Currently Android holds 29% of the US smartphone market; while the iPhone and BlackBerry hold 27% each. But wait: Android is an operating system, and there's considerable diversity among the manufacturers, models, features, and general user experience available in that category. Under the ""Android"" label you'll find everything from the high-end Motorola Droid Pro and the HTC Evo 4G to the lower-tech Samsung Intercept. Also, Android system updates get rolled out unevenly to various Android devices. In terms of manufacturers, Nielsen notes: ""RIM and Apple are the winners compared to other device makers since they are the only ones creating and selling smartphones with their respective operating systems. ""HTC follows with 12% of consumer smartphone owners having an HTC Android device and 7% owning an HTC device running a Microsoft OS. Ten percent of consumer smartphone owners had a Motorola Android device and one percent owned a Motorola device running a Microsoft OS.""","New data from Nielsen shows that slightly more people are buying Android phones .

"It's not the Occupy Wall Street protesters yelling ""mic check"" who are bugging Newt Gingrich at his events these days. It's the attack ads occupying the airwaves in Iowa. A new spot from the pro-Mitt Romney super political action committee Restore Our Future starts with the simple question: ""Know what makes Barack Obama happy?"" The answer: ""Newt Gingrich's baggage."" In the ad, luggage bearing the names of the former speaker's past liabilities then spills out onto an airline baggage carousel. ""Newt has more baggage than the airlines,"" the ad says. The spot doesn't mention Gingrich's personal baggage. But it might as well. Gingrich has demanded that Romney call on the super PAC to pull its negative ads. ""I object to lies. I object to negative smear campaigns,"" Gingrich said Tuesday. But Romney makes no apologies. ""If you can't stand the relatively modest heat in the kitchen right now, wait until Obama's hell's kitchen shows up,"" Romney said in New Hampshire on Wednesday. Unfortunately for the former speaker, it's about to get hotter. The 2012 campaign is now a high stakes version of Pac-Man. In the battle of Romney versus Gingrich, guess who the ghost is? The Restore Our Future super PAC is not only run by former Romney political operatives. It also is funded in large part by big donors who still work at Romney's former investment firm, Bain Capital. None of this is a mystery to Gingrich. ""We need to understand that these are his people, running his ads, doing his dirty work, while he pretends to be above it,"" Gingrich said Tuesday. According to an analysis of disclosure forms from Restore Our Future conducted by the nonpartisan government watchdog Center for Responsive Politics, the pro-Romney super PAC has spent $430,380 on ads in Iowa. That's more than the $325,770 spent by the Romney campaign. Combined, they are outspending Gingrich in Iowa by more than seven to one. Bain employees have given $1.25 million  to Restore Our Future. Contrast that to the $84,500 contributed by Bain employees directly to the Romney campaign. Contributions to federal candidates are limited to $2,500. There are no limits on donations to super PAC's. That's part of what makes them super. In its landmark 2010 decision in the case of ""Citizens United vs. the Federal Election Commission,"" the U.S. Supreme Court green-lighted the activities of super PAC's, effectively allowing them to legally raise and spend unlimited amounts of money. Viveca Novak with the Center for Responsive Politics said Bain's connection to ""Restore Our Future"" gives Romney a clear advantage in the race. ""He automatically has access to extraordinary amounts of money through these individuals who are connected to securities and investment firms, which are part of the world he used to inhabit,"" Novak said. Romney has suggested he has no legal authority to pull the super PAC spots. ""My goodness, if we coordinate in any way whatsoever, we go to the big house,"" Romney said in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" Novak said Romney could do more. ""If Romney wanted to he could call a press conference and call on the super PAC to take down the ad,"" Novak said. Romney defended ""Restore Our Future"" by pointing to the pro-Obama super PAC, Priorities USA, which has already started attacking his campaign. That PAC, run by former White House Deputy Press Secretary Bill Burton, has one spot featuring a now infamous photo of Romney during his days at Bain. The picture shows Romney in a suit stuffed with money. As Romney has pointed out, the president's advisers have set their fundraising goal at $1 billion. The Romney campaign said its own spots are positive. Its latest ad stars Romney's wife, Ann, who extols the virtues of good moral character. ""If you really want to know how a person will operate, look at how they've lived their life,"" Ann Romney says in the ad. That sounds like another subtle swipe at Gingrich, who  has a new ad featuring his wife, Callista. ""From our family to yours, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year,"" she says in the spot. With super PAC fever spreading, a little holiday cheer doesn't hurt.","""Super"" political action committees are spending millions of dollars on ads in Iowa .

"(CNN) -- FBI investigators were working Tuesday to discover what caused a small hole in the body of a US Airways jet. A pilot discovered the hole Monday while checking the aircraft before a flight, the airline said. The puncture in the Boeing 737 airliner is the size and shape of a bullet hole, but that doesn't mean someone shot at the plane, said Amy Thorenson, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Charlotte, North Carolina. Investigators don't yet know what could have caused the hole, she said Tuesday morning. The airline declined to comment. ""We're not speculating on the hole and what caused it,"" airline spokeswoman Valerie Wunder said. The aircraft had flown to Charlotte from Philadelphia and was being prepped for another flight when the pilot discovered the hole above a passenger window toward the back of the plane, according to airline officials. The airline pulled the plane from service and called in the FBI. It's unclear whether the hole appeared before or during that flight or while the airliner was on the ground in Charlotte, but investigators and the airline were operating under the assumption that it happened in flight, Thorenson said. The airline called in the FBI, which Thorenson said has jurisdiction over anything that happens to a commercial passenger airliner in flight. The airline is also investigating, Wunder said. The airplane remained idle Tuesday, she said. The plane -- a 737-400 designated as flight 1161 from Philadelphia -- had landed without incident at Charlotte-Douglas International Airport at about 4 p.m. The plane holds 144 passengers, according to the US Airways website. It was not immediately clear how many people were aboard that flight, but all of the passengers were accommodated on other flights, a US Airways spokeswoman said. CNN's Rich Phillips contributed to this report.","NEW: Airline:  ""We're not speculating"" on what caused the hole .

"Two Maryland doctors face murder charges related to abortions performed on late-term fetuses that were viable, authorities said Friday. Steven Brigham and Nicola Riley are in jails in New Jersey and Utah, respectively, awaiting extradition hearings to bring them back to Maryland, police in Elkton, Maryland, said in a news release. The two face identical charges -- five counts each of first-degree murder, five of second-degree murder and one of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. The cases did not fall into the exceptions for aborted fetuses under Maryland law, Kerwin Miller, the deputy state's attorney for Cecil County, told CNN. Defense attorney Tom Brown told CNN by e-mail that Brigham ""has fully cooperated with this investigation"" and has not ""violated any Maryland laws."" Another lawyer for Brigham, Norman Wilson, declined to comment. Sharon Krevor-Weisbaum, an attorney at a Baltimore-based law firm that is representing Riley, said, ""We believe that the criminal charges are without merit, (and) we believe it is inappropriate for (Riley) to be held without bond."" The investigation began August 13, 2010, when Riley brought a woman into an Elkton hospital due to a ""complication resulting from a medical procedure,"" police said. The woman had driven from New Jersey to Maryland for an abortion, investigators later determined. Days later, Elkton police searched the abortion clinic where Brigham and Riley work and found several fetuses ""in a freezer chest."" The fetuses were taken to a medical examiner's office in Baltimore, according to the news release. The indictment warrant was issued Wednesday, following an investigation. Camden, New Jersey, police took Brigham into custody ""without incident"" later that night. The 55-year-old doctor has since been held at the Camden County jail. Riley, 46, was also detained without incident Wednesday evening by the Unified Police Department in Utah. She is being held at the Salt Lake City jail, ahead of an anticipated extradition hearing, Elkton police said. Miller, who is the chief homicide prosecutor for Cecil County, said more details on the case will not be released until Tuesday.","The doctors were arrested earlier this week in New Jersey and Utah .

"Santa Monica, California (CNN) -- The alleged East Coast mobster and his girlfriend were known as Charlie and Carol Gasko, a May-December couple living in the heart of sunny Southern California, just two blocks from the beach and an upscale outdoor mall, in a town known for its unapologetic liberalism. But their real names were James ""Whitey"" Bulger, 81, and Catherine Elizabeth Greig, 60. And recently, Greig had been telling friends that Bulger was showing signs of Alzheimer's and was suffering depression, unable to sleep or to get out of bed, neighbor Catalina Schlank told CNN. One manager of a restaurant just down the street recalled how the alleged gangster and his girlfriend liked the privacy of a far corner table and once worked up a $192 bill, plus tip, for a steak and lobster dinner, accompanied by foie gras, vodka highballs and chardonnay. Until this week, Bulger had been on the lam for 16 years and was on the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted list, facing charges in 19 mob-related murders. Bulger was arrested Wednesday after he was lured out of his apartment by an FBI ruse: He received a phone call and was told that his lockbox had been broken into in the basement parking lot area of his apartment building. When Bulger went down to check it out, FBI agents arrested him, a source said Friday. His longtime girlfriend was arrested inside the apartment, where the FBI later found 30 firearms, authorities said. Bulger's alleged barbarity as an Irish-American mobster in Boston inspired the Jack Nicholson character in Martin Scorsese's 2006 film ""The Departed."" For the past several years, the couple hid in plain sight in this palm-tree-lined oceanside city by Los Angeles. They were largely quiet, polite neighbors who occasionally helped Schlank carry her groceries or newspaper, said Schlank, who lives in the same building as Bulger and Greig. Out of generosity, Bulger even gave her a flashlight for her first-floor apartment. They lived in a three-story building named Princess Eugenia, which features pine trees, a brick stoop and a rose bed. It was clear that the couple didn't want to be bothered: They didn't answer their phone, and an answering service would take messages, Schlank said Friday. ""He was a handsome, old man,"" Schlank said. ""She was beautiful."" Bulger often wore a hat and pulled down the brim, said Schlank, who at age 88 is the most senior tenant in the building, having lived there since 1974. ""She was a very nice person to me -- they both were,"" she said. But the couple kept boundaries, Schlank said. ""They were kind of secretive. Even on the phone, you couldn't call them,"" Schlank said. ""Sometimes, I wanted to give them a tip of stuff on sale."" Schlank was put off by the answering service. ""After a while, I said forget about it,"" she said. Another neighbor, Denise Walsh, who lives four doors down from apartment 303, where Bulger and Greig lived for up to 15 years, said the couple often walked hand-in-hand and stopped to pet dogs, telling people they were canine lovers. ""He was very avuncular, she was very sweet. They were very kind people from my knowledge of them,"" Walsh said. But when she learned of the allegations against Bulger this week, she felt frightened, Walsh said. ""I actually was really shaking because I was really saddened to know it was them,"" Walsh said. ""It's like finding out your grandparents are murderers."" The couple held a status address on Santa Monica's Third Street. Just two blocks down is the city's popular tourist and commercial strip, called the Third Street Promenade, a breezy, open-air corridor of stores, restaurants and street performers. Several blocks up the street is an intersection with Montana Avenue, a boutique and restaurant district catering to Santa Monica's more affluent residents. Celebrities also frequent the blocks-long strip of one-story storefronts. In between those districts was Bulger's and Greig's apartment. Their fake name, Gasko, is still on the doorbell list of tenants. Their stucco building sits in a dense knot of apartments and million-dollar condos -- in which residents largely mind their own business unless someone strikes up a conversation, neighbors said. For an alleged gangster steeped in the baseball-bat brutality of Boston violence, Bulger and his girlfriend chose an unlikely destination to live, neighbors said. Santa Monica is known for its its left-leaning politics, with heavy restrictions on public smoking and a citywide emphasis on recycling and going green. Its nickname is ""The People's Republic of Santa Monica."" It was amid this bustle of pedestrian-friendly and tourist-loving activity that mobster and moll avoided detection -- until the FBI began a publicity campaign focusing on the girlfriend this month. ""Was he even hiding?"" asked Frank Quinn, 45, a copier salesman who works down the street from the Bulger apartment. Quinn made a visit to the apartment building Friday, because he's from a suburb south of Boston, Dedham. As a youth, he knew well the name of Whitey Bulger in that city's Irish-Catholic community, Quinn said. Bulger's reputation was one of ""a guy you didn't mess with,"" he said. ""He was all cash,"" Quinn said, referring to the FBI's reported discovery of more than $800,000 hidden in the apartment. One resident found Bulger's ability to enjoy life just blocks from her alarming. She was surprised by how the couple enjoyed a rent-controlled unit, in which the city limits annual rent increases by landlords. ""It's really mind-boggling,"" said Madeline Davis Heller, an arbitrator who was walking her mixed-breed dog, Sallie, past the Bulger apartment Friday. ""Santa Monica is notorious for rent control and background checks. I don't know how they got past. ""But they did have all this forgery stuff,"" she added, referring to the FBI having found fake IDs for the couple in their apartment. Bulger and Greig sometimes did step out at local institutions and dined at Michael's restaurant two blocks down the street. It's a white-tablecloth establishment of 32 years, known for attracting Hollywood producers, said general manager Andrew Turner, 41. The couple dined there a few times in recent years and made reservations under the name of ""Mr. Gasko"" on the OpenTable Internet reservation service, Turner said. They kept to themselves and always sat at Table 23 in the corner of the garden patio, at the back of the restaurant, lush with trees and plants, Turner said. He said he shook hands with the couple, as he does with all diners. Owner and cookbook author Michael McCarty has created a cozy space that includes art in oils and pencil for his guests. ""They were pleasant, but they kind of kept to themselves and certainly did not have, as far as I can tell, any interaction with any other guests,"" Turner said. In September 2009, Bulger and Greig had two Grey Goose vodka cocktails, two chardonnays, and an appetizer of foie gras. For an entree, Bulger had a 10-ounce, 28-day aged New York strip steak, and Greig had lobster, Turner said. The tab: $192 plus tip. The couple paid cash, Turner said.","Neighbor: I actually was really shaking because I was really saddened to know it was them""

"(CNN) -- Recently, Google announced that the Android version of its Google Maps app now automatically routes users around traffic when providing directions. According to the Google Blog, Google Maps navigation previously ""would choose whichever route was fastest, without taking current traffic conditions into account. It would also generate additional alternate directions, such as the shortest route or one that uses highways instead of side roads. ""[Now], our routing algorithms will also apply our knowledge of current and historical traffic to select the fastest route from those alternates. That means that navigation will automatically guide you along the best route given the current traffic conditions."" It will be interesting to see, as this feature develops, how well it adjusts for recurring or special events that not only cause congestion but also block traffic. For instance, could Google Maps navigation account for street closures for fairs and marathons -- especially if they're held in the same location annually? What about drawbridges that tend to open at regular times? Or St. Patrick's Day parades? Or what about when streets get flooded, or when public safety agencies shut down access to an area in an emergency? Or what about when Critical Mass bikers or zombie hordes overtake city streets? So far, the iPhone Google Maps app lacks this traffic-avoiding feature, but it's probably coming soon. For now, iPhone users of Google Maps can still use the ""alternate routes"" feature, with the live traffic layer enabled, to find their own ways around traffic. Or you can try the HD Traffic feature on the TomTom iPhone app, which, according to Pocket-lint, has offered traffic-dodging functionality for some time.

"Washington (CNN) -- Evidence is growing that a retired FBI agent who disappeared in Iran four years ago is alive and being held in Asia, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday. Robert Levinson disappeared during a business trip in March 2007. ""We have received recent indications that Bob is being held somewhere in southwest Asia,"" Clinton said in a statement. ""As the government of Iran has previously offered its assistance in this matter, we respectfully request the Iranian government to undertake humanitarian efforts to safely return and reunite Bob with his family."" Levinson checked into a Kish Island hotel and attended meetings on March 8, 2007. He checked out the following day, but did not make a scheduled flight to Dubai. In recent months, the United States received ""proof of life,"" according to a senior diplomatic official and a U.S. government official. Both requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the situation. The government official told CNN the evidence was received within the last six months and is ""clear and convincing proof that Bob Levinson is alive."" The government official would not elaborate on what the ""convincing"" evidence entailed. Its emergence has fueled a fresh round of ""discussions"" between the United States and Iran, according to the senior diplomatic official. The discussions, not equivalent to negotiations, were described as ""working level,"" meaning it was not conducted by senior administration officials, the official said. The United States is awaiting action by Iran and is hopeful progress is being made, the official said. Robert Levinson's wife, Christine, said her seven children, two grandchildren and she ""await the day we will be reunited."" ""Our family is tremendously encouraged by the news Bob is alive but remains concerned for his safety and well being,"" she said in a statement Thursday. Robert Levinson suffers from diabetes and requires regular medication, she said. Levinson's family told CNN in 2010 he was working as a private investigator in Dubai and may have been looking into a cigarette smuggling case. Levinson family members have met with local Iranian officials and have traveled there to retrace his steps. Christine Levinson flew to the United Nations in 2008 to ask questions about her husband. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad declined to meet her. The family has offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to his safe return. The State Department and FBI have consistently denied Levinson was working for the government and have demanded Iran free Levinson -- if it is holding him. Iran has insisted it does not know his whereabouts. The U.S. has lacked reliable information about whether Levinson was alive or dead. In the first few years after his disappearnace, Bush administration officials had said they suspect Iranian authorities seized Levinson and were holding him in a jail inside the country. But as the years since his appearance passed, many officials believed he might be dead. Levinson is a retired FBI agent from Coral Springs, Florida. After leaving the agency, his wife says, he worked as a security consultant specializing in cigarette smuggling. The State Department has repeatedly met with Levinson's family and have sent diplomatics note to Tehran through the Swiss government, who represents the U.S. interests in Iran in the absence of an American diplomatic presence in the country. CNN had reported that Levinson met with Dawud Salahuddin, an American fugitive who lives in Iran, shortly before his disappearance. Salahuddin -- known in Iran as Hassan Abdulrahman -- converted to Islam and was given refugee status in Iran after admitting in interviews to killing Ali Akbar Tabatabai, a former Iranian diplomat under the shah, in Maryland in 1980, he told CNN in a 2007 interview. Salahuddin was detained by Iranian officials in plain clothes and taken away from the room he shared with Levinson to be interrogated about his Iranian passport, he said in the interview. When he was freed the next day, he said, he was told by officials that Levinson had returned to Dubai. Senior administration officials have told CNN that they believe Salahuddin met with Levinson, but do not believe him to be a credible source of information on Levinson's whereabouts. In 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton personally passed a note to Iranian officials at a U.N. conference on Afghanistan in the Hague asking them for help in finding Levinson. FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said Thursday the agency could not comment further. ""We are working very hard to bring Bob Levinson home safely,"" Schweit said. ""His family misses him dearly and we remain concerned about his heath, given history of diabetes."" Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida has sought information for the Levinson family for the past four years. ""It's encouraging that we may have good news,"" Nelson said in a statement later Thursday. ""I'm praying that he can be reunited with his family."" ""It's encouraging that we may have good news.  I'm praying that he can be reunited with his family."" Elise Labott reported from Washington and Susan Candiotti reported from New York. CNN's Carol Cratty and Brian Todd contributed to this report.","U.S. has ""proof of life,"" senior diplomatic official says .

"(CNN)Could a prisoner handover spare the lives of two ISIS hostages? A message purporting to be from the Islamist terror group sets a new deadline for a possible deal with the Jordanian government. The latest demand: Bring convicted terrorist Sajida al-Rishawi to the Turkish border by sunset Thursday, or Jordanian ISIS hostage Moaz al-Kassasbeh will be executed ""immediately."" But is ISIS offering anything in return? From the latest message, it's unclear. But previous video posts purportedly from ISIS have suggested the group was offering Japanese hostage Kenji Goto's freedom in exchange for al-Rishawi's. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the latest message, which was read by a person claiming to be Goto and posted online by ISIS supporters. In the message, Goto purportedly calls for al-Rishawi's release in ""exchange for my life."" It's the latest twist in a complicated crisis with dizzying developments involving several countries. Here's a look at the key people involved: . • Goto, an experienced Japanese war journalist, has been at the center of several threats by ISIS since his capture. Last week, the group demanded $200 million from Japan in exchange for Goto and fellow Japanese hostage Haruna Yukawa, an aspiring security contractor. Since then, ISIS has claimed Yukawa is dead, but Goto is still alive. • Al-Kassasbeh, a Jordanian pilot, was captured by ISIS last month after the fighter jet he was flying crashed in Syria. ISIS says he's still alive, but Jordan's foreign minister told CNN his government has asked for a proof of life, but hasn't received it. • Al-Rishawi is an Iraqi prisoner on death row in Jordan for her role in 2005 bombings. ISIS has demanded her release by sunset Thursday (5:30 p.m. in Mosul, Iraq; 9:30 a.m. ET). Jordan has said it's willing to swap al-Rishawi for the Jordanian pilot. Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh told CNN on Wednesday that his country would release al-Rishawi if ISIS released al-Kassasbeh. Even though his government's announcement of its offer doesn't mention Goto, the foreign minister said that the Japanese journalist is not forgotten. ""Of course,"" Goto's release would be part of a prisoner exchange, Judeh told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. But the priority for Jordan is al-Kassasbeh's freedom, he said. It wasn't clear whether ISIS would accept Jordan's offer. With the fates of their sons hanging in the balance, the families of Goto and al-Kassasbeh called on their governments to do everything they can to save the hostages before time runs out. Goto, 47, is reported to have three children, two of them with his current wife. His mother begged Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to secure her son's release. ""Please save the life of Kenji,"" Junko Ishido said. ""I call on you to work with all your strength in negotiations with the Jordanian government, until the very end."" Al-Kassasbeh's father has called on Jordanian authorities to act as well. ""I firmly ask whomever has sent Moaz to fight outside the borders of Jordan, on a mission unrelated to us, to make strong efforts to bring back Moaz,"" Safi al-Kassasbeh said Tuesday. ISIS says it captured al-Kassasbeh after he ejected from his F-16 jet last month near Raqqa, the militant group's de facto capital in Syria. ""Moaz's blood is precious, it's precious and it represents the blood of all Jordanians,"" his father said. But the pilot's father suggested his son's case shouldn't be mixed up with Goto's. ""To link Moaz's situation with the Japanese journalist, this has nothing to do with us,"" he said. ""The Japanese journalist has his country to defend him."" ISIS, which holds large areas of Iraq and Syria under its brutal rule, has a grim track record of ruthlessly killing hostages. Last year, it publicized its series of beheadings of three American and two British captives. The group has made a series of demands regarding the Jordanian and Japanese hostages. In a Saturday post purportedly from ISIS, a voice thought to be Goto's first set out the idea of exchanging him for al-Rishawi, but no clear deadline was mentioned. In that post, Goto held a photo of what appeared to be Yukawa's decapitated corpse. A  post from the group on Tuesday announced that time was suddenly in short supply for Goto and the Jordanian pilot. In that message, the Japanese hostage is shown handcuffed and dressed in orange, holding a picture that appears to be al-Kassasbeh. ""I've been told this is my last message,"" a voice purporting to be that of Goto says, demanding the prisoner exchange. The video had said that ISIS would kill al-Kassasbeh and Goto within 24 hours if Jordan did not release al-Rishawi. CNN couldn't independently verify the authenticity of the messages. The Japanese government said there was no evidence so far that it wasn't Goto speaking in Tuesday's video, which was posted to YouTube and distributed on social media by known ISIS supporters. On Thursday, Japan's prime minister told lawmakers his government was analyzing the latest possible message from ISIS. ""Given the nature of the issue, we cannot tell concrete details,"" Abe said. ""However, within this extremely severe context, the government (of Japan) has been requesting cooperation from the government of Jordan and will continue making the utmost effort for swift release of Mr. Goto."" CNN's Caroline Faraj, Jason Hanna, Yoko Wakatsuki, Kareem Khadder, Mohammed Tawfeeq, Will Ripley, Junko Ogura and Karen Smith contributed to this report.

"He was only a kid, a 15-year-old with braces, when he first dove into the Olympic spotlight. He didn't win any medal at the Sydney Olympics, but he gave fans a tiny glimpse of what was to come when he swam the last 50 meters of the 200-meter butterfly faster than anyone else in the pool. He moved from eighth to fifth and moved from side note to talking point just like that. His teammate Tom Malchow told reporters at those 2000 Games, ""He's a true competitor, and he's going to be one of the greats."" Malchow likely meant swimming great. But did anyone expect the long, lean teenager from Baltimore to grow up to be possibly the greatest Olympian in history? Phelps extends record breaking spree with first individual gold in London . On Tuesday, Phelps won his 19th Olympic medal, more than many countries have ever won. And with a gold on Thursday he moved his overall total to 20 -- 16 gold, two silver and two bronze medals. ""It's a combination of everything,"" he told reporters last week on how he became the biggest name in swimming. ""You have to have a great work ethic. Have a strong mind, be motivated. There are so many things that come into it. ""I have a decent package so I can't complain."" The United States has been a world power in swimming since the days of Johnny Weissmuller, but Phelps has elevated its status like no other American competitor. Phelps talks idols, mistakes and his future . NBC once broadcast the world championships live, a rarity for the sport, because Phelps was so popular. He was the first swimmer to win Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year. After every Summer Olympics the number of swimmers increases, but when Phelps won eight gold medals in an electrifying eight days in Beijing in 2008, it grew exponentially more than previous post-Olympic years, according to a 2009 article in the Orlando Sentinel. Phelps: 'I'm done with swimming' Fresh off his record-setting Beijing performance, in an offseason where he was more concerned about tricking out his new apartment than training, he told Sports Illustrated he wasn't worried about the future even though he was out of shape and had put on some pounds. ""When I have to turn the switch back on, I know I can. All I have to do is put my mind to something and that's it, it's done,"" he said. It took a few years, but after some controversy he became motivated again. If Michael Phelps were a country: Counting up the medals . He was banned from competition for three months in 2009 after a tabloid newspaper ran a photo of him appearing to inhale from a marijuana pipe. He almost retired, but decided the London Games would be his sendoff from the sport he began as a wispy child in Baltimore. Phelps, who started swimming to emulate his sisters at age 7, set individual world records 29 times, and still owns records in six events. In the two competitive races he has left he probably won't be besting those times, now that he's almost a swimming old man (and due to slower swimsuits). He wraps up a career as the most decorated Olympian ever, perhaps the greatest ever. Some commentators will argue the cases of track and field's Carl Lewis, who missed an Olympics due to a U.S. boycott, or distance runner Paavo Nurmi, who won 12 medals. Some might argue for Bjorn Daehlie, the Norwegian cross-country skier. And there's gymnast Larisa Latynina, whose 18 medals are now second all time. It's a class for which it doesn't take long to call roll. Phelps signs off with gold as world records tumble in swimming finale .","Michael Phelps swam one event in his first Olympics, placed fifth .

"In a country where the image of Mao Zedong is still revered and taxi drivers hang Mao medallions from their rear-view mirrors almost like lucky talismans, Bo Xilai's ""red culture"" revival was always going to have traction. In the sprawling riverside megalopolis of Chongqing, the charismatic and urbane politician Bo launched a ""smash black, sing red"" campaign that promoted Chinese communist culture as zealously as it cracked down on organized crime. From June 2009, Bo led a law and order drive that resulted in the arrest of thousands of suspected gangsters, but critics claim it also targeted his political adversaries. The crackdown may have thrilled many in Chongqing's massive municipality of 32.8 million people -- almost four million of whom are rural migrant workers seeking work in the urban center -- but Bo's law-and-order campaign touched on one of China's growing social and political fault lines. While many are becoming fabulously wealthy in the new China, millions more feel they are missing out on the country's economic transformation. Bo's red-tinged economic policies -- which have included millions spent on social housing -- may have garnered him a rock star status in Chongqing, but almost 1,000 miles from the Yangtze River city in Beijing, some party chiefs were taking a different view. His populist policies and high-profile personal style were seen as a challenge to the economically liberal and reform-oriented faction within the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The division emerged in the famous ""cake theory"" spat between Bo and Guangdong party chief Wang Yang in 2011. Wang at the time stated that China needed to pursue economic growth before it could worry about how to divide the wealth, saying that ""one must bake a bigger cake first before dividing it."" Bo was said to have responded: ""Some people think [...] that one must bake a large cake before dividing it; but this is wrong in practice. If the distribution of the cake is unfair, those who make the cake won't feel motivated to bake it."" Political analysts say the spat, which was widely aired on Chinese media last year, drives to the heart of the factional problems besetting the CCP. The political divisions came to a boil in March 2012, when China's national legislature convened its annual meeting in Beijing. Speaking to reporters on March 9 on the sidelines of a panel discussion of Chongqing delegates, Bo defended his policies. ""Ask any citizen on the street if they support fighting corruption and they'll say 'yes',"" he boomed. Addressing the rich-poor divide, he said: ''If only a few people are rich then we are capitalists, we've failed."" That may have been Bo's last stand. Timeline: Bo's fall from grace . A few weeks earlier, Wang Lijun, his handpicked former police chief, had tried to defect to the U.S. consulate in the neighboring Sichuan city of Chengdu, triggering a political crisis that rocked the leadership in Beijing. On March 14, the Prime Minister Wen Jiabao obliquely reprimanded Chongqing's leadership over the Wang incident during the premier's annual press conference. Wen also refered to the damage wrought by the Cultural Revolution - a reference that alluded to Bo's red revival in Chongqing - and said that the city's stellar double-digit economic performance had been the fruits of several administrations and not just Bo's work alone. On March 15, the state-run Xinhua news service announced that Bo had been dismissed as Chongqing party chief and, almost a month later, he was suspended from the CCP's Central Committee and its Politburo-- the second-highest decision-making body in China -- ahead of investigations for ""serious disciplinary violations."" Bo's dismissal is the most sensational political scandal to hit the Chinese Communist Party in recent years. As a ""princeling"" - a son of a revolutionary veteran -- Bo was considered a strong contender for promotion into the Standing Committee of the party's Politburo, whose nine members decide how to run China. But then, things were always likely to be different for the maverick cadre. His father Bo Yibo, who had a similar relaxed and open style, was imprisoned and tortured during the Cultural Revolution as a ""capitalist roader."" His credentials as an economic reformer were cemented during the 1980s when he famously visited the Boeing factory in the United States. Seeing just two planes on the tarmac, Bo senior asked if they were the only planes the factory planned to produce. When he was told that Boeing only made the planes that were on its order books, he immediately saw the problems of China's planned economy which produced goods regardless of whether there was a market or not. Bo Xilai himself spent five years in jail during the Cultural Revolution and was said to have denounced his father during the tumultuous political upheaval -- an action that some argue may have cost him political allies in a culture that strongly values family ties. After his release, Bo entered Peking University's history department in 1977 and two years later, after gaining a degree, Bo got into the master's degree program in journalism, the first ever, at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ""His top ambition then was to be a Chinese journalist posted overseas,"" recalls a classmate and close friend of Bo. After graduation, however, Bo did not pursue his ambition to become a foreign correspondent. Instead, he worked his way up as a local party and government official. He spent 17 years in Dalian, a charming but gritty coastal city in northeastern China. He became Dalian mayor in 1993 and transformed it into a popular investment and tourism destination. As early as 1999, Bo was expected to move to Beijing for a ministerial post but his promotion was aborted when he failed to get elected into the Central Committee, the Communist Party's ruling elite. Bo served as the governor and later party chief of Liaoning, a rust-belt region in northeast China which then boasted of large but mostly money-losing state-owned enterprises. In Liaoning, Bo dealt with high unemployment and endemic corruption. In 2004, when Bo finally got elected into the elite Central Committee, he moved to Beijing as minister of trade and commerce. ""He was a tough and effective negotiator in terms of defending China's global trade policies and interests,"" said Wenran Jiang, a professor at the University of Alberta and Bo's former classmate at Peking University. For decades, Jiang recalled that Bo stood out as one of China's most dynamic and maverick politicians. Instead of reading prepared speeches, for example, he often spoke extemporaneously. ""He would have had a chance to become China's top leader, if China had direct elections. But he shows too much personality and charisma in the post-Mao political culture that emphasizes collective leadership,"" said Wenfang Tang, a political science professor at the University of Iowa. During Bo's anti-corruption crackdown, Bo relied mainly on Wang Lijun, a tough and decorated policeman who served as Chongqing's police chief from 2009 to 2011. The campaign led to thousands of arrests and several executions. Wang was promoted to vice mayor as a reward. Ironically, it was also Wang who torpedoed Bo's career. On February 8, 2012, Wang was unexpectedly reported to be ""on leave"" for health reasons. Days later, Wang mysteriously fled into the U.S. consulate in Chengdu, six hours' drive away from Chongqing. The next day, Wang left the consulate ""of his own volition,"" U.S. officials said, and was taken into custody by security officials. His revelations led to a murder investigation involving Bo's family. In April of the same year, Bo's wife Gu Kailai and a family aide, Zhang Xiaojun, were detained on suspicion of having murdered British businessman Neil Heywood. During her one-day trial that August, Gu issued a statement saying she didn't deny the accusations levied against her, but ""accepted all the facts written in the indictment"" -- including poisoning Heywood at a time when she thought her son's life was in danger, according to the state-run Xinhua news agency. Gu received a suspended death sentence, which is expected to be commuted to life in prison after two years. Zhang was sentenced to nine years in prison. Finally in August this year, the 64-year old stood trial at the Jinan Intermediate People's Court in eastern Shandong Provine on charges of bribe-taking, embezzlement and abuse of power. During the hearings of the politically sensitive trial that took place over several days and featured testimony from both his wife and Wang, Bo denied the charges and strongly challenged the prosecution's case against him, according to court accounts. Days before the court announced the date for delivering the verdict, Bo reiterated his innocence but said he anticipated a lengthy imprisonment in a letter written to his family. Read more: Bo Xilai jailed for life . But then on Sunday, September 23 Bo learned his fate: guilty of all charges and a life term in prison. The fall from grace of this one-time rising star was complete, leaving China watchers to ponder whether this was a statement of intent from President Xi Jinping as he continues with his anti-corruption drive.","Charismatic politician Bo Xilai promoted Chinese communist culture .

"(CNN)A south Georgia man was charged Tuesday with murder in the death of a couple who went missing last week after contacting a car seller on Craigslist, police said. Ronnie ""Jay"" Adrian Towns, 28, also was charged with armed robbery, the Telfair County Sheriff's Office said on its website. A judge denied bail for Towns, who also waived his right to a preliminary hearing. After Towns' initial appearance, reporters shouted questions as he was led from the courthouse, but the suspect remained silent. The victims were shot in the head, police said. Elrey ""Bud"" Runion, 69, and his wife, June, 66, had driven three and a half hours from an Atlanta suburb in search of a classic car after posting on the popular want-ad website. Their bodies were recovered Monday in woods in rural Telfair County. An autopsy Tuesday confirmed their identities. Towns turned himself in Monday. His father told CNN affiliate WSB on Tuesday that his son said he was innocent. ""He said, 'Daddy, I ain't had nothing to do with this,' "" Ronnie Towns Sr. told the station. ""It ain't Jay. I don't believe he did it."" The suspect's father told WSB that he went into the woods Monday where Towns was hiding and talked him into surrendering. His son had no prior record, he said. Telfair County Sheriff Chris Steverson said Towns had the ""last known communications"" with Bud Runion. The couple made the trip to look at a 1966 Mustang, and once Runion got to Telfair County, the suspect communicated with him, according to the sheriff. He did not say who called whom. McRae is about 180 miles from Marietta, where the Runions lived. ""Early on in the investigation, we did contact Mr. Towns, and we did interview him and by the information he provided, we found it to be false and deceptive,"" the sheriff said shortly before Towns turned himself in. ""After we interviewed him, our efforts to contact him were unsuccessful. Today we've contacted his family, and they've been helpful in locating him."" At the victims' home in Marietta, people placed flowers at a memorial around a flagpole in the front yard. A neighbor had lowered the flag to half staff. Another neighbor brought a child's bicycle. He said Bud Runion used to fix bikes through a church group for children in need. ""Bud is a veteran. He and June are great people. They give so much; they are selfless,"" Josh Patterson, the couple's son-in-law, said Monday. Though the overwhelming majority of Craigslist transactions occur without incident, the site has a history of being co-opted by criminals. Just in recent years, there have been numerous such instances. In Henderson, Nevada, police said a man placing an ad in July met three men at a park, who took him to a vacant house, tied him up, beat and robbed him, then escaped in his car. In March, a San Jose, California, woman responding to an ad for a cellular phone was allegedly kidnapped at gunpoint by two men who drove her to an ATM and demanded her passcode, police told a newspaper. In May 2013, a Maine teenager drove to Portland to sell his BMW sedan to a 29-year-old who had responded to his Craigslist ad. The teen was allegedly forced into his own trunk and driven to Delaware, according to media reports and an FBI affidavit. 11 disturbing crimes linked to Craigslist .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thai yellow shirt protesters on Friday demanded the prime minister's resignation over what they say is his failure to protect the interests of the nation. Hundreds chanted ""get out, get out Abhisit"" as they marched toward the statue of the late King Rama V in Bangkok. The king is a legendary figure in the history of the nation's monarchy. About 1,000 protesters took part, said Prawut Thavornsiri, a police spokesman. ""It was generally peaceful and the march ended quickly,"" he said. The nationalist yellow shirts have been demonstrating at major streets in the capital for more than two weeks. They have criticized the handling of the long-running border dispute with Cambodia that has led to deadly clashes recently. Protesters have vowed to retake Thai's land, which they say is lost to Cambodia. Are you there? Share your story and images with CNN iReport. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva once enjoyed support from the yellow shirts, but the relations turned soar after the demands of the nationalist group were not met. The yellow shirts are part of color-coded political divisions that also includes the red shirts. The latter are made up of the country's rural and urban poor, while the yellow shirts are largely middle- and upper-class urbanites. Meanwhile, the border situation between Thailand and Cambodia remains calm, an army spokesman said. If no fighting erupts Friday, displaced Thais should be able to return home, said Col. Shinagard Rattanikitti.","Hundreds chant ""get out, get out Abhisit""

"(CNN) -- Rebel leaders said early Monday that they had captured three of embattled Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's sons -- Saif al-Islam, Saadi and Mohammed -- during their siege of Tripoli. ""As for the other four sons, we think they are either hiding or they have run away,"" said Guma El-Gamaty, the Britain-based coordinator for Libya's Transitional National Council. The latest arrest was that of Mohammad Gadhafi, whom the rebels claimed was being confined to his house. ""I'm being attacked right now. This is gunfire inside my house. They are inside my house,"" a man who identified himself as Mohammed Gadhafi told Al Jazeera in a phone call. A barrage of gunfire was then heard and the phone cut off. Later, the head of the Transitional National Council told the station that Mohammed Gadhafi was not harmed. Earlier, rebel leaders said they captured Saif al-Islam Gadhafi, a top official in his father's regime. Another of Gadhafi's sons, Saadi Gadhafi, was also in custody, the rebels announced. The International Criminal Court says it plans to negotiate the transfer of Saif Gadhafi who -- along with his father -- is wanted for crimes against humanity in connection with their attempts to put down the emerging revolt against Gadhafi's four-decade rule in February. The court, based in The Hague, Netherlands, issued a similar warrant for Abdullah al-Sanussi, the elder Gadhafi's brother-in-law and Libya's intelligence chief. The third son detained is Saadi Gadhafi, a businessman and onetime professional soccer player. He helped set up an April CNN interview with a woman who claimed she'd been raped by government troops. He later told CNN that those behind the attack should be prosecuted. Ali Suleiman Aujali, the Libyan Transitional National Council ambassador to the United States, told CNN early Monday he believes the Libyan people should decide whether to hand over the sons to the ICC. ""I believe the choice for the Libyan people they have the rights, you know, what they want to do with them,"" he said. Aujali said the decision will be made at a later date. ""It's very difficult to say at the present time,"" he said. There was no immediate reaction from Libyan government officials to the reports of the three sons' arrests. The whereabouts of Moammar Gadhafi was also unknown.","NEW: Four other sons are either hiding or have run away, El Gamaty says .

"Benghazi, Libya (CNN) -- CIA operatives are providing intelligence from Libya, where opposition forces are on the run and the defiant government suffered the embarrassing defection of its foreign minister Wednesday. The NATO-led coalition, which is enforcing a no-fly zone and protecting civilians from the intense fighting, got no help from the weather in its ongoing efforts to protect the fragile opposition movement. ""The weather conditions did not allow close combat support by aircraft in the last couple of days,"" said Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. Moammar Gadhafi's government, for its part, kept up the war of words. State-run Libyan TV late Wednesday quoted a military source as saying a ""civilian location was shelled tonight in the city of Tripoli by the colonizing crusader aggression."" Amid debate on whether the allies will arm the retreating and undertrained rebels, a U.S. intelligence source told CNN the CIA is in the country to increase the ""military and political understanding"" of the situation. ""Yes, we are gathering intel firsthand and we are in contact with some opposition entities,"" said the source. The White House refused to comment on a Reuters report that President Barack Obama has signed a secret order authorizing covert U.S. government support for rebel troops. ""I will reiterate what the president said yesterday -- no decision has been made about providing arms to the opposition or to any group in Libya,"" said White House press secretary Jay Carney in a statement. ""We're not ruling it out or ruling it in. We're assessing and reviewing options for all types of assistance that we could provide to the Libyan people, and have consulted directly with the opposition and our international partners about these matters."" According to the Reuters report, Obama signed the covert aid order, or ""finding,"" within the past few weeks. Such findings are required for the CIA to conduct secret operations, the report said. A U.S. official not authorized to speak publicly could not confirm the finding, but noted when there are crises like this, ""you look at all instruments of national power."" In early March, a U.S. official told CNN ""the intelligence community is aggressively pursuing information on the ground"" in Libya. British Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons that he has not ruled out arming the Libyan opposition, but added that Britain has not made the decision to do so. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton provided classified briefings to House and Senate members who asked whether the United States intended to arm the rebels, participants told CNN. Clinton and Gates made clear that no decision had been made, and Congress members from both parties said they believed it would be a bad idea, according to participants. Regarding the committing of U.S. forces to the U.N.-backed operation, the White House has said Obama acted within his authority under the War Powers Act. It notes that the president and other officials consulted congressional leaders several times in the run-up to the March 19 deployment of U.S. forces to the U.N.-authorized Libya mission. Clinton told members of Congress the administration acted within the requirements of the War Powers Act and needed no authorization for further decisions on the mission, lawmakers said. The opposition got a boost Wednesday with news that Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa willingly traveled to London and told the government there that he has resigned, the United Kingdom Foreign Office said. CNN's Ben Wedeman, who has been reporting from Libya for several weeks, said that Koussa's departure is a significant blow, but not a critical loss to the regime. A Foreign Office spokesperson said Koussa was one of the most senior figures in Gadhafi's government ""and his role was to represent the regime internationally -- something that he is no longer willing to do."" The department provided no other details on the surprise move. CNN's Nic Robertson, who previously met with Koussa, said the former head of intelligence once was a stalwart defender of the government. The Senate's Rogers called Moussa's defection ""huge news."" Libya's opposition said its fighters are executing a ""tactical withdrawal"" from a swath of territory they once controlled, a move that comes as Gadhafi's forces relentlessly pound them. Col. Ahmed Bani, speaking at a news conference in the opposition capital of Benghazi on Wednesday, said his forces are being outgunned by the superior military power of loyalists, spared the wrath of coalition airstrikes. They have been pushed eastward over the last two days after CNN reported on Sunday that rebels took Brega, Ras Lanuf and Bin Jawad and reached a town just east of Sirte. Rebel forces have now lost Bin Jawad and the key oil town of Ras Lanuf and are backed up to the Brega area, Bani said. Ajdabiya, which is east of Brega, will be prepared as a ""defense point"" if the withdrawal continues farther east, he said. CNN's Wedeman said the rebels continue to have no effective command and control. Bani called on the international community to supply opposition fighters with better and more powerful weapons to hold off the Gadhafi forces. He said the opposition was open to foreign troops training rebel fighters. Bani asked for tanks, heavy artillery and communications and logistics equipment. The rebels have been demanding an end to Gadhafi's almost 42-year rule in Libya, but they have been facing ""sustained attacks in the face of the coalition bombing"" in Misrata, Ras Lanuf, and Bin Jawad, Robertson reported. In an address to the House of Commons in London on Wednesday, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said that ""regime forces have intensified their attacks, driving back opposition forces from ground they had taken in recent days."" He cited the violence in the western town of Misrata. ""Misrata also came under heavy attack yesterday, with further loss of civilian life, including children, from mortars, sniper fire and attacks on all sides from regime tanks and personnel carriers,"" Hague said. In the outskirts of Ajdabiya -- which was recently taken over by opposition forces -- Gadhafi's regime planted several dozen land mines, Human Rights Watch said in a statement Wednesday. ""Given the pedestrian and vehicular traffic in the area, the mines were clearly laid while government forces were in Ajdabiya,"" the group said. Human Rights Watch also said 370 people are missing in the eastern part of the country, with some suspected to be in government custody. That list includes rebel fighters and civilians, including doctors, the group said.

"North Korea's enigmatic leader Kim Jong Il -- who, after succeeding his father 17 years ago, captained his poor, closed nation and antagonized its enemies -- is dead, state media reported Monday. Kim, 69, died at 8:30 a.m. Saturday, according to state media. A tearful broadcaster reported that Kim died due to ""overwork"" after ""dedicating his life to the people."" Kim suffered ""great mental and physical strain"" while on a train during a ""field guidance tour,"" North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency reported. A look back at the life of Kim Jong Il . More specifically, the agency reported that Kim suffered a heart attack and couldn't be saved despite the use of ""every possible first-aid measure."" He had been treated for ""cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases for a long period,"" KCNA noted. His funeral will be held December 28 and the national mourning period extends until December 29, said the news agency. North Korean and communist party officials ""released a notice on Saturday informing"" members of the Workers' Party of Korea, military ""and all other people"" of Kim's passing, according to KCNA. South Korea's national security council convened after news broke about Kim's death and was still meeting as of 2 p.m. Monday, President Lee Myung-bak's office said. The president canceled the rest of his Monday schedule, and all members of South Korea's military have been placed on ""emergency alert,"" according to Lee's office. Under the alert -- which is short of the highest possible level -- South Korean forces will monitor North Korean troop movements closely and tighten security measures at sea, according to the ministry of defense. In addition, South Korea's National Police Agency has ordered police across the country to be on emergency work shifts. ""South Korea's concern is warranted, frankly, because an insecure North Korea could well be an even more dangerous North Korea,"" a U.S. official said. The White House, meanwhile, released a statement saying U.S. officials are ""closely monitoring reports"" of Kim's death and are ""in close touch with our allies in South Korea and Japan."" This Just In: Up-to-the minute news on the death of Kim Jong Il . ""We remain committed to stability on the Korean peninsula, and to the freedom and security of our allies,"" the White House statement said. The son of Kim Il Song, founder of the communist nation, Kim Jong Il had been in power since 1994 when his father died of a heart attack at age 82. The enigmatic leader was a frequent thorn in the side of neighboring South Korea, as well as the United States. There have been reports in recent years about his health, as well as that power will be transitioned to his son, Kim Jong Un. North Korea's nuclear program -- and international attempts to hinder its nuclear weaponry potential -- put Kim at odds with many world leaders in recent years, as did his governing style. iReport: Send us your reaction . Under his leadership, North Korea was largely closed off to outside influences, fearful of threats from its neighbors and subject to decades of political socialization. At the same time, it also sought international aid after extensive famines that contributed to the deaths of tens of thousands of people. Both North Korea and South Korea have shown signs of concession in recent years -- Pyongyang has expressed willingness to engage with countries involved in multilateral talks aimed at North Korea's denuclearization, while Seoul recently sent humanitarian aid through U.N. agencies to help the malnourished population in the North. But relations between the two rival nations soured yet again when North Korea launched an attack on the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians. U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said earlier this fall that the greatest threat from North Korea is weapons of mass destruction. ""North Korea continues to defy the international community as it enhances its nuclear weapons, its ballistic missile programs and continues to engage in dangerous and destabilizing proliferation activities."" The regime has been planning a nationwide, yearlong celebration in 2012 to show North Korea is ""strong and prosperous"" and also to honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il Song, the communist nation's founder. North Korean news reports earlier this fall indicated that Kim Jong Il had been traveling around the country and visiting China, a big change from 2009 when he was thought to be ill with cancer. Two senior U.S. military officials said then that they believed the pace of North Korea's planned regime change from Kim to his 20-something son appeared to have slowed. The son, also known as Kim, started his career as a four-star general and in recent years was given more official duties by his father. ""He's clearly the designated successor,"" Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the U.S.-China Institute who once worked for CNN, said of Kim Jong Un. ""This has been in place for a while."" Chinoy said he expected that, in the short-term, North Koreans would ""rally around the flag (and) hunker down."" But given the nation's deep-rooted economic and other problems, maintaining that unity and control without a overarching figure like Kim Jong Il in place may be more difficult. ""The deeper questions come over the long-term,"" Chinoy said.","""An insecure North Korea could (be) more dangerous,"" a U.S. official says .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant experienced full meltdowns at three reactors in the wake of an earthquake and tsunami in March, the country's Nuclear Emergency Response Headquarters said Monday. The nuclear group's new evaluation, released Monday, goes further than previous statements in describing the extent of the damage caused by an earthquake and tsunami on March 11. The announcement will not change plans for how to stabilize the Fukushima Daiichi plant, the agency said. Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced a full meltdown, it said. The plant's owner, Tokyo Electric Power Co., admitted last month that nuclear fuel rods in reactors 2 and 3 probably melted during the first week of the nuclear crisis. It had already said fuel rods at the heart of reactor No. 1 melted almost completely in the first 16 hours after the disaster struck. The remnants of that core are now sitting in the bottom of the reactor pressure vessel at the heart of the unit and that vessel is now believed to be leaking. A ""major part"" of the fuel rods in reactor No. 2 may have melted and fallen to the bottom of the pressure vessel 101 hours after the earthquake and tsunami that crippled the plant, Tokyo Electric said May 24. The same thing happened within the first 60 hours at reactor No. 3, the company said, in what it called its worst-case scenario analysis, saying the fuel would be sitting at the bottom of the pressure vessel in each reactor building. But Tokyo Electric at the same time released a second possible scenario for reactors 2 and 3, one that estimated a full meltdown did not occur. In that scenario, the company estimated the fuel rods may have broken but may not have completely melted. Temperature data showed the two reactors had cooled substantially in the more than two months since the incident, Tokyo Electric said in May. The earthquake and tsunami knocked out cooling systems at Fukushima Daiichi, causing the three operating reactors to overheat. That compounded a natural disaster by spewing radioactive material into the atmosphere. Tokyo Electric avoided using the term ""meltdown,"" and says it was keeping the remnants of the core cool. But U.S. experts interviewed by CNN after the company's announcement in May said that while it may have been containing the situation, the damage had already been done. ""On the basis of what they showed, if there's not fuel left in the core, I don't know what it is other than a complete meltdown,"" said Gary Was, a University of Michigan nuclear engineering professor and CNN consultant. And given the damage reported at the other units, ""It's hard to imagine the scenarios can differ that much for those reactors."" A massive hydrogen explosion -- a symptom of the reactor's overheating -- blew the roof off the No. 1 unit the day after the earthquake, and another hydrogen blast ripped apart the No. 3 reactor building two days later. A suspected hydrogen detonation within the No. 2 reactor is believed to have damaged that unit on March 15. CNN's Yoko Wakatsuki and Kyung Lah contributed to this report.","Japan's nuclear emergency agency goes further in describing the extent of damage .

"The Girl Scout cookie can't seem to catch a break. Under fire in years past for including trans fats, high fructose corn syrup and palm oil in its cookies, the Girl Scouts' current cookie selling season is under fire because of policies that have nothing to do with the actual composition of the cookies. A group calling itself HonestGirlScouts.com has posted a YouTube video calling for a boycott of Girl Scout cookies in response to a Colorado troop's decision to allow a 7-year-old transgender child into its troop. Gay rights and transgender rights groups have reported a grassroots LGBT movement of supporters buying Girl Scout cookies in response to the video. ""I've decided to purchase as many boxes as my modest budget will allow and donate them to the local LGBTQ community center,"" says Mara Morken, a lesbian stay-at-home mom in Fargo, North Dakota. ""I want to show support for GSUSA in their honorable decision to allow all girls to participate in their programs. However I do not want that support to show itself on my thighs, so I will donate the entire cookie order!"" After an initial burst of publicity around the nearly 8-minute video featuring a teen Girl Scout wearing a Girl Scout sash, the video has been made private on YouTube. However, it's still available for viewing elsewhere on the Internet. ""I ask all fellow Girl Scouts who want a true, all-girl experience not to sell any Girl Scouts cookies until GSUSA (Girl Scouts of the USA) addresses our concerns,"" says the girl, identified as a teen named Taylor, a troop member from California, in some news reports. ""I ask all parents who want their girls to be in a safe environment to tell their leaders why you will not allow your girls to make any more money for GSUSA."" The video was prompted by the case of Bobby Montoya, whose mother told a CNN affiliate in October that a troop leader initially told her that Bobby couldn't join the troop because Bobby ""has boy parts,"" even though her child identifies as a girl. The Girl Scouts of Colorado blamed the initial decision to exclude the child on ignorance of the scouts' policy. The state scouts said Bobby was welcome to join Girl Scouts. ""If a child identifies as a girl and the child's family presents her as a girl, Girl Scouts of Colorado welcomes her as a Girl Scout,"" said the Colorado Girl Scouts, in a statement to a CNN affiliate. The Honest Girl Scouts website says that the Girl Scouts use cookie income to promote ""abortion and LGBT agendas,"" introduces Girl Scouts to ""the concept of sexual rights for children without parent consent"" and is rewriting badge books to include ""radical activists and gay role models."" On its website, HonestGirlScouts.com states that the group is comprised of current and former Girl Scouts, leaders, parents, volunteers and lifetime members. When contacted via its listed Gmail account to comment, someone replied that the group's ""legal counsel has advised us not to comment or do interviews until further notice."" Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, dismissed the video as an attempt by conservative activists to raise funds. ""This issue not withstanding, the Girl Scouts is a really good organization,"" says Keisling. ""It's been a really good place for kids to learn things. (This controversy) will die down. We as a society are progressing and the outdated reactionary attitude that poor girl was put up to in that video, those attitudes are dying out."" Other LGBT groups are taking a tongue-in-check approach to the debate, encouraging people to eat more Girl Scout cookies. ""Girl Scout cookies may not be so great for your waistline but they are great for being inclusive,"" says Liz Owen, spokeswoman for Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays (P-FLAG). Owen reports hearing from people who decided to break their New Year's resolutions to go on a diet with a Girl Scout cookies purchase.","A group is calling for national boycott of Girl Scout cookies because of transgender issues .

"(CNN)Curious kittens exploding are the Internet's new potato salad meets ""Reading Rainbow"" with a guest appearance by Veronica Mars, meaning this card game is seriously winning the hearts of Internet users and party game lovers alike. ""Exploding Kittens,"" the card game dreamed up by video game designers Elan Lee and Shane Small and illustrated by The Oatmeal's Matthew Inman, is now the most backed campaign in Kickstarter history, in terms of the number of backers, according to the crowdfunding platform. The card game has raised more than $4 million since its January 20 launch -- far exceeding the initial $10,000 goal. Kickstarter spokesman David Gallagher confirmed the game, which has everything from magical enchiladas to cats that can kill you, had set a record for the most individual donors. More than 108,000 individuals have pledged as of Tuesday evening. That's more backers than the crowd-pleasing reboot of Veronica Mars, return of ""Reading Rainbow"" or the Coolest Cooler in the 21st century received in their individual campaigns. (Although LeVar Burton is at a close second with 105,857 supporters.) The fundraising campaign still has 22 days to go before it's officially over. Luke Crane, Kickstarter's community manager for games, says the success of ""Exploding Kittens"" is a combination of The Oatmeal's online popularity, Elan Lee's great reputation in the games world, and Kickstarter's own game-loving community. ""They love being a part of making something new. And they've pledged a total of $305 million to games projects since Kickstarter first launched,"" Crane said. ""We knew it would be successful given the people involved, but we had no idea it would get this big."" In an interview with CNN Wednesday, Elan Lee described ""Exploding Kittens"" as a strategic kitty-powered version of Russian roulette that gets more intense as users play the game because there's a greater chance of drawing an exploding kitten card. In its blog post, the ""Exploding Kittens"" team says the success of its fundraising campaign has nothing to do with money, press or fancy graphics and it has everything to do with the people who feel passionately about backing the game. ""It has everything to do with you. You wonderful people have come together to form the largest community in Kickstarter history, and the numbers keep rising,"" the creators wrote. The community is also helping to improve on the game, Lee said. Commenters on the Kickstarter page flagged their concern about left-handed accessibility when it comes to fanning out cards. Now the ""Exploding Kittens"" team is looking into how to make the game easy to use for right and left-handed people. Lee estimates card decks will start being shipped by July. ""We pushed away everything to focus on our core promise that you send us $20 and we'll send you the game,"" he said. Initially, Lee planned on printing 1,000 decks of ""Exploding Kittens"" and got an estimate that it would cost $10,000. That was the original amount on the ""Exploding Kittens"" Kickstarter page. But when the pledges soared into the millions, Lee shared the Kickstarter page with his printer because he wasn't sure how many orders they could fill. The printer, who also works with the popular Kickstarter game ""Cards Against Humanity,"" was floored. ""She just started screaming,"" Lee said. That's the kind of enthusiasm Lee is seeing on ""Exploding Kittens"" Kickstarter page. ""This is an amazing community. This is the place where people are coming together to help build this game. These 108,000 people will tell us what they love and what they were concerned about,"" he said.","""Exploding Kittens"" is the most backed Kickstarter project ever .

"Many observers point to Moscow's close ties with Damascus going back to the 1950s as a reason for Russia now acting to defend the al-Assad regime in Syria against its many internal and external opponents. What has apparently been forgotten is that Moscow's ties with Syria have been plagued by tensions and disagreements throughout this entire period. Underpinning the Moscow-Damascus relationship for over half a century now has been a common antipathy toward America, Israel, and the moderate Arab states. But they have also differed on many issues. When Soviet-Syrian relations first became close during the mid-1950s, Moscow seemed to hope the then-powerful Syrian Communist Party might at least share power with the virulently anti-Israeli and anti-Western Baath Party. But the Syrian Baathists feared the communists and agreed to the 1958 merger of their country with Egypt and even accepted the leadership of the latter's ruler, Nasser, partly in order to get his help in suppressing the communists. After Nasser helped them do this successfully, he and the Syrian Baathists fell out, and Syria withdrew  from their union (officially the United Arab Republic) in 1961. Moscow restored ties with Damascus, but during the 1960s and early 1970s had much closer relations with Egypt, which had allowed the Soviet Union to build up military and naval facilities there. Soviet-Syrian relations improved after Nasser's successor, Sadat, switched Egypt from being a Soviet ally to being an American one, and even made a separate peace with Israel. Moscow was also grateful to Syria for being one of the few Muslim states that did not condemn the USSR for invading and occupying Afghanistan. Nevertheless, Moscow and Damascus disagreed on several issues. Although the USSR supplied arms to Syria, Damascus complained that America supplied better ones to Israel, and that this allowed Israel to best Syria on the numerous occasions when their forces clashed. Moscow responded by saying there was nothing wrong with the quality of Soviet weapons; it was the quality of the Syrian personnel operating them that was deficient. While it broke diplomatic relations with Israel during the June 1967 Arab-Israeli War, the Soviet Union at least recognized Israel's right to exist. Syria, by contrast, did not. As a result, Syria did not cooperate even with Soviet-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace initiatives. In addition, Moscow was not pleased about Syria's intervention in Lebanon's long civil war beginning in the mid-1970's. Moscow and Damascus often found themselves supporting different factions during it. Further, while Moscow (and many Western states) supported Iraq during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, Syria -- practically alone among Arab states -- supported Iran. Syria was not happy with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev for having improved relations with America, the West, the moderate Arab states, and even Israel. And while Russian relations with America and the West deteriorated during the Yeltsin era (1991-99), this was also a period in which Russia was largely absent from the Middle East and thus did not provide much support for Syria. After Putin rose to power at the very end of 1999, it soon became clear that he wanted to reassert Russia's influence in the Middle East and elsewhere. Even so, Russian-Syrian relations did not improve for several years and were actually quite testy until 2005. Putin was unhappy that Syria was unwilling to repay its Soviet era debt -- some $12-13 billion -- to Moscow. Damascus was unhappy about the improvement in Russian-Israeli relations that occurred under Putin, and about Russia's refusal to sell advanced weapons that Syria wanted but Israel objected to it acquiring. Russian-Syrian relations, though, did improve in 2005 -- the year that Syria withdrew its forces from Lebanon in response to an amazing popular uprising in that country and possibly to Syrian fear of American intervention if it did not withdraw. Moscow and Damascus resolved the debt issue (very much in Syria's favor), Moscow began work to revitalize the use of naval facilities at the Syrian port of Tartus that the Soviet Navy had used during the late Cold War era, and the Russian oil firm, Tatneft, gained a foothold in the Syrian petroleum sector. While the West and the Arab League have condemned President Bashar al-Assad's regime for its violent oppression of the popular unrest against it that arose in 2011, Russia (along with China) has staunchly defended Damascus in the UN Security Council and elsewhere. Many of the previous Russian-Syrian differences, though, remain -- especially ones concerning Russia's close relations with Israel and the inability of Syria to obtain certain Russian weapons systems. Should the al-Assad regime manage to crush its internal opponents and remain in power, it is doubtful that these ongoing Russian-Syrian differences will disappear. Moscow is not defending the al-Assad regime because it has been such a great Russian ally. What motivates the Kremlin instead is the fear that if the al-Assad regime falls, what comes next in Syria will be worse for Russia: either a pro-Western, democratic government that has no further need of Russia, or a radical, Islamist regime that is as anti-Russian as it is anti-Western. In either case, Russia would lose influence in Syria. And since Syria is the last country in the Middle East in which it has strong influence, this means Russia will lose influence in the Middle East as a whole. Compared to this prospect, it is not surprising that Moscow prefers to see the survival of the al-Assad regime despite how difficult and uncooperative a partner for Russia  it has proven itself to be.

"Yemen's parliament approved a controversial law Saturday that ensures President Ali Abdullah Saleh complete immunity from prosecution. The law was delayed for weeks as Saleh insisted on specific changes guaranteeing his aides partial protection from legal actions. In return, Saleh will step down from power in Yemen next month after ruling the country for more than 33 years. Yemeni Information Minister Ali al-Amrani said the law was the best option for the country and that people can now look forward for change and development. ""The law was a pivotal point of debate, and now we are looking forward to February 21 (when) a president would lead the country,"" al-Amrani said. ""Many changes took place in the law to make it accepted by all factions, but in the end, the efforts were worth it,"" he added. During the same session, the parliament also accepted Vice President Abdurabu Hadi's nomination for presidency. The vice president's office hailed the move and called it a success after long negotiations over the past week. The immunity law was always linked with parliament accepting Hadi's nomination for president. Saleh supporters refuse to pass Hadi's nomination until the immunity law passed. The immunity law was a key element in a Gulf Cooperation Council power transfer deal. Since the president signed the power transfer deal in November, tens of thousands of young activists have marched in provinces across Yemen. They have vowed to have Saleh tried for the deaths of hundreds of unarmed protesters. The United Nations' envoy to Yemen, Jamal Benomar, arrived in the country last week to ease the tension after fears grew that the deal would collapse. Though the deal was hailed by opposition parties in Yemen, youth protesters and international rights groups called the immunity a violation of international law. Youth protesters continued marching on Saturday, rejecting any immunity for Saleh or those who served under him over the last three decades. Protests took place in 13 provinces across Yemen, according to the Revolution Youth Organizing Committee. The largest protests took place in Sanaa, where many continued pushing for Saleh's prosecution. ""He killed many, and now the opposition wants to forgive him,"" said Salma al-Nusari, a youth activist in Sanaa. Blood that Saleh spilt will not be forgiven, and we will continue demanding his prosecution until our demands are met."" Presidential elections are expected to take place February 21.","Protests take place in 13 provinces Saturday, an organizing committee says .

"(CNN)Diego Lagomarsino is among the few who can offer clues about the puzzling death of Argentine prosecutor Alberto Nisman. The IT security expert was one of the last to see Nisman alive. Nisman was found dead in his apartment days after filing a report accusing the country's top leaders of covering up Iran's involvement in Argentina's worst terrorist attack. It looked like a suicide, but now even the government has doubts that is the truth. So when Lagomarsino decided to address reporters on Wednesday, it should have been an unequivocally illuminating event. But like so much of the information surrounding Nisman's mysterious death, seeds of doubt had already been planted. In addition to being an assistant to Nisman, Lagomarsino is the one who gave the prosecutor the gun that ended his life and is the only person charged in connection with his death. Lagomarsino faces up to six years in prison if convicted of providing Nisman with the gun. With this hanging over his head, Lagomarsino broke his silence, saying that he committed no crime and that he let Nisman borrow the gun at the prosecutor's insistence. Nisman was fearful about his safety after he filed his report in court and was distrustful of even the security guards that were assigned to protect him, Lagomarsino said. The prosecutor had called Lagomarsino, who had become a family friend through the IT work he did for them, before dawn on January 17. Nisman asked him to come over to his apartment immediately, Lagomarsino said. Lagomarsino recalls seeing documents splayed out on a table and an anxious Nisman spilling his fears. The prosecutor was worried about repercussions for the accusations he levied against the government. He alleged that President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and Foreign Minister Hector Timerman, among others, conspired to cover up Iran's involvement in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in exchange for a friendly trade deal. In the days after he filed the complaint in court, Nisman didn't even venture out to buy groceries. He had his mother do that for him, Lagomarsino said. ""I am more afraid of being right than being wrong,"" the IT engineer remembers Nisman telling him that morning. He was afraid that his daughters were in danger, Nisman told Lagomarsino. The prosecutor said he didn't trust his security guards, and asked Lagomarsino if he had a gun he could borrow. Lagomarsino went back home and thought about the request. When Nisman called again, insisting that he bring the weapon over. According to Lagomarsino, Nisman claimed he would not use the gun and only wanted to have it in his glove box in case of an emergency. So Lagomarsino returned to Nisman's apartment, handed him the weapon, and then left. He texted Nisman later that afternoon to check in on him. The prosecutor never replied. Nisman, who had been investigating the 1994 bombing of the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association (AMIA) that killed 85 people, died from a gunshot wound to the head. The gun that Lagomarsino had given him was near the body, along with a shell casing. His body was found on January 18, the day after his conversation with Lagomarsino, and the day before he was to testify before lawmakers about his allegations. An autopsy was performed the next day. President Fernandez was quick to call it a suicide but changed her story a few days later. A test found no gunpowder residue on Nisman's hands, as would have been expected if he had pulled the trigger. On Wednesday, Nisman's body was returned to his family after his ex-wife declined to have additional tests conducted on the body, the state-run Telam news agency reported. The prosecutor's funeral is scheduled for Thursday. Even before Nisman died, Fernadez's government vehemently denied that it had covered up anything relating to the 1994 bombing. The government's Cabinet chief has said that Nisman was swayed by information from Antonio ""Jaime"" Stiusso, a former Argentine intelligence chief. Stiusso was ousted from the intelligence agency in December. Government officials have implied that rogue intelligence agents misled Nisman to attack Fernandez and then killed him when they no longer needed him. Many of the small details in the case fuel the conspiracy fire. In the days after Nisman's body was found, state media published what it described as a social media message from Nisman to friends explaining that he had to cut a vacation to Spain short so he could return to Argentina and file the report against the President. On Wednesday, the prosecutor investigating Nisman's death, Viviana Fein, told reporters that there is no evidence that Nisman suddenly changed his plans. Records show that his return from Spain had been planned weeks before. There have also been reports linking Lagomarsino to the former intelligence agent Stiusso. The IT man's lawyer denied that the two knew each other.

"(CNN)It was a very telling mini-scandal, the faux-fury over Michelle Obama's short visit to Saudi Arabia. First there was the phony claim that Saudi television had blurred the first lady's image in its transmission of the Obamas' condolence call on the kingdom. Then came the kerfuffle over her outfit. Was she insensitive in not wearing a headscarf? Should she had worn black? Then, finally, we heard the questions about whether she committed an etiquette no-no when she shook hands with the new Saudi monarch, King Salman. None of these accusations and claims amount to much on their own. But there is a reason, a very good reason, why social media turned its attention sharply toward Michelle Obama in Saudi Arabia. The presence of an American first lady on Saudi territory embodies the intense unease that surrounds U.S. and Western relations with the Saudi kingdom. Saudi Arabians can be the most hospitable people in the world, and they are friends of the United States. But all is not well with the relationship. The spectacle of American and European leaders lavishly praising and courting the Saudi royals is a most unsettling one. U.S.-Saudi relations present a profound moral dilemma for America. They constitute a classic example of the tough choices a nation faces when its ideals clash with its interests. The United States wants to have good relations with Saudi Arabia, not only because it has a lot of oil, but because it is one of the most powerful countries in the Middle East and the two countries share many strategic goals. The U.S. needs Saudi Arabia -- and Saudi Arabia needs the U.S. At the same time, many of Saudi Arabia's practices stand in direct violation of America's -- and the world's -- most cherished values. Values or interests: that is the question. Let's now put an end to the discussion about Michelle Obama. She did absolutely nothing wrong. In fact, the claim that her attire and performance created a firestorm in Saudi Arabia is plainly false. By some counts, there were some 1,500 tweets with the Arabic hashtag #ميشيل_أوباما_سفور, which means roughly #Michelle_Obama_Unveiled. That is hardly a Twitterstorm, considering that Saudi Arabia has more than 5 million Twitter users. Second, the first lady followed protocol. Saudi law does not require foreign visitors to wear a hijab, the Muslim headscarf. This was no protocol breach, and it was also not an unusually courageous move on her part. Countless prominent women have appeared in public meeting Saudi royals without wearing headscarves. We've seen Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, Angela Merkel, among others, visit the kingdom in Western attire. Finally, that handshake: The King would not have shaken hands with Michelle Obama if he had not wanted to do so. In fact, we saw an endless parade of dignitaries shake the President's hand and walk right past the first lady, bluntly, rudely, ignoring her. That is a breach of etiquette. But it was not committed by the first lady or by King Salman. So it looks like this is the scandal that wasn't.  A non-tempest, if you will. But there was a teapot. The story made headlines because people in the United States and in the West feel a scandal in the relationship, because much of what goes on in Saudi Arabia is an affront not just to Western principles but to human rights conventions endorsed by most of the world. And some of the most egregious violations of those values are perpetrated against Saudi women. For decades Saudi women have protested the indefensible rule that bans them from driving, making Saudi Arabia the only country in the world with such a ban. A Saudi woman is required to have a male relative as a ""guardian"" who must approve her travel and other key decisions in her life. Saudi women are required to wear the abaya, a head-to-toe cover, and many wear a niqab, which covers the face. The fact that they dress differently is not in itself a rights violation, but the fact that they have no choice in the matter is. Saudi women, who are intelligent, strong, competent, mature, capable of making decision for themselves as well as any Saudi man, are treated in many cases as if they were children. But it's not just women whose rights, as defined by international standards, are violated. There is no freedom of religion in the kingdom, where everyone by law must be a Muslim and the public practice of other religions is forbidden.  And freedom of expression is severely restricted. Blogger Raif Badawi, who sought to promote a discussion about social and religious issues on his website, was sentenced to 1,000 lashes for ""insulting Islam,"" and showing disobedience. He suffered the first 50 lashes a few weeks ago, and the international outcry, combined with the toll it took on his health, led the government to put the rest of the sentence on hold. Then there are the public beheadings after questionable legal proceedings. Already 16 people have been beheaded this year. There were 87 such punishments last year. So what is the United States to do? Cooperation with Saudi Arabia is crucial in restoring stability to the Middle East, in fighting ISIS and other terrorist groups, in keeping oil prices low to pressure Iran and Russia, and in a number of other high-priority items on the world's agenda. The answer is a frustrating balance of realism and idealism. The answer requires acknowledging -- in private and in public, as Hillary Clinton has done -- that we find some of their practices unacceptable, along with an open and unapologetic defense of the principles of equality and basic freedoms. The United States cannot sever relations with Riyadh, and the truth is that it cannot force the Saudis to change, but keeping quiet on the matter is an unseemly capitulation. A condolence call was not the time for public criticism, and Michelle Obama's presence in Riyadh was a meaningful sign that the United States believes women belong in the public sphere. The scandal was a sign of the frustration people feel with this ethical dilemma.","Frida Ghitis: Michelle Obama's not wearing headscarf in Saudi Arabia is a faux-scandal .

"Seven U.S. Marines were killed in the midair collision of two U.S. military helicopters along the Arizona-California border, officials said Thursday. Six killed in the crash were based at Camp Pendleton, California, and one was from Yuma, Arizona, the Marine Corps said. The crash occurred during routine training operations Wednesday night around 10:30 p.m. ET, according to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma Base Commander Col. Robert Kuckuk. The collision occurred in the Chocolate Mountains on the California side of the range, near Yuma. The aircraft, an AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter and a UH-1Y Huey utility chopper, were part of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing and based at Camp Pendleton. According to Gunnery Sgt. Dustin Dunk, a spokesperson for Air Station Yuma, two other helicopters were in the immediate area of the collision. Authorities were investigating. ""We won't know exactly what happened until the investigation is complete, and we can't make any assumptions right now,"" said 1st Lt. Maureen Dooley, a Marine Corps spokeswoman. While weather did not appear to play a factor, visibility may have been severely limited by nightfall and a significant amount of dust, referred to as a ""brown out,"" created by the helicopters landing and taking off, according to Dunk. The Marines on board were preparing for deployment to Afghanistan, Dooley said. ""We have aircraft going out to Yuma training ranges on a weekly basis, and they go out there primarily because the aircraft mimics what they will see in Afghanistan,"" Dooley said. Authorities did not plan to release the names of the Marines involved until their families were notified. ""This tragedy serves as another stark and sad reminder of the peril our men and women in uniform encounter on a daily basis -- not only abroad, but on our own soil. It also reminds us that, whether in combat or training, no military mission is ever routine,"" Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said in a statement. ""We must never take for granted nor forget these soldiers' sacrifice and service to the United States of America."" Marine Corps Air Station Yuma is home to about 4,000 active duty Marines and sailors. It supports 80% of the Marine Corps air-to-ground aviation training and covers five square miles in southeastern Yuma. The military has long used the AH-1W and UH-1 Huey for a variety of tasks.

"Bruce Willis has vanquished terrorists, basement rapists and the defenses of Cybill Shepherd. But in his three decades in Hollywood he may not have faced as daunting an opponent as Apple. According to an unconfirmed report in a British publication, Willis wants to bequeath his extensive iTunes music collection to his daughters -- something that's not permitted under the current iTunes terms. The Daily Mail says the actor has spent thousands of dollars downloading music on to ""many, many iPods"" but, like many iTunes users, was surprised to discover that in Apple's eyes he doesn't actually own the songs. The Mail, without citing any sources, says Willis is considering legal action against Apple to gain control over the music. CNN could not confirm the report Monday, and a request sent to representatives for Willis was not immediately returned. The ""Die Hard"" actor's wife, Emma Heming-Willis, cast doubt on the report when she said Monday on Twitter, ""It's not a true story."" But the news reports, exaggerated or not, do raise potentially significant issues about ownership of digital music and whether someone could pass on digital assets to heirs. Apple's terms and conditions for iTunes are an exhaustive, jargon-filled document that users must ""agree"" to before downloading content but that many people don't bother to read. In simplified terms, they state that when we buy music from iTunes, we are paying for the license to listen to songs via our iPhone, iPod or other Apple device. But we are not buying the music itself. ""When you buy a book, you own the copy of that book but not the actual material,"" Jonathan Handel, a Los Angeles-based entertainment attorney who specializes in digital media and intellectual property, told CNN last year. ""What you are buying here is right to use music on certain devices."" If Willis did take on Apple over ownership of his iTunes collection, he might have an uphill legal battle. The iTunes terms are essentially a contract between the user and Apple, and clicking ""Agree"" counts as an electronic signature, digital-media lawyers say. Nothing would stop Willis from leaving music-loaded laptops or phones to his children, although things would get more complicated if his kids tried to transfer the songs to other devices. Apple limits use of digital music to Apple gadgets used by the iTunes account holder.  Apple also prohibits users from downloading songs to more than 10 devices, or burning a playlist more than seven times. Willis, 57, has three adult daughters with ex-wife Demi Moore and a young daughter with current wife Heming. Apple did not respond Monday to a request for comment. The company's formidable legal team last month won a $1 billion judgment against rival Samsung in a patent dispute. Other online music retailers, such as Amazon and Google Play, impose similar restrictions on downloads. Willis was trending on Twitter Monday, with some commenters poking fun at the issue. Wrote one Twitter user, ""I don't know what's more shocking Bruce Willis suing Apple ... or the fact he actually read the Terms and Conditions.""","Report: Bruce Willis wants to bequeath his iTunes music collection to his daughters .

"Former Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell died Thursday, the team reported on its website. Modell, 87, was an NFL owner for 43 years, during which his teams won two championships. He died peacefully of natural causes at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital, the team said. ""'Poppy' was a special man who was loved by his sons, his daughter-in-law Michel, and his six grandchildren,"" Modell's son, David Modell, said in a statement released by the team. ""Moreover, he was adored by the entire Baltimore community for his kindness and generosity. And, he loved Baltimore. He made an important and indelible contribution to the lives of his children, grandchildren and his entire community. We will miss him."" Modell made a large mark on the league as chairman of its television committee, which helped shape lucrative rights fees for game broadcasts. He led owners' negotiations on the first collective bargaining agreement with players in 1968, according to his team biography. He was also league president from 1967 to 1969. Modell purchased the Cleveland Browns in 1961 for $4 million. The Browns won the National Football League championship in 1964, two years before the NFL and the rival American Football League agreed to merge. In 1996, he moved the team to Baltimore, where, playing as the Ravens, the team won the 2001 Super Bowl. He stepped aside as owner in 2003. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley hailed Modell for his contributions to Baltimore and the state. ""He helped reinvigorate Baltimoreans' sense of pride in their team and their city,"" he said in a statement.

"A gunman who shot dead two American officers inside the Afghan interior ministry remained at large late Saturday as U.S. officials decried the attack in Kabul. ""This act is unacceptable, and the United States condemns it in the strongest possible terms,"" Defense Department press secretary George Little said in a statement. The Taliban claimed responsibility, though NATO and Afghan officials are investigating and have not confirmed involvement by the Islamist militant group. A Taliban spokesman said the attack was in response to the recent burning of Qurans at a U.S. base. The killing of the officers prompted Gen. John Allen to order all military advisers with the International Security Assistance Force to withdraw from government ministries in the Afghan capital as a precaution. According to ISAF, initial reports indicated that ""an individual"" turned his weapon against NATO service members, later confirmed by an Afghan police official to be an American colonel and major. The two officers were found dead in their office from gunshot wounds to the head, the Afghan police official said. ""They were part of the advisory mission there,"" the official said. ""At this stage we can't say why they were killed."" Hours later, U.S. President Barack Obama called Allen to discuss the situation and express condolences to the families. ""We welcome President (Hamid) Karzai's statement this morning encouraging peaceful expressions, and his call for dialogue and calm,"" Obama said in a statement released by the White House. ""The United States remains committed to a partnership with the government and people of Afghanistan, as we work to realize our shared goal of disrupting, dismantling and defeating al Qaeda and strengthening the Afghan state."" Photos: Faces of the Taliban . The investigation into the attack is ongoing, and it was unclear who the shooter was, the Afghan official said. However, it's unlikely that the gunman was an outsider who had infiltrated the ministry, he said. The attack happened in a separate compound inside the interior ministry where as many as 10 Americans are based, the Afghan official said. Such an attack would have to be planned, he said. ""The perpetrator of this attack is a coward whose actions will not go unanswered,"" Allen said. Allen's order for ISAF advisers to withdraw includes the interior and defense ministries, among others, the U.S. official said. The U.K. Foreign Office announced that British officials working in Afghan ministries in Kabul have also been withdrawn, as a ""temporary measure."" ISAF provides advisers in key ministries to help train Afghan officials. It is not clear to what extent ISAF's military training mission was affected by the attack. Afghan Defense Minister Abdul Rahim Wardak called his American counterpart, Leon Panetta, to offer his condolences and apologized for the attack, Little said. Panetta ""urged the Afghan government to take decisive action to protect coalition forces and curtail the violence in Afghanistan after a challenging week in the country,"" he added. Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said ""the attacker is still alive and resisting and a second Mujahid managed to escape the ministry."" ""This comes amid our call to all Afghan security forces to turn their guns towards the invading forces who are the real enemies of our country and religion and kill them so they leave our country,"" Mujahid said in an e-mail. Saturday's brazen attack at the interior ministry came amid continued protests over the recent burning of Qurans at Bagram Airfield. A military official said the materials burned were removed from a detainee center's library because they had ""extremist inscriptions"" on them and there was ""an appearance that these documents were being used to facilitate extremist communications."" A fifth day of demonstrations over the burning left four civilians dead and 50 injured near the United Nations office in Kunduz, said Saad Mokhtar, head of the city's health department. Twelve police officers were among the wounded Saturday. Allen addressed the burning issue during a visit to a military base where two U.S. soldiers were killed Thursday by a man wearing an Afghan National Army uniform. A protest over the burning of Qurans was taking place outside the base at the time of the killings. Allen called on troops to ""show the Afghan people that as bad as that act was at Bagram, it was unintentional, and Americans and ISAF soldiers do not stand for this. We stand for something greater than that."" Obama also apologized for the incident. Muslims believe the Quran is the word of God, so holy that people should wash their hands before touching the sacred book.","President Obama expresses condolences .

"Washington (CNN)They weren't exactly James Bond but the three alleged Russian spies exposed by the FBI are part of the most intense effort by Russia to infiltrate agents onto American soil since the Cold War. In an affidavit unsealed in federal court on Monday, the Justice Department accused Evgeny Buryakov, also known as ""Zhenya,"" of posing as a Russian banker in Manhattan to funnel economic intelligence to the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence agency. Two other Russians, Igor Sporyshev and Victor Podobnyy, were ostensibly diplomats in Russia's UN mission in New York but are accused of being Buryakov's SVR handlers. While Buryakov was operating deep undercover and therefore had no diplomatic protection, the other two have immunity and have already left the the United States. Anecdotes in the affidavit portray the accused spies as bumbling and hapless compared to the stereotype of hard-eyed Soviet-era KGB professionals. Still, news of their existences comes at the most perilous moment in U.S.-Russia relations in decades, with Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin at a standoff over issues ranging from Ukraine to Moscow's claims it has a right to a ""sphere of influence"" in its backyard. A spy operation will only serve to deepen the hostilities. Professor Mark Galeotti, a specialist in transnational organized crime, security affairs and Russia at New York University, said that Russian operations are cranking up against the U.S. and its European allies. ""It is clear that this is a process that has been taking place over time,"" he said. ""It is not just about throwing money and people into it. It is the tempo and the aggressiveness that is at the height of Cold War levels."" FBI: Russian spies used tickets and hats to try to hide New York activities . Edward Lucas, author of ""Deception: The Untold Story of East-West Espionage Today,"" said ""Russian espionage in the West is on a bigger scale than it was during the Soviet period."" ""We are an open society so we are very easy to spy on and we are in competition with a very closed society, which is Russia. They use intelligence as one of the most important tools in the Kremlin tool kit."" U.S. authorities agree. ""More than two decades after the presumptive end of the Cold War, Russian spies continue to seek to operate in our midst under cover of secrecy,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. Assistant FBI Director Randall Coleman warned that despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, ""espionage is as pervasive today as it has ever been."" ""This case is especially egregious as it demonstrates the actions of a foreign intelligence service to integrate a covert intelligence agent into American society under the cover of an employee in the financial sector,"" he said. The affidavit contains details of alleged -- and apparently fumbling -- attempts by the accused SVR agents to recruit female students at a New York University and a boastful American businessman dreaming of riches in the Russian energy industry. Those tid bits have sparked derisive assessments of Moscow's espionage prowess, echoing the ridicule drummed up by the outing of Anna Chapman in 2010. She was exposed in an FBI probe into 10 Russian deep cover ""sleeper agents"" and was later exchanged with Moscow in a spy swap. According to the unclassified affidavit, the 2015 spies, like the 2010 brigade, appeared to extract little useful intelligence and appeared not to penetrate deeply into the U.S. financial industry. In fact, the two alleged handlers, were caught on an FBI surveillance tape complaining that life as a spy in the United States wasn't like it was in the movies. Podobnyy is quoted in the affidavit as saying that he didn't expect to be ""James Bond"" but had expected a little more excitement. ""Of course, I wouldn't fly helicopters,"" he said, but confessed he had expected to ""pretend to be someone else"" under an assumed identity. The pair apparently communicated with Buryakov using covert and coded methods and conducted 48 clandestine meetings, unaware they were under surveillance by the FBI. Lucas said that in retrospect their missions might look amateurish, but ""all espionage operations look brilliant if they succeed and blundering if they fail."" Close observers of the spy trade argue that media mockery over Chapman, now a TV star and model in Russia, and her apparently unsuccessful comrades in New York, detracts from a long-term, well-financed and painstaking effort by Moscow -- and Putin, a former KGB agent  -- to insert ""illegals"" deep into Western society. Peter Earnest, a former CIA case officer who now heads the International Spy Museum in Washington, said that a perception had grown that those swept up in the 2010 operation were part of a hapless ""Keystone Cops"" operation. ""The  Russians under Putin have chosen to invest a lot of money into placing people like that overseas,"" he said. ""It wasn't clear to the public what these people were doing."" ""They were meant to be sleepers,"" Earnest said. ""Typically an illegal sent to another country is a sleeper. He or she is available to handle a very sensitive asset, or in the case of wartime, or some sort of confrontation, be available."" While the agents exposed in New York this week were not ""sleepers"", they were also evidence of a comprehensive Russian espionage program. The latest National Threat Assessment by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned last year that Russia, in addition to challenging U.S. cyber security, was also seeking to target U.S. personnel with access to sensitive computer network information. He named Russia and China as the biggest threats to U.S. state security and said they were seeking data on advanced weapons systems and information on U.S. firms and research institutions that deal with energy, finance, the media, defense and dual use technologies. John Schindler, who spent a decade with the National Security Agency working as an intelligence analyst and counterintelligence officer on Eastern Europe and the Middle East, believes the U.S.-Russia spy wars are as vibrant as ever. ""This is the tip of an iceberg,"" he said. ""The 2010 illegals program that was rolled up by the FBI was a big success but this was not the end of it."" Schindler said that since the demise of the Soviet Union, Russian intelligence services have rebuilt overseas networks, partly to wage ""economic war"" against the West. Such an emphasis is increasingly important at a time when the United States and its allies are imposing economic sanctions on powerful figures and top firms over Russia's annexation of Crimea and alleged infiltration into eastern Ukraine. The new Russian intelligence offensive has a world of opportunity. Russian businesses and capital are increasingly important to and invested in the global economy. And the nexus between vast Russian commercial and energy interests, and organized crime offers a shady world where spies can prosper. The affidavit in the Buryakov case alleges that the SVR sought to use an official Russian news organization in the United States to get information about high-frequency automated trading systems used on Wall Street and to gauge interest among brokers about Russian products. While it lays out a comprehensive legal case against the three alleged Russian spies, the document also includes several intriguing story lines and leaves key questions unanswered in the fog of the espionage wars. The document includes transcripts of conversations between Podobnyy, Sporyshev and Buryakov -- not just from phone taps, but from what it says are discussions ""inside the SVR NY office."" That leaves open the possibility that the FBI managed to get some kind of bug into the super secure premises. Lucas said its mention may be intended to induce paranoia among Russian intelligence chiefs who may wonder what other sensitive conversations were swept up. The document also says that in the summer of 2014, Buryakov ""met numerous times with a confidential source working for the FBI."" That revelation may also lead SVR bosses to question the extent of FBI knowledge about their operations. Another question is why did the FBI move now? ""Arresting a foreign spy is the last option, you would rather turn them or watch who they are taking to,"" said Galeotti. ""Why did they decide to arrest this guy? Did they think they would be about to return to Russia? Was it because there was a risk that he was going to stumble across something important? ""Was it time to put a shot across the Russian bows?"" The idea that the United States wanted to make a political point about its intelligence operations at a time of rising tensions appears supported by the robust language of the Department of Justice Press release. ""We will use every tool at our disposal to identify and hold accountable foreign agents operating inside this country -- no matter how deep their cover,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder. Bharara added: ""New York City may be more hospitable to Russian businessmen than during the Cold War, but my office and the FBI remain vigilant to the illegal intelligence-gathering activities of other nations.""","Alleged Russian spies seem hapless but may hint at wider operation .
Arrest comes at time of sharp U.S.-Russia tensions ."
"What a birthday. Just hours after being falsely accused of carrying explosive material onto a plane, Christopher Shell arrived in Dallas after being reboarding a flight from Philadelphia. When he got to Dallas on Thursday evening, airport police were waiting for the 29-year-old birthday celebrant because he was wanted on outstanding warrants, said David Magana, a spokesman for Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. According to CNN affiliates WPVI and WFAA, Magana said that Shell was wanted by several Texas municipalities. Earlier Thursday, Shell was deemed the victim of a hoax that caused officials to order a US Airways flight on its way to Dallas to return to Philadelphia. ""All indications are that this was hoax and a pretty nasty trick was played on this passenger,"" Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan said Thursday morning. He said someone called Philadelphia police and identified a passenger who the caller said was carrying a potentially explosive substance. No dangerous material was uncovered, police said. WPVI reported that sources told the station the prank caller dates one of Shell's ex-girlfriends. A passenger told WPVI that federal agents stormed the plane, drew their weapons on Shell, pulled him out of his seat and quickly removed him from the plane. Richard Quinn, assistant FBI special agent in charge, told reporters that making false calls affecting a commercial airline is a federal offense and it is expected that the caller will be prosecuted. Authorities say the Airbus A319, which was carrying 69 passengers, was cleared after all passengers were removed. Teen with Down syndrome stopped from boarding plane .

"Americans are not a nation of moochers and helpless dependents. Those who are not paying federal income tax would gladly do so, because it would mean they have a decent-paying job. GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney is right that 47% of Americans don't pay federal income tax. But he is wrong to suggest almost half of Americans pay no tax at all and feel entitled to live off  government handouts. Romney said: ""There are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47% who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. But that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what. ... These are people who pay no income tax."" Opinion: Real conservatives can say they're sorry . It's true that some Americans don't pay federal income tax. But virtually all Americans pay some form of tax, whether it's sales, payroll, state income, or property tax. Over 60% of those who don't pay income tax are working; they pay payroll tax, which goes to support Social Security and Medicare. Another 22% of those who don't pay income tax are the elderly; most of them don't work. In fact, only about 8% of Americans pay neither federal income tax nor payroll tax, because they are unemployed, are students, or are disabled. What is missing from all this talk about tax is the fact that although the rich pay higher taxes than the poor, middle-class people actually pay a higher percentage of their income in total taxes. True, federal income tax rates are progressive, with rates going to 35% for the top earners. But deductions and special treatment of capital gains reduce actual tax rates for the top earners. So what we end up with is upper-middle-class taxpayers paying the highest actual percentage of their income, over 31%, according to a 2010 study by the group Citizens for Tax Justice. How did our tax system get so flat? The payroll tax for Social Security is 12.4% (split between employer and employee). It's highly regressive, because only the first $110,100 of income is taxed. CEOs earning over $35 million per year have paid their entire annual Social Security tax bill before the end of their workday on January 2, while regular workers see this tax deducted from every check throughout the year. Billionaire Warren Buffett points out that he pays a tax rate of only 17.8%, compared with his secretary's rate of 35.8%.  Why? Because payroll taxes are capped and he gets a lower rate on his capital gains. President Obama pushed to pass the ""Buffett Rule"" to help reduce this disparity, but Romney's vice-presidential running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, opposed the rule, calling support for it ""class warfare.""  As the Republicans use the term ""class warfare,"" they also bring forth, pointedly, details on the wide gap in income and wealth distribution in our country. Digging deeper into why 47% don't pay federal income tax, what we find are many former taxpayers: Twenty-two percent are the elderly, living mostly on Social Security, a benefit they got by working and paying payroll taxes. Others are unemployed or are paid close to the minimum wage, so they don't have enough income to file any taxes. What about Romney's claim that these people believe they have a right to government assistance? Our research shows that over 50% of older people looking for work (but who are too young to collect Social Security) do not receive unemployment insurance or any other government assistance. They are living close to the poverty line with no help other than family. Opinion: Election winner faces a dangerous world . Far fewer poor Americans get government assistance for low incomes. For the last 30 years, less than 4% of the U.S. population has received a full year's worth of payments, like food stamps, which are based on level of income. Romney can choose whom he cares about, but he can't be allowed to choose his own facts and distort reality in service of divisive politics.  Focusing exclusively on federal income taxes hides the fact that most Americans pay plenty of other taxes. Finally, Romney says that the 47% can't be convinced to take ""personal responsibility.""  Tell that to the single mother working the night shift to put her kids through school, or the 78-year-old widow living on Social Security, or the handicapped Iraqi war veteran who relies on government health care for his service to his country.  Along with millions of working Americans, they are paragons of personal responsibility, not Romney's caricature of self-pitying victims seeking to live off government benefits.","Teresa Ghilarducci, Rick McGahey: It's true 47% of people don't pay income tax .

"Google laid out the next step of its Chromebook effort on Thursday by introducing a thin, light, Samsung-built laptop attached to a killer number — $250. ""It's the best laptop that's ever been designed at this price,"" said Sundar Pichai, who oversees Google's Chrome browser, OS and product teams. ""We assume that you have a Windows machine in your home, or maybe a Mac. This isn't built to replace those machines but instead be an additional computer."" The same way a tablet or smartphone are for many today. With that in mind, the performance and specs of the latest Samsung Chromebook (officially called the New Samsung Chromebook) fall just a bit below that of the mid-range $450 Samsung Series 5 Chromebook launched in May. For example, the new Chromebook uses a Samsung Exynos dual-core ARM processor — essentially a chip designed for use in smartphones and tablets rather than traditional laptops — along with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of built-in storage. The Series 5 Chromebook had 4GB of RAM. Google is also giving Chromebook buyers 100GB of free Google Drive storage for two years, so they can store files in the cloud, rather than locally on the device. The New Samsung Chromebook is available for pre-order on Amazon starting Thursday and officially goes on sale Monday. Google is setting up 500 ""Chromezone"" kiosks in Best Buy stores, staffed by Google employees, to give consumers a chance to use Chromebooks, ask questions, and see what the low-priced computer line is all about. The new Chromebook will also be sold in Google Play, alongside Nexus phones and tablets. ""We really want this to be for everyone in your family,"" Pichai said. ""We really want users to think about this as one extra computer for your kitchen counter, one near the bed, maybe a computer for your kids or family."" The new Chromebook has a full-sized keyboard and trackpad and an 11.6-inch matte display with a 1366 x 768 resolution, versus the 12.1-inch, 1280 x 800 display found on the Series 5 Chromebook. The previous Chromebook offered two USB ports and a single DisplayPort++ connection that could be used with HDMI, DVI and VGA to hookup to TVs or external monitors. The New Samsung Chromebook also has two USB ports but ditches DisplayPort++ for straight-up HDMI. But the main feature, aside from price, is the new Chromebook's profile. At just 2.5 pounds and 0.8 inches thick, this is one of the lightest and thinnest laptops on the market. It has no fan and or other moving parts — just like your smartphone or tablet. ""At Google, our goal is services which are used by hundreds of millions of people, gmail, maps, hangouts,"" Pichai said. ""This is a big step in the journey for us. From the inception of the project we've had this goal to provide a thin, light computer that is perfect for everyone."" Keyboard-equipped computers need to be, and can be, more accessible, he said, pointing out that although about 85 percent of U.S. households have multiple TVs, 50 percent of them have only one computer. So the $249 Chromebook is Google's most accessible Chromebook, a category that so far has mostly been a toy/tool for early adopters and about 1,000 schools. So why buy a $249 Chromebook over a $200 Nexus 7 tablet? Pichai said that while tablets take care of quick, casual computing for most people — checking e-mail, using social media apps, maybe watching a movie or video chatting with a friend — the world still has a need for low-priced computers with a keyboard. ""We, today, see a huge need for computing which is very usable with keyboards,"" he said. ""I see it in my house with my kids. My daughter has a tablet, but when she wants to do her homework, she needs a keyboard. She doesn't want to do that on a tablet.""","Google announces a new $250 laptop, made by Samsung .

"He's on the outside looking in, and the view of Viktor Yanukovych seems to keep getting dimmer. A news conference Friday from his new quarters in southeastern Russia underscored just how dim his prospects appear to be, as the ousted Ukrainian President complained that his host -- and potential benefactor -- was not around and had done little to make his stay more comfortable. ""I consider that Russia must and has to act,"" Yanukovych told a phalanx of reporters who had assembled in the city of Rostov-on-Don, near the southwestern border with Ukraine and about 700 miles south of Moscow. He did not specify what actions he was hoping for but made clear whom he was looking to. ""Knowing the character of Mr. Vladimir Putin, I am surprised why, up 'til now, he has remained restrained, silent. That is the question."" Though he and the Russian President had talked over the phone, they had not met, said Yanukovych, who appeared to concede that he did not know where Putin stands on his ouster and was hoping for clarity -- whenever the two men get together. ""As soon as this meeting takes place, I will understand his attitude. ... It would not be correct now for me to speak about what Russia should do now. ... Russia must use all its possibilities in order to overcome this chaos, this terror which today is taking place in Ukraine. It is difficult for me to say what can come about, but I would like to say again that I am categorically against any interference with the sovereign integrity of Ukraine as a state."" The location of the news conference itself underscored his isolation. ""I'm struck by the fact that he's in Rostov-on-Don and not in Moscow and that he has had a phone call with President Putin and not met,"" former U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul told CNN. ""I thought he expressed dismay that President Putin has not been more decisive to defend him."" He cited Yanukovych's comments as ""signs that he is not in good standing with his current host."" For his part, Putin discussed developments in Ukraine in a telephone call with European leaders, stressing the importance of avoiding an escalation of violence, according to a statement from the Kremlin, which did not cite Yanukovych. A call for Ukrainian harmony . In a rambling news conference that lasted for more than an hour, the ousted leader spoke in Russian instead of the Ukrainian that he has used at official functions. Though he insisted that he's still the boss and wants nothing more than to lead his country to peace, harmony and prosperity, he offered little evidence that he was in a position to do much about it. He pleaded for forgiveness ""from all who have suffered"" in the chaos and violence that have roiled the country in recent weeks. He said he would ""bow down to all of them, no matter which side of the barricades they were on,"" but then unleashed a volley of epithets targeting those who were on the side of the barricades that opposed him, referring to them as ""bandits"" and ""fascists."" Wearing a dark business suit and tie, he cut a lonely figure as he held forth from a table, behind which stood four blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags. During the news conference, he appeared contained as he fiddled with his pen. But he betrayed the pressure, staring down at his hands, which were on the table, bending a pen. When it snapped, he grimaced, then looked up and continued speaking. ""Everything that I can do, I will do to the end of my life to be with the people of Ukraine -- not with those nationalists, not with those bandits, but the people of Ukraine,"" he said, adding that Western countries, including the United States, bore some of the blame for the unrest. He said that he had left his country only after his life and the lives of his family were threatened and that he planned to return when it is safe to do so. ""A normal way of life must be assured to the citizens of Ukraine, both in Kiev and in all regions of Ukraine,"" he said, and he called for a national referendum ""as soon as possible."" Elections planned for May 25 in Ukraine would be illegal, he said, adding that he would not participate in them if they are held. ""I consider that all the elections must take place in accordance with the law and constitution of Ukraine,"" he said. Yanukovych said he was ""ashamed"" that he had not been able to maintain stability in his country. ""I want to apologize in front of everybody -- to the veterans, to the Ukrainian people -- that I did not have the strength to stop what is now taking place in the country from taking place,"" he said. But he said that ""any military action"" would be unacceptable. ""Ukraine must remain united and undivided,"" he said, adding that the Russian-majority Crimean region must remain part of the state but given ""broad autonomy."" Yanukovych, who is wanted in Ukraine on charges related to the killings of demonstrators last week in Kiev, denied having ordered police to fire on them, killing scores. ""No government can succeed with bloodshed, and everything that has taken place is the responsibility of those who did it,"" he said. ""I never gave any order for the police to shoot,"" he said, asserting that they fired in self-defense in the face of ""an attack of a mass character.""","Ex-envoy sees signs that Yanukovych ""is not in good standing with his current host""

"Air Force One, flying President Barack Obama to a campaign event, aborted an initial landing attempt in Ohio on Wednesday due to weather conditions. The jumbo jet experienced turbulence on approach to Toledo and was within sight of the runway when the pilot pulled the plane up and circled the airport, according to reporters on board. ""Air Force One, missed approach,"" the pilot announced to air traffic controllers, according to radio recordings on the website LiveATC.net. ""We'd like radar vectors back around,"" the pilot said, according to the recordings. The Boeing 747 landed safely shortly before noon ET after its go-around, the Federal Aviation Administration said. The FAA described the incident as a ""routine missed approach due to weather."" Weather conditions included fog and mist. Visibility was three miles, but the clouds were at 400 feet. It was the second aviation incident related to the presidential campaign in the past week.

"Dennis Eckersley is one of the greatest relief pitchers in baseball history, and he spent nine years of his career closing games for the Oakland A's. So surely, if there is somebody out there who believed this current team could have a remarkable season like this, it's him. Right? ""Not a chance,"" Eckersley said over the phone. Okay, fair enough. The A's did lose 88 games last season, finishing a full 22 games behind Texas in the American League West standings. It would be hard to project that they'd win that division before the season. But surely, if somebody could have believed that this ridiculously young team would take off at midseason and stun the Rangers in the final game, it would be a legend from the team's glory days like Eckersley. Right? ""Nope,"" Eckersley, now an analyst for TBS, said over the phone. ""I mean, I didn't really buy into (this team) until a couple months ago. I think I got a call from somebody at the trade deadline who said, 'Do you still think they're pretenders?' And I still thought they were!"" Eckersley is forgiven. The A's magical season is so confounded, so unexpected, that you really don't even know where to begin. It's hard to even pick out the most mind-bending number related to their success. Is it 13, the number of games back they were in the standings on June 30, making their comeback to win the division one of the five biggest in baseball history? Is it five, the number of games back they were just nine days ago, when their chances to make the playoffs at all, much less win the AL West, seemed borderline at best. Is it four, the number of runs they were down in the final game against the Rangers, before they scored the next 11 to storm back for a 12-5 win and a champagne-drenched celebration? Is it .238, the overall team batting average, which is the third lowest in all of baseball? Or 15, the number of rookies on the current roster? Or 94, the number of victories this team won? For most, it'll be this number: $55 million. That's the entire A's payroll, the second lowest in the major leagues. They are proving that, in an era when sports are big business and the biggest spenders are usually the biggest winners, that it's possible to win without breaking the bank. That's why, in the estimation of MLB Network analyst Sean Casey, ""They're the best story in baseball."" Maybe this is a good spot for a quick history lesson: The A's are hardly some plucky newcomer. They are one of the eight founding members of the American League, a franchise with roots in Philadelphia that adopted an elephant as its mascot because old New York Giants manager John McGraw called the team ""a white elephant."" It moved from Philadelphia to Kansas City to Oakland, in 1968, and were known mostly for its eccentric owner Charlie Finley -- he changed the elephant mascot into a mule that paraded around the stadium -- until it emerged as a dynasty in the 1970s. Reggie Jackson. Catfish Hunter. Vida Blue. Those A's won the World Series from 1972-74, and after Finley sold the team, again in 1989 with the ""Bash Brothers,"" Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire. That remains the franchise's last championship, but it wasn't the end of its relevance. Savvy general manager Billy Beane, knowing he had less money to pay players than other franchises, created a radical system for building his teams that relied less on traditional scouting and more on statistical analysis. That formula led to five postseason appearances in the early 2000s and was documented by the bestselling book ""Moneyball"" and later a movie by the same name. Beane is still the GM, making the A's perhaps the first franchise in sports history where the GM is more well known that any of the players -- Brad Pitt, after all, did play him in the movie. But Hollywood might soon wish it had waited, because this team might end up a better story. ""It's the perfect storm with so many things coming together,"" Eckersley said. ""I'd like to see this thing go all the way to the World Series, you know, to do more than just get into the playoffs."" SI: Hottest hitters heading into playoffs . Eckersley is most amazed by the young pitching staff. This is a staff entirely of rookie starters and none of them household names. Jarrod Parker and Tommy Milone won 13 games. Even the team leader in saves -- Grant Balfour -- has a name that suggests something other than pitching acumen. You won't find stars in the lineup, either. Josh Reddick led the team with 32 home runs and 85 RBI. Yoenis Cespedes led the way with a .292 batting average. Coco Crisp stole 39 bases. Jonny Gomes is the designated hitter and one of the few veterans in the clubhouse. ""It's surreal,"" first baseman Brandon Moss said on the A's broadcast after they won the division. ""We've enjoyed every step of the way. There was never any pressure on us. We were supposed to lose 100 games."" Maybe that's part of it. Eckersley thinks so. ""It's totally different when you're a position when nobody expects you to win,"" he said. ""I've never been on a team like that in my life."" He might not have picked them before the season or during it, but Eckersley has had a change of heart. Pitching, he believes, is the key to any team winning the World Series and the Hall of Fame closer thinks the A's have the arms to compete with anybody in the postseason. They'll open in Detroit on Saturday in the division series, where once again they'll face a team with twice its payroll and star power. But for once, at least, everyone will see them coming. TBS will have exclusive coverage of the first-ever Wild Card games on Friday, October 5.

"A European court on Monday ruled that radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza can be extradited from Great Britain to the United States, where he faces a host of terrorism charges. The European Human Rights Court issued its ruling, clearing the way for Hamza's extradition. This means that he can now be moved to the United States, though no date has been set. Hamza faces 11 charges in U.S. courts, including conspiracy in connection with a 1998 kidnapping of 16 Westerners in Yemen and conspiring with others to establish an Islamic jihad training camp in rural Oregon in 1999. Read more about the Abu Hamza story . The cleric is one of the highest-profile radical Islamic figures in Britian, where he was already sentenced to seven years for inciting racial hatred at his north London mosque and other terrorism-related charges. The Egyptian-born Hamza -- who is also known as Mustafa Kamal Mustafa -- has previously denied wrongdoing, saying, ""They have no evidence against me whatsoever apart from me trying basically to open the people's eyes about certain principles."" Monday's decision, which was signed by seven judges from different European nations, follows a ruling this spring in which the same court likewise said that Hamza and four other terror suspects could be extradited. The court determined, then and now, that the suspects would not get ""ill treatment"" in super-maximum security prisons if they are extradited to the United States and convicted in American courts, according to the European court's decision Monday. That ruling noted that conditions in such U.S. prisons were in some ways better for inmates than in Europe, given that they'd have access to things like television, newspapers, social visits and hobby-related items. It acknowledged the prisoners may be confined in their cells most of the time, but said this is warranted given the charges they face. ""As concerned ... restrictive conditions and lack of human contact, the court found that, if the applicants were convicted as charged, the U.S. authorities would be justified in considering them a significant security risk and in imposing strict limitations on their ability to communicate with the outside world,"" the court ruled. The British Home Office issued a statement Monday saying it ""welcomes"" Monday's decision, which also affects several others wanted in the United States. ""We will work to ensure that the individuals are handed over to the U.S. authorities as quickly as possible,"" the office said in its statement. The U.S. Justice Department, through spokesman Dean Boyd, similarly applauded the European Human Rights Court's ruling. ""We are pleased that the litigation before the European Court of Human Rights in these cases has come to an end, and we will be working with the UK authorities on the arrangements to bring these subjects to the United States for prosecution,"" Boyd said. In addition to Hamza, the four others who can now be extradited to the United States are Syed Thala Ahsan, Adel Abdul Bary, Khaled Al-Fawwaz and Babar Ahmad. The court earlier this year delayed its decision on a sixth suspect, Haroon Rashid Aswat, so that further information could be provided regarding his mental health issues. U.S. authorities allege Aswat -- who suffers from schizophrenia, according to court documents, and is now held in Broadmoor Hospital, a high-security psychiatric facility situated 65 kilometers (40 miles) west of London -- was Hamza's co-conspirator. All six men were indicted in the United States on various charges between 1999 and 2006, after which they were arrested in the United Kingdom. Ahmad, for one, is accused of providing material support to terrorists, conspiracy and money laundering. If convicted, he could face a life prison-sentence. The U.S. indictment against Ahmad accuses him of conspiring to provide support to terrorists, including helping to ship gas masks to the Taliban and using U.S.-based websites to raise money for Chechen leader Shamil Basayev. Basayev claimed responsibility for the  Beslan school massacre in Russia in 2004, two years before he was killed by Russian agents. Two men who can now be extradited -- Al-Fawwaz and Bary were among more than 20 people indicted (with late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden among them) -- are charged in connection with the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Bary, for one, could be sentenced to 269 mandatory life sentences if convicted on murder charges tied with the blasts. The other four men who can now be extradited could ""face discretionary life sentences"" -- which they argue would be unfair -- the European court said. ""The court did not consider that these sentences were grossly disproportionate or amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment,"" the court said.","Radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza faces 11 terrorism-related charges in the United States .

"It looks like the big blue eyeball found on a Florida beach last week was cut out of a swordfish hauled in by a deep-sea angler, the state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said Monday. A beachcomber found the softball-sized eyeball on the sand in Pompano Beach, Florida, on Wednesday, speculating that perhaps it came from a squid. But experts who examined the eyeball made their call of swordfish based on the its size (softball), color (blue) and structure (presumably swordfishy), according to a statement from Joan Herrera, curator of collections at the agency's Fish and Wildlife Research Institute in St. Petersburg. Based on straight cuts on the bone around the eyeball, Herrera said, experts think an angler cut it out of a swordfish and tossed it overboard. The half-ton fish are frequently found in the Florida Straits off South Florida at this time of year, according to the statement. DNA testing is being done to confirm the finding, the agency said.","Mystery eyeball probably cut from a swordfish by an angler, state wildlife agency says .

"The tangled David Petraeus scandal highlights how easily the U.S. government can access citizens' private e-mails. The FBI's request to access Paula Broadwell's personal Gmail account was one of 7,969 similar requests Google received from the U.S. government in the first half of 2012, according to Google and news reports. The company said it complied with the requests, either fully or partially, 90% of the time. According to the latest Google Transparency report, Google fielded 20,938 requests for private account data from governments around the world between January and June of this year. That's up from 18,257 such requests during the last half of 2011, the company said. ""One trend has become clear: Government surveillance is on the rise,"" Dorothy Chou, a Google senior policy analyst, writes in the blog post announcing the latest report -- the sixth Google has released in the last three years. Google stores huge amounts of data and personal information about its users. In addition to the wealth of information in e-mail and Google Drive accounts, the company also has users' IP addresses, which can be used to determine locations. Beginning in May of this year, the FBI accessed Gmail accounts used by Broadwell to communicate with Petraeus, the former CIA director, during their affair, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The bi-annual Google Transparency report is Google's attempt to ""shine a light"" on how often governments around the world ask to access user data as part of criminal investigations. The company also publishes data on how often government agencies request that public content be removed from Google services, such as YouTube videos or blog posts on Blogger. The most common reason cited for wanting content taken down is defamation. U.S. law enforcement agencies seem to be the most curious. The country continues to top the list for the most requests for user data in the world, followed at a distance by India. While Google is admirably proactive about releasing data on government requests, in the majority of cases it does turn over the requested information. The company said it cooperates with U.S. government requests more than any other country. Outdated laws have created loopholes that allow government and law enforcement agencies to request information and conduct electronic surveillance without warrants. The piece of legislation at the heart of the issue is the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, passed in 1986. Technology has changed radically in the past 25 years. E-mails, cellphones, location information and data stored on cloud services weren't considered when the original law was drafted. Google is an active member of the Digital Due Process Coalition, which has been pushing for reform of the ECPA. The group's members include Apple, Amazon, the ACLU, Facebook, Google and Twitter along with a slew of other big-name tech companies and civil liberties groups. Other technology companies, including Twitter and LinkedIn, are joining Google and releasing their own transparency reports. The United States Justice department is against any updates to the law that would require more warrants. Revising the ECPA wouldn't prohibit the government and law enforcement agencies from requesting the information, it would just require they go through an approval process to get the warrants. In a bit of circular logic, the Justice Department has argued that the electronic evidence gathered without warrants is necessary to build enough of a case to later get search warrants.","Google's Transparency Report shows increase in government requests for private data .

"(CNN)An American actor living in Canada has been arrested on voyeurism charges in Toronto, police said. Jean-Paul Manoux, also known as J.P. Manoux, was arrested on Tuesday.  He's scheduled to appear before a judge on March 11. It started when two women in their mid-twenties rented a condo from the actor.  According to the Toronto Police Service, the women alerted them after they ""discovered hidden cameras and video equipment connected to the internet."" Police said in a statement that the actor has rented out this condo before and they ""believe there may be other victims."" The 45-year-old Manoux is a U.S. citizen, but a permanent resident of Canada.  He works in both countries, according to the his website. He's a busy actor, but largely in smaller parts, with more than 140 film and television credits, according to IMDb. You may have seen him in the film ""Knocked Up,"" or on TV in ""ER,"" ""Community,"" ""How I Met Your Mother,"" and most recently the Canadian sitcom ""Spun Out."" CNN has reached out to Manoux's representatives, but they have yet to respond. CNN's Henry Hanks and Phil Gast contributed to this report.","Voyeurism charges were filed against Manoux in Toronto .

"(CNN)Wednesday was a day for digging out in New England. But forecasters are warning more snow might be on the way. To be sure, it will be nothing compared to what has already fallen this week. Worcester, Massachusetts, received a record 34.5 inches from Monday through Wednesday. ""There's so much of it, you have a problem because there's just nothing to do with it,"" a resident told CNN affiliate WHDH. He compared it with a blizzard in 1978 and a storm in 2013. ""This is much worse,"" he said. ""It just never stopped."" For many people in New England this blizzard brought whiteout conditions from heavy snow and wind greater than 35 mph for as long as 14 hours. In towns and cities from Connecticut to Massachusetts to New Hampshire there were plenty of folks who were digging through more than 30 inches of fresh snow on sidewalks and driveways. Homeowners weren't just dealing with the question of where to put all the snow. Some had to call their insurance agents, like residents of 11 homes in Marshfield, Massachusetts, where there was significant damage after a seawall breach. After deserting the streets Tuesday as the storm struck, traffic moved again along major roads in Massachusetts and beyond.  Boston's Logan International Airport accepted incoming flights around 8 a.m., according to spokesman Matthew Brelis. Buses and trains in Massachusetts -- including the Boston-area subway system, the ""T"" -- ran again, with major roads reopened as well, said incoming state Transportation Secretary Stephanie Pollack. But schools in Boston were closed, as they will be Thursday.  The National Weather Service said Wednesday that another system is moving toward the area and several more inches of snow could come down Thursday night into Friday night. The high on Saturday is forecast to be 16 degrees. CNN senior meteorologist Dave Hennen said as the low pressure develops off the coast,  damaging winds might yet again be in store for New England on Friday and Saturday. If anyone has a right to complain, it was those digging out Wednesday not just in New England but also on New York's Long Island. The weather service reported that Orient on the tip of Long Island, ended up with 30 inches of snow. That's about 10 inches more than fell across Long Island Sound in New London, Connecticut, though Mayor Daryl Justin Finizio noted that his city has up to 8-foot drifts and some roads that were still impassable Wednesday morning. ""We're getting there,"" said Finizio. ""But it will be another day or two digging out from this. This isn't going anywhere."" ""There are still a few dead ends that we still need to punch through to get to, to make sure that people can get out of their houses,"" the mayor said. One good thing: Because it was colder than expected, most of the snow didn't weigh enough to snap too many limbs down onto too many power lines. So instead of 300,000 power outages in Massachusetts, as authorities had feared, the number topped out at 36,000, according to Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency spokesman Peter Judge. ""Although we may end up with record snow, it's not going to be a record disaster, which it could have very well been,"" Judge said. Still, any outage can be deadly in a winter storm like this. And at one point an entire island, Nantucket, was in the dark. Four hours after the power went out, Danielle Smith gave birth to her first child at Nantucket Cottage Hospital -- with a few lights on and some heat, thanks to the facility's generator. ""And Danielle is a superstar,"" said Dr. Margaret Koehm, who noted that a ""blizzard girl"" joined Smith's ""blizzard boy,"" Cayden, a short time later at the same hospital. ""She did it all naturally."" In central Connecticut, Heather Klein felt her contractions coming on overnight Monday. After getting the OK from Hartford police to break the travel ban, she drove in and settled into the hospital in time for the birth of her baby, Anna. Mom and baby had plenty of quality time together Tuesday, since visitors couldn't hit the roads to come see them. ""It's so boring,"" Klein said. ""I can't wait to go home."" For Jennifer Bruno, there's no going home. The Iraq war veteran had evacuated to a friend's house overnight, knowing that things might not be safe in her own home of Marshfield, a town of 25,000 located 30 miles south of Boston. When she got back home, the National Guard sergeant broke down in tears. ""Part of the roof collapsed, the wall, my door was missing,"" Bruno said of her house. ""It was just destroyed."" She wasn't alone, as 10 other homes in the same seaside town were also damaged after the powerful storm tore down about 50 feet of seawall. Two of the houses were damaged badly enough to be condemned. There was significant flooding there and in other coastal communities around Massachusetts, which had to deal not only with storm surges but lashing winds that in some places topped 75 mph. Even so, there is also recognition that -- for the vast majority of the 58 million people in the storm's path, especially given the dire warnings -- it could have been even worse. ""Despite the fact that we had record-breaking snowfall in many parts of Massachusetts,"" Gov. Charlie Baker said Wednesday, ""we have come out of this, I think, in relatively good shape."" CNN's Steve Almasy, Tina Burnside, Brian Todd, Anderson Cooper and Ana Cabrera contributed to this report.","Worcester, Massachusetts sets record with total for one snowstorm .
Towns in New England and on Long Island under 30 inches of snow .
More snow -- much less this time -- appears to be in the near future ."
"A Florida teenager was sentenced Wednesday to a year in jail after he was convicted of four felonies linked to his impersonation last year of a physician assistant in a hospital emergency room. Matthew Scheidt, 18, will then spend a year under house arrest, followed by eight years' probation. Scheidt was convicted in August of two counts of practicing medicine without a license and two counts of impersonating a physician assistant at Osceola Regional Medical Center in August 2011, when he was 17. Scheidt told investigators that the ruse began when he went to the hospital to get a badge for his job as a clerk at a doctor's office across the street. But someone botched the paperwork. ""Their error was putting me in apparently as a physician assistant into their computer,"" Scheidt told investigators in August. ""Let's even say that I said I was a physician assistant. Let's even say that I was. Are you that stupid that you are just going to put me in the system as that, without any credentials or any paperwork or nothing?"" Prosecutors said Scheidt used the badge to work in the hospital emergency room for weeks, changing bandages, handling IVs and helping to conduct exams. After his arrest, Scheidt acknowledged having performed CPR on a patient suffering from a drug overdose, authorities told CNN affiliate WFTV. ""I felt so uncomfortable even doing that. And, you know, the only reason why I did do it was because there was nobody else in there. And I'm not going to let her die,"" Scheidt told investigators at the time, according to the television station. During his interrogation, Scheidt confessed and admitted he had made mistakes, WFTV reported. ""I messed up,"" he said. ""I should have addressed the issue when it was given to me. I just didn't want any questions asked, like I just wanted to learn as much as I possibly could."" He was arrested in September 2011 and allowed to bond out. But in January, he was back in police custody. The charge: impersonating a police officer. A nursing supervisor at the hospital said no one was available to comment.

"The Justice Department on Thursday was reviewing a request from Virginia Democratic lawmakers to launch an inquiry into a firm that hired a worker who allegedly destroyed voter registration applications. Congressmen Jim Moran, Bobby Scott and Gerry Connolly on Wednesday asked Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate a Republican-hired firm, Pinpoint, amid allegations of voter fraud. A Pinpoint employee, Colin Small of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania, who was brought on to conduct voter registration drives, faces local criminal charges in Rockingham County, Virginia. He is charged over allegations that he threw eight completed voter registration forms into the trash. He also is charged with obstruction of justice. Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a Republican, said he was expanding the investigation to see whether there was an effort to destroy voter registration applications statewide. His decision came after the Republican-dominated state elections board agreed to seek an inquiry to determine whether the allegations against Small represented an isolated incident or a broader effort. Pinpoint and another company, Strategic Allied Consulting, were hired by Republicans to conduct voter registration drives. Strategic Allied Consulting, on its website, said it has ""never tolerated even minimal violations of election law when registering voters."" CNN was unable late Thursday to contact Pinpoint. The Justice Department did not say what if any action it might take, but indicated the Virginia attorney general's action would not affect its decision.","Employee accused of throwing out voter registration forms .

"Mike Rioux can't go to the grocery store without making a list, even for a single item. He can't drive without gripping the steering wheel so hard his knuckles turn white. And he can't stand any longer than 30 minutes because of severe back pain. This is Rioux's life after Afghanistan, where firefights and a roadside bomb blast left him with a traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. His ears still ring from the explosions. He suffers from vertigo, headaches, insomnia and nightmares. He has terrible anxiety, evident in an interview with CNN -- Rioux could hardly sit still, and his memory loss and inability to concentrate meant questions had to be repeated at times. ""I need to discover who I am again,"" he said. As a staff sergeant in the U.S. Army, Rioux most recently was deployed in 2010 to one of the most dangerous spots in Afghanistan. There he survived firefights and blasts and witnessed much carnage in Paktia province, near the volatile Afghan-Pakistan border. After returning home, Rioux faced a much different battle, one that neither he nor his wife, Maggie, expected. Confusion is 'monumental' The Department of Veterans Affairs said it is on track to process 1 million disability claims this year. With the war in Iraq over and the one in Afghanistan winding down, the VA is sorting through a backlog of more than 860,000 disability claims from American veterans. More than a quarter of those vets -- 228,000 -- have been waiting for a year or more. Rioux has been trying to get his disability claim fully processed since January 2011, shortly after he returned from Afghanistan. The litany of delays includes lost paperwork, long wait times for appointments and erroneous lab results. At one point, a doctor prescribed him medication for a bladder infection he didn't have; he'd never given as much as a urine sample. Because of his debilitating injuries, neither Rioux nor his wife, Maggie, is able to work full time. Rioux said without his wife's care, ""I'd be in the fetal position. I'd be curled up in a ball. I couldn't do it."" He can afford it, she can't: Couple's health care dilemma . The Riouxes and their 23-year-old daughter, Alex, are living at his mother's home outside Phoenix. Maggie and Alex share a bedroom, while Mike sleeps on the living room couch every night. At 51, he said that makes him feel ashamed. ""I feel low,"" he said. ""How can I support my family, let alone ... keep a roof over their head so that my daughter can have her own room? My wife and I can't have a bed to sleep together? We're on couches. We sleep separate. ... That hurts a lot. I miss her."" Part of the problem, the VA said, is that many veterans are returning with severe and complex mental injuries. These veterans file multiple claims, far more than ever before, and sometimes they file incomplete paperwork. The backlog also increased when hundreds of thousands of vets were finally allowed to file claims for Agent Orange and Gulf War syndrome. Last year, the VA said it paid out nearly $5 billion in compensation. In August 2011, the VA told Rioux his claim was in review and, four months later, he was told to expect a decision by the end of the year. None came. Both he and Maggie wrote numerous letters seeking help, including one to first lady Michelle Obama, with a copy sent to Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki. Three months ago, the Riouxes finally heard from the VA about his claim. It rejected coverage for his traumatic brain injury, granting him limited disability coverage that amounts to about $660 a month. Attempts to get full disability coverage have left the Riouxes often lost in a morass of red tape and confusing policies at dozens of offices in various veterans medical centers. ""That is trademark VA -- that you get answers, and then a different answer from the same building, but a different floor or a different office,"" Maggie Rioux said. ""And the confusion that ensues is monumental."" The Riouxes are not alone. Two-thirds of the 860,000 applicants have been waiting longer than the 125 days that Shinseki set as a goal for processing claims. On average, the VA said veterans wait more than eight months -- 256 days -- before their claim is resolved. CNN interviewed 16 veterans for this report, all of whom recounted monthslong waits to get a simple evaluation of their disabilities. Many said they had not received prompt help for serious mental health issues. One vet said he called a VA suicide prevention hotline, was told he would be called back, and a return call never came -- a situation the agency said never should have happened. VA official: Backlog 'unacceptable' Tommy Sowers, the VA's assistant secretary for public and intergovernmental affairs, said the current backlog ""is unacceptable, and we know that."" But he added, ""This is a problem that has been decades in the making."" ""We're transitioning from a paper-based system to an electronic system, and it is a huge amount. It is a huge undertaking and task,"" he said. Only a small fraction of the VA's regional offices has computerized their records so far. The vast majority are still tracking veterans on entirely paper files -- a process that's not only slow and inefficient but also requires massive space and numbers of files. The toll of war now includes more amputees . ""We're moving from these mountains and mountains (of paper), sifting through papers, scanning them, digitizing them, creating a secure environment where these claims can be moved through much quicker,"" Sowers said. But Paul Rieckhoff, the founder of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said veterans who are fighting for their disability claims are angry and tired of the rhetoric. ""There's a big difference between what they're saying in Washington, D.C., and what you see on the ground,"" Rieckhoff said.  ""The guys on the ground -- they don't care about paperwork, or slow improvements. They care if they got a decision back from the VA."" Mike Grabski is another veteran who knows about the problem. He ultimately got his disability payments, but it took him two years to get his full amount. ""It wasn't just the stress of not having the compensation,"" he said. ""It was the stress of 'Is this going to happen?' or 'When is this going to happen?' or 'How is this going to happen?' or 'What's the next speed bump going to be?' "" Grabski left the Army in 2009 as a staff sergeant after 10 years in the service. He served two combat tours in Afghanistan and one in Iraq with the 173rd Airborne Brigade, earning two Bronze Star medals. But his service left him with a long list of injuries, including degenerative bone disease in both knees, asthma, hearing loss and a mild traumatic brain injury resulting from exposure to constant explosions and gunfire. Grabski was also diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, which he said has increased his irritability and affects his concentration. He formally filed for disability in Oakland, California, in July 2010. It wasn't until after he received media attention for his plight that his file was reviewed nearly two years later. After 21 months, the VA rated him 40% disabled due to knee injury, asthma and hearing loss, awarding him $560 a month in compensation. Following new appointments to assess his brain injury and PTSD claims, the VA upgraded Grabski's disability rating to 80% in mid-July. His monthly disability payment went up to $1,427. Critics told CNN that veterans have an expression among them that the VA's policy is ""Delay, deny until we die."" Asked about that complaint, the VA's Sowers responded, ""What I would say is that there are many veterans out there that love their VA care. Absolutely love it."" A different man . Rioux plans to appeal the VA's ruling against covering his traumatic brain injury as a disability -- a decision that could mean another two years of red tape. ""He's got the injury, but it's zero for that,"" Maggie Rioux said, referring to the disability coverage. She said she thinks the VA made its ruling based on outdated medical information from last year. ""We filed a second claim stating that he has new symptoms, worsening symptoms, like vertigo ... the dizziness, the daily headaches, his agitation, his marked personality changes,"" she said. Man's best friend helping war veterans heal . A VA doctor has diagnosed that Rioux has a traumatic brain injury. However, some of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries overlap, Maggie Rioux said, ""and we're very well aware of that. But this isn't only PTSD."" She said she wants her husband to get the respect he deserves after he risked his life for his country. ""He could've been killed. Every time I spoke to him on the phone I thought it might be the last time I heard his voice,"" she said. But she added, ""Our relationship has had to take a hit. I'm married to a different man now. I love him. Just as much as I've always loved him. But he's different."" The Riouxes said they are not looking for a handout and want to work. ""We're not a charity case, and we're not looking for sympathy,"" Maggie Rioux said. ""We're angry about the VA. We're angry about so many things, including all of the other soldiers and veterans that are waiting longer than we have.""","Veteran Mike Rioux waited for more than a year for disability benefits .

"On Election Day, marijuana enthusiasts rejoiced as Colorado and Washington legalized marijuana. (Ballot initiatives in Oregon and a medical initiative in Arkansas did not fare so well.) From the federal government's perspective, however, marijuana remains illegal. It is anyone's guess what the Obama administration's next move will be, but it is important to understand that this president has long stated his opposition to marijuana legalization. When it came to medical marijuana expansion in several states, Obama's Justice Department sent out strongly worded letters warning that even medical marijuana was in ""violation of federal law regardless of state laws permitting such activities"" and that ""this includes prosecution of business enterprises that unlawfully market and sell marijuana."" Why the opposition to marijuana legalization in the first place? First, we know that legalization would dramatically decrease the price of marijuana and increase use, according to a 2010 study from the Rand Drug Policy Research Center.   And today's marijuana is not the marijuana of the 1960s; potency has tripled in the past 15 years, according to a 2009 report from the U.S. government . This is not reefer madness thinking. High-potency marijuana has contributed to addiction for one out of six kids who start using it in their teens, direct IQ loss (an 8-point loss among kids using regularly), car crashes, and mental illness. Many who support legalization have claimed that we could control marijuana use, especially among teens, if only we regulated it through legalization. Sadly, however, the provisions passed in Colorado and Washington do everything but control marijuana. If these state laws were enacted, in fact, we could face a major industry commercializing and promoting marijuana to kids. As we know from alcohol and tobacco, even when age limits are in place, getting people hooked young is a key long-term strategy for profiteers. Indeed Big Tobacco, for one, has long been perched and ready to make some serious cash from marijuana sales: According to internal documents released during its historic court settlement, in smoking's heyday, Big Tobacco considered marijuana legalization a golden opportunity. Opinion: U.S. should honor states' new pot laws . ""The use of marijuana ... has important implications for the tobacco industry in terms of an alternative product line. (We) have the land to grow it, the machines to roll it and package it, the distribution to market it. In fact, some firms have registered trademarks, which are taken directly from marijuana street jargon. These trade names are used currently on little-known legal products, but could be switched if and when marijuana is legalized. Estimates indicate that the market in legalized marijuana might be as high as $10 billion annually,""  said a report commissioned by cigarette manufacturer Brown and Williamson (now merged with R.J. Reynolds) in the 1970s. If increased use and addiction might be unwelcome results of legalization, what hoped-for results might not materialize? Many have already begun touting tax revenues from legal marijuana as a major plus of the recently passed state laws. Sadly, however, we know that vice taxes rarely pay for themselves. The $40 billion we collect annually from high levels of tobacco and alcohol use in the U.S. are about a tenth of what those use levels cost us in terms of  lost productivity, premature illness, accidents and death. Additionally, our experience with many state lotteries has shown that promised funding for schools falls well short of expectations. As the California Department of Education said recently: ""Although the public still perceives the lottery as making a significant difference in the funds available for education, it is a minor source that cannot be expected to provide major improvements in K-12 education."" School officials are not happy about this: ""We thought that it would be a windfall,"" said Michael Johnson, executive director of the Illinois Association of School Boards. ""The general public -- they were fooled by this."" Opinion: The end of the war on marijuana . We also know that the promise of ending violent cartels is far from reality. A recent RAND report showed that Mexican drug trafficking groups only received a minority of their revenue from marijuana. So they are likely to stay around, legal marijuana or not. Voters have been sold a false dichotomy: ""You can either stick with failed, current policies, or you can try a 'new approach' with legalization."" Sadly, this kind of black-and-white thinking betrays the fact that there are better ways than legalization or prohibition to deal with this complex issue. Legalization may not be the answer, but that also means that former users with an arrest record should not be prevented from getting a job or accessing social benefits. We need to have an adult conversation about marijuana arrests among disadvantaged communities, too, to ensure equal justice under the law. Increased education and treatment will work better than incarceration and a sole reliance on the criminal justice system. Indeed, we can reform the worst part of our current laws without increasing rates of addiction and harms. Let's think before we legalize.

"(CNN)On Wednesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee kicks off the confirmation hearing for Loretta Lynch, President Barack Obama's nominee to replace Eric Holder as attorney general. The attorney general -- our nation's chief federal law enforcement officer -- plays a vital role ensuring laws and regulations are faithfully executed, while respecting and defending the rights of American citizens as well as the duties of each independent branch of government. Unfortunately, for the past several years, leadership at the department has often lost sight of this mission. Instead, it has engaged in a sort of constitutional gymnastics, contorting the intent of the enumerated powers to provide the President practically carte blanche authority for some of his more extraordinary executive actions. The Justice Department's lack of responsiveness to congressional inquiries on anything from ""Fast and Furious"" to the President's executive action on immigration has been a constitutional slap in the face to the American people. The Justice Department, like any other federal agency, must be accountable to the people. This requires transparency and cooperation with Congress. A renewed commitment to transparency and accountability at the Justice Department will depend largely on the actions of its next leader. The tone set by a new attorney general could be a turning point in the relationship between the department and Congress. As chairman, I intend to hold a fair and thorough hearing to carefully evaluate Lynch's qualifications and perspectives. While she has been confirmed twice as a U.S. attorney, she's never had a nomination hearing before the committee. Leading the Justice Department is a whole different ballgame, one with serious implications for a number of important national policy areas going forward. She'll be asked tough questions from all members of the committee, and her responses will provide valuable insight into what sort of attorney general she may be. This is Lynch's opportunity to make her case. The hearing is scheduled to last at least two days. On Wednesday, senators will be able to ask Lynch about her experience and her views of how the Justice Department should operate. The second day will be dedicated to testimony from witnesses selected by senators on both sides of the aisle. My philosophy as chairman is to provide members of the committee as much time as they need to question the nominee adequately, in a live setting. Vetting Lynch began weeks ago, shortly after her nomination. My office has been working to collect the necessary materials needed for a comprehensive review of Lynch's background. I appreciate that the Justice Department has been largely accommodating in the committee's requests for documents throughout this process. This week, as the Senate fulfills its constitutional duty to provide advice and consent, the American people will have the opportunity to learn how Lynch intends to lead the department, if she is confirmed. The country faces difficult challenges that the attorney general must meet head-on. It will take someone who has the right qualifications and experience to fill the job. I look forward to hearing Lynch's responses to our questions and evaluating her credentials for this important post.","Loretta Lynch has been nominated as the next U.S. attorney general .

""For 17 years I have given 100% of my time, energy, and life to public service,"" Jackson wrote. ""However, over the past several months, as my health has deteriorated, my ability to serve the constituents of my district has continued to diminish.

""My health issues and treatment regimen has been incompatible with service in the House of Representatives. Therefore, it is with great regret that I hereby resign as a member of the United States House of Representatives, effective today, in order to focus on restoring my health."" Jackson, the son of civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson, is the subject of investigations by the FBI and the House Ethics Committee involving possible financial improprieties. His House colleagues are looking into allegations that he or one of his associates offered to raise money for then-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich in exchange for Jackson being appointed to the Senate seat vacated by Barack Obama in 2008. ""During my journey I have made my share of mistakes,"" Jackson said in his resignation letter. ""I am aware of the ongoing federal investigation into my activities and I am doing my best to address the situation responsibly, cooperate with my investigators, and accept responsibility for my mistakes, for they are my mistakes and mine alone. None of us is immune from our share of shortcomings or human frailties and I pray that I will be remembered for what I did right."" Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn has five days after the resignation is confirmed to set a date for a special election to fill the seat vacated by Jackson. ""This election will be carried out in a manner that is fair to the electorate and as economical as possible for taxpayers,"" Gov. Quinn said Wednesday. U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush, who represents another Chicago district, suggested Wednesday that Jackson waited until after the election to step aside to make sure voters could chose his successor.  Otherwise, a few people in the Chicago power structure would have been able to  ""choose one of their lackeys to be the congressman."" Rush warned there could be confusion, though, if too many people jumped into the race to replace Jackson.  ""My fear is that there are going to be so many wannabees who are guided by blind ambition that we might find a tea party representative from the second congressional district, which would be a travesty in itself,"" Rush said . Jackson sounded ""sounded very, very sorrowful,"" in a phone call Wednesday morning, Rush said.  ""He sounded in so much pain."" ""As he works to address his health, our thoughts and prayers are with him, his wife Sandi, his children as well as his parents,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said. ""We are grateful to him and his family for their long-standing record of public service to our country."" Jackson has been out of the public eye and absent from Capitol Hill for much of the past year, including while he was being treated at the Mayo Clinic as recently as last month. He made no campaign appearances, relying instead on a recorded automated call to constituents in October in which Jackson said, ""the good news is my health is improving, but my doctors tell me the road to recovery is a long one."" ""Like many human beings, a series of events came together in my life at the same time and they've been difficult to sort through,"" he said in the call, which his office provided to CNN. ""I am human, I am doing my best, and I am trying to sort through them all."" In early July, the congressman's office announced he was ""receiving intensive medical treatment at a residential treatment facility for a mood disorder."" A few weeks later, his office said he was undergoing an ""extensive inpatient evaluation for depression and gastrointestinal issues"" at the Mayo Clinic. Jackson grew up in his father's shadow, placing him on history's stage as the Rev. Jesse Jackson Senior led civil rights campaigns, including Operation PUSH and the Rainbow Coalition. Jackson was born in 1965, just months before President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, which forced election changes that opened up the political process for African-Americans in the United States. Listen: Strange saga of Jesse Jackson Jr. He spent his 21st birthday in a District of Columbia jail cell after being arrested in an anti-apartheid protest at the South African Embassy in 1986, according to the biography on his congressional website. He was on the stage in Cape Town in 1990 when Nelson Mandela delivered his historic speech after his release from 27 years in a South African prison, the biography says. The younger Jackson earned a Master of Arts degree in theology and then a law degree in 1993. He served as national field director for his father's Rainbow Coalition, a role that included leading a campaign to register millions of new voters, the biography says. In 1995, Jackson became the 91st African-American elected to Congress. Since then, he has represented Illinois' 2nd Congressional District, which includes parts of Chicago's South Side and suburbs. A potential opportunity created by Barack Obama's election as president in 2008 ironically triggered a series of events that threatened Jackson's political career. Jackson, then 43, spoke with Blagojevich in fall 2008 about the possibility of being appointed to serve the remaining two years of Obama's vacated U.S. Senate term. Blagojevich was arrested by federal agents the next day and was accused of trying to sell the seat to the highest bidder. Jackson said he presented only his credentials and polling information that suggested he could win re-election in 2010. Blagojevich, eventually convicted on multiple corruption charges, started serving a 14-year prison sentence in March. The House Ethics Committee has been examining allegations that Jackson or one of his associates offered to raise funds for Blagojevich in exchange for the Senate seat. ""In doing so, Rep. Jackson may have violated federal law and House rules concerning the proper use of the member's representational allowance,"" the statement said. Jackson has maintained his innocence and pledged to continue to cooperate with authorities. ""I did nothing illegal, unethical or inappropriate in that pursuit, and I believe that is what the Ethics Committee will conclude at the end of this process,"" he said. Jackson apologized to his constituents in September 2010, after the Chicago Sun-Times reported that a Chicago businessman told federal investigators that Jackson had asked him to pay for a restaurant hostess to fly between Washington and Chicago several times. He said he was ""deeply sorry"" that he had ""disappointed some supporters."" The newspaper also reported that the businessman, Raghuveer Nayak, told the FBI that Jackson asked him to raise $6 million for Blagojevich in exchange for Obama's vacated Senate seat. The governor ended up appointing former Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris to the Senate post. Despite the congressional investigation, Jackson decisively won a heated primary for a 10th term in March. The congressman disappeared from Capitol Hill in May, and in June he explained in a statement released by his staff that he was taking a leave of absence because he was suffering from a ""medical condition.""

"(CNN)David Berry, one of 10 people killed during an attack on a luxury hotel in the Libyan capital, loved to live -- in the words of this father -- ""on the tip of the spear."" ""David was a patriot. David was a warrior when he needed to be, and also a peacemaker,"" James Berry said about his son. ""He was intelligent and resourceful. He would not break down in a fight when liberty, freedom and justice was at stake. I lost a son yesterday, but I believe in what David did, and I stand proud of him while I privately mourn,"" he told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Wednesday. The Libyan branch of ISIS has claimed responsibility for the gun and bomb attack that killed five foreigners, including Berry, an American security contractor. Five Libyans also died in Tuesday's attack on the Corinthia Hotel, said a spokesman for a security division of the Ministry of Interior in Tripoli, Essam al-Naas. Two attackers were killed, he said, saying it appeared they were Libyans. The five-star hotel is known as one where foreigners and government officials stay and meet to conduct business. The Libyan branch of ISIS released photos of the two gunmen it said had carried out the attacks, identifying them as Abu Ibraheem Al-Tunsi and Abu Sulaiman Al-Sudani. Their naming convention indicates that the men were of Tunisian and Sudanese origin, respectively. The FBI is expected to open an investigation into the incident, two U.S. officials told CNN. According to military records, Berry was in the U.S. Marine Corps, completing six deployments in Afghanistan, Kuwait and Iraq. He retired in September 2012, after a dozen years of service. He was working for Crucible, a security firm. According to its website, the Virginia-based firm ""provides high-risk environment training and global security solutions to employees of the U.S. government, NGOs, and multinational corporations who live and work in dangerous and austere locations worldwide."" His father said Berry was fluent in Arabic and knew his way around the Arab world. ""He knew how to approach Arabic people on a foreign shore and not ... discriminate against them -- not come across as, 'I'm am American warrior and I'm going to do it this way.' He was very conciliatory in nature,"" James Berry said. His son leaves behind a wife and four children. The other foreigners killed in the attack were a French citizen and three people from Tajikistan, al-Naas said. The French Foreign Ministry confirmed that a French citizen was among the dead but did not identify the victim. The Tripoli government, which is not internationally recognized, said the intended target of the attack was its prime minister, Omar al-Hassi, but the claim has not been confirmed. Al-Naas said that at least two Libyan security personnel were killed in the attack. An online group that supports ISIS said the attack was carried out in the name of Abu Anas al-Libi. He was an alleged al Qaeda operative accused of involvement in the bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa. He was captured by U.S. special forces in Tripoli in 2013. He died in a U.S. hospital this month. It's this declared link to al-Libi's capture by the United States that has prompted the FBI to investigate. Fighters loyal to ISIS have for several months been in control of the Mediterranean port city of Derna in eastern Libya, near the border with Egypt. They are suspected in other attacks elsewhere in Libya, including in Tobruk, Al-Bayda and Tripoli. Tuesday's attack began when militants detonated a car bomb in the parking lot of the hotel. The gunmen then shot their way into the hotel. The high-rise hotel is popular among government officials, some of whom live there. Until now, it was seen as one of the remaining secure locations in Tripoli for diplomatic and government activity. The attack, different in scale and coordination to those seen previously -- even after months of violence in Libya's east -- sends the message that nowhere in the country, or its capital, is safe. Authorities say they are now in control of the hotel premises and are starting their investigation. The self-proclaimed Tripoli government, formed by a coalition of militias, holds sway only over the capital and surrounding areas. The internationally recognized parliament was forced to leave the capital after militia groups seized control of the city in the summer. The U.S. Embassy in Tripoli, the United Nations and other international organizations and businesses also evacuated their staffs from Tripoli in the summer due to the unrest. The U.S. State Department last week issued a warning advising U.S. citizens against all travel to Libya and recommending that any U.S. citizens currently in the North African country should leave immediately. ""Extremist groups in Libya have made several specific threats against U.S. government officials, citizens, and interests in Libya,"" it said. ""Because of the presumption that foreigners, especially U.S. citizens, in Libya may be associated with the U.S. government or U.S. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), travelers should be aware that they may be targeted for kidnapping, violent attacks, or death.""

"(CNN)An electrical failure ignited a dry,15-foot-tall Christmas tree in a fire that destroyed an Annapolis, Maryland, mansion, killing four children and their grandparents, Anne Arundel County fire officials said Wednesday. Technology executive Don Pyle; his wife, Sandra; and four grandchildren died in what Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Bill McMullan called ""a tragic accident that occurred at the worst possible time while the Pyles and their grandchildren were sleeping."" ""The involvement of the Christmas tree explains the heavy fire conditions,"" Fire Chief  Allan Graves said at a news conference. The grandchildren have been identified as Alexis (Lexi) Boone, 8; Kaitlyn (Katie) Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8; and Wesley (Wes) Boone, 6. They were the children of Sandra Pyle's sons, Randy and Clint Boone. ""While the explanation that has been shared with us today does not bring solace, it does start us down the long road to acceptance,"" a statement Wednesday from the Boone and Pyle families said. ""Our tragedy has touched many lives in many families, and, in different degrees, is shared by each of us.  Our hope is that our loss will raise awareness that this tragic event could happen to any family. "" The blaze started in the waterfront mansion's great room, with 19-foot ceilings and connections to living and sleeping areas. It was fed by a towering Christmas tree that was cut about two months earlier, fire officials said. The tree was lit most of the time, officials said. ""The fuel load from the Christmas tree itself is what created the significant amount of fire and heat to cause the fire to spread as quickly as it did,"" Deputy Chief Scott Hoglander said. Authorities were alerted within minutes by a fire-alarm system monitored outside the home and a neighbor's 911 call. The home, which was constructed before 2005 legislation requiring a sprinkler system, did not have the devices. ""We're very comfortable that this was an accidental fire,"" Graves said. The medical examiner's office positively identified the victims, officials said. Five bodies were recovered in the days after the fire; the final one on Monday. The children were visiting their grandparents for a sleepover because January 19 was a school holiday, a family spokeswoman said. ""We believe that life is about making memories.  As we work through our pain and loss, the memories we made with our family will sustain us,"" the families' statement said. Officials said they were still conducting tests to determine the exact sequence of events, but believe the fire was sparked by a faulty electrical outlet. Smoke detectors in homes are common but fire sprinklers are not, says the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Fire sprinklers reduce the death rate by 83%, property damage by 69% and firefighter injuries by 65%. Fires in homes are responsible for more than 80% of fire deaths in the United States, according to the agency. Christmas tree fires are three times more deadly than home fire in general, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Local and federal officials last week secured the structure and accessed the foundation of the 16,000-square-foot house. Cadaver dogs led them to the bodies, officials said. Authorities were initially treating the house as a crime scene. Officials said it is standard procedure for a case such as this and no evidence has been found to indicate suspicious activity. The house belonged to Pyle, chief operating officer for ScienceLogic, and his wife, Sandra, company spokesman Antonio Piraino said. The sheer size of the structure and the fact that three-fourths of the building had collapsed into the basement, with deep piles of  debris still smoldering days after the blaze, compounded the search, Anne Arundel County Fire Capt. Robert Howarth said. He led the investigation along with a team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ""You're looking at five standard houses put together,"" he said last week. ""This is more of a commercial fire than it is a residential fire. There are a lot of businesses that aren't 16,000 square feet. That adds to it."" Fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about 3:30 a.m. January 19. About 80 firefighters responded. The ATF national response team responded because the fire was deemed suspicious, Howarth said. The fire department said crews had difficulty putting out the fire because the house is secluded, apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene. Photos the fire department posted on Twitter showed hoses stretched for long distances. Davies said it took hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control. Pyle's company biography described him as an industry veteran who has held multiple CEO positions, with more than 25 years' experience in information technology infrastructure software and hardware management. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.","Family statement says relatives are trying to accept what happened .

"Thanks to testimony and ""real-time"" video, lawmakers said they got their clearest picture yet Thursday of the deadly attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya, though questions and tensions remain as to how President Barack Obama's administration handled the matter. Republicans and Democrats who attended closed-door sessions of the House and Senate intelligence committees described what they heard and saw as informative, albeit not necessarily conclusive. They vowed to keep asking questions, and keep holding hearings, to determine not only how Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans died but also whether officials were forthright in the attack's aftermath. ""A lot of light was shone on this situation,"" Sen. Dianne Feinstein said after a hearing of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which she chairs. ""But we don't have all the facts yet. We are, in effect, fact-finding."" Added the committee's vice chairman, Georgia Republican Saxby Chambliss, ""Were mistakes made? Gosh, we know mistakes were made, and we've got to learn from that."" Legislators saw a ""real-time film (showing) exactly what happened"" on September 11 in Benghazi, starting before the attack began up ""through the incident and the exodus,"" said Feinstein. A source familiar with the House committee hearing said the video included shots of Stevens being dragged out of the building. Sen. Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican, described the footage as ""a combination of video from a surveillance camera and a drone."" ""It gave us a good picture, from the surveillance standpoint, what was happening,"" Coats said. Besides learning more about the attack, some Republicans in recent days have focused on comments made by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice days afterward, when she suggested the attack came after a protest against an anti-Muslim video produced in the United States. Several of those Republicans -- including Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rep. Peter King of New York -- have vowed to block any effort to nominate Rice as secretary of state should Hillary Clinton step down. Sen. Rand Paul: Heads should roll over Benghazi, but Rice is not the issue . ""What is clear is that this administration, including the president himself, has intentionally misinformed -- read that, lied -- to the American people in the aftermath of this tragedy,"" said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher of California, a GOP member of the House Foreign Affairs committee that on Thursday convened a panel of experts not directly connected with the Benghazi attack. ""The arrogance and dishonesty reflected in all of this is a little bit breathtaking."" Obama himself has stepped into the fray, saying Wednesday that those who criticize Rice ""because they think she's an easy target, then they've got a problem with me."" His comments didn't appear to dampen GOP criticisms of Rice and, thus, the Obama administration at Thursday's House Intelligence Committee hearing. A source familiar with that briefing said one Republican House member ""got into it"" with acting CIA Director Michael Morrel and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper about Rice's comments, challenging why they weren't as strong as they should have been on whether an extremist element was involved in the attack. Obama: Republican criticism over Rice 'outrageous' After that hearing, Rep. Adam Schiff echoed the president's comments on Rice, saying those ""claiming that the U.N. ambassador had some different information ... are either unfamiliar with the facts or willfully ignoring them."" The California Democrat said the ambassador got the same assessment as lawmakers that the violence in Benghazi began with ""a spontaneous protest that evolved into something militant."" ""We were given a very early assessment of events in Benghazi, and we were given an unclassified version that we could share with the public. That unclassified version turned out to be inaccurate, as we found out later,"" Schiff said. It was not clear if Rice's comments came up at the corresponding Senate hearing, though Feinstein did say, ""We had a good back and forth, and it was not always the easiest thing for everybody."" Then-CIA Director David Petraeus -- who is set to testify Friday before the House and Senate intelligence committees, one week after resigning citing an extramarital affair -- did develop unclassified talking points in the days after the incident,  a source who has spoken to him said. But he had no direct involvement in comments made by Rice, which may have used some of Petraeus' information but were otherwise distinct, the source said. Petraeus is testifying because he wants to clear up ""a lot of misrepresentations of what he told Congress initially,"" said the source, who is directly familiar with the ex-CIA chief's analysis of the situation. Pentagon releases official timeline of Benghazi attack . He knew ""almost immediately"" that Ansar al-Sharia, a loosely connected radical Islamist group, was responsible for the attack, as suggested by multiple sources and video from the scene, said the source. At the same time, a stream of intelligence -- including about 20 distinct reports -- also emerged indicating that a brewing furor over the anti-Islamic video preceded the attack. The CIA eventually disproved the reports that film-related protests had anything to do with the attack. But this didn't happen until after Petraeus' initial briefings to lawmakers, in which he discussed all the possibilities, the source said. Petraeus' told Kyra Phillips of HLN, CNN's sister network, that his resignation was not linked to the Benghazi attack and that he never passed classified information to the woman he was having an affair with.

"(CNN)Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry again asserted his innocence in the felony abuse-of-power case against him Wednesday and pledged to fight the charges, despite a Texas judge's refusal to dismiss the case this week. ""I am confident that I will ultimately prevail because the prosecution's case amounts to the criminalization of politics,"" he said during a Wednesday afternoon press conference. Perry's attorneys had sought to have the two criminal charges — coercion of a public official and abuse of official capacity — against him thrown out on constitutional grounds, their second failed attempt to have the case dismissed. Tony Buzbee, the governor's attorney, said in a statement issued Tuesday that Perry ""acted lawfully and properly exercised his power under the law as Governor to protect the public safety and integrity of government."" ""Continued prosecution of Governor Perry is an outrage and sets a dangerous precedent in our Democracy. America's commitment to the Constitution and the rule of law is at stake in this case, which is why we will immediately appeal this decision to the Third District Court of Appeals,"" he said. The former governor has already spent more than $1 million from his campaign coffers on his defense, and another appeal is likely to take months and draw more resources as he prepares for a likely presidential bid. Perry was indicted in August related to his 2013 veto threat to veto funding for public corruption prosecutors in the state, a threat which he eventually carried out and one that critics said was intended to pressure a local district attorney to resign. District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, a Democrat, rebuffed the governor's calls to resign after she was arrested and pleaded guilty in April of 2013 to drunken driving. The Texas governor is openly preparing for another presidential bid, and though the indictment was then seen as a possible impediment to his candidacy, he continued his travel to early primary states, and in fact drew widespread support from Republicans when the indictment was reported. His potential GOP primary opponents again came to his defense with the judge's decision to allow the case to move forward this week. Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, along with Govs. Scott Walker and Chris Christie, all issued statements of support on social media. And Perry reiterated Thursday that the ongoing case will have no impact on his preparations for a second run. ""We're moving right along as we have intended to"" with those plans, he said, and hinted that he may already have his mind made up on whether to go forward with another bid. ""We'll make a decision — or, actually, make an announcement, is a better descriptive term — in the May-June timetable just like we had intended to before this,"" Perry added.","A Texas judge denied the second attempt by Rick Perry's attorneys to have the felony charges against him thrown out .

"It's been three years since I reported on the plight of the Rohingya Muslim people of western Myanmar and neighboring Bangladesh. We called our documentary ""A Forgotten People,"" and it looked at appalling incidents where boatloads of refugees fleeing poverty and persecution arrived in Thailand only to be towed back out to sea and abandoned by the Thai security forces. Hundreds died or went missing. WATCH: The Forgotten People: Part 1 | Part 2 | Part 3 . Since then, the Rohingya have remained off the political agenda in western countries. But now that's changing. U.S. President Barack Obama addressed their plight during his recent visit to Yangon. The lukewarm response he got in the auditorium was nothing to the vitriol he got online. Even mentioning the name Rohingya is controversial for some in Myanmar. We have come to Rahkine to report on the latest threat to the Rohingya. What we have found is shocking. The Rohingyas are among the most persecuted people on the planet. In both Myanmar and Bangladesh -- where they have a deep-rooted heritage dating back to when it was known as East Bengal -- they are not officially citizens and are denied passports, access to health-care, education and decent jobs. Each country claims the Rohingya is the other's problem. In July this year, the Bangladeshi government ordered three international aid organizations to stop helping Rohingya who were crossing the border from Myanmar. In Myanmar, their perilous situation has become markedly worse in recent months. Mobs of Buddhist Rahkine extremists have been torching whole Rohingya villages. Hundreds have died and more than 100,000 people have been forced to flee, according to humanitarian groups. But there is nowhere for them to go. So driven by fear many are congregating in huge makeshift camps on the edge of the Rahkine town of Sittwe. I was expecting the camps to be grim -- but I wasn't prepared to see children starving to death. This isn't journalistic hyperbole. The two western doctors working unofficially here have watched several children perish before their eyes -- not from a rare tropical disease or an untreated chronic condition, but simply from malnutrition. I find it sickening and outrageous that this is happening in a land of plentiful food in 2012. Perhaps I am naïve or too idealistic. I should probably know better, I should have seen enough of the world's misery and violence to be unaffected by a wide-eyed kid too fatigued to swat the flies from her eyes. But this one broke my heart. She's not alone. An assessment in August by Refugees International found that ""2,000 acutely malnourished children who were at a high risk of mortality."" Thousands of kids like Saulama Hafu are starving to death. International aid agencies are beginning to wake up to the scale of the problem. The United Nations has just launched an appeal for US$41 million. Tents, wells and latrines have been installed in some of the camps, but according to Refugees International, camp facilities are ""unacceptable and fall well below international standards"" and ""are a direct manifestation of a funding gap."" They say water and sanitation facilities in particular are ""wholly inadequate, resulting in life-threatening illnesses."" Many Rohingya are surviving on a cup of rice each day and little else. It's not enough for breast-feeding mothers to sustain their babies. It's not enough for adults. It's not enough for little Saulama, whose skeletal body is as light as a doll's. She looks like a famine victim but she is starving to death in a camp surrounded by paddy fields full of rice. There's a busy market a couple of miles away, but her mother is effectively imprisoned here. This is a man-made crisis that could be ended immediately, with political will. I asked Saulama's age, thinking that she looked like a toddler. My own daughter is three and is considerably larger, so I guess perhaps she was two. I was appalled when her mother told me Saulama is five-years old. In the west, she'd be in her first year of school. Here, she could be in the last year of her life. She's so thin she can barely walk. Her limbs are pitifully emaciated. After six months in this camp, she looks like she can't go on. The doctors have not been given visas to help here, so they can only get the most basic supplies. The Myanmar government is reluctant to allow aid workers to help people who don't officially exist. But the reality is that there are an estimated one million Rohingya in Western Myanmar and at least a tenth of them have been driven from their homes. Yet driving around Sittwe, away from the camps, you rarely see a Rohingya in the town center. When we asked a Rohingya driver to bring us back from the camps to our hotel to sort out a problem with our camera, the hotel manager was furious. He told us in no uncertain terms not to use a Muslim driver again and said people had seen the driver come into the hotel and had complained. It is apartheid of the most extreme form. Near Sittwe University, which sits amid several Rohingya villages and camps, RohingyaS on foot, bicycle or scooter are forced to pull off the road when Buddhist Rakhine students are leaving classes. Sharing the same stretch of tarmac as a Rohingya is unacceptable for many Rahkine Buddhists; heaven forbid a Rohingya should attempt to board the same bus or eat in the same restaurant. Aung Mingalar is the last neighborhood of Rohingya living inside the town of Sittwe; the rest of population is now under canvas or tarps out in the countryside. This island of Rohingya houses is now effectively a ghetto surrounded by barbed wire. The soldiers that patrol the area are supposed to protect the Rohingya from further attacks by hostile locals, but videos taken by Rohingya purportedly showing an outbreak of violence in Aung Mingalar in June show the troops doing little to put out fires set in Rohingya homes. The Rohingya fear more attacks here, but can do little to stop the gangs of extremists who they say were orchestrated by a local Rahkine nationalist party. The spokesman for that party denies involvement, but has open contempt for the Rohingya, flinching when I even mention the term. He says it's a recently made up word, and that the Rohingya are simply Bengalis from neighboring Bangladesh. Ominously he goes further. He doesn't just want to kick all Rohingya out. He wants all Muslims out of Rakhine state, including officially recognized ethic groups like the Kaman. The anti-Muslim sentiment has spread across Myanmar, with protests outside a mosque in the main city of Yangon. The International Crisis Group report on the situation is deeply worrying, while Human Rights Watch has also completed some important work, highlighting the atrocities, with satellite photos showing the vast areas of destruction. What has disappointed many is that Nobel laureate and pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi took a long time to speak out clearly to uphold Rohingya rights and condemn the extremists. She recently told Indian Broadcaster NTV: ""Violence is something I condemn completely, but don't forget that violence has been committed by both sides. This is why I prefer not to take sides and also I want to work towards reconciliation between these two communities. I'm not going to be able to do that if I'm going to take sides."" Suu Kyi elaborated further, saying: ""There's a quarrel whether people are true citizens under the law or whether they have come over as migrants later from Bangladesh. One of the very interesting and rather disturbing facts of this whole problem is that most people seem to think as that there was only one country involved in this border issue. But there are two countries. There's Bangladesh one side, there's Burma on the other and the security and the security of the border is surely the responsibility of both countries."" But in the past she has referred to Rohingyas with the pejorative term ""Bengalis"" suggesting some should not be recognized as citizens in Myanmar. The whole issue has tarnished the glow of fast-paced reform in Myanmar. While the rest of the country is enjoying freedoms not experienced in 60 years of military dictatorship, in Rahkine State the ethnic cleansing is continuing with impunity. It demands the attention of the international community, for the sake of children like Saulama... before it's too late.","Rohingya are a stateless Muslim minority living in Myanmar's Rakhine state .

"Pakistani police are searching for two youths suspected of shooting a teenage activist for girls' education and the man they believe drove them to the scene, the country's interior minister said Sunday. ""The guys who actually made this assassination attempt, they were two young boys,"" Rehman Malik said. But he said they were brought to Malala Yousufzai's hometown of Swat by Atta Ullah Khan, a 23-year-old man identified by police as their primary suspect. Malik said one of the youths distracted the driver of the car that carried Malala, while the other asked a bystander to identify her. ""Obviously they had done their homework,"" Malik told CNN in London. ""They had seen the vehicle of Malala going up and down, and accordingly they acted on that."" Messages for Malala . Police said last week that they had arrested six men in connection with the shooting, but were still searching for Khan, who was studying for a master's degree in chemistry. Malik defended the investigation into the shooting, telling CNN, ""Within 24 hours we were in a position to identify almost everybody."" And he rejected calls from some in Pakistan to bring the country's military to bear on the attackers, saying ""A military solution is not the solution."" The 15-year-old Malala initially gained international attention in 2009, writing a blog about her life as the Taliban gained a foothold in her home region, in northwest Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan. Taliban leaders claimed responsibility for the shooting, but they don't appear to have anticipated the level of condemnation it would provoke. Thousands of people in Pakistan and elsewhere have attended rallies and vigils honoring her courage and praying for her recovery. Malik called her ""the pride of Pakistan"" and said ""we would love her to come back."" He said police had offered to protect Malala three times before the incident, but her father had refused. He said her entire family would be under guard when they return to Pakistan after her treatment, for which the government will pay. He said that will require two cordons of police -- female officers to surround Malala, with male officers surrounding the female contingent.  But he added, ""I assure to the world community that when she goes back, we do have the ability to protect her."" Malik is scheduled to visit Malala on Monday in her hospital in Birmingham, England, where she is recovering from her head wound. He'll also meet with the foreign ministers of Britain and the United Arab Emirates, which provided the air ambulance that flew Malala to the United Kingdom. Malala was shot at point-blank range while on her way home from school on October 9. She was flown to Britain six days later. Her father, Ziauddin Yousufzai, visited her in Birmingham last week and described her survival as a ""miracle for us."" Malik said she and her parents can stay in the UK as long as needed, ""until she is fully rehabilitated."" He said she had asked for her school books so she can study for exams, which he said will be given to her when she returns.","Pakistan's interior minister says teen activist's assailants were ""two young boys""

"On Tuesday afternoon's epsiode of ""Anderson Live,"" host Anderson Cooper told viewers he sunburnt his eyes on a recent trip to Portugal, and was subsequently blind for 36 hours. Cooper said the injury occurred while he was on the water, without sunglasses, for an extended period of time reporting for CBS's ""60 Minutes."" ""I wake up in the middle of the night and it feels like my eyes are on fire, my eyeballs and I think, 'Oh, maybe I have sand in my eyes or something,'"" Anderson said. ""I douse my eyes with water. Anyway, it turns out I have sunburned my eyeballs and I go blind. I went blind for 36 hours."" TIME.com: A wristband that tells you when to get out of the sun . Just how common is sunburning your eyes? According to Dr. Deborah Sarnoff, senior vice president of The Skin Cancer Foundation and practicing dermatologist at Cosmetique in New York, sunburns to the extent of Cooper's doesn't happen too often, but it is possible if you're not wearing the right protection. ""We have sunscreen we can put on our skin, but we don't have eye drops that offer a protective film for the cornea, so it is really important that everyone, and especially people with fair or light eyes, wear sunglasses that protect against both UVA and UVB rays,"" says Sarnoff. According to Sarnoff, the outer eyeball layer, known as the cornea, is similar to the outer layer of  skin. When it is burned by the sun's rays, the cornea becomes inflamed -- an effect called keratitis -- which can be quite painful and, as in Cooper's case, can cause temporary blindness. For someone like Cooper, who has light irises, there is a higher risk of burns. And like sunburns on the skin, burning your cornea causes cumulative damage. ""In the short run you heal, but in the long run sometimes the damage builds. We can get a sunburn, and we can heal from it, and the inflammation can go away, but it can add to the chronic damage and put us at risk for skin cancer,"" says Sarnoff. Eye issues like cataracts, skin cancer of the eyelids and melanoma in the retina are all possible risks from sun-damaged eyes. TIME.com: Sunburn and indoor tanning still putting young people at risk for skin cancer . Thankfully, with numbing and antibiotic eye-drops, it only takes a couple days to recover. ""The good news is that our bodies are very regenerative, and we have regenerative powers in both the top layer of our skin, and on top of the cornea. We are always replacing the skin and corneal cells,"" says Sarnoff. ""It takes time, but within a few days you can be better."" Even during the winter, you should protect your eyes from dangerous rays -- particularly when they are reflected off bright surfaces such as snow. To keep your eyes safe, wear sunglasses and a hat with a three inch brim, advises Sarnoff. If you do get a burn, see your ophthalmologist right away. This story was originally published on TIME.com.

"(CNN)It's an unseasonably warm day in Oakland, California, a perfect morning for Jennifer and Dave Simon to take their baby, Livia, out for a walk. But her stroller sits idle, and Livia is stuck inside the house -- as she has been for nearly a month. Livia isn't sick, but doctors fear she might become the 53rd person to contract measles in a recent Disneyland outbreak. Now she's in a 28-day quarantine, because of a family that refused to vaccinate their child. Opinion: Heed the lesson from Disneyland measles outbreak . It started January 2, when the Simons took Livia, who had a cold, to the pediatrician. Two days later, the doctor's office called to say that a child with measles had been in the office that same day. The Simons feared the worst. One of the most contagious viruses on Earth, measles can hang in the air or on surfaces for hours. If she'd contracted the disease, Livia could become deaf or even die. ""We were really freaking out and really worried,"" Jennifer Simon said. Then the Simons learned from a doctor that the child in the doctor's office had contracted measles because his parents had refused vaccination. Livia, just 6 months old, is too young to be vaccinated. ""I'm angry,"" Simon said. ""I've been upset that someone else's personal choice has impacted us so much."" In Alameda County, where Simon lives, nine infants were in quarantine as of Tuesday night because of the measles outbreak, a spokeswoman said. Simon said she hopes families who opt not to immunize their children realize the full impact of their decision. ""Their choice endangered my child,"" she said. She points out that vaccine refusers rely on other people to protect their children. It's called herd immunity. If the rest of the community is immune to disease, it helps keep the disease from spreading to those who are unvaccinated. ""You're basically relying on society but not giving back,"" she said. Livia's quarantine ends Friday. A happy baby, she doesn't seem to mind being at home, but it's disrupted the Simons' life and cost them money, as the couple had to miss work for several days and then bring Jennifer's mother in from Houston to stay home with Livia. When asked what she would say to parents of the unvaccinated child, she said she would first ask whether their child was doing OK. Then she would ask them a question: ""Hey, you guys, what do you think about vaccines now?"" 5 things to know about measles .","A California baby too young to be vaccinated went to the doctor with a cold .

"(CNN)A young mother in Washington state has been charged with attempted murder after authorities say she cut her children's throats in an attempt to keep them quiet. Over the weekend, Christina Booth called 911 to report that her three children were crying nonstop and ""needed medical attention,"" according to a recent probable cause filing. The 28-year-old and her husband, Thomas Booth, have three children, a 2-year-old and 6-month-old twins. When officers arrived at the Olympia, Washington, home Saturday night, they found a troubling scene. As spelled out by a local prosecutor, police saw the twins on the couch crying ""uncontrollably"" and ""bleeding from their necks."" One officer then went upstairs and found the couple's 2-year-old in bed, under the covers with ""dry blood all over her."" All three were taken to a local hospital, where, CNN affiliate KOMO reports, they underwent surgery. They are now in stable condition and will be placed in protective custody. In their probable cause filing, authorities paint a picture of a mother overwhelmed and suffering from postpartum depression. A judge set bail for Booth at $3 million, KCPQ, another CNN affiliate, reported. The night that ended in tears and blood began with wine and a movie. In the probable cause filing, Thomas Booth told investigators he had two ""large glasses"" and his wife had at least the same amount. ""Thomas said he was feeling intoxicated,"" the document reads ""and Christina was intoxicated to the point that she was slurring her words."" As the movie wrapped up, Thomas Booth told police, his wife took the toddler upstairs to put her to bed, but then ""a short time later Christina came down the stairs in only her underwear crying and screaming."" Postpartum depression: One mom's mission becomes a movement . Christina Booth, like her husband, spoke to authorities without an attorney present. Her story differs from her husband's slightly, a local prosecutor said. She told a police detective that she was having ""a really rough time"" taking care of her three children. She said that her husband ""never helps"" and that he ""gets very annoyed when the children cry and make noise."" Like her husband, Christina Booth said they were watching a movie and she went to put the toddler to bed just before the movie ended. She then told authorities that the twins started crying and ""she hit her breaking point."" In the probable cause document, a prosecutor says she confessed to the crimes of which she stands accused, saying ""she knew if she killed all the kids the house would be quiet for Thomas."" ""During the interview, Christina broke down crying several times, yelled about Thomas never helping with the kids"" the document says. ""Christina made the comment 'they will be quiet now' several times."" Thomas Booth told police that his wife has been ""very stressed out raising the children"" and that she took medication for postpartum depression. He also said she ""always takes the children out of his presence if they cry."" The couple's account differs in where the attack on the twins took place. Christina Booth told authorities she carried them downstairs after attacking her toddler and cut their necks while they lay on the couch. Her husband told police he found the babies upstairs with injuries to their necks and brought them downstairs to render first aid. Thomas Booth has not been charged, and KOMO reports that police do not suspect he played any kind of role in the violence. KOMO reports he's an active-duty soldier who was recently deployed overseas. Neighbors described Christina Booth as sweet, vivacious and ""a loving mother."" Tiffany Felch, who has spent time with the pair, told KOMO, ""I would have never suspected that she would be a person to take this kind of a drastic action. I can't imagine what stress she must have been under to cause her to do such a thing."" KOMO reported that neighbors say Christina Booth was normally social, but changed after giving birth to the twins. Neighbor Tammy Ramsey expressed concern to KOMO about the potential for missed opportunities to help the family. ""Why weren't we knocking on the door?"" she said. ""I think that we need to rally and love to understand and not to judge.""","Christina Booth is charged with attempted murder after admitting slashing her three young children, police say .

"The president of the Central African Republic asked Thursday for help from other nations to stave off rebel advances that threaten his rule. The former French colony asked France and the United States to help ensure ""the rebels return home...instead of destroying and killing Central Africans,"" President Francois Bozize said. ""Fellow citizens, the time has come,"" Bozize said. The rebels ""want to steal our country and we want to do (something) about it."" Amid indications that the rebels may try to take the capital, Bangui, the United Nations began relocating dependents and nonessential staff. The U.S. Embassy in Bangui suspended operations Friday ""as a result of the deteriorating security situation,"" the State Department said in a statement. ""U.S. citizens who have decided to stay in CAR should review their personal security situation and seriously consider departing, taking advantage of commercial flights,"" it said. Read more: CNN Inside Africa . Attacks on several cities by the coalition of rebel groups known as ""Seleka"" undermine peace agreements in the Central African Republic; rebels say they are fighting because the government has broken promises. The rebels were located about 190 miles from Bangui; no new attacks had been reported since Wednesday, diplomatic adviser Honore Nzessiwe said Thursday. The Central African Republic government is seeking negotiations with the rebels in Libreville, Gabon, he said. In the meantime, troops from the Central African Multinational Forces were expected to arrive to bolster security in the capital, he said. Bozize directed his call for help to France, saying ""the French are our cousins. They should fix what is happening."" France has a permanent presence of 200 to 300 military personnel at Bangui's airport under the mandate of the Economic Community of Central African States. But French President Francois Hollande said Thursday that the troops are not intended to ""protect a regime"" against the advance of the rebels, but instead French nationals and interests. France will ""in no way to interfere in the internal affairs of a country, in this case, CAR,"" Hollande said, adding: ""That time is over."" Asked about a possible intervention in favor of displaced persons or refugees, the French president said that his country could not ""intervene unless there is a U.N. mandate,"" and noted that ""this is not the case."" ""But in general, we are always for civilians to be protected and preserved, and we will do our duty again,"" he said. Bozize spoke Thursday with the French foreign minister about the crisis. The French asked the Central African Republic leader to protect foreign nationals in his country. A day earlier, hundreds of protesters massed outside the French Embassy and called for intervention in Bangui; people threw stones and pipes at the building. On Thursday, protesters gathered in front of a U.N. building in the capital. That was where Bozize made his remarks asking for foreign help, said Margaret Vogt, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general. The president ""addressed the crowd telling them he is ready for a dialogue,"" she said. The desire for negotiation was reiterated in a statement released on behalf of Bozize by the Central African Republic Foreign Ministry. It said Bozize has no intention to tinker with the constitution in order to remain in power, and wants to work within the framework of the document to negotiate a solution.

"The Japanese parliament elected Shinzo Abe as prime minister Wednesday, giving him a second chance at the same job five years after he resigned abruptly. Abe, 58, is the nation's seventh prime minister in six years. He started the revolving door of prime ministers by resigning in 2007, just one year into the job. The leader of the Liberal Democratic Party has vowed to boost the economy and defend Japanese interests, including territorial disputes with China over a group of islands. Read more: Japanese politicians vie for votes amid turmoil . Asia's first and second largest economies have been embroiled in a trade dispute over the islands in the East China Sea.

Those that pass should be brought back online,  he has said. He'll also have to deal with the enduring task of cleaning up communities shattered by the earthquake and tsunami, and contend with local anger that the recovery seems to have stalled. Former Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda stepped down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. His Democratic Party of Japan, once seen as a breath of fresh air, was considered increasingly ineffective. Noda conceded defeat in parliamentary elections, signaling the return to power of the  conservative Liberal Democratic Party that ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955. It was forced from power three years ago by Noda's party. Abe is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. ""The economy is at the bottom.

"French movie icon Gerard Depardieu is now a Russian. He is best known to U.S. movie fans for his starring role in the 1990 comedy ""Green Card,"" in which the character he plays marries an American woman -- played by Andie MacDowell -- to be allowed permanent residence in the States. Depardieu may never become a documented immigrant in the U.S., but the star announced Friday he accepted  Russian citizenship after Vladimir Putin granted it to him personally by presidential decree, Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported. Read more: Hollande under pressure to show hand . The movie star and businessman recently fled his native France in a high-profile protest of government plans for a tax hike on the richest. He moved just across the border to the town of Nechin, Belgium, and ditched his French citizenship. Putin's offer stems from a quip the actor made to a French newspaper two weeks ago about citizenship offers from other countries. ""Putin has already sent me a passport,"" he joked to Le Monde. He and Putin are friends. Read more: France's tax laws will lead to 'brain drain' The Russian president pounced on the wisecrack the very next day, saying that if Depardieu wants in, then he's in, Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported. Putin had Thursday's decree posted to his website: . ""In accordance with clause 'a' of article 89 of the Russian Constitution, the application for Russian citizenship by Gerard Xavier Depardieu born in France in 1948 has been granted."" France's socialist administration wants to raise taxes on citizens earning more than 1 million euros ($1.3 million) annually to 75%. The Russian federation has a flat income tax rate of 13%, RIA Novosti reported. Depardieu has worked in Russia before, appearing in a historical film on czarist Russia and in ad campaigns. His father was a Communist, and as a child, before the fall of the Iron Curtain, he listened to Radio Moscow. He has promised to start learning Russian and in a letter to journalists gushed with praise for his new society, RIA Novosti reported. ""I adore your country, Russia, your people, your history, your writers...I adore your culture, your way of thinking."" And he wrote that he spoke with ""his"" President Francois Hollande about the decision. ""He knows that I love your President Vladimir Putin,"" Depardieu wrote, according to RIA Novosti, ""and that feeling is mutual."" Read more: France raises taxes on rich . Depardieu is a cultural icon in France, and his departure has triggered a hailstorm of public criticism for and against him. It reignited the discussion on the tax code. He abandoned his citizenship in an emotional, sweeping open letter addressed to French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault that was published in mid-December in the Sunday paper Le Journal du Dimanche. ""Sadly, I no longer belong here,"" he wrote, ""but I will continue to love the French public, with whom I have shared so many emotions. I'm leaving because you believe that success, creativity, talent -- what makes people individual -- must be punished."" He asserted that he has always paid his taxes, claiming they totaled 145 million euros over the past 45 years. In addition to his million-dollar acting fees, Depardieu has revenues from companies he said he owns that give work to a total of 80 employees. ""I leave after having paid, in 2012, 85% tax on my income,"" he wrote, triggering at least one fact check in the French press. With his citizenship, Depardieu bequeathed in the letter his social security benefits to the state. He has left France to become ""a true European, a citizen of the world."" Depardieu has been one of the quintessential faces of the French silver screen for decades. His large, clefted nose, broad smile, beaming eyes, longish blond hair, hefty physique and bodacious mannerisms are uniquely his own and have left their imprint on the French cinema and stage. He has played in at least 195 films since 1967, according to the Internet Movie Database, and starred in every genre from happy-go-lucky comedies to tragedies. He has helped bring French historic epics such as ""Napoleon"" and ""Germinal"" to life. Depardieu has received numerous acting awards and has even been knighted. But he has also been known for audacious escapades under the influence of alcohol, such as urinating on the floor of an airplane about to take off and reportedly trashing an automobile with his bare hands. In his open letter to France and its politicians, he admits to foibles in his lifestyle and love life but is unapologetic. He has also suffered family tragedies. He lost his heroin-addicted son to pneumonia. He left his wife, and he and his daughter are reportedly estranged. According to media reports, Depardieu has received citizenship offers from other countries. His next movie, which IMDb describes as a ""thriller"" is to release this year and bears the title ""Foreign Affairs.""","Gerard Depardieu has been granted Russian citizenship by Vladimir Putin .

"The U.S. Army reported Thursday that there were 325 confirmed or potential suicides last year among active and nonactive military personnel. ""Our highest on record,"" said Lt. Gen. Howard Bromberg, deputy chief of staff, manpower and personnel for the Army. The grim total exceeds the number of total U.S. Army deaths (219) and total military deaths (313) in Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, according to figures published by the military's Defense Casualty Analysis System. For all of last year, 182 potential active-duty suicides were reported, 130 of which have been confirmed and 52 of which remain under investigation, it said. And 143 potential not-on-active-duty suicides were reported (96 Army National Guard and 47 Army Reserve), 117 of which have been confirmed and 26 remain under investigation. The total for 2011 was 283 -- 165 confirmed active-duty suicides and 118 confirmed not-on-active-duty suicides (82 Army National Guard and 36 Army Reserve). No cases were under investigation. The toll comes despite what the military touts as extensive support and counseling programs. ""The Army continues to take aggressive measures head-on to meet the challenge of suicides as every loss of life impacts our family,"" said Bromberg. ""In spite of the increased loss of life to suicide, with calendar year 2012 being our highest on record, the Army is confident that through our continued emphasis in the services, programs, policies and training that support our Army family, we will overcome this threat to our Force."" How virtual reality can combat veterans' PTSD . For years, the Pentagon has struggled with how to identify service members at risk for suicide and to provide counseling and other services. The Army and Navy have focused on teaching ""resiliency"" to troops in hopes of helping them cope with stress. Military experts have long said one of the enduring challenges is that there doesn't appear to be a direct link between suicides and the stress of being in the combat zone. ""Nobody knows No. 1, why all the suicides. Nobody has a good theoretical model for explaining this vector, but these are some possible contributors,"" said Dr. William Nash, an expert in combat stress injuries. ""The whole system being strained, more temper, stigma is rampant, leaders who should be getting more education for mental health issues but are not."" Nash said the stigma discourages soldiers from reporting issues related to stress in the combat zone. ""To the extent that a military service branch that is having basically an epidemic of post-traumatic stress disorder  is not embracing it as an epidemic, but instead sees it as 'they're faking,'"" he said. ""Which has been part of the stigma problem."" Treating PTSD with Ecstasy . The Army's statement said it had expanded the Strong Bonds Program to strengthen relationships and family bonds; certified more than 3,000 additional suicide prevention trainers in the Ask, Care, Escort suicide intervention program; revised the Comprehensive Soldier Fitness program to include family members; increased the volume and availability of behavioral health services; and conducted an Army-wide stand down during Suicide Prevention Month to promote increased leaders' awareness and involvement. The numbers did not surprise Paul Sullivan, a member of the board of Veterans for Common Sense, a nonprofit advocacy group. ""As the service members return home and as the wars wind down, the mental trauma of war remains and there is an urgent need to make sure every service member receives a psychological evaluation upon returning home, and whenever a service member reaches out for help, the service member needs to receive it immediately,"" he said. ""In both of those areas, the military is trying to improve, yet it's still falling short. For example, the military is now providing more psychological exams, but it's not doing it for every soldier coming back. And the military still reports that it's short-handed for mental health professionals and, because of the vacancies, that means either veterans don't see a doctor at all, there's delay seeing a doctor, the veteran is put in group therapy instead of individual or the veteran is given prescription drugs instead of receiving one-on-one counseling, which is the best standard."" The suicide hotline is 800-273-8255. A private-sector group, the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS), which provides military grief support programs, has reported it receives eight to 10 cases a week of people seeking help dealing with the suicide of a service member.

"If it doesn't sound off with that iconic click-clack keyboard sound, is it really a BlackBerry? The company behind the former market-leading phone says yes. And it is betting a big stack of their dwindling chips that both new users and diehard ""CrackBerry"" devotees will agree. On Wednesday, Research in Motion (who would simply be named BlackBerry by the time the event ended) unveiled BlackBerry 10, a top-to-bottom overhaul of its mobile operating system. With BlackBerry 10, struggling phone maker eyes comeback . With it came two new phones. One, the BlackBerry Q10, includes the physical keyboard that most users, or former users, consider virtually synonymous with the brand. But that one felt like little more than an afterthought. It was the Z10 -- a snazzy, touchscreen-only new phone -- that was used throughout the presentation to show off the system's new capabilities. And BlackBerry's website Wednesday was dominated with plugs for the Z10, while the Q10, like an embarrassing stepchild, was nowhere to be found. Forget the Z10 simply having fewer buttons than older BlackBerrys. With no ""home"" button, it's got fewer than the iPhone and most popular Android phones, as well. The Z10 isn't the first time BlackBerry has tried a keyboard-free device. But it's clear they're putting more stock in it than the ill-fated BlackBerry Storm, which hit an iPhone-dominated smartphone market with a resounding thud in 2008. From 'CrackBerry' to 'depressing': The BlackBerry's 5-year fall . ""The absolute best typing experience in the industry, period."" That's how BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins touted his two new phones. Specifically, with white virtual keys and a black background, it's one that will be familiar to users of other smartphones, who BlackBerry hopes to woo back home, as well as the brand's current fans. ""Everything just feels like a BlackBerry typing experience,"" said Vivek Bhardwaj, head of software at BlackBerry. Kevin Michaluk, editor of BlackBerry fan site CrackBerry, says a touchscreen-only experience ""may seem odd to some considering the majority of today's 78 million communication-hungry BlackBerry subscribers are using models with a physical keyboard."" But after demoing the device, he says he's sold. ""Now that we have logged some mileage on the BlackBerry Z10, we're getting it,"" Michaluk wrote Tuesday. ""BlackBerry 10 has built a full touchscreen experience that even physical keyboard diehards will love."" 5 things that could make BlackBerry 10 a hit . Function aside, experts say that in 2013 bringing a touchscreen device to the forefront was something BlackBerry had to do. ""The Q10 is really just a retro play to make sure they do not lose any of the 79 million users that still prefer the traditional BlackBerry keyboard,"" said Scott Snyder, co-founder of mobile-strategy firm Mobiquity and author of ""The New World of Wireless: How to Compete in the 4G Revolution."" ""The Z10 is really the future vision,"" he said. The Z10 may not signal the end of the physical keyboard on smartphones, he said. But it could be the beginning of the end as the last holdout evolves. ""RIM was caught off guard by this. Now they are in the mainstream, with a touch interface, for the majority of the 1 billion smartphones in the world. Only a small segment of enterprise users will continue to stay on the traditional keyboard model out of habit.""

"(CNN)In 2010, Marissa Alexander discharged a firearm in the direction of her estranged husband, Rico Gray -- a so-called ""warning shot"" that missed him by several inches.  Their two children were present. Although no one was injured, she was charged with aggravated assault with a firearm. Alexander claimed self-defense, but a judge declined to grant self-defense immunity (""stand-your-ground""). The case went to trial where a jury convicted Alexander after just 12 minutes of deliberation, triggering a mandatory 20-year sentence. The verdict prompted outrage as it highlighted the absurdly draconian punishments that can result from minimum mandatory sentencing guidelines that demand a certain punishment regardless of the underlying facts of the case. The stakes in this high-profile case elevated when, in 2013, an appellate court vacated Alexander's conviction based on a legal technicality.  The ruling set the stage for a retrial, but this time, State Attorney Angela Corey (the same prosecutor I faced in the Zimmerman case) upped the ante, insisting the 20-year sentence apply once for every person present -- Rico and the two children.  Alexander faced a potential 60-year prison sentence for firing a shot that harmed no one. Last month, Alexander accepted a deal whereby she pled guilty to the charges in exchange for a drastic reduction of the prison sentence -- essentially the three years she had already served. This week, the court approved the sentencing. But to say that Marissa Alexander is free is a misnomer.  She'll serve another two years under house arrest, wearing an ankle collar.  She's also a convicted felon, so she's lost her right to vote and she'll face the stigma of such a designation for the rest of her life. Many are left wondering if justice was served. Marissa Alexander's case had some problems.  In order to justify her self-defense claim, Alexander needed to show that she had reasonable fear of imminent and great bodily injury or death when she discharged the weapon.  Her estranged husband, Gray, did have a history of domestic violence. And there was testimony that he was violent in his encounter with Alexander just before the shooting. The problem for Alexander, however, was that she escaped the danger by retreating into the garage.  There, she took the gun from the glove compartment of her car and she re-entered the house, engaged Gray, and fired the weapon.  It's what we lawyers call ""imperfect self-defense.""  The ""stand-your-ground"" statute removes the duty to retreat from a threat, but it does not allow you to retreat, arm yourself, and come back. The Alexander case provides an excellent example of how an ""imperfect"" self-defense argument can have devastating and disproportionate consequences.  Because the jury did not accept Alexander's self-defense argument, they had to convict.  What they probably didn't realize (because in Florida juries aren't told the sentences attached to their verdicts) is that they triggered Florida's 10-20-Life mandatory sentencing requirement. In Florida, a person who uses a gun in the commission of certain felonies (including aggravated assault) must face minimum mandatory sentencing.  If the gun is possessed during the commission of one of the enumerated felonies, a minimum 10-year sentence is required.  If the gun was discharged, as it was in this case, it is 20 years.  Florida's minimum mandatory sentences are served day-per-day; there is no early release. It might be appropriate to impose minimum mandatories on violent felons who use guns to further the commission of a crime such as armed robbery. The idea, however, that Florida does not allow any discretion -- even judicial discretion -- for more complicated scenarios truly makes it difficult to adjudicate these cases. Had Alexander taken this case to trial and again been convicted, the state indicated that they would seek a 60-year minimum mandatory sentence.  While the law allowed for such, it would have been an absurd result. We rely on judges to assist in dispensing justice, and to be the arbiter between the state and the defense.  While the legislature has the absolute right to make laws, it should not hamstring a judge's ability to dispense appropriate justice under the specific circumstances of individual cases.  When a judge faces a minimum mandatory sentence, her hands are tied, she becomes a mathematician rather than a dispenser of justice.  If the facts and the law support a harsh sentence, a judge has the discretion to impose it, but we should not force their hands when minimum mandatories produce obviously unjust sentences. More troubling yet is that the threat of such an absurd punishment clearly dissuaded Alexander from seeking a second jury trial.  Had the statute been written in such a way to allow for a judge or jury to consider whether or a minimum mandatory sentence should apply, then the case could have been adjudicated on its merits.  Instead, Alexander did what she had to do under the present statutory scheme -- plead and avoid risking a virtual life sentence where she would have died in prison. Minimum mandatory sentencing takes discretion away from judges and gives it to prosecutors.  While it is appropriate for prosecutors to have discretion over who they prosecute and what charges they pursue, minimum mandatory sentencing gives them a power that can be too easily abused.  Prosecutors can use the threat of extreme minimum mandatory sentences to strong-arm defendants into plea deals.  This is what happened in the Alexander case, and it compromised her right to due process simply because the risk was too great to chance a conviction at trial. Minimum mandatory laws are politically popular with ""tough-on-crime"" advocates. But the ""tough-on-crime"" flag waving that makes for great talking points during an election ignores the day-to-day difficult realities judges and defense attorneys face, as well as the effect it has on the lives of the people who get caught in the system. This is not a call to go light on crime; this a call to be reasonable about sentencing. We can keep our tough sentencing guidelines, but we need to let our judges be judges. We need to eliminate minimum mandatory sentencing laws.","Minimal mandatory sentencing laws demand harsh punishment regardless of the facts of a case .

"Born on safari in Zambia (then Northern Rhodesia) in 1942, Geoffrey Kent developed a taste for adventure at an early age. He co-founded luxury exploration company Abercrombie & Kent in 1962, taking small groups of travelers into Kenya with comforts once reserved only for royalty. Proper linens! Caviar! With his expedition company marking its 50th anniversary this year, Kent now oversees premium excursions to more than 100 countries. In a spirited interview with CNN Travel, the 70-year-old adventurer reviews his career, casts an eye toward future adventure and shares remarkable photos from his personal collection. CNN: Can you recall the first safari you ran in Kenya in 1962? Kent: It was a monthlong safari with my father for a lovely couple, a husband and wife. We started in Kenya and drove to Uganda, stopping at Queen Elizabeth Park and Murchison Falls, then crossed into the Congo where we saw pygmies. I remember we even went water skiing on Lake Kivu, which has no crocodiles. The area was called the ""Switzerland of Africa"" because it was so beautiful. CNN: What were the moveable camps like back then? Kent: The original Manyara tents had poles in the middle for support and tarpaulins on the ground. Setting them up took a long time, since there might be a hundred poles. We eventually color-coded them to simplify the process -- red meets red, yellow meets yellow. The beds were low cots, just a few inches off the ground, with mosquito netting draped over them. We used paraffin lamps for light at night. In the morning a basin of hot water would be set out on a small table just outside the entrance of your tent so you could shave and wash. One toilet for the entire camp would be located about 10 meters away. It was simply a toilet seat mounted on a box over a pit lined with lime. When choosing a place to set up camp, the most important thing was to find a ""shower tree."" You needed a sturdy branch at just the right height to hang a 10-liter canvas bucket for showers. This was especially important to the ladies. CNN: You encouraged portable iceboxes so guests could enjoy sundowners on safari. What other luxuries did you bring to the safari? Kent: Champagne, caviar, smoked salmon. CNN: What sort of guests did you attract back then? Kent: Our clients are experience seekers: educated, active, accomplished professionals and entrepreneurs with an intense curiosity about the world. But when we started, traveling to Africa was something only the wealthiest could afford. CNN: Scariest safari experience? Kent: I was with Richard Burton in Kenya. We had just sat down for sundowners and I walked over to the mess tent to refresh his drink. I heard a roar behind me and a lot of screaming and turned to see four lions bringing down a buffalo in our campfire! I quickly upended the table, sending the crystal and china flying, and gathered the guests behind it as a barricade. What an amazing spectacle to watch! The next day Burton wanted to know if we could do it again. He thought I planned the whole thing. CNN: How has Kenya changed since that first safari? Kent: When I was growing up, Kenya was very much the wide open spaces you see in ""Out of Africa."" The Masai Mara and Lewa Conservancy still offer that same sense of space, but the growing population means that farms are encroaching on the land surrounding the game reserves. And traffic in Nairobi rivals the most congested cities in the West. CNN: How does a Kenyan safari compare to ones in other African nations? Kent: East Africa and Southern Africa offer different safari experiences. Traditionally, the migration has made East Africa the must-see destination for first-time safari goers. But in recent years, the world-class hotels and restaurants in South Africa have been attracting guests who want a holiday that combines game viewing with gourmet food, interesting local wines and romantic accommodations. East Africa remains the most popular safari destination. The large numbers of herd animals -- wildebeest, zebra, antelope -- and the drama of the migration attract many visitors to Kenya and Tanzania -- but in places like the Ngorongoro Crater you are likely to see many other vehicles during a game drive. If travelers are looking for a more traditional ""Out of Africa"" experience, I recommend our Hemingway-style mobile-tented camps. South Africa is a more developed safari destination with cosmopolitan cities, world-class hotels and fine restaurants. In national parks like Kruger or Sabi Sands, guests are likely to see vehicles from many different safari lodges, so for those seeking solitude, choose lodges that offer game drives on adjacent private lands. CNN: We've had good luck in Botswana. Kent: Botswana limits the numbers of safari-goers. We recommend the exclusive Mombo Concession in the Moremi Game Reserve -- it's considered the predator capital of Africa, with lions, leopards, cheetah, painted dogs, hyenas and jackals along with elephants, giraffe, zebra, wildebeest and impala. Here, you find small luxury tented camps with game viewing in open vehicles and the rare opportunity for walking safaris and night game drives. Though relatively unknown outside Africa, Zambia offers a diverse range of environments with prolific wildlife. Walking safaris were pioneered here; if you have only seen animals from inside a vehicle, you will find walking with big game a thrilling experience. Night drives are also a specialty, and the best means of seeing some of the more elusive nocturnal species, including leopards. CNN: Most memorable encounter with wildlife? Kent: I was studying elephants with Iain Douglas-Hamilton on the shores of Lake Manyara in Tanzania. He wanted to introduce me to a new matriarch he had found named Boadicea. She charged us and picked up our Land Rover with her tusks and pushed us nine or 10 meters along the ground! CNN: Favorite place? Kent: The Galapagos Islands would be at the top of my list. I love to be active and there you can swim, snorkel and scuba dive with sea lions and turtles and stroll through colonies of penguins and blue-footed boobies -- they have no fear of humans. But I also love Zambia, where I was born while my parents were on safari. CNN: Is there a country you don't operate in that's on your radar? Kent: We don't operate in Syria yet, but it has so much history with incredible archaeological sites. I was also hoping to take people to see the bonobo chimpanzees in the Congo, but that's on hold for the moment. CNN: What will the African safari experience be like in 20 or 30 years? Kent: There will always be African safaris. Enlightened countries like Botswana and Zambia understand the importance of sustainable tourism and are protecting their wilderness and wildlife. Both are rich in natural resources and have small populations relative to their size.","Luxury travel company Abercrombie & Kent turns 50 in 2013 .

"Alex Rodriguez is denying any connection to a Miami man who a South Florida newspaper and ESPN reported provided the New York Yankees star with performance-enhancing drugs. The Miami New Times published a story Tuesday saying more than a dozen professional baseball players, including Rodriguez, and other athletes were named in records kept over several years by the Biogenesis clinic. ""The purported documents referenced in the story -- at least as they relate to Alex Rodriguez -- are not legitimate,"" a statement from his public relations agent said. CNN has been unable to independently obtain the documents the newspaper said it based its reporting on. Meanwhile, ESPN.com published a story Friday quoting unidentified sources as describing how the man who ran Biogenesis allegedly would go to Rodriguez's waterfront mansion when summoned and inject the star player with performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). That brought this response from a Rodriguez spokesman: ""In regards to the new allegations made in today's ESPN Outside the Lines story, we can say that they are not true,"" Terry Fahn of Sitrick and Company communications said Friday. ""Alex is working diligently on his (physical) rehabilitation and is looking forward to getting back on the field as soon as possible."" Major League Baseball expands testing for HGH, testosterone . Rodriguez, 37, has admitted in the past to using performance-enhancing drugs, but he also has denied taking any after 2003. He has never been suspended by the league for a drug violation. The Miami New Times report identified other players in addition to Rodriguez as being named in handwritten notes of Anthony Bosch, chief of the Biogenesis clinic. The records, according to the report, detail the selling of banned supplements such as human growth hormone, testosterone and anabolic steroids. Major League Baseball released a statement following the newspaper report, acknowledging ""that three of the players allegedly involved have already been disciplined under the Joint Drug Program."" While the league did not list which of the previously disciplined players it was referencing, the newspaper report did name Oakland A's pitcher Bartolo Colon, San Francisco Giants outfielder Melky Cabrera and San Diego Padres catcher Yasmani Grandal.  All three served suspensions for violations of baseball's performance enhancing drug rules last year. Washington Nationals pitcher Gio Gonzalez, also named by the paper, posted a response on his Twitter account Tuesday morning. ""I've never used performance enhancing drugs of any kind and I never will,"" Gonzalez tweeted. ""I've never met or spoken with Tony Bosch or used any substance."" A statement from Rodriguez's representatives followed the Miami New Times report, declaring, ""The news report about a purported relationship between Alex Rodriguez and Anthony Bosch are not true ... Alex Rodriguez was not Mr. Bosch's patient, he was never treated by him and he was never advised by him."" The newspaper said its article was mostly based on handwritten notes believed to have been kept by Bosch. The notebooks were give to the paper by a former employee of the clinic, which recently closed. ESPN's report Friday focused on Rodriguez and what unidentified sources described as a personal relationship between the player and Bosch. Baseball writers balk at Hall of Fame class of '13 . ""Only Tony handled A-Rod,"" one source was quoted as saying. The ESPN report recounted a purported scenario in which Bosch would make visits to Rodriguez's home ""every few weeks."" On one occasion last spring, an ESPN source said, Bosch told his associates he had been kicked out of Rodriguez's home after he had trouble locating a vein and the player became infuriated. ESPN quoted Bosch as terming the allegations against him ""bull----"" and ""all wrong,"" and cited a statement from his attorney in which Bosch denied the allegations. Major League Baseball, meanwhile, said after the initial newspaper report, ""We are always extremely disappointed to learn of potential links between players and the use of performance-enhancing substances ... These developments, however, provide evidence of the comprehensive nature of our anti-drug efforts."" The league said its investigations department was ""actively involved in the issues in South Florida."" ""We are in the midst of an active investigation and are gathering and reviewing information,"" the league said.  ""We will refrain from further comment until this process is complete."" Contacted by CNN Friday and asked whether the organization had a response to the ESPN story, MLB spokesman Patrick Courtney responded, ""There is not. We issued a statement on Tuesday saying we are investigating. This would fall into that. Thank you.""

"Rock Hill, South Carolina (CNN)A South Carolina judge on Wednesday threw out the convictions of the Friendship Nine, who were jailed in 1961 after a sit-in protest in Rock Hill, South Carolina, during the civil rights movement. ""Today is a victory in race relations in America,"" said Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., said in a news conference following the ruling. ""It is a new day."" The prosecutor who pushed for this momentous day, 16th Circuit Solicitor Kevin Brackett of Rock Hill, cited King's father when explaining to CNN on Tuesday why he was motivated to take up the cause of the Friendship Nine: ""The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice."" How Friendship Nine ended up back in court . The proceedings began at the Rock Hill Law Center with Municipal Judge Jane Pittman Modla reading from the original court record for each of the men. She asked each of the seven men in attendance -- one has since died, while another had transportation issues -- to stand as their names were called. ""Offense: trespassing. Disposition: guilty. Sentence: $100 or 30 days. Condition: sent to the chain gang,"" she said for each of them, reading from the 1961 docket. Retired state Supreme Court Justice Ernest Finney, who was the men's defense attorney in 1961, entered the motion to have the sentences tossed out. The 83-year-old required help standing and propped himself on the table in front of him as he spoke. ""May it please the court, today I'm honored and proud to move this honorable court to vacate the conviction of my clients. These courageous and determined South Carolinians have shown by their conduct and their faith that the relief that they seek should be granted. I move for the convictions entered in 1961 to be vacated."" Brackett joked that he would probably be best served letting Finney's moving argument stand, but he was compelled to say why he agreed with him. One of the reasons is that the Friendship Nine deserved a ""heartfelt apology,"" which Brackett delivered on behalf of the state. He went on to say, ""The record is abundantly clear: There's only one reason these men were arrested. There was only one reason that they were charged and convicted for trespassing, and that is because they were black. This could not happen today. It was wrong then. It was wrong today. These convictions, if they are allowed to stand, would be an offense to justice, and they must be vacated."" Brackett closed by calling the men ""my heroes"" and extended his appreciation for their bravery: ""Our community here and our country is a better place because of what y'all did. ... It's a better place for me, and it's a better place for my daughter, and for that, I owe you my thanks."" When Circuit Court Judge John C. Hayes III, the nephew of the judge who sentenced these largely unsung civil rights heroes almost 5½ decades ago, announced that the convictions and sentences were officially vacated, the 250 people in the courtroom broke into a 20-second standing ovation. Another 250 spectators looked on in two overflow rooms within the courthouse. Many of those in attendance were old enough to have lived through the civil rights movement. Prior to the proceedings, Rock Hill Mayor Doug Echols told the crowd that the actions of the Friendship Nine that day ""is what courage looks like when good people step forward to lead."" Leaning on a quote from Robert F. Kennedy, who was attorney general at the time of the protests and arrests, Echols said, ""Few of us will have the greatness to be in history, as the Friendship Nine have done, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events within our own actions and, by example, touch the lives of others so that in the total of all of those acts, it will be confirmed and recorded that justice is for all people, and that injustice must not be tolerated in any place at any time."" The men, named after the Rock Hill, South Carolina, college that eight of them attended, were looking to make a statement about the plight of the segregated South. And that's just what they did. Lunch-counter protests had become the cause célèbre the year before, in 1960, just two hours up the road in Greensboro, North Carolina. African-Americans, many of them students, sought to break the barrier of segregated lunch counters by sitting in ""white-only"" sections. On the morning of January 31, 1961, just after 11 a.m., the Friendship Nine arrived at McCrory's 5-10-25 Cent Variety Store in downtown Rock Hill. They took their seat at the lunch counter and were promptly arrested for trespassing by police who had caught wind of the men's plan and were already at the store waiting for them. As the lunch-counter sit-ins spread from Greensboro to other parts of the South, protesters were arrested and charged. Civil rights groups had to pay the mounting bails and fines that the protesters were incurring. The men of Friendship College wondered whether paying fines and bail -- to the very people who were oppressing them, no less -- was the best course of action. Rather than pay the $100 for their release, the men felt they could make a more profound statement by accepting the full punishment for trespassing: 30 days of hard labor. The strategy, known as ""jail, no bail,"" would become a popular strategy in the civil rights movement .","Solicitor calls Friendship 9 ""my heroes"" and thanks them for bravery .

Behind this success stands Maithili Ahluwalia, a former strategy consultant-turned-fashion-entrepreneur, who after a stint in a New York firm decided to return to her native Mumbai and follow her passion for design. ""I was working in the corporate world for three years trying to impress my father... but I soon realized that it wasn't my calling,"" says Ahluwalia.

Ahluwalia, who was raised in Mumbai but went to school in Singapore and university in the U.S., wanted to blend her international sensibility with the best of India's design. ""I encourage my customers when they buy a piece from Bungalow Eight to actually buy a certain way of looking at the world,"" she explains. ""A way that encourages you to stick your neck out to be different, and to wear a piece of India proudly,"" she adds. Last year, the 37-year-old entrepreneur was included in the Business of Fashion 500, a list people who are shaping the global fashion industry. She quotes her mother, a jewelery designer, as a major influence on her style and life. ""She taught me that fashion isn't just the clothes you wear, it's about a world view, the kinds of books you read, the kind of food you want to eat, and about choosing a certain way of living,"" she says. Ahluwalia doesn't regret the years she spent fine tuning commercial sense, and says they served her well when she set up her own enterprise: ""I think it gave me critical business tools, and even though I don't think that I realized the value of them back then, I think today I really appreciate it.""","Maithili Ahluwalia is the founder of Bungalow Eight, a Mumbai fashion and design concept store .

"David Axelrod is a smart guy who knows a heck of a lot about politics and the press. Robert Gibbs is also a smart guy who knows a heck of a lot about politics and the press. They will now be dispensing their wisdom as paid contributors at MSNBC, and I'll be interested in what they have to say. But I have to ask: Is NBC's cable channel turning into an Obama administration in exile? It's hardly a news flash that MSNBC long ago decided to be cable's liberal bastion, a left-wing counterweight to Fox News. But the more the studios are populated with people who worked for the president, the more the network may seem like an off-campus adjunct of the West Wing. To be sure, MSNBC was already packed with former Democratic presidential candidates, from Al Sharpton to Howard Dean. Former party chairman and Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell has also become a fixture, as well as former party spokeswoman Karen Finney. Watch: Should Fox News have hired tarnished candidate Herman Cain? But now that the president is into his second term, there is a growing band of alumni available for pundit duty. Jared Bernstein went from Joe Biden's chief economist to MSNBC talking head. Now the former senior adviser and former press secretary will be holding forth on their former boss. Occasionally, the liberals on MSNBC criticize Obama from the left. The network's few conservative commentators, such as former Republican Party chairman Michael Steele, take aim from the right. But isn't that going to be considerably harder for Axelrod and Gibbs, who have devoted their lives to this president? Gibbs tells me he sees his job ""as a political analyst and as someone who has been in the room during important meetings and when big decisions are made who can convey what that's like to viewers. I don't see it either as being a cheerleader for the president or as a spokesman for the administration's point of view."" Watch: Mark Sanford launches post-affair forgiveness tour . ""I will be honest with my opinions and when I believe the White House has made a mistake I will say so. I'm sure no one in the White House thought my comments on Chuck Hagel's confirmation hearing were necessarily pro-Obama."" Axelrod also sees himself taking a different approach: ""My role is not that of a surrogate, but an analyst and commentator.  I'm proud of my work for and with the president. But in this role, I will offer observations, based on my experience over 35 years in journalism and politics, and will call them as I see them."" He added: ""I'd also note that NBC and MSNBC have, on their roster of analysts, both Republicans and Democrats."" MSNBC didn't invent this practice; Fox News is the model. For a while, it served as the Bush administration in exile, with such loyalists as Karl Rove, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton and ex-press secretary Dana Perino. Fox also provided Bush with a spokesman when the late Tony Snow made the jump from Roger Ailes' network to the White House. The Fox payroll was soon packed with potential 2012 contenders like Sarah Palin, Mike Huckabee, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, with the latter two jumping from Rupert Murdoch's team into the presidential primaries. There is no question that the high-profile platform gave them a boost. Now, Herman Cain, who left the race under a cloud after denying allegations of sexual harassment and an extramarital affair, has joined the Fox team. In his first outing the other night, Cain said 51% of Americans were ""misled"" into voting for Obama, prompting a dissent from Bill O'Reilly. Is this the kind of unvarnished analysis we can expect from Cain? Watch: Obama, Biden learn pitfalls of Google and Facebook chat . CNN is not exempt from this game, having provided a home for Pat Buchanan between his presidential runs and, later, hiring Bush 41 lieutenants John Sununu and Mary Matalin, Clinton alumni Paul Begala and James Carville, and W.'s press secretary, Ari Fleischer. The network also got into the disgraced ex-governor business through its ill-fated fling with Eliot Spitzer. But CNN, at least, makes a point of tapping partisans from both sides. (ABC, for its part, brought in George Stephanopoulos from the Clinton White House, and he gradually earned credibility in his new profession.) When networks employ active partisans such as Rove, who raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for GOP candidates in 2012 and has now launched a new super PAC, it's fair for viewers to wonder whether their commentary is subjugated to an agenda. That was the question with Dick Morris, who was recently dumped by Fox after acknowledging that his predictions of a big Mitt Romney victory were in part an effort to boost Republican morale.

"Royal Dutch Shell says it will ""pause"" its closely watched project to drill for oil off the Alaskan coast this year, instead spending 2013 preparing for future exploration. The company began work in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas in the remote Arctic this summer. The project caused widespread concern among environmentalists and suffered some high-profile snags, including the grounding of a drill barge that was being towed back to the Lower 48. ""Alaska remains an area with high potential for Shell over the long term, and the company is committed to drill there again in the future,"" a corporate statement issued Wednesday afternoon declared. But Shell said it would take time off this year ""to prepare equipment and plans for a resumption of activity at a later stage."" Shell began preparatory drilling on two wells in September and October. Before the work began, the drill ship Noble Discoverer slipped its mooring and drifted toward shore in the Aleutian Islands, though it remained afloat. Then on New Year's Eve, the drill barge Kulluk had to be cut loose in a severe storm while being towed back to its winter home port in Seattle. It ran aground on an uninhabited island about 200 miles south of Anchorage and was stuck there for a week before being refloated. Shell said both vessels are now being towed to Asia for maintenance and repairs. The incidents sharpened concerns about Shell's plans to drill in the Arctic, both among environmentalists and in native Alaskan communities. The World Wildlife Fund, a leading environmental group, called Shell's decision wise under the circumstances. ""Throughout the 2012 season, Shell's experience proved time and time again the inherent difficulties in meeting challenging Arctic conditions and the safety standards required by the federal government,"" Margaret Williams, the group's managing director for the region, said in a written statement. The company's decision ""should be heeded by others in the industry as they re-examine their future in this inhospitable environment."" And Chuck Clusen, the Natural Resources Defense Council's director of Alaska projects, said the Obama administration should ""learn from this experience, step into the ring and end this folly once and for all -- before the next accident happens."" Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the ranking member of the Senate's energy and natural resources committee, said that she continues to support Shell's plans and that the suspension was evidence of the company's commitment to safety. ""I have always said that it must be done to the highest safety standards,"" the Alaska Republican said. ""This pause -- and it is only a pause in a multi-year drilling program that will ultimately provide great benefits both to the state of Alaska and the nation as a whole -- is necessary for Shell to repair its ships and make the necessary updates to its exploration plans that will ensure a safe return to exploration soon."" The plans were held up after BP's 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell says it's working at far less depth and lower pressures than the BP well that erupted nearly a mile beneath the Gulf, killing 11 men on board a rig and unleashing an undersea gusher that took three months to cap. ""Alaska holds important energy resources,"" the company said Wednesday. ""At the same time, securing access to those resources requires special expertise, technology and an in-depth understanding of the environmental and societal sensitivities unique to the region."" The U.S. Geological Survey estimates more than 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas may be recoverable by drilling in the North Slope area. Shrinking of the region's sea ice -- which hit record lows in 2012 -- has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region. ""The causes of last year's mishaps must be remedied so they do not occur in the future,"" Marilyn Heiman, director of the Pew Charitable Trusts' Arctic program, said in an e-mail. She called on the federal government and oil companies to meet with environmental groups to ""develop world-class industry standards and ecological and cultural protections to safeguard the Arctic."" Climate researchers say that a decrease in sea ice is a symptom of a warming climate, caused largely by the combustion of carbon-rich fossil fuels. The research is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most scientists.","One environmental group says company should ""end this folly""

"Lebanese women are taking to the streets to demand that the government takes domestic violence seriously, by introducing laws to protect women from abusive partners. Nadine Mouwad, a founder of feminist collective Nasawiya, says the prevalence of unveiled, glamorous women in Beirut can create the impression that Lebanon is more liberated from patriarchal cultural attitudes than neighboring countries. But that's merely an illusion, she says. ""The problem is that we are sold a lot of fake freedoms that raise Lebanese women under the impression that they have freedom to go anywhere, freedom to dress the way they want to,"" she said. For the past year and a half, Mouwad and fellow feminist activists have been demanding that politicians ignore the objections of Muslim religious authorities and pass a stalled law protecting women from domestic violence. A draft version of the Law to Protect Women from Family Violence was approved by Lebanon's Cabinet in 2010, but has since become bogged down in parliament, mainly due to the objections of Sunni and Shia authorities. The initial version of the bill was drafted to criminalize physical and sexual abuse, so-called ""honor crimes"" and marital rape, create specially-trained domestic violence response units within the police, and provide the legal framework for restraining orders to be issued against abusers. Read also: Not all colors welcomed in Lebanon's cultural tapestry . But Lebanon's religious courts -- the judicial authorities presiding over each of the country's faith communities, with jurisdiction over matters of ""personal status,"" including marriage problems -- have criticized the proposed law as an attempt to erode their authority. Dar al-Fatwa, Lebanon's top Sunni authority, and the Higher Shi'a Islamic Council both said that they opposed the draft on the basis that Sharia law protected the status of women, and should remain the basis for governing legal issues related to Muslim families. Domestic violence cases in Lebanon are typically heard in the religious courts, which often respond with rulings focused on preserving the family unit, rather protecting women from violence. It's a response that abused women are usually met with from police as well, says Lebanese lawyer Amer Badreddine. ""They are told to solve the problem amicably, to keep it a family issue and not cause embarrassment to themselves by bringing it to the police,"" said Badreddine, who specializes in domestic violence cases. He said the law also failed to recognize marital rape as a crime -- a position that some Muslim judges argue should be upheld. Criminalizing marital rape ""could lead to the imprisonment of the man,"" Sheik Ahmad Al-Kurdi, a judge in the Sunni religious court, told CNN, ""where in reality he is exercising the least of his marital rights."" Read also: A Palestinian farmer's journey to the Oscars . With little protection from authorities, Lebanese women in abusive marriages must also often contend with the disapproval of their families if they seek to escape their predicament. One Lebanese mother-of-three told CNN of being beaten by her husband from the time she was pregnant with their first child. Shortly after the child was born, he broke her nose and she resolved to divorce him. But her parents were mortified about what people would think, and said she would have to give up her son if she left. She returned to the marital home where the abuse continued, including her husband forcing himself on her. ""He used to make me pregnant, thinking that as long as I was having kids he would make me stay,"" she said. She feared he would kill her. But eventually, with the help of a Kafa (""Enough"") -- an NGO tackling violence and exploitation of women and children -- she was able to divorce her husband and retain custody of her children. Such an outcome is rare for abused women in Lebanon -- a situation that was now unlikely to be remedied by the passing of the domestic violence bill, says Mouwad. Her organization heard of about 15 cases a year of Lebanese women murdered by their domestic partners, she said. Mouwad said the draft bill had been watered down with so many amendments due to objections by religious conservatives, that it was virtually useless. She said she would ultimately prefer not to see it pass. ""If it passes the way it is, it's going to be disastrous and counterproductive,"" she said.","A law to protect women from domestic violence in Lebanon has stalled in parliament .

"The first official portrait of Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, has been unveiled at London's National Portrait Gallery -- but has met with a mixed reaction from art critics and the public. Award-winning artist Paul Emsley, who spent three-and-a-half months painting the Duchess's likeness, said he had tried to portray her warmth and personality in the picture. ""The Duchess explained that she would like to be portrayed naturally -- her natural self -- as opposed to her official self,"" he said in a video posted on the gallery's website. Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announce royal due date . ""She struck me as enormously open and generous and a very warm person, so after initially feeling it was going to be an unsmiling portrait I think it was the right choice in the end to have her smiling - that is really who she is."" Both Catherine, who is expecting her first baby, and her husband Prince William, are said to be pleased with the finished painting, with the Duchess reportedly telling Emsley at a private viewing on Friday that it is ""amazing... brilliant."" Duchess attends first event since pregnancy . However, reaction from art critics and the public has been more mixed, with many taking to social media, including Twitter, to share their thoughts, claiming the picture is unflattering and ages the Duchess beyond her years. Writing in the UK's Guardian newspaper, Charlotte Higgins claimed the painting transformed ""a pretty young woman... into something unpleasant from the 'Twilight' franchise."" In the Independent, art critic Michael Glover wrote that the portrait was ""catastrophic,"" combining ""hamsterish"" cheeks and ""hair whose featheriness has been borrowed from an advert for shampoo.""

"Air pollution in China has gotten so bad lately that one environmentalist's wacky idea for a solution doesn't seem all that far-fetched: putting clean air in a can. Last week, when a thick gray haze blanketed Beijing and several other Chinese cities, sending kids to the hospital, grounding planes and causing the government to order cars off the road, Chen Guangbiao took to the streets in Beijing to hand out yellow and green cans of smog-free, non-carcinogenic air. ""Free fresh air. Open it and drink it and breathe it!"" the Guardian quoted the multimillionaire and national celeb as saying. ""It keeps you fresh the whole day!"" Ego aside (the bright cans feature an image of Chen's face and the words ""Chen Guangbiao is a good man"" on them), the clever political stunt is just the sort of thing that China needs these days. Such creative and public protests should help push forward much-needed national reforms to combat air pollution in the country. A ""Clean Air Act"" for China is long overdue. And the recent ""air-pocalypse,"" as the suffocating air pollution that hung over several Chinese cities in January has been termed, should be more than enough proof of that. The pollution during the 2013 Great Smog of China was so thick last month that it was visible from space (from space!). Breathing in Beijing was ""akin to living in a smoking lounge,"" according to an analysis from Bloomberg. Air quality readings literally were off the charts. An index reading below about 50 is considered healthy. Readings for Beijing in January hit 500, the top of the index, and went higher than 700, according to the U.S. Embassy. ""The air has this kind of greenish-gray pallor to it. And it smells like you're standing next to a chemical plant, really chlorine-y,"" said David Pettit, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. ""It's an awesomely bad smell."" He was telling me about Beijing air on a normal day. ""I'm standing outside my office building but am unable to see its top,"" one Beijing resident said, according to China's state news agency, Xinhua. ""The new normal in Beijing is sending your kids to school wearing gas masks,"" Christina Larson wrote in Bloomberg Businessweek. Fixing China's air pollution is not just about the country's image or economy, although those certainly suffer because of smog, too. It's about the right of all humans to walk outside and breathe in air that won't choke them or make them sick. The AFP reports hospital visits for respiratory problems were up 20% during the air-pocalypse. Last year, small particle air pollution, called PM2.5, in four major Chinese cities resulted in 8,572 premature deaths, according to a December study by Greenpeace East Asia and Peking University's School of Public Health. Similar deaths can and should be prevented. And I'm optimistic they will be. For several reasons. The first is history. It wasn't all that long ago, in 1952, that the ""Great Smog"" covered London in gray, sooty pollution, resulting in an estimated 4,000 premature deaths. The government reacted by passing sweeping reforms. Now London is known for its real fog, not smog. Air pollution in Los Angeles was handled in a similar fashion. After the city's car culture created a smog problem, scientists started researching protective helmets to protect people. Others wore gas masks. But, eventually the government took action to reduce the pollution. California led the way for the nation, and in 1963, the United States passed the Clean Air Act. That law is credited with preventing 205,000 premature deaths, 843,000 asthma attacks and 18 million child respiratory illnesses in 1990, based on the first 20 years of the law. These changes took time. And it's unfortunate that things had to get bad before they could get better. But China, like others, is finally realizing that its air really is that bad. Its own people are calling for the change and more vigorously than before. More than 200 students at a Beijing high school school signed a petition asking the city to ""amend air quality regulations and take specific emergency measures,"" according to Calum MacLeod from USA Today. And on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, Pan Shiyi, a real estate magnate, called for the country to adopt its own Clean Air Act. When he posed the idea to his 14 million Weibo followers in an online poll, nearly all of the 50,000-some people who responded said they supported that type of national legislation. Maybe that's just one man's social media feed. But there's a history of this kind of thing working in China. In 2011, Pan successfully used his online network to press Beijing authorities to report more smog data, according to the Wall Street Journal's China blog. It's clear the government has taken notice this time as well. Beijing implemented several emergency measures to curb smog. State media is talking about the pollution. After speaking with a few experts, it seems clear what needs to be done: China has to reduce its reliance on coal, increase renewable energy, regulate the amount of smog-causing sulfur that can go into its diesel fuel and increase vehicle efficiency. ""It's not rocket science,"" said the Natural Resources Defense Council's Pettit. There will, of course, be costs and significant challenges. China burns ""nearly as much coal as the rest of the world combined,"" according to a recent report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Beijing catches so much of the pollution from coal-burning power plants because it sits at the center of a ring of mountains, which help trap the smog. Throw a bunch more cars into the mix, 13 million of them were sold in China last year, according to IHS Automotive and the problems start compounding. Fixes may be expensive, but the United States has made the compelling case that the costs of enforcing clean air regulations are offset by gains in health and worker productivity. China, which does have some air quality regulations, already seems to be realizing this. The country on Wednesday announced stricter fuel standards that go into effect by the end of 2014 for diesel and 2017 for gas, according to the Financial Times. An environmental official, Wu Xiaoqing, also told state media this week that ""China will formulate regulations, standards and policies to reduce air pollutants and control coal burning."" The energy industry estimates it will costs billions for China to meet tougher fuel standards. It may be up to people like artist Ai Weiwei, who posed in a photo wearing a gas mask, and Chen, the man who's peddling cans of clean air, to ensure that the public and the government see that clean air is worth the cost. ""I want to tell mayors, county chiefs and heads of big companies: Don't just chase GDP growth, don't chase the biggest profits at the expense of our children and grandchildren, and at the cost of sacrificing our ecological environment,"" Chen told Reuters. If Chinese leaders don't want to drink air from a can, they should listen.","This year has been one of the worst for air quality in China .

"The U.S. Department of Education has opened an investigation into the handling of sexual assault cases at the University of North Carolina at the request of current and former students, and a former administrator who say the university has long turned a blind eye to such allegations. ""We love UNC,"" said Annie Clark, the lead complainant. ""We're not trying to vilify the university, we're just trying to make it better."" Clark and other students named in this report agreed to be identified by CNN, which does not typically identify the victims of sexual assault. The investigation comes amid outrage on campus and nationwide over intimidation charges filed in the Chapel Hill, North Carolina, school's student-run honor court against one of the women involved in the complaint. Investigators from the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights will look into the women's allegations that school administrators brushed aside concerns about sexual violence on campus and failed to adequately investigate complaints of sexual assault, according to a March 1 letter sent to Clark by the agency. In a separate complaint filed with the Education Department, the women say the school also violated federal laws requiring universities to fully disclose crimes on campus. In an e-mailed statement, a UNC spokeswoman said the school would cooperate with the investigation. School administrators have disputed the cavalier attitude toward sexual assault alleged by the students, noting that UNC has removed sexual violence cases from the list of concerns handled by the school's student-run honor court and appointed an administrator to deal directly with victims. ""The university cares deeply about all of its students and is committed to providing policies and procedures that are fair for everyone, especially about an issue that is as difficult and often involves strong opinions on both sides like sexual assault,"" UNC spokeswoman Karen Moon said in an e-mailed statement. Clark began researching sexual assault issues on campus when she realized there was no clear reporting system for sexual violence at the school after she said she was assaulted in 2007. Clark said she did not know her rapist and she did not report the incident to police. ""I went to one administrator, and she told me, 'Rape is like football. And if you look back in the game, would you have done anything differently,'"" Clark said. Three other students, all of whom said they also had been sexually assaulted, joined the complaint, as did an assistant dean for students, Melinda Manning, who resigned in December. As they investigated, Clark said they found example after example of the school failing to properly address sexual assault. ""The university not only had knowledge of actual violations, but they acted with that knowledge to sweep violations under the rug,"" she said. The tension over sexual violence claims at UNC was most recently on display in February, when it became public that honor court charges were being pressed against one of the complainants, Landen Gambill. The court's student prosecutors had earlier declined to proceed with a case alleging honor code violations by Gambill's ex-boyfriend, whom she had accused of rape. Gambill did not file a sexual assault report with police, and Gambill's ex-boyfriend -- who has not been identified publicly -- has denied her accusation, according to his attorney, John Gresham. The man then asked the court to consider intimidation charges against Gambill, saying her accusations had negatively changed perceptions of him on campus and was making life difficult for him at school. In a statement last month, UNC Chancellor Holden Thorp said school officials had not encouraged the man to file a case against Gambill. ""This university works hard to encourage students to come forward and report instances of sexual violence,"" Thorp said in the statement. ""No student has ever been disciplined for reporting a sexual assault or any honor code violation. Further, no university administrator filed or encouraged the filing of charges in this case; there is no retaliation by the university."" Since the controversy burst into the open, the school has changed its policies to take sexual assault cases out of the honor court's jurisdiction and has hired an administrator to be the primary contact for sexual assault victims on campus. It's unclear how long the Education Department investigation might take, but Clark said she and the other students expect a ""long, difficult, grueling experience."" ""But it will all be worth it in the long run,"" she said. Another of the complainants, Andrea Pino, said she hopes the case will spark a change in how all schools respond to complaints of sexual violence among students. ""I hope that this will serve as a wake-up call to not just UNC, but universities across the country,"" she said. ""The time has come for all survivors of sexual violence to demand change and justice.""","Students say the University of North Carolina sweeps sex assault claims under the rug .

"Five years after he resigned as Pakistan's president and left the South Asian nation, Pervez Musharraf will return to the country intent on leading his party in upcoming elections, he announced Saturday. Musharraf plans to fly on a commercial airline into Karachi on March 24, then attend a rally attended by 50,000 people including more than 200 Pakistani expatriates from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates, he said in a statement. He plans to lead his political party into Pakistan's general elections, which are slated for May. Whether the rest of Pakistan welcomes him back, including the authorities now heading the country, remains to be seen. In 1999, the then chief of Pakistan's army became its president in a bloodless military coup. He remained in power until resigning in 2008 -- a period that included the U.S.-led invasion of neighborhood Afghanistan, starting a sweeping international war on terror -- then went into self-imposed exile in London and Dubai. A few months before he left office, Benazir Bhutto -- who served two stints, in the late 1980s and 1990s, as Pakistan's first elected female prime minister -- was killed in a gun-suicide bomb attack as she was wrapping up a campaign rally in Rawalpindi. This attack, coming two months after she survived an assassination attempt in Karachi, fueled criticism that Musharraf had not done enough to protect Bhutto's life despite numerous threats. The former military ruler has denied having anything to do with Bhutto's killing. He's been targeted by Pakistan authorities, who in August 2012 confiscated his property and froze his bank account. A politician and prosecutor, according to media reports, have said Musharraf will be arrested as soon as he steps foot in Pakistan.","Pervez Musharraf says he'll fly to Karachi on March 24 to lead his party in elections .

"A final meeting with the president. A farewell address to the State Department staff. A terrorist attack at the U.S. Embassy in Turkey. Hillary Clinton's last day as secretary of state on Friday seemed to be a microcosm of her four globe-trotting years as America's top diplomat. The former first lady had a full schedule, as usual, meeting in private with President Barack Obama at the White House and then attending the send-off ceremony with clapping, cheering workers at the agency she led. Those events were clouded by a suicide bombing earlier in the day in Ankara that killed the attacker and a Turkish security guard at the embassy. No Americans were killed or injured. Clinton traveled nearly 1 million miles and visited 112 countries in her quest as secretary to promote better understanding of the United States and its role in the world. On the road with Hillary Clinton . However, her tenure will also be remembered for last September's attack on a diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Amid the good wishes and emotions of Clinton's farewell, Friday's bombing in Turkey was a grim reminder of the continuing threats and challenges to U.S. diplomatic efforts. ""Of course we live in very complex and dangerous times as we saw again just today at our embassy in Ankara,"" Clinton told the State Department ceremony. ""I know the world we are trying to help bring into being in the 21st century will have many difficult days,"" she added. ""But I am more optimistic today than I was when I stood here four years ago."" Standing in front of a sign that said ""Thank You,"" Clinton told the staffers jamming the area that she would miss them and the important work they do around the world. ""I will probably be dialing ops just to talk,"" she said to laughter. Clinton sent her resignation letter to Obama a few hours before her successor, John Kerry, was sworn in on Friday afternoon. Opinion: Clinton, secretary of empowerment . ""It has been an honor to serve in your administration and to represent our country around the world,"" the letter said. ""I am proud of what we have accomplished together on behalf of the American people and in pursuit of our interests and values. And I am more convinced than ever in the strength and staying power of America's global leadership and our capacity to be a force for good around the world,"" she said. In what was billed as Clinton's farewell speech on Thursday at the Council on Foreign Relations, she said the United States needs to build ""smart power"" in a world where the levers of influence are changing rapidly. American diplomats have to work with entrepreneurs and activists, use new technological tools such as social media and update the global and regional institutions that have dominated international affairs since World War II, Clinton said. ""We need a new architecture for a new world -- more Frank Gehry than formal Greek,"" she said. ""Now some of his work at first might appear haphazard, but in fact, it's highly intentional and sophisticated. Where once a few strong columns could hold up the weight of the world, today we need a dynamic mix of materials and structures."" Clinton defends her diplomatic legacy . Clinton called the United States ""uniquely well-positioned"" to help construct that metaphorical global edifice. ""Those things that make us who we are as a nation --- our openness and innovation, our diversity, our devotion to human rights and democracy --- are beautifully matched to the demands of this era and this interdependent world,"" she said. Kerry, who served nearly 30 years in the Senate, stepped down Friday ahead of his swearing-in as the nation's 68th secretary of state. He was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Democratic nominee for president in 2004, when he lost to incumbent President George W. Bush. Kerry expects to take his first official overseas trip in coming weeks, according to a U.S. official who said stops would likely include Israel and Egypt. Exiting State, Clinton looks to writing, speaking . Clinton, 65, now faces persistent questions about whether she will mount a second White House run in 2016 to break perhaps the highest remaining glass ceiling. ""Well I'm not thinking about anything like that right now. I'm looking forward to finishing my tenure as secretary of state and catching up on 20 years of sleep deprivation,"" Clinton said Tuesday at a global ""town hall"" forum in Washington. Observers note her answer was a less emphatic denial than previous responses that seemed to rule out any possibility of reentering the political fray. According to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted last month, 85% of Democrats and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party said they would be very or somewhat likely to support Clinton if she sought the Democratic nomination. Clinton was considered a favorite in 2008, but Obama, who served with her in the Senate, got an early jump in the primaries. Clinton was unable to capture the momentum in a fierce political battle. Despite the rugged campaign, Obama chose Clinton for his Cabinet and she embraced the role. In a joint interview with CBS that aired on Sunday, Obama said that he believes Clinton's  legacy will rank among the best. ""It has been a great collaboration over the last four years,"" Obama said.

"A French hostage held in Mali has been executed by al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Mauritania's ANI news agency reported late Tuesday. The agency attributed the information to an AQIM spokesman. Six other French hostages are still being held in Mali, ANI said. The spokesman reportedly told the agency that the March 10 execution was in response to France's military intervention in Mali, and that French President Francois Hollande ""is responsible for the lives of the rest of the hostages."" Before the ANI report on Tuesday, the French foreign ministry released a statement quoting Hollande as saying there are no ""financial discussions"" ongoing to gain the release of French hostages in various countries. The ministry said it is in constant contact with the families of those being held, and that everything is being done to gain the release of French hostages. French involvement in the Malian conflict began on January 11, the day after militants said they had seized the city of Konna, east of Diabaly in central Mali, and were poised to advance south toward Bamako, the capital. Islamist extremists carved out a large haven in northern Mali last year, taking advantage of a chaotic situation after a military coup by the separatist party MNLA. The militants banned music, smoking, drinking and watching sports on television. They also destroyed historic tombs and shrines.","French foreign ministry says everything's being done to gain release of hostages .

"Attorney General Eric Holder is not entirely ruling out a scenario under which a drone strike would be ordered against Americans on U.S. soil, but says it has never been done previously and he could only see it being considered in an extraordinary circumstance. He began to winnow the list of those possible extraordinary circumstances Wednesday. In testimony Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pressed Holder whether he believed it would be constitutional to target an American terror suspect ""sitting at a cafe"" if the suspect didn't pose an imminent threat. ""No,"" Holder replied. But he also said the government has no intention of carrying out drone strikes inside the United States. Echoing what he said in a letter to U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, he called the possibility of domestic drone strikes ""entirely hypothetical."" That letter, released Tuesday, was prompted by questions raised over the nomination of John Brennan to head the CIA. Specifically, members of the Senate Intelligence Committee sought the Obama administration's legal rationale for its use of drones to kill terror suspects overseas. But Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has said he would do what he could to hold up Brennan's nomination until he got a full answer to his query, wanted to know whether the administration considered that policy applicable domestically. Holder: Drone strike against Americans in the U.S. possible . In a letter to Paul dated on Monday, Holder said it was possible, ""I suppose,"" to imagine an ""extraordinary circumstance in which it would be necessary and appropriate"" under U.S. law for the president to authorize the military to ""use lethal force"" within the United States. However, Holder said the question was ""entirely hypothetical"" and ""unlikely to occur."" The United States, he said, has not carried out such action domestically and had no plans to do so. Holder said a potential scenario might involve a president ordering such action ""to protect the homeland"" in a case like the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington or the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. But he said the administration rejects the use of military force where law enforcement authorities provide the best means for incapacitating a terrorist threat. Paul, who released the letter from Holder along with his statement, was not satisfied with the response. ""The U.S. attorney general's refusal to rule out the possibility of drone strikes on American citizens and on American soil is more than frightening. It is an affront to the constitutional due process rights of all Americans,"" Paul said. Jeffrey Toobin, CNN senior legal analyst, said on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" that Holder made it clear in his letter that he would have to examine the facts of each situation separately and advise the president on his legal authority. ""Again, he made a point of saying Sen. Rand Paul's question is hypothetical at this time. But at some point down the road, this may not be hypothetical,"" Toobin said. Brennan defended the use of drones overseas at his confirmation hearing weeks ago, but acknowledged there should be more public discussion. Read letter from Brennan to Paul . In a written response to the intelligence panel, Brennan, too, said the administration has ""no intention"" of killing Americans with drones in the United States. The issue of targeting American terror suspects with lethal force was brought into sharp focus in 2011 when New Mexico-born Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in a drone strike in Yemen. Officials said he played an operational role in al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Brennan confirmed a connection at his hearing between al-Awlaki and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to blow up a Delta Air Lines jet enroute to Detroit in 2009 with a bomb in his underwear. The Obama administration has said targeting Americans overseas with drones is only permitted when the U.S. government determines a suspect to be an imminent threat to the United States and when capture would not be feasible. Additionally, all applicable laws must apply. The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel turned over new documents on its legal rationale to the Senate intelligence panel earlier in the day. Some key members who had been pressing for the information said they were satisfied with the White House cooperation. ""We are pleased that we now have the access that we have long sought and need to conduct the vigilant oversight with which the committee has been charged. We believe that this sets an important precedent for applying our American system of checks and balances to the challenges of 21st century warfare. We look forward to reviewing and discussing these documents in the days ahead,"" Democrats Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado, and Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said in a statement. They credited Paul with raising the use of drones domestically as a question of ""fundamental importance."" The Intelligence Committee approved Brennan's nomination later Tuesday and sent it to the full Senate for consideration.

"Former NBA star Dennis Rodman declared his eternal friendship with North Korea's supreme leader Thursday. ""You have a friend for life,"" Rodman told Kim Jong Un after the two men sat next to each other watching an unusual basketball exhibition in Pyongyang, North Korea. Photos of the event, published online by Vice magazine, show Rodman and Kim Jong Un sitting at court side, surrounded by an arena filled with dark-uniformed fans. The North Korean leader, who is known to be a basketball fan, appears to be engrossed in the competition. ""To see everyone letting their hair down and getting into the match made it all the more worthwhile,"" said Vice founder Shane Smith.  ""At the reception afterward,  many kind words were spoken and invitations offered."" The game involved a combination of three stars of the Harlem Globetrotters and members of North Korea's ""Dream Team.""  The final score was a 110-110 tie. When Kim joined the American group for supper, Vice correspondent Ryan Duffy invited the leader to visit the United States. ""His invitation was met with laughter,"" according to a Vice statement. The weeklong trip by these ""basketball diplomats"" is not an official U.S. mission, but for a TV documentary production. The video will be shown in an installment of a monthly series produced by Vice for HBO. ""I come in peace. I love the people of North Korea!"" Rodman, 51, said on Twitter as he arrived in Pyongyang on Tuesday. The visit comes at a time of heightened tension between the United States and North Korea, a result of Pyongyang's pursuit of a nuclear program. Just days ago, North Korea threatened ""miserable destruction"" in response to routine military exercises planned between South Korea and the United States. North Korea provoked Western condemnation earlier this month with an underground nuclear test that was preceded by the December launch of a long-range missile capable of transporting a warhead. Could the connection between Rodman and Kim, who classmates said was a huge basketball fan as a teenager -- when Rodman was winning five NBA championships -- help cool down this international hotspot? Rodman, whose nickname is ""Worm,"" tweeted that he was ""honored to represent The United States of America."" ""I'm not a politician. Kim Jung Un & North Korean people are basketball fans. I love everyone. Period. End of story,"" he tweeted. Kim, who is believed to be about 29 years old, assumed power after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in late 2011. North Korea's official news agency KCNA reported Thursday that Rodman's delegation was taken to visit the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where past supreme leaders lie in state. ""They paid high tribute to Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il before their statues,"" KCNA reported. It was unclear whether Rodman, who is accompanied by Globetrotters Bull Bullard, Buckets Blakes and Moose Weekes, will be taken to North Korea's countryside, where aid groups say malnutrition is rampant . According to Human Rights Watch, hundreds of thousands of people remain enslaved in prison camps, which are ""notorious for horrific living conditions and abuse.""","Rodman and Kim Jong Un sit together at a basketball game .

"Washington  (CNN)House Speaker John Boehner on Wednesday confirmed House Republicans are filing a lawsuit against Obama's executive action delaying deportations for millions of immigrants here illegally. ""The President's overreach when he took executive action to deal with the immigration problems in our country, frankly, in my view, is a violation of our Constitution,"" he said in an interview on Fox News. ""This isn't about immigration,"" he said. ""This is the President violating the Constitution, violating his oath of office, and frankly, not upholding the rule of law."" Boehner had told House Republicans of the planned lawsuit during their closed-door meeting on Tuesday. The move comes as House leadership struggles to round up support for a border security bill they planned to vote on this week, in part due to conservative opposition. Conservatives have expressed frustration that leadership hasn't done enough to oppose Obama's unilateral action on immigration. Boehner insisted during the interview that the bill will ultimately pass. But while the lawsuit may help quell some of those complaints, it's unlikely to ultimately have much impact on deportations. Boehner turned to a similar tactic on Obamacare, bringing a lawsuit against the administration for delaying the employer mandate that remains stalled in court. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said the administration believes Obama was acting well within his power when he issued the order on deportations. ""House Republicans seem to be relying more and more on the courts these days to challenge the president's authority,"" Shultz said at Wednesday's daily press briefing. ""We believe that we acted within the full bounds of authority enshrined to the executive branch, and we'll be defending that."" Boehner also defended his decision to invite Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to address the House in March, without letting the White House know in advance, a move that's drawn widespread criticism from even pro-Israel groups. SEE ALSO: Obama says Netanyahu's visit is too close to election for a meeting . ""The Israeli prime minister can also talk with some expertise about the growing threat of radical Islam,"" Boehner said. ""We've got a serious problem in the world and the President just wants to act like it's going to just disappear. And so as a co-equal branch of our government, I don't have any problem at all in doing what I did to invite the prime minister to come to Congress and address those concerns."" Netanyahu is expected to lobby Congress to pass new sanctions on Iran, putting him squarely at odds with Obama. The President said during a Wednesday interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria that he hadn't heard ""a persuasive rebuttal of my argument that we crafted very effective sanctions against Iran specifically to bring them to the negotiations table."" Obama also told Zakaria that he won't be meeting with Netanyahu when he comes because ""our general policy is, we don't meet with any world leader two weeks before their election."" But Boehner said there's clear ""antipathy"" from the White House towards Netanyahu. ""They don't even try to hide it,"" he said. Boehner also said House Republicans will eventually offer an alternative to the health care reform law, and that he himself expects to remain speaker — despite facing another conservative coup attempt — for quite some time. ""I'll be here for a while,"" he said.","House Speaker John Boehner confirmed the GOP lawsuit against Obama's immigration actions .

"A court in Indonesia on Monday rejected the appeal of a 56-year-old British grandmother sentenced to death for drug trafficking on the island of Bali. A spokesman for the Denpasar High Court told CNN that it upheld the sentence handed down by the Denpasar District Court in January but gave no reasons for the decision. Prosecutors in Bali had asked for a 15-year sentence for Lindsay June Sandiford, who was arrested last May carrying what officials said was cocaine worth an estimated $2.6 million. Sandiford, from northeast England, was found to have blocks of cocaine weighing 4.7 kilograms (10.4 pounds) in her suitcase when she arrived on the island, the court heard during her original trial. Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office expressed its disappointment at Monday's decision. ""The UK strongly opposes the death penalty and has repeatedly made representations to the Indonesian government on this matter. We will continue to provide consular assistance to her at this difficult time."" The UK-based group Reprieve, which works to secure the human rights of prisoners around the world, said neither Sandiford nor her lawyer had yet been formally informed of the outcome of the appeal. The next step would be to file an appeal with the Supreme Court, Reprieve investigator Zoe Bedford said. But, she said, ""Lindsay's lawyer has exhausted all the funds which were kindly donated by the public and Lindsay's friends and family to cover his expenses for the appeal to the High Court. If her appeal has been unsuccessful, Lindsay will now need to somehow raise the funds for legal representations for an appeal to the Supreme Court."" Read more: Death penalty is what harms Bali's reputation . According to the original trial judges, the defendant showed no regret for what she did, Indonesian state news agency Antara reported. ""We were surprised by the decision, because we never expected the death penalty,"" Ezra Karo Karo, a lawyer acting for Sandiford, told Antara in January. He said the judge did not consider mitigating circumstances in his client's case, such as that she acted under the threat of violence to her family, the news agency reported. Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, has strict laws against drug trafficking. The head of Bali's Customs and Excise Agency monitoring division, Made Wijaya, warned at the time of her arrest that Sandiford could face execution if convicted. ""The main reason is because narcotics can massively endanger the young and, thus, whoever is caught with drugs should be severely punished. If three people can consume one gram of cocaine, then this operation has potentially saved up to 14,000 lives,"" he said. Reprieve has previously said Sandiford was a vulnerable person who should not have been sentenced so harshly. ""Lindsay has always maintained that she only agreed to carry the package to Bali after receiving threats against the lives of her family,"" said Harriet McCulloch of Reprieve in January. ""She is clearly not a drug kingpin -- she has no money to pay for a lawyer, for the travel costs of defense witnesses or even for essentials like food and water."" The High Court spokesman said the appeal decision was made on April 2 but still needs to be ratified by the lower court.","UK rights group Reprieve says Sandiford cannot afford to pay for a further appeal .

"Dietary supplements are commonly used to lose weight and build muscle, but the Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning regarding exposure to a potentially harmful ingredient. The FDA said in the advisory last week that it is using ""all available tools at its disposal"" to eliminate supplements containing the stimulant dimethylamylamine, or DMAA, from the market. The agency says DMAA, found in supplements including OxyElite Pro and Jack3d, can cause increased blood pressure, shortness of breath, chest tightening, cardiovascular problems and even heart attacks. It may be difficult for consumers to tell whether DMAA is an ingredient in their supplement. Different names such as methylhexanamine, 1,3 DMAA or geranium extract could be used. The FDA says it has received reports of 86 illnesses and deaths associated with supplements containing DMAA as of last week. Illnesses also included nervous system and psychiatric disorders, the agency said, and DMAA could be especially dangerous taken with caffeine. Dietary supplements with DMAA have been promoted as a natural way to enhance athletic performance and speed up weight loss. According to its website, the FDA does not currently recognize any medical use of DMAA, but it was approved for nasal decongestion in the past. Unlike with a drug ban, the FDA must go through a series of lengthy scientific and legal steps to ban compounds in dietary supplements, according to its website. Hidden dangers in vitamins, supplements? In the meantime, FDA spokeswoman Tamara Ward said that 11 companies have received warning letters from the FDA over the past year asking them to stop marketing products that contain DMAA. All but one -- USPlabs in Dallas, which manufactures OxyElite Pro and Jack3d -- agreed to stop using DMAA in supplements. The FDA has visited six of the companies that received warning letters. Five had ended production of supplements with DMAA. ""The sixth company, which was not in compliance, agreed to recall its product after discussions with FDA,"" Ward said. Company names were not provided. In a statement, USPlabs said it ""stands behind the safety and quality of its products,"" citing ""eight peer-reviewed published clinical studies detailing the safety of (DMAA) and products containing it, making it one of the most heavily clinically studied dietary ingredients ever."" However, details provided by the company showed that the studies were each conducted with 50 or fewer participants. The FDA said it ""has found the information insufficient to defend the use of DMAA as an ingredient in dietary supplements,"" and it is finalizing a formal response to USPLabs to reflect the findings. Consumers can report DMAA-related incidents directly to the FDA or the supplement manufacturer. The FDA said consumers should also contact a health care provider if they become ill.","The FDA wants to eliminate supplements containing DMAA .

"The Democrat-controlled Senate passed its first formal budget proposal in four years early Saturday after hours of non-stop voting that started Friday evening. The non-binding plan for the 2014 budget calls for a trillion dollars in tax increases and passed 50 to 49. No Republicans voted for the bill, and four Democrats voted against it. It now goes to the House, where it is expected to be shot down.  Senators recently voted down a budget proposal passed by the Republican-controlled house. The two budget proposals and a third one to be offered by the president will likely be used as a basis for future negotiations between the parties. The Senate convened on Friday morning, and voting started about 4 p.m. ET, as lawmakers considered dozens of amendments to the Democratic budget proposal. The ""vote-a-rama,"" as it's known on Capitol Hill, typically is an annual affair each budget season. However, because it's been so long since Democrats put a budget on the floor, almost half the current senators had not been through the demanding and exhaustive practice. It involves the consideration of and voting on dozens of amendments to the proposed bill. The process took 13 hours and ended just before 5:00 a.m. Saturday. GOP continues push for balanced budget . As voting on final passage of the bill began, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called the session ""one of the Senate's finest days in recent history."" ""I commend everyone who has participated in this extraordinary debate,"" McConnell said. The proposal is supposed to set the funding levels for the various government agencies next year. But because those amounts were set already as part of last year's debt ceiling agreement, this year's budget is really a political document that outlines priorities for the Democrats who control the Senate. Authored by Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Washington, the proposal increases government spending -- including repealing the automatic spending cuts required by sequestration -- and raises taxes on the wealthy. While it reduces the deficit over 10 years, it stands in sharp contrast to the House budget proposal, written by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, that passed the House Wednesday. The Ryan plan slashes trillions of dollars from government accounts and balances the budget in just 10 years. In some years, the House and Senate budgets are reconciled, however, that is not expected to happen this year. ""The budget we're debating this week puts our middle class families first,"" Murray said. ""It reflects our pro-growth, pro-middle class agenda that the American people went to the polls in support of just a few months ago."" The top Republican on the Budget Committee disagreed. Congress avoids shutdown, bickers over 2014 budget . ""Our chair says this is a pro-growth, pro-middle class budget. I say it's a pro-tax, pro-spend, pro-debt budget,"" said Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama. ""It's a budget that comes nowhere near doing the things necessary to put America on a sound path."" While Democratic leaders were confident the Senate bill would pass, there were several moderate Democrats, including some up for re-election, who were concerned about the steep tax hikes in it and indicated they might vote against it. In the end, Senators Max Baucus, D-Montana, Mark Begich, D-Alaska, Kay Hagan, D-North Carolina and Mark Pryor, D-Arkansas voted against the budget proposal. ""We're going to have lots of votes today,"" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid warned Friday morning, going into the session. ""Everybody is going to be tired."" Reid said 400 amendments had been filed, but he added that in most years only 25 to 35 are voted on during these extended voting sessions. Each vote takes about 15 minutes to complete. The amendments are not-binding but still symbolically significant. This time there were 70 votes for 101 amendments; some measures were agreed to unanimously en bloc after party leaders grouped the amendments together to cut down on time. Some of the amendments were designed to put a political squeeze on members of the opposite party. For instance, Murray offered up Ryan's budget for a vote, forcing Senate Republicans to say whether they are for or against the deep spending cuts and entitlement changes in his plan. Democrats argue the cuts are destructive and unrealistic. For his part, Sessions offered an amendment to require Democrats to present a budget that balances in 10 years -- something Murray's budget doesn't do and President Obama's is not expected to do when he unveils it soon. Democrats and Republicans came together on one amendment that passed overwhelmingly. It would strip from the Affordable Health Care Act a tax on medical devices that has been unpopular since it was created. Other amendments dealt with a range of social and economic issues from raising or slashing taxes, preserving insurance coverage for contraception, hiring veterans, endorsing the Keystone XL pipeline, repealing ""Obamacare,"" and prohibiting illegal immigrants from being eligible for Medicaid and Affordable Health Care Act benefits. Meat and poultry industry rescue federal workers . The Keystone amendment, offered by Senators John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, and Max Baucus, D-Montana, passed by a vote of 62 to 37. Though non-binding, the measure establishes the Senate's official support of the controversial project, and is symbolically important as President Obama weighs his decision on whether to approve construction of the pipeline. He is expected to make a final decision sometime this summer. The Senate also passed -- by a vote of 99 to 0 -- an amendment put forth by Sen. David Vitter, R-Louisiana, to end so-called ""Too Big To Fail"" financial advantages for megabanks, defined as any bank that has more that $500 billion in total assets. ""This amendment is very simple. It says we should do away with the federal policies that create that subsidy, that uneven playing field,"" Vitter said. ""It doesn't say it would forcibly break up the banks, it doesn't say we would tax them. It just says that."" This year, senators had an extra personal incentive to pass a budget plan. That's because of a new ""no budget, no pay"" provision that says if a budget is not passed by April 15, senators' salaries will be held in escrow until a budget is approved. That threat is now off the table, though an amendment asking all Senators to donate 20 percent of their own salaries to a charity of their choice did pass by a voice vote. Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham offered the measure so that Senators ""would feel what other people are feeling because of the sequestration."" Lawmakers' salaries were not affected by the forced spending cuts that took effect on March 1, because the Constitution requires a new law to be passed in order to alter congressional compensation. Graham's amendment establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund to broaden the effects of the spending cuts.

"Last January after a fresh snowstorm, my 9-year-old son asked me to help him build a snowman. I told him that I would be out to help shortly. A couple of minutes later he came running back yelling, ""Dad, it's melting!"" That got my attention. It was sub-30 outside, so how could a snowman be melting? I followed him as he ran down the hall to his bedroom. In the middle of his room was a 4-foot tall snowman, melting away. While I removed the snowman and cleaned the remaining slush and mud, I asked him why he did it. He said, in a very matter-of-fact-tone, ""It's cold outside."" Growing up autistic . My son has Asperger's syndrome. For him, building a snowman in his bedroom because it was cold outside was a logical solution to a problem. Because of my son, ""Aspies"" hold a special place in my heart. So whenever I hear someone in my industry talk about hiring an Aspie, I cringe just a little. Because in technology, saying you've hired an Aspie is like code to say that you've hired a machine. It's true that there are a lot of benefits in hiring someone with Asperger's. Research from Harvard Business School shows the strengths of people with Asperger's and high-functioning autism make them especially well-suited for software development and testing. They have the ability to focus for extended periods. They have very good memories and are often highly intelligent. Their strong analytical skills make them talented at technology work. I have Asperger's: I am just like you . But there is a lot more to Aspies than their focus, intelligence and determination. Aspies are human. Like anyone else, they have their highs and lows, and their good and bad days. As a manager, you should understand how to handle the unique opportunities and challenges that come with hiring an Aspie. Here are six things you should know: . 1. Aspies are autistic . Asperger's syndrome is a high-functioning variant of autism. People with Asperger's are often exceptionally intelligent and verbally gifted, but they also can be socially awkward. They can react to stress differently and at times more emotionally than others not on the autism spectrum. Many people with Asperger's are challenged by large crowds, looking people in the eye and reading common social cues. When talking with an Aspie, don't get offended if they look around or focus on an object in the room instead of looking directly at you. This is a coping skill that most Aspies develop over time. Listen to their words instead of focusing on their body language. 2. Aspies are intelligent -- and independent . Aspies will question authority. They will never accept ""no"" for an answer without being told the reason for it. They almost never accept a fact simply because of who it comes from. They will only accept it as fact if the logic proves out. For this reason, many inexperienced managers shy away from working with an Aspie. Don't. You just need to be prepared to justify your decisions when they'll have a direct impact on your Aspie employee. 3. Aspies think differently . Aspies frequently talk at length about small details instead of being brief and to the point. The reason is simple: It's how they see the world. They hold complex mental models that include all those small interlocking details. To them, overlooking the details is ignoring part of the solution. Be patient with them. It's an Aspie's way of getting it. I have seen Aspies start reprogramming software in their head well before they get back to their desks and write the first line of code. Aspie testers will instantly see what is wrong with the software because it no longer fits their model. All this ""rewiring"" has wonderfully positive results. 4. Aspies feel deeply . It's easy to think that Aspies are less empathetic because of how they can act. They're not. When people are unsure how to respond to a stressful or unfamiliar situation, we can act in strange ways. This goes for Aspies, too. One the most challenging things for any autistic individual to deal with is the cacophony of emotions that can be triggered by seemingly mundane events. For example, the cancellation of a project may be a relief to most of your team, while an Aspie may see it as people not appreciating their hard work or allowing them to finish the job. Be patient. Pull them aside beforehand to explain the situation and ask them for their feedback and insight. It will give them a chance to process the idea. 5. Aspies talk differently . In the most simple of terms: Aspies are blunt to a fault. Aspies are known for being direct, speaking their mind and being honest and determined. Just be aware that an Aspie is interested primarily in significant contributions to conversation, preferring to avoid ""small talk,"" trivial statements and superficial conversation. Aspies are not trying to be rude. 6. Aspies are successful . There is good reason that Asperger's is called the successful disorder. Their focus and dedication leads many Aspies to great heights. I doubt you could find an entrepreneur who doesn't have a few Aspie behaviors. Asperger's comes with challenges along with the great opportunities. Don't shy away from Aspies because they have different mannerisms or behaviors. Be aware of them and understand how to respond to them. If you do, you will see Aspies as the invaluable people they are and afford them the respect they deserve. Readers support Asperger's community .","People with Asperger's bring unique strengths to their careers, Dave Wellman says .

"The anti-abortion group that recently revealed two videos from a secret investigation into abortion clinics released a third on Thursday. The group, Live Action, previewed it first to CNN, providing what appears to be full footage and an edited version. The new, secretly recorded video focuses on the Family Planning Associates Medical Group in Phoenix. Two other videos, released earlier this week, focused on the Dr. Emily Women's Health Center in New York and the Washington-based Washington Surgi-Clinic. With the new video, Live Action levels the same claim it did in the previous two: That abortion clinic workers admit or suggest they're willing to kill babies who are born alive after botched abortions. ""What we're alleging is there is a federal Born Alive Infants Protection Act. And there are numerous state laws that protect infants,"" Live Action founder and president Lila Rose told CNN in an exclusive interview.  ""So we're alleging that there is potentially illegal activity going on in these clinics."" Live Action has been accused of pushing a hardline anti-abortion agenda using dubious tactics, including secret recordings. They've also been accused of heavily editing videos to achieve a desired effect. Rose dismissed the criticism. ""Our agenda is the truth here.  The truth about the brutality of abortion. and the truth that we believe every person deserves human rights.  And that women can do better than this.  That's our agenda.  I'm very clear about that."" The third release could prove potentially more controversial and helpful to the anti-abortion movement than the previous two productions. Arizona is a far more conservative state on abortion than New York or Washington. Last year, Arizona attempted to pass what some called one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation. It is on hold pending a legal challenge. Live Action's chief told CNN the group plans to release three more videos in coming weeks. The liberal-leaning media watchdog MediaMatters said on its website this week that the videos are timed to coincidewith the trial of Dr. Kermit Gosnell. He is accused of performing illegal late-term abortions in Philadelphia. Gosnell's lawyer says he's innocent. Jurors are currently deliberating. In all of the Live Action videos, a pregnant woman meets with workers at an abortion clinic and pretends to want an abortion.  In each case, the woman is actually working undercover for Live Action. And in each case, the pregnant woman secretly records her conversations with those workers -- who are unaware they are being recorded. The video shot inside the Phoenix medical group features three workers. The conversations on it do not prove any wrongdoing by any of FamilyPlanning's staff. Dr. Paul Isaacson, part owner of the Phoenix facility, maintained that his clinic follows all applicable abortion laws. ""We have not had the opportunity to review the video or transcript of the video reportedly recorded in our office because it has not been provided to us,"" Isaacson said in a statement to CNN. ""However, the details of the video as described do not reflect the policies and procedures at Family Planning Associates Medical Group. Family Planning Associates Medical Group strictly adheres to all applicable state and federal laws regarding the delivery of abortion care,"" he added. CNN has reached out to the various local, state and federal health and law enforcement agencies to determine if any will investigate Live Action's claims against the Phoenix medical group. CNN has not yet received a response. Congress passed and President Bush signed the ""Born Alive Infant Protection Act"" in 2002. The law states that any infant born alive, including any in an abortion attempt, must receive legal protections. Doctors must also work to save their lives. The law does not explicitly state that it is illegal to discuss hypotheticals of what might happen in such matters. In the recording from inside the Phoenix facility, one woman identifies herself as Dr. Laura Mercer , a  chief resident. The doctor carefully walks the pregnant woman through the abortion process, to which the woman rolls through a series of questions. At one point, the woman asks if she could go into labor, at home, over the two-day process. ""That would be a lot less common, but theoretically it would be a possibility,"" the doctor said. Moments later, the pregnant woman asks: what would happen if she went into labor and the fetus emerged alive. ""It won't,"" the doctor said. ""But if it, if it does survive, like what would you do, like?"" the woman asks. ""Nothing,"" the doctor responds.  ""So at this gestational age, um, there's really not the possibility.  A fetus is not developed enough that it can survive outside of the uterus, at this point."" ""So you wouldn't like resuscitate it, or like give it anything to help it survive?"" the woman asks. ""No,"" the doctor says. ""Even if you were pregnant at the same time with a very desired pregnancy, and you had the exact same thing happen, spontaneously on your own at 23 week two days in the hospital, we would still say, 'Do you want us to try to resuscitate? Our chances aren't good.'  But it's kinda one of those things that if it makes the parents feel better, we'll give it a shot between 23 to 24 weeks."" Later on tape, another women identified by Live Action as a counselor, makes similar comments. Rose said her group wants investigations. ""We're looking for prosecutions where there may be criminal acts going on. We're looking for the de-licensing of these so-called doctors and their clinics so they're no longer allowed to operate.  And we're also looking for the de-funding of any federal or state or local taxpayer dollars that are going to these acts,"" she said. CNN spoke with Mercer on Wednesday. She acknowledged previously doing a resident rotation at Family Planning but was not aware of the existence of the video or any role in it. When informed about the video, Mercer responded, ""That's interesting,"" adding that she'd need to go back and look over records of a conversation with the pregnant woman in question. Mercer was familiar with laws that mandates a doctor must work to save a fetus that emerged alive during an abortion. ""You have to evaluate for the ability to do so.  Absolutely,"" Mercer said. Asked if she could recall ever saying otherwise, Mercer responded: ""No. Not that I remember."" Mercer is a physician resident in training at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center. Bill Byron, vice president of public relations, spoke with CNN in a phone interview. ""The issue of what, let's say Dr. Mercer, would or wouldn't do, according to Live Action -- she's a resident. And a resident is not going to do anything without being supervised, obviously, in any decisionmaking from the perspective of the attending physician in the office,"" Byron said. ""The second thing is that, when you look at Arizona, some of our statutes ... is that, by law, if a fetus was deemed as viable or showed signs of viability, a second physician has to be in the room who's going to assume the care of that fetus."" Byron added that ""nowhere do I see where she says that 'Hey, if your baby comes out alive, I'm ... going to let it die.'""","Most recent video focuses on Phoenix family planning practice .

"Seriously. It actually happened. Sort of. On January 10, in my weekly Apparently This Matters column, I wrote about an online fundraiser called the Good Day Blimp where, essentially, four guys were trying to quickly raise $25,000 for charity to more-or-less guilt-trip the Goodyear company into flying their blimp high in the air while spelling out in lights ""ICE CUBE'S A PIMP."" If Goodyear would do this on January 20 -- a very specific and important date -- the South Central Los Angeles nonprofit, A Place Called Home, would get the money. You know, for kids! But it had to be THAT date and THOSE words. It's a little silly and a lot complicated, and you can read the whole backstory here, but just know that it all stems from the lyrics of one of Ice Cube's old-school, 1992 hit rap songs ""It Was a Good Day"" where, in recounting a day so good he ""even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp and it read ICE CUBE'S A PIMP."" For my column, I actually spoke to Ice Cube while he happened to be at the CNN Center in Atlanta promoting his new movie ""Ride Along,"" (sequel to come, he told CNN today) and that's when he first learned of the movement. He thought it was: ""Dope."" Then, a few days later he acknowledged the movement on Twitter before appearing on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon where the subject once again came up. So, between us and Jimmy Fallon, we feel a little responsible for this thing blowing up. What was once a quiet, ridiculous Internet fundraiser was now officially a thing. Goodyear released a statement via Twitter, saying that on January 20 they would treat kids from the A Place Called Home charity to rides on the blimp, and even invited Ice Cube to join them. However, they weren't going to write ""ICE CUBE'S A PIMP."" That just wasn't going to happen. But they basically met everyone halfway by promising to write out ""IT'S A GOOD DAY."" In the end, Ice Cube flew out to Los Angeles early Monday morning from the East Coast to meet with the kids, check out the blimp, and help the Good Day Blimp guys present a large, novelty-sized $25,000 check to the charity. ""I never thought in a million years it would happen,"" Cube said, standing outside the blimp. ""Rap is a mixture of fantasy and reality, and it seems like fantasy has met reality today."" Sort of. The wording wasn't exact, but let's face it, Goodyear was never going to write PIMP on their famous airship, and they very easily could have ignored the whole thing. By January 21 it would be a memory. But it happened. And credit to Ice Cube for being there for the festivities. It was a good day.

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Most people are never really alone. Living here in New York, we're constantly surrounded by others. Even in the state's biggest wilderness, the Adirondacks, you can't get more than 15 miles or so from civilization. Similar levels of population density can be found in most of the lower 48 states. So when we heard about Heimo and Edna Korth, a couple who live 150 miles above the Arctic Circle and 60 miles from their nearest neighbors, we had to go meet them. The Korths reside in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, an area about the size of South Carolina in the northeast corner of the state. It is bordered by the Beaufort Sea on the north and Canada's Yukon to the east. There are other people living in the refuge -- Inuit in Kaktovik and the Gwich'in of Arctic Village -- but as far as we know, the Korths are the most isolated humans in the area. They live in the most remote location in America and sustain themselves by hunting, fishing and trapping. They've lived like this for more than 30 years, raising a family in the process and all the while dealing with grizzly bears and temperatures that dip as low as minus-50 degrees Fahrenheit. Their home turf is inhospitable in the truest sense of the word. See the rest of Heimo's Arctic Refuge at VBS.TV . As much as Heimo Korth truly is the Final Frontiersman, he's no Luddite. He uses lots of modern tools: guns, the radio, a satellite phone, a chainsaw and, most important, a gasoline-powered snow machine (a snowmobile in recreational terms) to check his miles of traps. In the wake of the BP spill, the refuge has received renewed attention from the ""drill, baby, drill"" crowd, which refuses to ever let a good crisis go to waste. Their claims that the refuge is uninhabited will ring particularly hollow after you watch the above video and catch a glimpse inside the Korths' lives. They are, after all, Americans and seem to be doing their own thing in their own time, which is perhaps the most American activity of all. Still, we didn't set out to make a documentary about the politics of oil drilling. That's boring and has been done a million times already. What we wanted was to tell the story of a pair of the last Americans who use well-honed skills to survive solely off the land, skills that we are losing at our own peril. The Korths supplement their myriad abilities with the benefits of oil-based products and machines. They understand the necessity of oil. We all do.","Heimo and Edna Korth have lived isolated life for 30 years, raising family in wilderness .

"Less than an hour after he fired off an angry letter to Catholic Church leaders about their handling of Argentina's same-sex marriage debate, Marcelo Marquez says his phone rang. He was surprised to hear the voice on the other end of the line. It was Jorge Mario Bergoglio, then the archbishop of Buenos Aires, and now the pope. What Bergoglio said to him at a meeting soon afterward that year, 2010, was even more surprising, Marquez said. For months, church officials had made sharp, public criticisms of the push to legalize same-sex marriage in the South American country. But privately, Bergoglio seemed to be more open to discussion, according to Marquez. 5 things to know about Pope Francis . ""He told me. ... 'I'm in favor of gay rights and in any case, I also favor civil unions for homosexuals, but I believe that Argentina is not yet ready for a gay marriage law,'"" said Marquez, a gay rights activist, a self-described devout Catholic and a former theology professor at a Catholic seminary. The pope's reported willingness behind-the-scenes to accept civil unions as a compromise may offer new insight into how he will lead the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. A public battle . As archbishop of Buenos Aires, Bergoglio was one of the leaders of the Catholic Church's public charge against legalizing same-sex marriage in Argentina. He engaged in a notorious war of words with the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, who supported the measure. Bergoglio put himself in the middle of the fight, calling the proposed legislation ""a destructive attack on God's plan."" With a front-page counterpunch, the president said the church possessed ""attitudes reminiscent of medieval times and the Inquisition."" Some point to the public battle as evidence of Bergoglio's traditionalist views. But behind closed doors, Marquez said, the man who would become pope appeared to be more open to discussion of the issue. In another meeting, Bergoglio told him he had always treated gay people with respect and dignity. World reacts to new pope . ""I have accompanied many homosexual people during my career to tend to their spiritual needs,"" Bergoglio said at the time, according to Marquez. Pope was 'very open, very frank' Bergoglio, who chose the name Pope Francis after he was elected pontiff last week, may have voiced his support for civil unions in other circles. Andres Albertsen, a former pastor of the Danish Church in Buenos Aires, said Bergoglio made similar comments about civil unions to him in a private meeting. ""In this conversation that we had, he showed himself to be very open, very frank with me,"" Albertsen told CNN en Español on Wednesday. ""He told me that he would have accepted a civil union."" According to a story published by The New York Times on Wednesday, Bergoglio also told bishops at a 2010 meeting that the church should support civil unions for gay couples. CNN could not independently confirm the details of the Argentine bishops' meeting, which was also described in a July 2010 article published by Argentina's Clarin newspaper. ""Bergoglio -- faithful to his moderate position -- proposed continuing measured actions. ... He would suggest, also, that the church discreetly accept the intermediate alternative of the civil union -- authorizing a series of rights (inheritance, social work) -- that would not equate to marriage nor permit adoption,"" wrote journalist Sergio Rubin -- now Bergoglio's biographer. But that proposal was rejected by bishops, who voted instead to begin a high-profile, public battle against same-sex marriage, Rubin wrote. Pushing for dialogue . A senior Vatican official said he could neither confirm nor deny The New York Times report at this point, adding that while Pope Francis might have expressed such a view while he was a cardinal, he should be given time to develop his policy position as pontiff. Alejandro Russo, the rector of the Metropolitan Cathedral in Buenos Aires, said it was unlikely the pope had ever expressed such a view, even in private. In 2007, Bergoglio publicly criticized Buenos Aires' government for allowing civil unions, Russo said. His relationship with the mayor of Buenos Aires soured over the matter. Gay rights advocates in Argentina later argued that civil unions, allowed in a several states, were a positive step that conferred some benefits to same-sex couples, but didn't go far enough. The same-sex marriage measure, they said, would treat homosexual and heterosexual relationships equally before the law. It would permit gay couples to adopt, and also allow the inheritance of property. Argentina approved a law legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide in July 2010. Even though Bergoglio was one of the law's most well known opponents, Marquez said on Wednesday that he hopes the pontiff will remain open to discussion, just as he appeared to be several years ago in Buenos Aires. ""We are going to try to have a dialogue with the pope,"" said Marquez, who works for Argentina's National Institute Against Discrimination. ""It's frightening, but I think it must be done."" 'He's really moderate on this issue' Word of the pope's reported support for civil unions in Argentina sparked debate, with some praising his stance and saying it was a hopeful sign of possible reforms. ""He wanted to respect human rights. That's the real surprise here, that people say, well he's anti-gay. You can be anti-gay marriage and not be anti-gay, and I think there's a distinction here,"" said the Rev. Edward Beck, a CNN contributor and host of ""The Sunday Mass"" on ABC Family. ""He's really moderate on this issue, it seems."" Others, though, were more skeptical. One Argentine journalist said Wednesday that he wasn't quite ready to celebrate. In an article titled, ""Francis, the pope that declares war on us and later calls us on the phone,"" journalist Bruno Bimbi said it wasn't clear how the pope will handle the issue of same-sex unions. ""Maybe the lion has become a lamb. Maybe, as a priest told me the day his election was announced, maybe he is worried about his biography and wants to go down in history. I do not know,"" Bimbi wrote. ""Whatever he does, this time he won't be able to blame others for the pressures. Now he's in charge.""

"The death toll has surged from weekend violence in Afghanistan, with six Americans and more than a dozen Afghan civilians reportedly among the casualties. Five Americans -- including a U.S. diplomat, a civilian from the Defense Department and three U.S. service members -- were killed while delivering books to an Afghan school, when a suicide bomber struck their convoy in southern Afghanistan's Zabul province Saturday. Another U.S. service member was killed in a separate attack Saturday. The diplomat's death was a grim reminder of the risks and importance of pushing for change in ""one of the toughest places on earth,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said. Anne Smedinghoff, 25, is believed to be the first U.S. diplomat killed since a September attack in Benghazi, Libya. ""I think there are no words for anybody to describe the extraordinarily harsh contradiction of a young 25-year-old woman with all of the future ahead of her, believing in the possibilities of diplomacy, of changing people's lives, of making a difference, having an impact, who was taking knowledge in books to deliver them to a school,"" Kerry said.

The attack killed Afghan civilians and wounded four more State Department personnel. One of them was in critical condition in a hospital in Kandahar, Kerry told reporters Sunday. ""I wish everyone in our country could see first-hand the devotion, loyalty and amazingly hard and hazardous work our diplomats do on the front lines in the world's most dangerous places,"" Kerry said in a statement Saturday. ""Every day, we honor their courage and are grateful for their sacrifices, and today we do so with great sadness."" Smedinghoff volunteered for an assignment at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and had been working there since July, her parents said in a statement. ""She particularly enjoyed the opportunity to work directly with the Afghan people and was always looking for opportunities to reach out and help to make a difference in the lives of those living in a country ravaged by war,"" Tom and Mary Beth Smedinghoff said.

Dunford, who took command of ISAF about two months ago. ""One of the things I'm going to ask (Dunford) is ... what have you learned,"" Dempsey told the American Forces Press Service. ""If he tells me 'Nothing,' I'm going to say, 'Maybe we got the wrong guy.'"" Dempsey spokesman Col.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama delivered a rousing speech Saturday night to the nation's largest gay rights group, praising the gay community for making strides in equal rights and pledging to deliver on major campaign promises that some say he's left on the back burner. President Obama speaks Saturday night at the Human Rights Campaign dinner in Washington. ""For nearly 30 years, you've advocated for those without a voice,"" Obama said during his address at the dinner for the Human Rights Campaign. ""Despite the progress we've made, there are still laws to change and hearts to open."" Obama's speech came as gay rights activists continued to lose patience over the lack of change to key issues for the gay community -- including the Pentagon's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. It comes on the eve of a major gays-rights rally in Washington. ""This fight continues now and I'm here with the simple message: I'm here with you in that fight,"" Obama told the applauding crowd. The Human Rights Campaign issued a statement praising the speech, saying it was a ""historic night when we felt the full embrace and commitment of the president of the United States. It's simply unprecedented."" Obama called for the repeal of the ban on gays in the military -- the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. ""We should not be punishing patriotic Americans who have stepped forward to serve this country,"" he said. ""I'm working with the Pentagon, its leadership and the members of the House and Senate on ending this policy, legislation that has been introduced in the House to make this happen, I will end 'don't ask, don't tell.' That's my commitment to you."" The president said he backed the rights of gay couples, saying they should have the ""same rights and responsibilities afforded to any married couple in this country."" He said he has urged Congress to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act and to pass the Domestic Partners Benefit and Obligations Act. Obama also touched on protection against hate crimes, noting that legislation was passed in the House this week that expanded the definition of hate crimes to include attacks based on sexual orientation and gender identity. ""I can announce that after more than a decade, this bill is set to pass and I will sign it into law,"" he said. Obama acknowledged the fact that many in the gay community don't believe government is moving fast enough to address their concerns. ""Many of you don't believe progress is happening. I want to be honest about that because it's important to be honest among friends,"" he said. ""I said this before, I'll repeat it again, it's not important for me to tell you to be patient."" Obama said gay people, like other Americans, are affected by myriad concerns -- namely, the economy and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq -- and stressed that he's focusing on issues that affect the entire nation.  Watch Obama say he will sign hate-crimes legislation » . ""While some may wish to define you solely by your sexual orientation or identity alone, you know and I know that none of us want to be defined by one part of what makes us whole,"" he said. ""So I know you want me working on jobs and the economy and all of the other issues that we're dealing with."" Still, Obama said, it's imperative that the gay community continue to pursue the policies they support. ""It's so important that you continue to speak out and you continue to set an example and that you continue to press your leaders, including me, and to make the case all across America,"" he said. The Human Rights Campaign in its statement praised Obama's pledge that ""we will see a time in which we as a nation finally recognize the relationships between two men or two women.""

"White Plains, New York (CNN) -- Ex-New York Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik was sentenced to 48 months in prison Thursday after pleading guilty to charges of lying to Bush administration officials who vetted his unsuccessful 2004 nomination for homeland security secretary. The sentence, handed down by U.S. District Judge Stephen Robinson, exceeded the 27- to 33-month prison term recommended by federal prosecutors. ""With great power comes great responsibility and comes great consequences,"" Robinson said in court. Kerik, accompanied by his wife and son, addressed the court before his sentencing. ""I make no excuses,"" the former police commissioner said. ""I take full responsibility for my actions. I have learned from this. I know I will be punished, but I only wish you would allow me return to my wife and two little girls as soon as possible."" Kerik, 54, pleaded guilty in November to tax fraud and six other felonies and has been under house arrest in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, since then. He must surrender to authorities to begin his sentence by May 17. After the sentencing, Kerik told reporters he wanted to ""apologize to the American people for the mistakes I've made and for which I have just accepted responsibility."" ""As history is written, I can only hope that I will be judged for the 30 years of service that I've given to this country and the city of New York,"" he said. In court papers, prosecutors said Kerik denied to a White House official that there was ""any possible concern"" about his relationships with contractors involved in renovating an apartment of his or that he had any financial dealings with prospective city contractors. Kerik had been scheduled to go to trial on a variety of corruption charges, including allegations that he received and concealed benefits of about $255,000 in renovations to his Riverdale, New York, apartment from a company seeking to do business with the city of New York. He pleaded guilty to that charge and several tax-related counts in November. Kerik was New York police commissioner from 1998 to 2002, a tenure that included the September 11, 2001, attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center and killed more than 2,700 people. He spent a brief stint in Iraq training the country's police force after the U.S. invasion in 2003, and President Bush nominated him to be homeland security secretary in 2004. However, Kerik withdrew from consideration after allegations surfaced that he had employed a nanny with a murky immigration status. In 2006, he pleaded guilty to accepting tens of thousands of dollars in gifts while he working as city corrections commissioner. Under his plea agreement, he paid $221,000 in fines and avoided jail time. His admission dogged the 2008 presidential campaign of his longtime patron, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who said his endorsement of Kerik had been ""a mistake."" Kerik made an unsuccessful appeal for clemency to Bush in 2008, according to court papers released in October.","NEW: Bernard Kerik tells reporters he wants to ""apologize to the American people""

"What if war is triggered by accident or some kind of miscalculation on the Korean peninsula? This is a possibility that has provoked worry, analysis and preparations for more than 50 years. The recent bellicose rhetoric from the young, unproven leader of North Korea raises this possibility to a new height. What precisely is the risk, and what should be done about it? The angry rhetoric of Kim Jong Un has set a record for extremism.  And yet, going all the way back to the negotiating tactics used in the Korean War, the North has used an extreme, abusive and contradictory style. Anything conceded to them was taken, but they conceded nothing.  Anything up for negotiation was met with ever heightening demands. Every offer of compromise was met with an angry rhetoric of denial. Repeated rounds or negotiations over the succeeding decades have seen little change. And their public rhetoric has always been harsh and hyperbolic. Opinion: North Korea is far from suicidal . But it hasn't been only rhetoric over the years.  In the 1960s, U.S. soldiers serving in Korea were authorized to wear their division's insignia on the right shoulder, the so-called combat patch. A U.S. Navy ship was attacked, boarded and seized with its crew held captive in 1968. A U.S. Army major and another soldier were beaten to death in the Korean Demilitarized Zone in 1976. Again and again, North Korea has defied international accords, laws and common sense, creating and exporting long-range missiles, building nuclear capabilities and engaging in kidnappings, sabotage and cyberattack. But there has been no war. We attribute this to three factors. First, we believe the overwhelming power of the United States guarantees that any North Korean attack would, eventually, result in the utter destruction of the regime.  Second, the South Korean leadership has shown remarkable restraint in the face of humiliating North Korean provocations.  Third, the North Koreans may not have ever intended to attack, though we have no way of knowing, or they understand that the combined U.S.-South Korean forces would destroy North Korea should war begin. The U.S. and South Korean deterrent remains strong -- in both rhetoric and deployable, effective military power. But what about miscalculation? Yes, it is always possible that Kim may doubt that the United States would act, despite all the evidence to the contrary.  Or, perhaps he miscalculates how far he can push the South Koreans. It is possible that a North provocation could be so extreme that the South would be compelled by its own domestic politics to respond militarily -- say a tit-for-tat ship-sinking. Or maybe such an incident occurs by accident, if overzealous commanders make a wrong move. Opinion: Does North Korea think U.S. going soft? And then Kim, fearing that his own associates would mistake forbearance for weakness, would escalate in turn, thus initiating a cycle of intensifying moves that could spread conflict and turn into a war that neither side could back away from. The risk is higher now than before because Kim's bellicose rhetoric may mask real weaknesses in his authority or in his understanding. The rising rhetoric raises tensions (as it is probably designed to do). These tensions increase the risks of fear or pride, which could lead to an inadvertent incident. Should an incident occur, there will be pressure on leaders of both sides to retaliate and even escalate hostility. The consequences of conflict are higher than before, given the North's nuclear and missile capabilities. What should be done? First, ensure that the U.S. deterrent is capable and credible.  This requires that we have the capability to both defend ourselves and strike back, and that we make it as clear as possible to the North Koreans our resolve to use these capabilities if challenged. Second, assure our South Korean allies that we will stand with them, so they can afford politically to be restrained. Third, strike a balance between demonstrating resolve in public and, simultaneously, working to reduce tensions.

"(CNN)In 1610, after he built his telescope, Galileo Galilei first spotted enormous Saturn's gigantic rings. More than 400 years later, astronomers have in a sense dwarfed that discovery with a similar first. Using powerful optics, they have found a much larger planet-like body, J1407b, with rings 200 times the size of Saturn's, U.S. and Dutch astronomers said. It lies some 400 light-years away from Earth. For decades, scientists have believed that many moons around large planets formed out of such ring systems. But this is the first one astronomers have observed outside of our solar system, they said. It was discovered in 2012, but a detailed analysis of its data was recently completed and published. If J1407b were in our solar system, it would dominate Earth's nightly sky. ""If we could replace Saturn's rings with the rings around J1407b, they would be easily visible at night and be many times larger than the full moon,"" said Matthew Kenworthy from the Netherlands' Leiden Observatory. Unlike Galileo peering a relatively short distance through his simple telescope, today's astronomers can't eyeball the rings hundreds of light-years away. But using two very powerful optical devices with eight cameras each, they can observe the effect the rings have as they pass across nearby star J1407 -- written without a 'b' at the end. It is similar to our sun. The rings of planet J1407b eclipse its light. With the enormous size of the rings, the eclipse the astronomers observed lasted 56 days. But the star did not go completely dark for nearly two months. Some of J1407b's 30 rings are denser, blocking more light, and some of them are less dense, letting more light through. And there are gaps between the rings, leading the scientists to theorize that ""exomoons"" have formed and cut clean orbits through the debris, like the moons around Saturn. Our own solar system's ringed giant has at least 60 moons, according to NASA. Like its system of rings, planet J1407b is also much larger than Saturn, said astrophysicist Eric Mamajek, whose team at the University of Rochester discovered the object. ""You could think of it as kind of a super Saturn."" It is called a brown dwarf, a size classification somewhere between a planet and a star, according to the California Institute of Technology. Brown dwarfs are hot but don't burst into nuclear fusion the way stars do, so they don't give off light. The scientists are calling on amateur astronomers to keep an eye on star J1407 in hopes they may observe the rings eclipsing it again and report the results to the American Association of Variable Star Observers, which collects astronomical data on ""stars that change in brightness."" And astronomers will also search for more such ringed systems.","Scientists have long believed many moons formed from Saturn-like rings .
This is the first time such a system has been spotted outside of our solar system, astronomers say ."
"It was a boat owner's obsession with perfection, making sure his ""baby"" was stowed just right in his backyard, that led him to discover the surviving suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings. Contrary to police reports, David Henneberry said the discovery of blood had nothing to do with the inspection of his boat, the Slip Away II, he told CNN affiliate WCVB. During the inspection, he found a bloodied Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, hiding in the boat, he said. Henneberry said he had been obsessing over how two pads had fallen out of the shrink-wrap protecting his boat for the winter. He had put the pads under the shrink-wrap to prevent chafing, he told the station. It took two visits tending to the boat before he finally saw Tsarnaev and his trail of blood. ""It was really windy, so I didn't think twice about it,"" he said of the dislodged pads. Neighbor photographs shootout with police . He couldn't address the problem until authorities lifted a ""shelter-in-place"" order for residents of Watertown, Massachusetts, about 6 p.m. Friday. Then he went outside to get some air, he told the affiliate. ""I am just going to put the pads back. They were bugging me all day.  So I went out in the yard and felt the freedom that everyone in Watertown was feeling. When I pulled the strap, it was a lot looser than it usually is.  But again, the wind could have loosened things up,"" he said. At this point, he didn't see blood on the exterior tarp, despite what police have said. ""No indication of anything.  I know people say I saw blood on the boat, 'He saw blood on the boat.'  Not true,"" he said. 5 key questions in Boston bombing . ""I said 'OK, everything is fine.' There are no visible signs of blood outside the boat.  I went inside,"" he said. But in a fit of obsession, he returned to the boat, climbed a ladder and inspected the Slip Away II again. ""I got three steps up the ladder and rolled the shrink-wrap.  I didn't expect to see anything, but I saw blood on the floor of the boat.  A good amount of blood,"" he told the affiliate. ""And I said 'Wow, did I cut myself last time?' I thought.  I was in the boat a couple of weeks ago.  Then I just look over there, and there is more blood,"" he continued. A look at Tamerlan Tsarnaev's past . The blood led to a revelation that would end a two-day manhunt for Tsarnaev.

""I think maybe (I knew), but I didn't want to think that. It's fast,"" he said. He recounted how the person was hidden. ""I see him lying there just like you see on the film (from the State Police helicopter's infrared camera).  He was just lying there by the engine block and the floor. I couldn't see his face. I'm glad I didn't see his face. I didn't see his face.  He didn't move,"" he told WCVB. Responding quickly, Henneberry didn't even remember climbing down the ladder and running to the phone to dial 911. FBI takes heat over Boston bombing suspect . ""I didn't waste any time.  I didn't ask him if he wanted a cup of coffee.  I was off that ladder.  That is all I remember,"" he told the affiliate. Police later escorted Henneberry and his wife to a neighbor's home. Police then surrounded the Henneberry's house. Tsarnaev eventually surrendered. ""I am lucky I am alive,"" Henneberry said. ""These other people were killed.  Sometimes, I just sit and say, 'Wow.'"" Many on social media want to buy him another boat. But Henneberry wants nothing of it. He calls himself an ""incidental hero."" ""It makes me feel wonderful that people that are thinking like that, but it is my boat.  People lost lives and lost limbs.  I'd rather that (the money) go to the One Fund Boston.  To buy me a new boat is a wonderful thing, I don't want that, really.  I would wish that they donate it to the One Fund Boston.  They lost limbs.  I lost a boat,"" he told the affiliate.

"Nairobi, Kenya (CNN) -- Betty Gikonyo's life changed forever at 30,000 feet. Several years ago, the Kenyan pediatrician was flying with her three children to the United States, accompanying her husband who was pursuing a medical scholarship in Minneapolis. But just before their departure from Kenya, the family was asked to escort an 18-year-old boy flying to America for treatment on a heart condition. The Gikonyos agreed and initially all seemed to be going well -- the plane was airborne and cruising but then, suddenly, the boy began to get sick. ""He started getting difficulty in breathing,"" recalls Gikonyo. ""He started foaming through the mouth,"" she continues. ""We were very fortunate because we had the medication, and we found ourselves administering medicine in the air."" After a short stop in Brussels to allow the boy's condition to stabilize, the group were finally able to continue their journey -- but the experience left a lasting impression on Gikonyo, shaping her mission to provide necessary healthcare for children in need. ""[It's that] feeling that you need to do something for somebody you don't know so that they can be comfortable, so that they can enjoy life the way you do,"" she says. Gikonyo has since returned to Kenya where she has become a leading pediatric cardiologist. Focused on improving access to quality healthcare, her illustrious career has seen her help establish the Heart to Heart Foundation, which raises funds for disadvantaged children to receive lifesaving surgery. Gikonyo also began organizing medical airlifts overseas so children could receive the vital treatment. But it was in 2006 when the Kenyan doctor realized her 20-year dream of opening a state-of-the-art facility where could treat children with ailing hearts, the Karen Hospital just outside Nairobi.

"As the world hunted him, the younger brother suspected in the Boston Marathon bombings acted like any other college sophomore. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, was on the campus of University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth every day after the attack until late Thursday, a university official told CNN. Tsarnaev attended classes and dorm parties and went to the gym while the rest of Boston came to a tense standstill. A student at the school told The Boston Globe that she saw Tsarnaev at a party Wednesday night that was attended by some of his friends from intramural soccer. ""He was just relaxed,"" she said, asking the paper not to print her name. Another UMass Dartmouth student said he talked about the bombing with Tsarnaev for several minutes Tuesday while they were working out at the gym. Tsarnaev seemed normal, perhaps a little tired, Zach Bettencourt told CNN. Bettencourt said he told Tsarnaev something about the bombing, to the effect of, ""You hear about this kind of thing happening in Iraq and Afghanistan, but not here."" ""He was like, 'Yeah, tragedies happen like this all the time and it's sad,' "" Bettencourt said, adding he had no inkling about anything suspicious with  Tsarnaev, whom he described as a nice guy. The days-long drama that gripped Boston -- and the world -- began when two homemade bombs made from pressure cookers exploded 12 seconds apart near the finish line of Monday's Boston Marathon. Three people were killed, and more than 170 wounded as nails, ball bearings, BBs and shards of broken glass were blasted through the viewing area. Law enforcement officials combed through photos and surveillance videos, searching for clues to who detonated the bombs. The FBI released photos showing two men they were seeking and asked for the public's help. Suspects: Immigrant dream to American nightmare . At the dorm where Tsarnaev lived, students joked Thursday as they viewed the FBI photos on television, a senior who lived in the suspect's dorm told The Boston Globe. ""We made a joke like, that could be Dzhokhar,"" said Pamala Rolon. ""But then we thought it just couldn't be him. Dzhokhar? Never."" A tense scene began to unfold Thursday night -- complete with wailing sirens, flashes of blue and red lights, a hail of bullets and explosions from homemade bombs. By early Friday morning, Tsarnaev's older brother, Tamerlan, 26, was dead. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was bleeding as he stole away into the night. On campus nobody was joking. The school posted a message on its website: ""UMass Dartmouth has learned that a person being sought in connection with the Boston Marathon bombing has been identified as a student registered at UMass Dartmouth. The campus is closed. Individuals on campus should shelter in place unless instructed otherwise."" Older suspect grew increasingly religious, analysis shows . The manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev lasted all day Friday and left Boston streets deserted as police asked everyone to stay indoors. Then after the request was lifted, authorities got a tip: A Watertown man told police someone was hiding in his boat in the backyard, bleeding. It was their suspect, Watertown police Chief Edward Deveau said. Officers spotted Tsarnaev poking through the tarp covering the boat, and a shootout erupted, Deveau said. Police used ""flash-bangs,"" devices meant to stun people with a loud noise, and negotiated with Tsarnaev for about half an hour. Chief describes how manhunt ended . ""We used a robot to pull the tarp off the boat,"" David Procopio of the Massachusetts State Police said. ""We were also watching him with a thermal imaging camera in our helicopter. He was weakened by blood loss -- injured last night, most likely."" A thermal image photograph, released Saturday by the state police, showed what authorities say was Tsarnaev lying in the middle of the boat. Police had no idea whether he had weapons or explosives with him, so they repeatedly told him to stand up and lift his shirt to show he wasn't wearing a device, Deveau said. Eventually Tsarnaev stood up and lifted his shirt for the officers. ""Once we saw that, we felt comfortable enough to send some officer tactical equipment to grab him and pull him away from the boat,"" Deveau said.  He was taken by ambulance to a hospital. Police are confident there are no other suspects, Deveau said. ""These two acted together and alone,"" he said. ""As far as this little cell and this little group, I think we got our guys.""

Jenny Dawson: I was researching food waste in 2010 and realized the scale of it, the implications both financially and environmentally. I wanted to do something about it. With my own eyes, I saw mountains of mangoes coming in from Kenya which looked perfect to me but for some reason they were being thrown away. It evoked a reaction in me. I thought there must be something I can do with this - I want to make a brand that champion-s things that others overlook. CNN: What inspired to you to turn this project into a business? JD: People were saying why don't you become a charity?  But I was really passionate about becoming a business that solved social problems. We live in a capitalist society where businesses take change and I was hoping we could be an example of a business that really made a social impact throughout our supply chain. CNN: How has the response been so far? JD: There's been an amazing response to our product, people really get behind it. In general, the supermarkets as well as the UK government have really gone behind it  - people talk about it now and are trying to address this.

"Within two weeks of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, the head of U.S. special forces issued orders that all photos of the body be either turned in or destroyed, a newly released document shows. In an e-mail dated May 13, 2011, then-Vice Adm. William McRaven wrote the following: ""One particular item that I want to emphasize is photos; particularly UBLs remains. At this point -- all photos should have been turned over to the CIA; if you still have them destroy them immediately or get them to the [redacted.]"" The e-mail was obtained by the conservative activist group Judicial Watch, which has called for the public release of photos of the raid in Pakistan that killed the al Qaeda leader. The e-mail, which was almost entirely redacted, was released under a Freedom of Information Act request. See a PDF of the redacted e-mail . Days before McRaven's instructions, Judicial Watch had filed a FOIA request for such photos, and hours before, they filed a lawsuit, according to the group's president, Tom Fitton. ""Despite there being multiple requests for this information, and a lawsuit for this information, there was a directive that was sent out, to who knows who, to destroy records,"" he said. ""It may have been in violation of the law,"" he said. It is not clear whether any photos of bin Laden's remains were actually destroyed. Through a spokesman, McRaven declined to comment. Retired Gen. James ""Spider"" Marks, a CNN military analyst, says if McRaven ordered photos deleted, he may have been trying to protect operational secrets, sources and methods and trying to make sure no commandos kept any photos or video of the covert raid that they were not authorized to keep. ""It wouldn't be surprising if they shook them down, and they said 'OK, I want to make sure you don't have something that's hidden away someplace,' "" he said. In the days after the raid, President Barack Obama said he would not authorize the release of any images of bin Laden's corpse, saying it would create a security risk. Osama bin Laden: The fast facts . ""It is important for us to make sure that very graphic photos of somebody who was shot in the head are not floating around as an incitement to additional violence, as a propaganda tool,"" the president told CBS news magazine ""60 Minutes."" Former FBI Assistant Director Tom Fuentes said he would have similar concerns if photos of the terrorist's body were made public. ""You would see those images forever on television,"" he said. ""That could lead to more recruitment of future al Qaeda members, making him a martyr."" Fitton is not persuaded by that argument. ""Americans' right to know about what their government is up to should be circumscribed because we don't want to offend terrorists and their sympathizers? That to me is unbelievable,"" he said. ""This is a historic raid. People have a right to this information."" But so far, the courts have not sided with Judicial Watch on that question, and the Supreme Court declined to hear the organization's appeal.

"The body of one of the two men accused of pulling off the Boston Marathon attack has been buried in rural Virginia -- a development that local officials said caught them totally ""off guard."" Tamerlan Tsarnaev's remains were accepted ""by an interfaith coalition in that community -- they responded to our calls,"" his uncle Ruslan Tsarni, of Maryland, told CNN. The body was buried in an unmarked grave in a Muslim cemetery in Doswell, Virginia, according to Tsarni. ""My tradition was that of a Muslim, and I have that tradition of burial, and people helped me with that,"" he said in a phone interview. The death certificate released by Massachusetts authorities indicates that Tsarnaev, whose cause of death was listed as gunshot wounds and ""blunt trauma to (his) head and torso,"" was interred at Al-Barzakh Muslim Cemetery in Doswell, which is about 25 minutes north of Richmond in a rural county of about 30,000 people. While the news came out Friday, Bukhari Abdel-Alim from the Islamic Funeral Services of Richmond said Tsarnaev was actually buried the previous morning. Speaking Friday from the cemetery, which his organization owns, Abdel-Alim said there was ""no intention to ... make anybody angry,"" but that he and others felt obligated to do what ""God says to do"" by putting Tsarnaev's ""body back into the earth."" ""It's not a political thing (but) he can't bury himself,"" said Abdel-Alim, adding his only regret was that Tsarnaev ""wasn't buried sooner."" ""...Whether he was Christian, Muslim, Jewish, atheist, when you're dead you need to be buried or taken care of, not just left in a funeral home."" Police in Worcester, Massachusetts, had announced Thursday a ""courageous and compassionate individual came forward"" to take Tsarnaev's remains out of Worcester, where the body had been at a funeral home while Tsarni and officials tried to determine what to do with it. The chairman of the Caroline County, Virginia, board of supervisors, Floyd W. Thomas, said Friday afternoon he couldn't then confirm or deny that Tsarnaev is buried in his county and that he hadn't seen the death certificate. As he pointed out, ""standard practice"" is that local officials are not notified that a burial is taking place. According to Thomas and county Sheriff Tony Lippa, neither they or any other officials in the county knew about plans to bury Tsarnaev in that area. They were not consulted, nor did they provide permission for such a burial to happen, said Thomas. At the least, he later told CNN, county officials ""would have preferred to be in a position to ... prepare for it a little better."" News of Tsarnaev's burial in the county upset residents like Rhonda Richardson, who said she thinks the body should have been taken to where his parents are in southern Russia. ""He killed Americans on American soil, therefore he shouldn't be buried here,"" she told CNN. At Friday's press conference, Thomas acknowledged residents' concerns and said ""I understand how you feel, and I feel the same way."" He said Caroline County does not want to be associated with such a ""terrible crime"" that took place more than 500 miles away, even though Tsarnaev has ""no ties to Caroline County."" ""We do not wish to be the home of the remains of one of those perpetrators,"" he said. Lippa, the county's sheriff, said members of Virginia Attorney General Kenneth Cuccinelli's office are also looking into the matter ""to make sure all legalities were being followed."" But unless something wasn't done right -- in which case, Thomas said, ""we would look into undoing what happened"" -- officials' hands are tied, he said. ""As long as everything was done legally, there's really very little that we can do,"" Thomas said. Officials were also concerned about securing the private cemetery against possible trespassing protesters or those who might attempt to deface the grave site. While a sheriff's deputy was stationed there Friday, officials said the county does not have money set aside to provide security. It's all a headache that Thomas, for one, never saw coming. ""Of all the localities in the United States, this was probably the last one we would have thought of,"" he said. What would happen to the body of the man who, along with his younger brother, Dzhokhar, was accused of setting off two deadly explosions at the Boston Marathon on April 15 had been a nearly month-long puzzle. The body of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, killed in a police pursuit days after the bombings, went unclaimed for nearly two weeks. A funeral home in Worcester -- about 40 miles west of downtown Boston -- eventually accepted the remains. But protesters in Worcester made it clear they didn't want the body buried there, with one holding a sign that read, ""Bury the garbage in the landfill."" And the city manager of Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Tsarnaev lived, said he would not allow Tsarnaev to be buried in the city, asserting that possible protests and media coverage would disrupt the community. It also appeared that sending the body overseas was an unlikely option -- Tamerlan Tsarnaev's parents in the Russian region of Dagestan said they would not fly his body back to Russia for burial, citing passport problems, spokeswoman Heda Saratova said. In a press release issued Friday, the Islamic Society of Greater Richmond said that a ""private Virginia citizen"" and licensed counselor named Martha Mullen ""quietly coordinated efforts to resolve the problem of where to bury Tsarnaev's remains."" That included e-mails exchanged with representatives of the church she belonged to, as well as local Muslim, Jewish and Hindu representatives. She contacted Worcester police ""after receiving an offer of a burial plot from the administration of the Islamic Funeral Services of Virginia,"" the society said. Mullen also talked with her local pastor about the moral implications of her spearheading the effort. ""Jesus tells us, 'Love your enemies,' "" she said, according to the Islamic Society. ""Not to hate them, even after they are dead."" Abdel-Alim, who is vice president of the Islamic Funeral Services of Virginia and attended Thursday's burial, stressed Friday ""there is no agreement with (Tsarnaev's) actions, whatsover, in any form or fashion."" At the same time, he said ""somebody needed to take responsibility."" ""We were able to do so, and that's what we did,"" he said. Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, appeared confused by Thursday's announcement from Worcester police. Speaking to CNN from Russia by phone Thursday evening, Zubeidat Tsarnaev said she didn't know whether her son was buried or where. Tsarni -- who was the main point of contact over what to do with Tamerlan Tsarnaev's remains, according to Abdel-Alim -- said Friday that he called his nephew's father Thursday ""to give him an update, but I did not tell him where he was buried."" ""He didn't even ask me,"" Tsarni said. Zubeidat Tsarnaev told CNN in late April that her husband couldn't travel to the United States, saying he was too ill. She said she eventually would be interested in heading to the United States to see her younger son, despite pending shoplifting charges against her in Massachusetts, where she once lived. Tsarni said Friday he was ""completely outraged that (the parents) have not been here for their children."" ""My assumption is that they must be here, just to help with the investigation at least,"" Tsarni said.","""It's not a political thing (but) he can't bury himself,"" an Islamic group official says .

"Riot police evicted scores of protesters from Taiwan's executive building early Monday morning as rallies over a controversial trade deal between Taiwan and mainland China entered their seventh day. Hundreds of protesters stormed the Executive Yuan in Taipei on Sunday evening, shortly after Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou dismissed protesters' demands to scrap a service trade agreement with China. Opponents of the deal say it could harm Taiwan's economy, democratic system and national security. Police used high-pressure water cannons to disperse the demonstrators, who were mostly university students. Meanwhile, other protesters continue their sit-in at the nearby legislature building, where they have been since March 18. ""We are tired, very tired. But we will continue on for democracy,"" a spokesperson for the movement, Lin Fei-fan told CNN on Monday. ""We have been protesting for seven days now. After last night's violence we are shaken,"" he said. Lin estimated there were up to 200 protesters inside the Legislative Yuan's main assembly hall Monday, with more outside the building. ""Last night many students were injured and bloodied, some got concussions and bone fractures,"" he said. According to Taiwan's Central News Agency, at least 137 people, including protesters, police and journalists, have been hospitalized since the rallies began last week. Most had minor injuries. Taiwan's premier Jiang Yi-huah said some 61 people were arrested for breaking into the executive building, including 35 who were still being questioned as of Monday morning, CNA reported. Dubbed the ""Sunflower Movement"" by Taiwanese media, the protesters are calling on the government to scrap a controversial trade deal which was signed in Shanghai last year. They say the agreement will threaten small business and allow China to exert greater influence in the island through investments in ""sensitive and core industries,"" including those associated with press freedom such as publishing and advertising. On Sunday, Taiwan's President Ma Ying-jeou defended the pact with China -- the island's biggest trade partner -- and said that it would benefit the economy and create jobs for young people. ""Regional economic integration is an unstoppable global trend. If we do not face this and join in the process, it will only be a matter of time before we are eliminated from the competition. For the sake of the nation's development, we truly have no choice,"" Ma said. Some Taiwanese believe parts of the agreement are beneficial to Taiwan's future, but many are incensed by what they believe were procedural errors in passing the pact. ""We feel that the content of the agreement was developed in 'black box' negotiations,"" protest leader Lin said. ""The opinions of workers were not consulted and it was passed without deliberation. This is against our democratic principles."" Taiwan and China signed the trade pact in June last year, but a review of the deal has been delayed in the legislature. On March 17, the governing party Kuomintang pushed the pact forward without bipartisan deliberation, a move that the opposition said broke an agreement that all legislators would consider the deal line by line. The Kuomintang has since agreed to review the pact one clause at a time during a second reading of the deal. President Ma is taking a hard stance against the students. His government did not respond to a March 21 ultimatum by protesters to issue an apology for the deal. On Sunday, Ma appeared in public to address the protests for the first time: . ""Is this the kind of democracy that we want? The foundation of democracy is rule of law -- adhering to the rule of law is fundamental to our statehood,"" Ma said. The protesters have called for a students' strike across Taiwan commencing Monday. Student unions from four major universities said they will participate. The director of the National Tsing-Hua University's Institute of Sociology said in a statement that all classes at the institute will be called off for one week. If the government gives the student protesters a ""satisfactory response,"" classes will resume immediately, he said. According to Lin, the protest leader, at least 1,000 students were taking part in the strike as of Monday afternoon. He said that the Taiwanese public has welcomed their campaign. ""I feel that most Taiwanese are supportive of us. They have been very warm towards us. We see parents bringing their kids to come and visit us,"" Lin said. Although Taiwan governs itself as the Republic of China, with Beijing considering it a breakaway province, relations between the former rivals have improved since Ma took office in 2008. Last month, Taiwan and mainland China held their highest-level talks in more than six decades. The meeting marked the first government-to-government contact since their split in 1949 following the Chinese Civil War. After the talks, they agreed to open a regular communication channel, China's state media Xinhua reported.","Riot police disperse protesters who stormed Taiwan's executive building .

"China has once again been rocked by a violent attack targeting civilians after two SUVs plowed into people gathered at an open market in Urumqi, the capital of the western Chinese region of Xinjiang. Explosives were tossed from the vehicles, before one of the SUVs exploded, leaving many shoppers dead or wounded on the streets as flames and smoke billowed from the scene. The incident left 31 dead and more than 90 others hurt, according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency. The brazen act was described by China's Ministry of Public Security as ""a serious violent terrorist incident"" and it vowed to crack down on the perpetrators. It was the latest in a series of deadly attacks in public places in China in the past few months. It also put the spotlight once again on Xinjiang, a region with a long history of friction between Han Chinese, China's biggest and most dominant ethnic group, and the indigenous Uyghurs, a mainly Turkic-speaking Muslim population. What happened in the recent attacks? -- April 30, 2014: After Chinese President Xi Jinping had wrapped up a visit to Xinjiang, an explosion rocked the South Railway Station of Urumqi, followed by a knife attack at the same location. Three people died and 79 others were injured in the attacks, according to Xinhua, as ""knife-wielding mobs"" attacked people at one of the station's exits following the blast. Two people, described as religious extremists and part of the East Turkistan Islamic Movement, were blamed for the incident. Both died in the blast. -- March 1, 2014: Twenty-nine people were killed and 130 were injured when 10 men armed with long knives stormed the station in the southwest Chinese city of Kunming. Kunming railway station is one of the largest in southwest China. Witnesses described men clad in black outfits stabbing and attacking people with cleavers and knives. Local government officials told Xinhua that evidence at the crime scene indicated ""it was orchestrated by Xinjiang separatist forces."" -- October 28, 2013: Chinese authorities indicated a Xinjiang connection when a jeep plowed into crowds in Tiananmen Square, killing five and injuring at least 40. Who are the Uyghurs? The Uyghurs are a predominantly Muslim ethnic group who live in Xinjiang, an area the size of Iran that is rich in natural resources, including oil. The province shares borders with Mongolia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan and India. Uyghurs, who speak a language related to Turkish, regard themselves as culturally and ethnically close to central Asia, despite a long history of Chinese rule. Since the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Xinjiang, which means ""new frontier"" in Chinese, has enjoyed varying levels of autonomy. In 1933, rebels declared independence and created the short-lived Islamic Republic of East Turkistan. The Chinese Communist Party took over the territory in 1949 and in 1955 it was declared an autonomous region, giving it a status similar to that of Tibet, which lies to the south of Xinjiang. Why do Uyghurs resent Chinese rule? Over the decades, waves of Han Chinese migrants arrived in the region, displacing Uyghurs from their traditional lands and fueling tensions. Xinjiang is now home to more than 8 million Han Chinese, up from 220,000 in 1949, and 10 million Uyghurs. The newcomers take most of the new jobs, and unemployment among Uyghurs is high. They complain of discrimination and harsh treatment by security forces, despite official promises of equal rights and ethnic harmony. Activists say that a campaign is being waged to weaken the Uyghurs' religious and cultural traditions and that the education system undermines use of the Uyghur language. Why is China concerned about the Uyghurs? Simmering tensions have erupted into riots. The worst violence in decades took place in July 2009, when rioting in Urumqi between Uyghurs and Han Chinese killed some 200 people and injured 1,700. That unrest was followed by a crackdown by security forces. Beijing says Uyghur groups want to establish an independent state and, because of the Uyghurs' cultural ties to their neighbors, leaders fear that elements may back a separatist movement in Xinjiang. What could be triggering attacks in Xinjiang? It could be multiple factors, but China is increasing its grip over Xinjiang society, said James Leibold, senior lecturer of politics and Asian studies at La Trobe University in Melbourne. President Xi's administration views Xinjiang ""as a crucial backdoor into central Asia"" -- one that could provide a new Silk Road and economic opportunities. There are also natural resources in the province. China has quadrupled internal security budget in Xinjiang, he said. ""It has increased armed patrols as well as security cameras in the region."" At the same time, China has also injected money to boost economic development amongst the Ugyhur minority and the Han Chinese who live in Xinjiang, Leibold added. Is the violence in Xinjiang getting worse? ""I think these things are cyclical in nature,"" said Leibold, an expert on Chinese ethnic policy relations. ""If you look at Xinjiang over the last 60-plus years it's been under Chinese Communist Party rule, the violence ebbs and flows."" The 1950s were particularly bloody, as was the Cultural Revolution, and violence was reported in the late 1990s and early 2000s, he said. ""It's impossible to confirm that ethnic violence has increased,"" he said. ""The government puts out statistics and all the information we get are bits and pieces."" The Chinese government blames what it calls three evil forces: Separatism, extremism and terrorism. What is significant in recent violence is that the target of the attacks appear to be shifting to civilians from security forces, he said. ""We have seen targeting of innocent civilians and places, an attempt to maim innocent civilians in large numbers,"" Leibold said. ""This violence has seeped outside of Xinjiang autonomous region,"" he added, referring to the incidents in Tiananmen and the Kunming train station several months ago. Are there Uyghur terrorist groups? Some say the threats from Uyghur separatist groups have been exaggerated and that little of the violence inside Xinjiang should be considered terrorism. They also say that the civil unrest is carried out by individuals or small groups, rather than an organized militant group. However, Uyghur groups have claimed responsibility for bus bombs in Shanghai and Yunnan prior to the Olympics in 2008. The Chinese government blamed an attempted hijacking of a flight in 2012 on Uyghurs. The U.S. State Department listed the East Turkestan Islamic Movement as a terrorist organization in 2002 in the wake of the September 11 attacks during a period of increased cooperation with China on security matters. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, some 22 Uyghurs were rounded up in Pakistan and Afghanistan and detained at Guantanamo Bay. The final three ethnic Uyghurs were released from Guantanamo to Slovakia where they were ""voluntarily"" resettled early last year.","Violent attack in Urumqi open market brings spotlight on Xinjiang .

"At first, it's hard to tell what these extraordinary works are made from. Kate Rohde's giant, glowing sculptures resemble backlit jewels, as if they have been carved out of phosphorescent rock. A luminous green box appears to be crafted from fine jade, even if its large size and intricate detail make this implausible. Another piece, labeled a ""crystal marsupial"", is a translucent purple figure which twists to reveal what looks like a glittering core of amethysts. In fact, all of these objects are sculpted from a resin which has become Rohde's signature medium as an artist and jeweler. These synthetic resins are so versatile that they can be molded into huge structures, or cut and polished to achieve the luster of gems. Over the past decade, Rohde has shaped this material into fantastic sculptures, including a fluorescent garden filled with jewels and creatures and a pair of turquoise crystal horns which can be worn as a headpiece. Rohde is fascinated by the morphology of animals and minerals, and her works often have the air of natural history specimens, given a psychedelic twist with their rainbow pigments and exaggerated shapes. One of her characteristic installations is a baroque display case stuffed with a variety of dazzling, incongruous objects: a neon skeleton, an artificial heart, a bright stalactite. For the Australian artist, there is an excitement about reinventing organic forms and traditional tableaux in day-glo colors, resulting in a mash-up of historical styles. She admits that she is ""always drawn to an eclectic mix of influences, things which are aesthetically excessive and colorful and blingy."" These display cases are a combination of 19th century diorama and modern fashion editorial, in which scientific models are imbued with futuristic glamor. In addition to her acclaimed gallery work, Rohde has had a long association with fashion and jewelry design. In 2010, she collaborated with fashion designers Anna Plunkett and Luke Sales of the Sydney label Romance Was Born to produce a Jurassic-themed collection called Renaissance Dinosaur, featuring models in crystal-studded breastplates and multi-colored antlers. She also worked with Romance Was Born to produce a series of fabrics -- and even a line of wallpaper -- depicting a maze of flora and fauna in acid colors. For Rohde, it makes sense to move between exhibitions, high fashion, and ready-to-wear items, since it allows her to work with ""vastly differing scales and functionality. Different fields bring unique challenges, but resin is quite a forgiving material, with flexibility and wide scope for experimentation. It can be built up and cut down in extreme ways."" Working on jewelry enables Rohde to perfect the precise cutting she uses for her gallery pieces, while ambitious sculptural ideas often find their way into her accessories. A crystal bird perched on a cuff functions as both a bracelet and a free-standing sculpture. Rohde's jewelry line ranges from chunky bangles in cartoon colors to striking but ethereal pieces, such as a cluster of rose-pink shards jutting out from the wrist. An iridescent blue ring with two bug-eye ""gems"" foregrounds the artist's sense of humor, while a pair of shimmering earrings with scalloped edges is both delicate and flashy. Resin allows multiple color changes to be incorporated into one piece, so that a ring graduates from milky white to translucent pink, and a cuff shows shades of blue seeping into yellow. It is important to Rohde that the transition to wearable art is made without losing the outlandish and distinctive quality of her style. Her designs for jewelry often draw on the same techniques as her sculptures: in particular, the use of ""acrylic icing"" to give an opalescent sheen to surfaces, as seen in her pearl-colored rings. At the same time, she is able to embrace the contradictions of working in both the art world and the luxury market, making sumptuous designs out of faux gems and applying painstaking modeling to synthetic materials. Some of Rohde's fashion collaborations can currently be seen at the National Gallery of Victoria. In the meantime, she is busy researching ideas for new sculptures. Her next exhibition at Melbourne's Karen Woodbury Gallery will have a geological focus, combining crystal structures with mixed media such as technicolor hair extensions she sources in Japan and a kind of plastic which can be dyed in hot water. She also intends to work the geological theme into her accessories: ""I think of my jewelry as small-scale sculptures, like a three-dimensional print with a small edition run. The only difference is that with jewelery, there has to be some serious consideration of the function and how it's worn, whereas a sculpture can be much more impractical.""

"Does your baby cry during long flights, causing you to want to disappear from the glares of fellow passengers? One airline is offering a perk that means your fussy baby would no longer be your problem. Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways offers free ""Flying Nannies"" to tend to children on long flights, according to a report from the Daily Mail. Consider it the ultimate in concierge service for parents, who can hand off their little ones to crew members who have been trained to care for their children. Hungry kid? No worries, the Flying Nanny can feed your progeny early. Bored to tears? The group is trained to entertain even the squirmiest of tots. The nannies are obvious by their orange aprons, and even trained are even trained in child psychology. The service helped Etihad, the national airline of the United Arab Emirates, win Best Up in the Air Experience distinction from the Future Travel Experience Awards in September. The award drew more attention to the nanny program. ""Across the carrier's existing fleet, travellers in all classes can also enjoy a range of other amenities ranging from the 'Flying Nanny' onboard childcare service and next-generation in-flight entertainment, to onboard menus created by a hand-selected team of world-class chefs,"" according to an FTE Awards release. ""Flying with a young family can be a daunting task, even for the most experienced travellers, and the Flying Nanny role demonstrates our understanding of our guests' needs and our commitment to making the journey as relaxing and comfortable as possible,"" said Aubrey Tiedt, vice president of guest services for the airline. ""The Flying Nanny will liaise with parents and use their experience and knowledge to make the travel experience easier."" Adam Weissenberg, vice chairman and U.S. leader of Deloitte's travel, hospitality and leisure sector, told USA Today that the airline was creative and forward thinking in offering the service. But swaying parents -- even those anxious to get a little help with their kids -- will still come down to dollars and cents he said. ""At the end of the day, travelers still look at price first,"" Weissenberg said. ""However, if prices are close or equal, perks like these could well sway a traveler's decision.""","Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways offers on-board nannies to care for children .

"New research focusing on underage Mexican immigrants trying to cross the border illegally into the United States shows these minors don't put aside their American dream easily, even if caught multiple times by immigration authorities. According to a new report published by the Pew Research Center, out of 11,000 Mexican minors who tried to cross the border illegally between last October 1 and May 31, ""only 2,700 children (24% of all the apprehensions) reported being apprehended for the first time in their lives."" This means that more than three-quarters of the children have been caught trying to cross the border illegally more than once.  According to the report, 15% of these would-be migrants had been detained by immigration authorities and deported at least six times. Mark Hugo Lopez, Director of Hispanic Research at the Pew Research Center, said his team started analyzing the data with no preconceived notions. ""We had no sense of how many times young people from Mexico had tried to cross the border,"" Lopez said.  ""In conversations with officials at the Mexican embassy we found out they had very specific data about the minors apprehended by immigration authorities, information that they have been collecting."" The data from Mexican officials was then checked against data collected by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and researchers found there was correlation.  U.S. immigration authorities notify Mexican consular officials of apprehensions per agreements between the two nations. When it comes to reasons why these children are choosing to leave home, Lopez said poverty and increased violence are the two main factors. ""Most of these young children are coming from border states, particularly Tamaulipas (south of Texas) which accounts for more than one quarter (3,077) of all those apprehended,"" Lopez said.  Other Mexican states with large number of migrant children are Sonora, which is south of Arizona, 1,160; Oaxaca, 884; Guerrero, 750: Guanajuato, 716; and Michoacán, 645. Tamaulipas has been plagued by violence over the last few years as two rival Mexican criminal organizations battle for territory.  Michoacán saw an increase in violence over the last year as groups of vigilantes took up arms to drive away a drug cartel. Unlike Central American children, Mexican minors are deported almost immediately.  A 2008 human trafficking law requires migrant children to be processed by the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR).  But the law doesn't apply to minors from the two U.S. neighbors to the north and south, Canada and Mexico. Lopez said there are also demographic differences between Central Americans and Mexicans. ""Central Americans are traveling a long distance, so crossing a second time is not very easy.  Another big difference is that most Mexican underage migrants are males in their late teens, whereas Central Americans come in all ages, some younger than 12, and the number of girls tends to be higher,"" he said.","A Pew Center report looked at attempted illegal border crossings by Mexican minors .
The report counted 11,000 who tried to cross between October 1 and May 31 .
Fifteen percent of those minors had been caught and deported at least six times .
Poverty and violence in Mexico are often reasons children leave home for the U.S."
"(CNN) -- It's all about money. That great big money pit where hypocrisy lives and science goes to die. Take climate change. Yeah, I hear some of you. You don't ""believe in it,"" as though global warming is some kind of religion. Well, it sort of is. But it has little to do with God and everything to do with the color green. I discovered just how cynical I am about that ""money pit"" when I sat down recently with Chloe Maxmin, a 22-year-old climate activist and senior at Harvard University whose idealism shines as bright as the North Star. I asked her why the issue is so important. ""Climate change is affecting everything I love and everything I care about,"" Maxmin told me. ""My values at the moment lie around mitigating climate change and doing something about this impending crisis that is going to affect my generation and billions of people around the world."" That's quite a challenge, I said to her. Let's face it, there are powerful people out there who think scientists are elitist, politicized job killers. ""If we come at this from a place of love,"" Maxmin responded, ""this infinite wellspring of energy that we can draw on, then it's hard to believe that we can't achieve a better world."" But I just don't see a genuine love for the planet these days. Money and politics are powerful motivators. It's why some really smart people discount the fact there is a 97% consensus among scientific experts that the Earth is getting warmer and human beings are in part to blame. The incoming Senate majority leader, Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell, told the Cincinnati Enquirer's editorial board that he doesn't know if climate change is a real problem because he's ""not a scientist."" McConnell added, ""I am interested in protecting Kentucky's economy, I'm interested in having low-cost electricity."" Then, he asserted that, ""...in the 1970s, people feared an Ice Age was imminent."" Actually, only a handful of scientists feared another Ice Age. The Christian Science Monitor points to MIT's climatologist Richard Lindzen, a climate-change skeptic, to prove the point. Lindzen wrote this for the (conservative) Cato Institute in 1992: . ""Indeed, the global cooling trend of the 1950s and 1960s led to a minor global cooling hysteria in the 1970s. ... But the scientific community never took the issue to heart, governments ignored it, and with rising global temperatures in the late 1970s the issue more or less died."" Let's return to 2014. A discounted Ice Age analogy comes in handy when, like McConnell, you come from a state that depends on fossil fuel for jobs, and you're lobbied relentlessly by an industry with money to burn. According to OpenSecrets.org: ""Companies with interests in oil and gas contributed more than $70 million to federal candidates in the 2012 cycle, more than double the total contributed in 2010."" It goes on to cite, ""Political donations from the industry -- which includes gas producers and refiners, natural gas pipeline companies, gasoline stations, and fuel oil dealers -- have taken on an increasingly conservative tint over the past two decades. In the 2012 cycle, 90% of its contributions went to the GOP."" Mitch McConnell, by the way, received more than 1.2 million in campaign dollars from oil, coal and gas entities. Now, I can't know for sure whether McConnell's ""disbelief"" in climate change is swayed by that great big money pit because, let's face it, Kentucky depends on the coal industry for thousands of jobs and McConnell would not be in office if he didn't support the industry. Maxmin recognizes that economic fact, but she's also absolutely sure ""that a lot of climate denial comes from the fossil fuel industry buying off politicians, propagating climate denial."" So, how exactly would Maxmin's ""infinite wellspring of energy"" beat out $70 million and save the planet? Her solution is to fight fire with fire. Maxmin figured that if people like her can persuade Harvard to divest its $36 billion endowment from fossil fuel companies, it would send a powerful message to not only the fossil fuel industry but also our politicians. She has co-founded Divest Harvard to do just that. Stanford University has already decided it will no longer directly invest in coal mining companies because it has a responsibility to consider ""corporate policies or practices (that) create substantial social injury."" Harvard is fighting climate change, too. The university has an enviably small carbon footprint and its scientists are among the most respected for their work in global warming. But so far, the university has refused to divest because its president, Drew Faust, says divestment is ""likely to have a negligible financial impact on the affected companies."" CNN reached out to Faust and received no response. Just as McConnell's state depends on the coal industry for jobs, Harvard depends on the industry, too. Harvard has the world's largest university endowment with $32.7 billion. As Faust points out, Harvard ""counts on the fund to finance more than a third of its operating budget."" Maxmin is unmoved. ""We think that Harvard is not a corporation and that profit shouldn't be our main motivator,"" she told me. ""Our main motivator should be about the students. And how can we invest in fossil fuel companies that are threatening our futures? It's an immoral bet against my generation."" Keep in mind, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of hundreds of scientists, determined climate change has already affected ""agriculture, human health, ecosystems...(and) water supplies."" French President Francois Hollande said global warming could lead to war. Even the U.S. Defense Department says climate change poses an ""immediate risk to national security."" And still, powerful politicians say, ""I'm not a scientist."" And Harvard still feels pulling its investments out of fossil fuels would ""diminish the influence or voice we might have with this industry."" I understand where both sides are coming from, but it still bugs me. And it bugs Maxmin. ""When you're talking about climate activism, I agree that we are seen as radical, but the science is so straightforward. And what's radical is ignoring the science. What's radical is continuing to use fossil fuels. What's radical is a government that refuses to address climate change."" Need I say more?","Carol Costello: 97% of scientists agree on climate change, yet there are deniers .

"(CNN) -- In 2010, Ugandan journalist Gladys Kalibala embarked on a mission to bring attention to her country's lost and abandoned children. Using the power of print, she started a newspaper column and more than four years later the award-winning writer has helped many youngsters reunite with their families and overcome a sense of hopelessness. While writing her ""Lost And Abandoned Children"" column for New Vision, one of Uganda's leading newspapers, Kalibala came into contact with several forgotten children, some of whom had been born into extreme poverty or suffered from abuse. Through the success of her features, Kalibala was able to rapidly increase awareness of the ongoing plight faced by many local children. And yet she felt the need to do more. As a result, she started putting her contact details at the end of each article, encouraging readers to contact her and contribute what they could for many of these scared and neglected kids. ""I really thank my readers because they always turn up, their response is always good,"" says Kalibala. ""They come up and give assistance where some of these children have been taken to school because of their sponsorship."" A mother to many . Today Kalibala has become known as a mother to many of these motherless children -- and in turn she considers them her own. What's most important to her however is that these children receive an education; Kalibala often pays tuition fees for many of these kids out of her own pocket, in addition to the funds provided by some of her supportive readers. ""I end up being the mother,"" says Kalibala, who takes an active role in the kids' lives by regularly checking their school reports to ensure that they're on the right track. ""They call me ""mother,"" they call me ""grandy,"" they call me all sorts of names and I end up feeling so bad that I don't want to abandon them... So I've ended up paying school fees for many of them although I'm getting very little money because as a freelance it's really not the best thing. You have to struggle a lot."" Tough childhood . The journalist's compassion stems primarily from her childhood; she was born into a family of 19 children and was raised by her grandfather after her father, who had two wives, abandoned the family for another woman. ""While growing up with my grandfather, I learnt a lot of things from him,"" recalls Kalibala. ""He was a reverend, a born again and he loved to help needy people. We used to have a lot of people in our home. We used to get visitors in the night, those ones who have failed to get transport, those ones who didn't have anywhere to sleep. We would always share food with them."" After her grandfather's death however, Kalibala was forced to drop out of school in order to look after her siblings. To do so, she worked several jobs with the hopes of returning to school at a later stage. When her brother started working in Zambia he offered to pay for her to take a course in journalism. But before he could fulfill his promise, Kalibala's brother died. Nonetheless, Kalibala was determined to make a name for herself and enrolled herself in a course in Uganda. Her luck changed when she began her career in journalism after being offered a job as a features writer at New Vision. Later on, a chance meeting at a police station, where two families were fighting over an abandoned child, let her to begin writing her column and become the voice of the voiceless in Uganda. Kalibala, who hopes to start a foundation whereby she can raise more awareness and support for these children by providing them with shelter and education, says the horrors many of these kids have had to overcome only strengthens her resolve to work harder. ""We have to come together; we have to pull out our resources; we have to give care; we have to really work together to see that we help all these needy children we see around,"" she says. ""If we empower them this will maybe help us reduce that number of abandoned children.""

"Corfu's tourism board should thank Vasilis Metallinos and John Miliadis. ""Corfu Nightscapes -- A Company of Stars"" is the pair's stunning five-minute video comprising 60,000 photos taken between 2010 and 2014 by Metallinos. If you're not inspired to head to Greece after seeing it, you probably didn't full-screen this tribute to Hellenic beauty. The music is composed by Miliadis. Metallinos, 29, became interested in astronomy a decade ago and has been practicing astrophotography for the last seven years. What's on his list of must-have equipment and his secrets for capturing a ""bigger"" moon? He shared that and more with CNN. CNN: What inspired you to create this gorgeous video? Vasilis Metallinos: This is my fifth time-lapse video so far and it was inspired by my love for Corfu island, my birthplace -- its long and rich history, breathtaking landscapes and my passion for the night sky. It's a dreamy, magical thing to look up in the sky and watch the stars, our neighbors, traveling to distant lands! CNN: What makes Corfu a good place for stargazing? Metallinos: Corfu's night sky is not perfect but we still enjoy dark skies and see lot of celestial objects within the city walls of the Old Town of Corfu -- a UNESCO World Heritage Site -- next to our monuments. What could be more beautiful than seeing Saturn's rings or clouds and Jupiter's Great Red Spot from the Esplanade Square, one of the largest squares in Europe with Venetian fortifications and French and English buildings? Corfu also has an important astronomical heritage. The first Astronomical Society of Greece was founded in Corfu in [1927] by French astronomer Felix Lamech. Both Lamech and the Corfiot astronomer Ioannis Fokas have a lunar crater named after them and Fokas also has an eponymous Mars crater. CNN: What's your advice for budding astrophotographers? Metallinos: Experience and knowledge are the most valuable tools. One needs to know how the celestial objects move and how to capture them with the camera. Until you get better, take as many photos as you can. Astrophotography requires patience. The weather isn't always our ally and we often have to wait for more than a month for a clear sky. One shouldn't give up easily, otherwise you might miss that one special photo that could come when you least expect it. CNN: What equipment do you use? Metallinos: A photo camera that can capture long-exposure images, a tripod and a remote control for the camera. I started with a DSLR Canon EOS 40D and a tripod. Now I also have three other DSLR's for nightscapes and landscapes. Some are specially modified to capture in infrared. I've got some CCD cameras especially for planetary photography, like the DBK 21 camera. I also use telephoto lenses like EF70-200 f2.8 or EF100-400mm f4 as well as telescopes like the SW ED80 f7.5 or Takahashi Toa130 f7.7. Also very useful is planetarium software like Stellarium, Carte du Ciel, Starrynight and Skysafari. They help you identify the stars or planets easily as well as calculate where the stellar objects will rise and set on the horizon. With software like The Photographer's Ephemeris (TPE), we can calculate where we should be. CNN: What are your favorite shots in the video? Metallinos: There are so many memorable ones. The one with the big fireball at 2:39 that blinded us and turned the sky blue or the one with the honeymooners and the lighthouse at 3:49 are good examples. For that shot, I was calculating for hours how to shoot my just-married sister inside the August full moon. But I (ended up) missing them by setting up the telescope just two meters wrong -- a very difficult shot when you're using a 1,000-millimeter telescope with almost 150 kilos of equipment. But my very best is the one with the Supermoon (when the full moon is at its closest point to Earth in its orbit) and the Old Fortress of Corfu at 3:21. The result would look great even if it was a cloudy night -- I set up in the right place at the right time. CNN: In some of the shots, the moon looks enormous -- how did you do that? Metallinos: You set up up the telephoto lens or a telescope at least a few kilometers away from the landscape you want to include in the shot. Use a lens with a long focal length to magnify the moon from afar. For example, the shot with the moon rising behind the Old Fortress was shot eight kilometers away using a 1,000-millimeter lens. Theoretically, you can capture a full moon every 29 days from a different azimuth 76° - 116° but it's actually challenging to shoot the moon due to the unpredictable weather and difficulty in getting the exact shooting angle correct. After calculating the exact point of the azimuth and setting up where you can put the landscape in the same shot, you'll then need a clear horizon. I manage to capture the moon only a few times every year. So the shots in the video are from 2010 till February 2014. CNN: The most time-consuming process is ... Metallinos: Some shots took more than eight to nine hours of continuous capturing. I climbed up the cliff with my camera and telescope for almost eight hours continuously to capture the shot with the trees. The shots with the moon took an hour or two, but it required an hour or two of pre-calculation for where to set up, and then we had to be there an hour earlier with the heavy equipment. But that is not the end -- we had to process thousands of raw pictures. It took me more than a month to archive my 200,000 pictures of time-lapse to a library of more than 1.5 million pictures I have. Then, it took us another month to create the video with the right shots and the right sound. CNN: The best places to photograph Corfu are ... Metallinos: To capture the old town of Corfu in the photograph, the best angle is from Kontokali Bay, about seven kilometers northwest of Corfu town. Other beautiful places with a nice dark sky include Chalikounas Beach (Lake Korission) in southwest Corfu and near Aggelokastro Castle just above Palaiokastritsa Bay. CNN: What are your favorite places to photograph Greece? Metallinos: I once captured nice star photographs from the Parnon mountains at Peloponnisos in southern Greece, with a perfect dark sky. Pelion at the city of Volos and the Gramos mountain range both yield beautiful photos.

"(CNN) -- A ball hasn't been kicked yet, but have we seen the World Cup's first own goal? Football fans around the world have been having their say on social media after FIFA announced the results of a slogan competition run by Korean car company Hyundai, one of the tournament's sponsors. The ""winning slogans,"" which will be emblazoned on team buses for the month-long event, are anything but in some fans' eyes. News that the Australian team bus will wear the words ""Socceroos: Hopping Our Way Into History!"" was met with derision. ""Whose mum came up with that ultra cheesy slogan?"" read one tweet. Australian Football Federation CEO David Gallop took an equally dim view of it as the country's 30-man preliminary squad for Brazil was announced. ""Don't worry too much about the other slogans that you might have read about. Just say, 'Go you Socceroos,' "" Gallop said, The Australian reported. Other national teams' nicknames have been put to better use, with Ghana's slogan perhaps being the highlight. The quarterfinalists in South Africa four years ago will travel in a bus bearing the phrase, ""Black Stars: Here to illuminate Brazil,"" while Ivory Coast's slogan, ""Elephants charging towards Brazil!"" also has some fun with the team's alias. Other teams, however, will have to make do with more enigmatic messages. One of the tournament favorites, Argentina, won't win any prizes for ""Not just a team, we are a country,"" and nor will 2006 champions Italy with ""Let's paint the World Cup dream blue."" The U.S. stick with the motoring theme with ""United By Team, Driven By Passion,"" while Dutch fans will hope the slogan ""Real Men Wear Orange"" can help steer the Netherlands all the way this time around after losing to Spain -- ""Inside our hearts, the passion of a champion"" -- in the 2010 final. ""In principle, at least, it was a good idea to run this competition ... but quite how significant and far-reaching having a slogan on the side of a bus is a moot point,"" Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at the UK's Coventry University, told CNN. ""Right now in sponsorship, and football generally, there is a big emphasis on fan engagement -- trying to get the fans as close as you possibly can to having an association with the sponsorship deal you are involved in,"" he told CNN. ""Effectively what you've got here is a collective view of what your country brand stands for. By using these slogans you are positioning your country as a brand in a particular way. ""So, if you look at Greece for example -- 'Heroes play like Greeks' -- you're then into Trojans, (being) resolute, and that works very, very well, and Japan -- ""Samurai, the time has come to fight! ""These are, in many ways, all very good positioning statements or very good brand slogans."" But Chadwick has some sympathy for Gallop and the Australian team. ""How is it that a commercial partner of FIFA rather than the football association itself decided what would be on the side of the bus?"" he says. ""I think there is a broader issue about corporate influence on the World Cup and on football in this. ""It's an issue about joined-up thinking. I can understand why FIFA has done this, but I don't think you can do it without involving the national association as well."" Here's the list in full. Let us know what you think. Algeria .

"Something incredible is happening this week in Alaska. People in more than 170 communities -- from Anchorage to Allakaket -- are planning to hold public ""Choose Respect"" rallies in honor of survivors of sexual and intimate partner violence. For the state with the highest rape rate in America, that's a massively important undertaking. It sends a message to people in the state and across the country that silence is the poison that lets rape and sexual violence continue. That enough is enough. ""We have extremely high rates of domestic violence and sexual violence in Alaska,"" said Katie TePas, a senior policy adviser to the governor. ""When victims and survivors see their communities standing up for them, they see a great deal of strength. ... And they see help, when they may not have ever sought help before."" It's a topic about which I care a great deal -- and I know you do, too. CNN readers voted for me to cover rape in the United States as part of my Change the List project. After spending more than two weeks in Alaska, I published a series of stories about why the rates of sexual violence are so shockingly high there -- and what could be done to change that. My biggest takeaway: People have to talk about this difficult issue. Otherwise, too many victims who come forward aren't believed. And too many suffer in silence, thinking they're to blame for what's happened to them. They're not alone, and these ""Choose Respect"" rallies are just the sort of awareness-raising events that could push Alaska off the bottom of the list. The demonstrations -- which are coordinated by the office of Alaska's Republican governor, Sean Parnell, and are sponsored by the state -- started in 2010 with only 18 communities participating, TePas told me. This year, she expects more than 170 communities. The rallies start Thursday and will continue through the weekend in some locations. I hope CNN readers will join the state in demanding an end to the violence there and elsewhere. Take a photo of yourself with a sign that says ""Choose Respect"" and upload it to Facebook, Instagram or Twitter with the hashtag #chooserespect. The images will appear on this page -- and maybe in future coverage. Parnell invited me to march with him in Alaska on Thursday. In a February 24 letter, he called CNN's coverage of rape in Alaska ""exceptional"" and said it ""pulled back the curtain and cast a new light on the issue"" of sexual violence. I'm unable to attend, but I appreciate the invitation. As for his kind words about the series, CNN shares the credit with the brave people in Alaska who told me their stories -- and with the dozens of readers and viewers who shared their stories of survival in solidarity with Alaskans. You can read some of those harrowing and heartfelt accounts on this page: ""We are the 59%."" Fifty-nine percent of women in Alaska face intimate partner or sexual violence in their lifetimes, including threats of violence. That statistic should horrify every American. And it should provoke action, as it already has for many. After the series, Marie Claire, Mother Jones, Salon and others took up the issue, too. On Thursday, as thousands of Alaskans are marching, my thoughts will be with all the incredible people I met on my trip to the state in December and those who shared their stories online. They will be with the people of Nunam Iqua, Alaska, which is one of a reported 75 communities that do not have any local law enforcement presence. A CNN reader started a petition asking the state government to change that. To date, I'm told that request has not been heeded. People there do not have access to the same level of justice as elsewhere in this nation. Unless geography determines a person's worth, that should change immediately. ""Where are the boots on the ground in our village?"" asked Russell Clark, principal of the school in Nunam Iqua and one of many people there who wants a local officer. Currently, state troopers usually must fly in from other villages to respond to emergencies -- a process that takes 45 minutes at best and sometimes, in bad weather, can take days. The state troopers have told me they're having difficulty finding someone who would take the job in Nunam Iqua. It's a tough economy these days, and I've been told funding is available for the position. If you'd like to apply, e-mail me (ctl@cnn.com) and put ""Nunam Iqua"" in the subject line. I'll be happy to connect you to the troopers. My thoughts will be with the young people who helped organize a panel discussion in Anchorage called ""NO MORE"" -- part of a national awareness-raising campaign. And, finally, my thoughts will be with Erin Merryn, a victim of child sexual assault from Illinois who, I'm told by a local lawmaker, will be traveling Alaska this week campaigning for a bill that would require state school districts to teach about the warning signs of child sexual abuse. Currently, Alaska does not require school districts to teach that essential information or sex education. The bill -- ""Erin's Law,"" which has been passed in ten other states, according to the group's Facebook page -- is expected to come before the Alaska House education committee on Friday. I hope her upcoming testimony will encourage legislators to push this bill forward. The lawmaker who proposed the legislation, Rep. Geran Tarr, an Anchorage Democrat, told me she's optimistic it can pass this session. She handed out copies of my articles, again, which CNN readers commissioned, in hopes representatives will realize the scope of this problem. ""It's really been a good conversation starter,"" she said of the stories. ""There's too much coverage (for legislators to ignore sexual violence). Once you start to be in national press for this, that really is a catalyst for change. That's not the kind of notoriety you want for the state."" I don't want to paint Alaska as an awful or isolated place. The stats are horrifying, as are many of the stories I heard. But sexual violence is a serious concern across the country, and states like South Dakota, Oklahoma, Michigan, New Mexico and Arkansas have rates of reported rape well above the national average. It doesn't have to be this way. I will anxiously await photos from the ""Choose Respect"" rallies. Alaska is also a beautiful place full of strong people. And this week, all of us will get a chance to see them -- and, hopefully, you -- demanding a safer future.","Alaskans will rally this week in 170 communities to end sexual violence .

"(CNN) -- What happens when a North Korean architect is given free rein to design what he or she likes? Over the course of the last four years, one Beijing based tour company has sought to answer that question by asking a practicing architect from North Korea to create futuristic designs for sustainable tourism developments in the country. Koryo Tours -- which offers organized trips around North Korea -- provided the anonymous participant who works at the Paektusan Architectural Institute in Pyongyang with an open brief and no limits on costs, scale or physical possibilities. The fascinating results depict something akin to Soviet-era iconography and the Jetsons and are now on display at the Venice Architecture Biennale in Italy. According to Nick Bonner, the man who arranged the project, ""there is very little exposure to contemporary architecture in North Korea."" ""The architect who led this project for us drew upon his own thoughts and experiences,"" he added. Unsurprisingly, the career path of an architect in North Korea is very structured. ""All architects (in North Korea) are trained at the University of Architecture and all work for the government. There are no private projects,"" Bonner continued. ""In a way, it's not much different than working for a council -- limited projects, but the better you are the more chance you have of working on more interesting projects, and the more chance of influencing design."" Some designs appear more rooted in reality than others which take big leaps into what the architect believes may be possible in the future. The image above shows a hotel and gondola on the West Sea Barrage in the port city of Nampo, an area currently without major accommodation facilities. Exhibiting slightly more blue-sky thinking, this image depicts a flying house that can double up as a hovercraft. Combining the old and the new, meanwhile, this nifty-looking bridge is designed to connect the famous mountains of Myohyangsan. People walking across it in the morning will be high above the early mist providing the sensation of floating above the clouds, the architect said. ""Apart from blocks of architecture that reflect Soviet influence, there is a certain futuristic style (and) modernism in many of the buildings"" in North Korea, Bonner said. In the image above, visitors to a mountain villa retreat interact with each other in an atrium designed to encourage social interaction between holidaymakers. Reaction to the exhibition has been mixed so far. ""Some people see it as retro and kitsch, while others see it as inventive, fun and with some valid ideas,"" Bonner said. ""It was never intended as anything more than a visual brainstorm -- a way to stimulate engagement, ideas and discussion."" The designs will be on display at the Korean Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale until November while Koryo Tours will be running a seven day architecture trip to North Korea in late October.","A tour group asked North Korean designers to come up with their visions of the future .

"(CNN)Take one look at these images and you experience a range of city-life emotions. You feel the noonday sun beating down on your back, surging waves of people on every side of you. You sip your overpriced beverage and stare into the distance for a reprieve from the crowds and from a morning spent on your feet. You see long shadows and you hear the quiet: the exhale of a city that's been running hard and long all day -- the settling down, the withdrawal of vendors and businessmen and every sort of tradesmen in between. Dutch photographer Bas Losekoot is interested in these interactions, and by isolating them he examines ""the mask that people are wearing on the streets, and things like the gaze -- who's looking at who? ""What do these small gestures on the street tell us about the human condition?"" Losekoot asked. ""How do people feel and how do people respond to (each other)?"" Losekoot was trained as a classical photographer and spent time after graduation shooting stills on film sets. Influenced by the lighting techniques from the cinema, he had the idea: ""Why not bring the light to the streets?"" ""After that,"" he said, ""the street became a studio and the people became the actors."" He started in New York three years ago when he had this idea. ""I was fascinated by this theme of the 'urban millennium,' "" he said. ""What's going to happen when cities get more busy and people have to live in a smaller space?"" The urban millennium references the announcement, made by the U.N. Department of Economic and Social Affairs in 2007, that ""more people (are) living in cities than in rural areas: 3.3 billion people (are) on three percent of the earth's surface."" During his time in New York, Losekoot made a blueprint for where he would go next to continue this documentary work: Sao Paulo, Brazil; Seoul, South Korea; Mumbai, India; and Hong Kong. He is now stationed in London, continuing the project while he pursues a master's in photography and urban cultures. When deciding what city to focus on for his project, there are three determining factors, he said: ""Speed and scale of urbanization, size of economy, and population density."" Once arriving in a new city, Losekoot brings passion for his work, and grit and determination carry him through long days standing on dusty and crowded street corners. ""I find these places interesting, because this is where the personality and character and the desires that people have come up in places where the population density is very high,"" he said. ""You really see what they're thinking in those places, and small gestures have a lot of information about what we think about ourselves and what we think of each other."" Losekoot brings small flashes with him and sets them up on whatever is available, be it light posts, poles or railings. Then he waits for the perfect moments. Nothing is staged; it's all a candid flow of human interaction. The most subtle gaze or movement speaks volumes in a still image. Losekoot does his best to be invisible so that people will act naturally and not pose for the camera. The dramatic lighting makes for a very theatrical end product. Running late for the bus suddenly becomes an epic dash through dappled sunlight and illuminated sheet-metal buildings. ""The camera made me curious in the world, and the camera is a great way to explore places and people,"" Losekoot said. ""And it can open doors in a lot of situations."" Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Losekoot asks thoughtful questions of society by holding up a mirror and inviting honest examination. ""What kind of cities are we creating, and in the end are we creating an ideal world? Those are the big themes I like to touch with my work. And the themes I like to raise questions about,"" he said. ""It's very difficult to find those answers in photography; it's hard to see the progress of the city in someone's eyes. I'm very much interested in the people in there, in the social behavior of the group."" These questions are the driving force that propels Losekoot's work. Exploring the dynamics of the streets. Capturing a moment in time that you can delve into and resonate with on a very human level. Just pictures of people on the street? Yes. But the underlying implication is that we, the same humanity that used to roam the forest floor, now traverse concrete in this urban millennium. Bas Losekoot is a Dutch photographer based in London.

"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama -- who once famously declared ""there is not a black America and a white America"" -- is again feeling his way through a volatile debate over race that offers fresh evidence of the nation's enduring divisions. The first African-American president is confronting the delicate issues of justice and discrimination after renewed violence this week in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked by a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer who shot and killed Michael Brown, a black youth, this summer. These issues refuse to fade for Obama, despite hopes that his election would lead to a post-racial era. On Tuesday night in his hometown of Chicago, Obama tried to master a balancing act that has become all too familiar during his nearly six years in the White House, reflecting on the African-American experience while standing by the legal system. He offered comfort to those angered by the grand jury's decision while identifying with the horror of looting and burning businesses in suburban St. Louis. Complete coverage of what's happening in Ferguson . ""If any part of the American community doesn't feel welcomed or treated fairly, that's something that puts all of us at risk,"" Obama said. But he added that ""nothing of benefit results from destructive acts. For those who think that what happened in Ferguson is an excuse for violence, I do not have any sympathy for that."" It was not quite the rhetoric of the transcendent political figure who spoke eloquently about race during his first campaign, nor was it the impassioned president who reacted so personally in the aftermath of Florida teenager Trayvon's Martin's death. Instead, Obama pledged to lead a national conversation on race and address the deep rooted belief in many communities of color ""that our laws are not always being enforced uniformly."" Obama: 'No sympathy' for violence in Ferguson . Obama's remarks reflect his reluctance to take sides or cast judgment on the grand jury's decision and an attempt to avoid adding to the racial turmoil. But they also show his struggle to talk about race in a way that connects with all Americans. The President ""is always on a teeter-totter of not really wanting to lean too far this direction, that direction,"" said Julian Bond, a longtime civil rights activist and chairman emeritus of the NAACP. ""He doesn't want to be the black president. He wants to be the president, and that constrains him a great deal. I don't think he'll ever overcome that."" His approach to Ferguson stands in contrast to remarks last year after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the 2012 shooting death of the 17-year-old Martin. At the time, Obama recounted his own experiences as a black man in deeply personal terms. ""When Trayvon Martin was first shot, I said that this could have been my son,"" Obama said. ""Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago."" He continued: ""There are very few African-American men who haven't had the experience of walking across the street and hearing the locks click on the doors of cars.  That happens to me -- at least before I was a senator."" He was more circumspect on Monday as the violence in Ferguson first heated up, saying the nation has made ""enormous progress in race relations."" ""I've witnessed that in my own life, and to deny that progress I think is to deny America's capacity for change,"" he said. Obama has dealt gingerly with racial issues since he burst onto the national political scene in 2004 as a state senator from Illinois who delivered a galvanizing speech at that year's Democratic National Convention. His 2008 caucus win in the lily-white state of Iowa launched his path to the presidency. He would later speak with pride about his ""commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country."" PHOTOS: Protests across the U.S. But he had to confront the issue more directly later in 2008 amid a furious debate over the incendiary remarks of his then-pastor Jeremiah Wright. He responded with a speech in Philadelphia in which Obama said Wright's views denigrated the ""greatness and goodness of our nation"" and rightly offended ""white and black alike."" Race would remain an unwelcome undercurrent throughout the campaign and after -- most notably when his aides had to confront claims by conservative conspiracy theorists that the president was not born in the U.S. That controversy only faded when he produced a document certifying his birth for reporters. (Conservatives and Tea Party activists refuted the idea that their vehement criticisms of the president had any racial grounding). For five years after Obama's seminal speech on race in Philadelphia, he tried to avoid racial issues but stumbled over the controversial case of Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates, Jr. who was arrested in his own home in 2009. Obama tackles immigration, Ferguson at hometown rally . Obama allowed Attorney General Eric Holder and other officials to push forward on issues like voting rights and housing that are important to the African American community. But the Martin case seemed to set a new tone for the second term of his presidency, where he has spoken with more ease about race. Obama was deeply affected by a private meeting he held last year with a group of young black boys about a mile from his home in Hyde Park, Chicago. He recalled that encounter earlier this year as he unveiled his ""My Brother's Keeper"" mentoring project at the White House. ""I could see myself in these young men,"" Obama said, admitting that he was lucky he made his youthful transgressions in forgiving, multi-cultural Hawaii and not in America's deprived inner cities. At other times, Obama has used the civil rights movement to make a point about the capacity of political movements — even as his own change crusade shuddered to a halt. ""The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but it doesn't bend on its own,"" he said, quoting Martin Luther King, a half century after the March on Washington last year. But Obama has studiously avoided the debate over whether race is a factor in his sinking approval ratings. He also shies away from talking about whether race played a role in his party's struggles in the South this election season, as Louisiana Sen. Mary Landrieu, a Democrat, suggested during an interview about her own prospects for re-election this fall. People who have seen him in private settings say the president speaks more frankly about race than he has in public. The President, insiders say, feels a responsibility to use his remaining time in office to secure his legacy on African-American issues and has thought deeply about his own unique place in history. Rogers Smith, co-author of  ""Still a House Divided,"" a study of racial politics in the Obama era, said the president understood the symbolism. ""I definitely think he is conscious that as the first black president, he will be a subject of endless historical scrutiny as well as intense contemporary scrutiny,"" Smith said. Still, race is likely to remain an issue during Obama's final years in the White House. ""For the overwhelming majority of people who just feel frustrated and pained because they get a sense that some communities aren't treated fairly or some individuals aren't seen as worthy as others -- I understand that and I want to work with you and I want to move forward with you,"" Obama said Tuesday. ""Your President will be right there with you.""","Ferguson violence revives race debate for first black president .

"(CNN) -- Keep your head down and your mouth shut. Play the game. Smile for the camera. Collect your fat paycheck. And go home. That has been the mantra for far too many professional athletes for as long as I can recall over my 20 years of working in sports media. Most sports stars have chosen to stand for nothing, believing instead that donning a uniform on game day and dazzling the world with their superior athletic skills somehow fulfills their contribution as American citizens. That somehow their physical gifts excuse them from being an active player in the game we call life. Truth be told, we journalists have been willing co-conspirators -- all too happy to stick to safe X-and-O questions about the game and avoid the uncomfortable issues. In fact, there was a time not too long ago when any question to a pro athlete that carried a whiff of controversy would mean ""interview over."" But that was yesterday. Today -- finally -- a few bold athletes are changing the game, finding their voices and speaking out about injustices they see -- whether fans like it, or not; whether their coaches like it, or not. On Sunday, five St. Louis Rams players raised high their hands in a ""don't shoot"" stance to show their solidarity with the Ferguson, Missouri, protesters after the grand jury decision not to indict the police officer who shot an unarmed 18-year-old, Michael Brown. Some police, pundits and fans have objected, but the players aren't apologizing. They are following in a proud tradition of agitators from the distant past who demanded the world see them not only as sports icons but as proud men and women who would use their talent to fight for equality in America. Men such as Muhammad Ali, a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War and forceful voice for black equality in his own nation, and tennis great Arthur Ashe, who marched along with civil rights leaders in the '60s and became a leading voice in the global fight against apartheid in South Africa. Olympians Tommie Smith and John Carlos lifted their black power salute during the medal ceremony of the 1968 Summer Games to protest racism in the United States. That day, Carlos wore a necklace of black beads on the Olympic podium to represent the thousands of African-Americans who were lynched at the hands of white racists in America. Smith carried a box containing an olive branch to call for peace. Those athletes refused to sit on the sidelines and ignore racial injustice in their lifetimes. The goal was to inspire a nation, not just to win games. Phenomenal women such as Althea Gibson and Billie Jean King vocally advocated across generations for gender and racial equality. Those women never let sports fans forget that they stood for something far greater than the game. Could it be that now a new generation of athletes has at last found a renewed sense of purpose and recognized their power beyond the sports? It's about time. I'm proud of each one of these young men and women who are finding the courage to speak up and speak out -- to join their rightful place in the American conversation. The world is often an ugly place, but this slow rebirth of activism by professional athletes is a beautiful thing to witness: . â€¢ LeBron James spoke volumes last year with his powerful #wearetrayvonmartin photo tweet featuring himself, Duane Wade and other Miami Heat players protesting with hoodies pulled tight over their famous faces in the wake of the shooting of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed African-American teen who was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Florida. â€¢ Hall of Fame player and ESPN analyst Cris Carter, among others, spoke out on-air against child abuse in the wake of the Minnesota Viking Adrian Peterson child abuse story. Carter described his own experiences as a child. â€¢ And last fall, professional athletes around the nation joined the call to end domestic violence with the ""No More"" campaign. One of those players, William Gay, the 29-year-old cornerback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, lost his mother when he was 8 after she was shot by his stepfather. Today, Gay is one of the league's most ardent voices denouncing against men who commit violent crimes against women. And he's targeting his peers. ""It's telling men that this not OK. We're not going to sit back and say, 'We'll let you guys handle it.' That's not the case anymore. People die from this, and we need to do something about it, and if we see something, we need to say something,"" Gay told USA Today Sports. These are the images that are beginning to compete for time with sports highlights on America's screens. They may make us feel uncomfortable. They may make it impossible for some of us to escape the problems at our own doorsteps. But this is America, where since 1791, the First Amendment has given citizens the right to freedom of speech and the right of the people to assemble peaceably, and to petition the government, among other things. League rules do not trump this constitutional right; to try to silence players would, or course, not stand up in court. The league can and often does, however, dictate how players can appear in public when at work (games, practice, press conferences), but only when the players are at league-sanctioned events, or in uniform. The league, like other companies, cannot demand that its employees not speak out as private citizens on their personal time. And though in the past NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has tried to stop players from speaking out about sports-related controversies, you'll notice that the Rams players will not be sanctioned in any way for their Ferguson protest. The NBA and other sports have also declined to fine or sanction players who have recently protested in some form for Trayvon Martin. Indeed, today anyone would be hard-pressed to justify why pro athletes -- tax-paying American citizens -- should be denied the right to speak out about any issue in the world. Yes, it's a new day in sports. And the revolution is being televised.","Roxanne Jones: Rams' protest over Ferguson is a sign sports figures are finding their voices .

"(CNN)What a difference a year makes. American ski star Lindsey Vonn exorcised the ghosts of a grueling fight back from injury with victory on the slopes of Val d'Isere, Saturday.

But Vonn -- who credits her golf star boyfriend Tiger Woods with inspiring her comeback -- underlined her return to form at the famous French ski resort with a dominant downhill World Cup win on the OK piste. ""I already knew I could win here today,"" Vonn told reporters. ""It was for other people to understand that I'm back to where I used to be. ""It's a celebration for myself and for the team around me. After two tough years, I've waited a long time for this and I'm very happy. ""It feels amazing. I was a bit nervous as I made some mistakes in training. I skied aggressively today."" The victory in Val d'Isere was the 61st World Cup win of Vonn's career, which means she is just one win away from equaling the all-time record held by Annemarie Moser-Proell. Vonn, who had not won on the French piste in the last four years, has a chance to match the Austrian's feat in Sunday's super-G. She added: ""61 is a difficult number and I'm looking forward to another chance tomorrow. ""I'm very much looking forward to the rest of the season and having more opportunities to feel more comfortable with the speed and keep pushing myself."" Vonn leads the downhill World Cup standings on 232 points ahead of joint Olympic downhill champion Tina Maze, who finished seventh. The American posted a photo on Instagram posing with her prize for her Val d'Isere victory -- a baby cow. ""This is the best prize for winning a race EVER!! I have a new addition to my growing herd...meet ""Winnie"" my one month old baby calf,"" she said. Vonn is continuing her steady comeback from an anterior cruciate ligament injury which threatened to end her career in 2013. She crashed heavily at the 2013 world championships and has since had reconstructive surgery on her right knee.","Victorious ski star Lindsey Vonn says: ""I'm back to where I used to be.""

"Former CIA Director Michael Hayden as well as some top political voices are issuing blistering responses to the Senate Intelligence Committee's report on torture. Hayden, whose tenure over the agency was skewered in the report, fired back at the findings, growing emotional in an interview and saying he was taken out of context. ""I think the conclusions they drew were analytically offensive and almost street-like in their simplistic language and conclusions,"" he told Politico Magazine. The new report says the CIA misled the public on its enhanced interrogation program for post-9/11 detainees during the George W. Bush era. It details brutal scenes of torture, harsher than what the CIA had disclosed in the past. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who steered the Senate investigation, blasted Hayden in her Senate floor speech Tuesday for providing deceptive testimony about the program to the committee when he met with them in 2007. Top takeaways from the CIA torture report . Feinstein said that Hayden painted a ""starkly"" different picture of certain interrogations in a hearing than what committee staff members learned about those interrogations from cables. ""(The cables) described brutal, around-the-clock interrogations ... in which multiple coercive techniques were used in combination and with substantial repetition,"" Feinstein said on the floor. ""It was an ugly, visceral description."" Hayden, who ran the CIA from 2006 to 2009, said that's simply ""untrue."" To back up his point, he noted that the Obama administration, which investigated CIA-detainee interrogations, didn't prosecute anyone. ""You can't have all this supposed documentary evidence saying the agency mistreated these prisoners and then Barack Obama's and Eric Holder's Department of Justice saying no, you've got bupkus here,"" Hayden said. Hayden insisted he was treated unfairly and disproportionately in the report, stressing that he became CIA director late in the game. ""Everything here happened before I got there [to the CIA], and I'm the one she [Sen. Feinstein] condemns on the floor of the Senate? Gee, how'd that happen?"" he said. CIA report's most shocking passages . ""I'm the dumb son of a b---- who went down and tried to lay out this program in great detail to them,"" he continued. ""I'm mentioned twice as much in there as [former CIA Director] George Tenet â€” but George and [former CIA Director] Porter Goss had 97 detainees during their tenure, while I had two."" He said statements he made about the program's later days -- when the interrogation system was better regulated and more finely tuned -- were applied to the earlier days of the program when he wasn't in charge. ""It misrepresents what I said,"" he said. Hagel on torture report release: 'We want to be prepared' ""I would never lie to the committee,"" he also said in the interview. ""I did not lie."" Former Democratic Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, who previously served on the intelligence committee, argued that his former colleagues were part of a partisan effort. Democrats, he wrote in an op-ed for USA Today, ""started out with the premise that the CIA was guilty and then worked to prove it."" He hammered the committee for relying on documents rather than interviews during the investigation and said the ""most significant missed opportunity"" was the fact that the report included no recommendations. ""No one would claim the program was perfect or without its problems. But equally, no one with real experience would claim it was the completely ineffective and superfluous effort this report alleges."" Republicans on the Senate committee also defended the CIA, releasing a rebuttal Tuesday that questioned the methodology of the Senate five-year-long probe. Their statement said the report created the ""false impression that the CIA was actively misleading policy makers and impeding the counterterrorism efforts of other federal government agencies during the Program's operation."" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said he understands why torture was used on detainees and argued that American officers aren't the bad guys. ""At the end of the day, I'm trying to distinguish ourselves from our enemies,"" he said Tuesday on Fox News. ""They crucify people, they rape women, they sell them into slavery, they will kill people's children before their eyes."" The techniques in question that were analyzed in the report were used to prevent another 9/11, Graham said. ""When you roll up some of these guys, you're very anxious to get out of them whatever you can to prevent the next attack,"" he continued. ""I understand why people did this.""","Former CIA chief Michael Hayden is ""upset"" about the report's methodology .

"(CNN)The holidays are officially over for Sebastian Vettel -- the Formula One racer has started his new job with Ferrari. The 27-year-old is driving into the unknown after ending his rewarding relationship with Red Bull Racing, which powered him to four straight world titles and 44 grand prix victories. It was Vettel's decision to quit Red Bull for Ferrari, a decision he said was partly inspired by a desire to follow in the footsteps of his racing idol Michael Schumacher. But despite his willingness to replace Fernando Alonso at Ferrari, the team suggested it was the new boss who persuaded Vettel to a turn up for a first day at the office. The team said in a statement: ""At the request of Team Principal Maurizio Arrivabene, Sebastian Vettel came to Maranello to visit the Gestione Sportiva. ""The purpose of the tour was to allow the four time world champion to visit all the departments and to get better acquainted with everyone he will be working with this season."" Vettel was seen wearing the distinctive scarlet colors of Ferrari for the first time and ended his Italian road trip by posing for a photograph with his new teammates. Ferrari will unveil its car on January 30 ahead of the 2015 season, which starts in Australia on March 15. It will take to the track for the first preseason test in Jerez, Spain during the first four days of February. But there won't be a No.1 on Vettel's chassis -- that honor will go to Mercedes rival Lewis Hamilton, now a double world champion -- and instead Vettel will race under the No.5. That could be the least of the changes the German has to cope with in his unfamiliar circumstances. Ferrari failed to win a race in 2014 for the first time since 1993 and finished fourth in the constructor standings. Arrivabene, who was the third man to occupy the position of Ferrari team principal in 2014, has set Vettel and his teammate Kimi Raikkonen a target of at least two race victories in the coming season. ""Vettel brings with him the experience of winning,"" Arrivabene, who joined from American tobacco company Phillip Morris, said at a media conference in December. ""He is well equipped for the job that awaits him.""","Sebastian Vettel has started his new job with Ferrari .

"Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein aggressively defended her decision to release a controversial Senate torture report Tuesday, despite assertions from the CIA that interrogation techniques detailed in the report were effective in thwarting attack plans, capturing terrorists and saving American lives. In a testy interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer on ""The Situation Room,"" Feinstein said she wasn't going to get into whether CIA Director John Brennan was lying about the torture techniques' effectiveness, but that ""there's a big difference of opinion."" ""If Mr. Brennan is making an argument that this kind of torture works, we can submit all kinds of experts to say it doesn't work,"" Feinstein said. ""And we submit the record to say the record shows it did not work."" The report, which details the CIA's extreme interrogation techniques used on terrorists after the September 11th attacks, was released by Feinstein's committee despite a last-minute pleas from Secretary of State John Kerry and members of Congress not to release the information to the public at this time. Many opponents of the report's release argued that the timing of the release could prompt global attacks on Americans -- skepticism later exemplified with the FBI issuing a terror alert bulletin. Asked if she would feel guilty if American lives were lost as a result of the report, Feinstein said, ""I would feel very badly, of course. I mean what do you think?"" But Feinstein argued, ""There's no perfect time to release this report."" ""It's possible that something happens even without this,"" Feinstein said. ""There have been beheadings. There have been attacks without this report coming out. This doesn't mean that we shouldn't clean our house."" The California Democrat also acknowledged that the timing of the release is important for political reasons. Should the Republicans take control of the White House, Feinstein argued, ""There's some evidence"" that the report would ""never see the light of day."" Feinstein says she and her committee stand by a 14-1 vote taken in 2006 to release the report's executive summary once it was completed. She also said that she believes that the release of the report, which took five-and-a-half years, ""will meet the test of time.""","Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dianne Feinstein defended her decision to release the torture report .

"The budget proposal introduced by House Republicans on Tuesday is much more than a series of numbers on a spreadsheet -- it's a vision for reforming the key pillars of the American social contract in the 21st century. In that regard, it's very different from the vision put forward by President Obama in his budget plan from a month ago, which emphasized preserving the status quo with another round of tax hikes. The central economic problem of coming years is how to update the nation's largest entitlement programs so that they are sustainable and available to future generations of Americans. The Congressional Budget Office projects that spending on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid (plus the new 2010 health care law) will increase from about 10% of the nation's total economic output this year, as measured by gross domestic product (GDP), to nearly 16% in 2035. Historically, the government has collected about 18% of GDP in revenue. Thus, if the entitlement programs remain on autopilot, there will either be nothing left in the budget beyond transfer payments, or government taxes will have to soar. In Medicare, the GOP budget preserves today's arrangements for those in or near retirement. But for future entrants into the program, Medicare would change into a ""premium support"" model. The government would provide a fixed level of premium assistance to the program's enrollees, and they would use that assistance to pick from among competing insurance options, including the traditional fee-for-service federal program. Medicare's drug benefit is already run as a premium support program, and spending on the program over its first decade is now projected to be more than 40% below what was expected at enactment in 2003. A recent analysis produced for the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, shows that a competitive bidding approach in the full Medicare program would reduce costs by more than 5% in year one alone. That's the way to bring costs down without undermining the quality of care provided to Medicare patients. Obama's vision for Medicare is very different.  He wants an unaccountable board of bureaucrats to cut fees to those caring for Medicare patients. But cutting fees isn't real cost control. Low reimbursement rates will just force doctors and hospitals to stop taking care of Medicare patients and thereby impair their access to care. For Medicaid, the GOP plan would shift power and financial control to the states so that they can reform their programs in ways that best suit the needs of their residents. In addition to mending entitlement programs, the GOP plan calls for top-to-bottom reform of the federal bureaucracy, with an emphasis on cutting programs of low or marginal value so that more money can be invested in what truly matters. Most importantly, the plan does not adopt the deep reductions in defense spending that would cripple the military just as threats around the world are expanding and intensifying. Over the next decade, the GOP budget would cut federal spending by $5.3 trillion, compared with Obama's proposal. The differences between the GOP and the president's plans are stark on the tax side, too. The president has proposed to increase taxes to 20% of GDP in 2022. The GOP plan would hold the line on tax hikes and keep revenue at roughly its historical norm of just above 18% of GDP. Further, it calls for fundamental reform of both individual and corporate taxes, including the consolidation of today's complex six-rate structure for individuals into just two rates -- 10% and 25%.  This is the kind of tax reform that some tax experts believe would promote job creation in the American economy. The American people now have before them two clear and very different approaches for how to address the nation's fundamental economic challenges. One vision would preserve the status quo, with growing entitlement commitments, steady hikes in tax rates and more centralized control of the economy from the government. The other vision would bolster a vibrant private sector with sensible taxes; reform of entitlements and other programs that emphasize limited but effective government; protection of the most vulnerable among us; and the power of free markets to promote prosperity. These competing plans give voters a real choice when they go the polls in November.  And whatever they decide, the consequences will be lasting.","House Republicans introduced a budget proposal Tuesday .

"Pro-Russian rebels released dozens of captive Ukrainian troops Sunday as part of a ceasefire deal. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said in a Twitter post that 73 troops were released in Donetsk. But despite the ceasefire, violence continued to flare in the volatile region. As shelling rocked the city throughout the day Sunday, local officials described the situation as ""critical."" Six civilians died and 15 were injured as the result of shelling, Donetsk's city office said on Monday. Poroshenko spoke with German Chancellor Angela Merkel over concerns that the ceasefire deal -- brokered earlier this month -- is being violated. They ""agreed to make further efforts to settle the situation peacefully,"" Poroshenko's office said in a statement. In an interview with TV Tsentr pm Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the truce agreed upon in Minsk, Belarus, appeared to be holding generally and that Moscow, at least, is ready to work toward a long-term peace.

"(CNN)Demand for South African food is booming in an unlikely place: the United Arab Emirates. Sizzling in the kitchen at the Abu Dhabi-based restaurant ""The Meat Company,"" there's only one specialty -- and the key is in the name. T-bones or Rib-Eye, flame grilled or triple-basted, this is not a venue for vegetarians. But the meaty menu is proving popular; in the past year 350,000 customers dined at the restaurant. ""It's a very exciting region to be in and to showcase your brands,"" says South African owner Johnny Tomazos. ""There's a lot of developments going on, there's a lot of growth for companies such as ours to grow in the food sector in the Middle East,"" he continues. ""Tourism is growing, more people are coming to live in the region; all that combined with the economic driver allows for a great market for us."" Meaty business . Ten years after his family founded the enterprise, Tomazos today owns 15 restaurants -- mostly in the Gulf. In fact, the company has moved its headquarters from South Africa to Dubai, and has built a presence not only in the UAE but also Bahrain and Kuwait. Yet, Tomazos is not the only South African cashing in on tax-free income and a growing population of young customers increasingly hungry for Western-style fast food. Popular South African burger chain Steers is also setting up shop in the region, offering burgers on the manmade Yas Island -- a popular location for tourists and thrill-seekers. General manager Mark Oliver is confident the company's first venture in the Middle East will take off with the big local South African community. ""[There are] over 100,000 South Africans living in the UAE, over 100,000 brand ambassadors living in the UAE,"" he says."" ""It's a natural fit to bring a brand ... such as Steers to the Middle East."" Gulf of opportunity . In fact, there are roughly 200 South African companies operating in the UAE -- a country where expatriates account for over 80% of the work force. Bilateral trade between South Africa and the UAE tops $3 billion a year according to the South African embassy in Abu Dhabi. In 2012 South African gross domestic product grew at 2% whereas growth rates in the UAE were double that, according to the World Bank. And the UAE ranks 22nd out of 189 countries for the overall ""Ease of Doing Business."" South Africa is 43rd on that list. It's data like this that has other industries, from diamond jewelers to builders, looking to the Gulf to grow their profits. ""Our relationship with the UAE is growing,"" says Mpetjane Kgaogelo Lekgoro, the South African ambassador to the country. ""With trade growth of an average of 22% year to year from 2009, and actually, in 2013 to 2014, we recorded an increase of 37%."" And it's not just South African businesses operating from the region. Ugandan entrepreneur Ashish Thakkar has built his Mara Group empire in Dubai. From the Gulf HQ, his business operates in 18 African countries in various industries -- from financial services and real estate to communication, manufacturing and agriculture. Risks to success . Whilst the Gulf promises exciting business returns, South Africans bringing a business abroad also have to contend with challenges -- especially when there's meat involved. Following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in South Africa in 2011, international authorities banned red meat exports. Experts have said the global annual cost of FMD could be as high as $21 billion, and one South African businessman who felt the effects was Dave Jackson -- in 2009, the businessman bought an Abu Dhabi-based butchery to sell dried meat called Biltong to the South African expat community. Following the export ban, Jackson had to find a new source of meat, and his customers were not happy. While South Africa only produced around 2.7 million tonnes of meat in 2012 -- and Africa as a whole only accounted for 5% of global meat production -- expats told Jackson they wanted that taste from home. ""Suppliers [from] around the world -- Australia, New Zealand, America, Brazil -- [provide] quality products,"" Jackson says. ""But still, when people come here, they say 'where's the South African meats?'"" But this lack of supply could be set to change soon, following a ruling in February that South Africa was FMD-free, paving the way for exports to the UAE to start again. Innovation is key . While South African meats could boost customer satisfaction in restaurants and food businesses, Tomazos says the key to success in the UAE is adapting. ""In this competitive environment, if you're constantly not innovating and not looking at the customer needs, then you don't stand yourself in good stride,"" he says. For Tomazos, any future expansion of his trademark steaks won't be at home, but here in the Gulf. More from Marketplace Africa . Read this: The human cost of piracy .

"Ironically, the misogyny Rush Limbaugh spewed for three days over Sandra Fluke was not much worse than his regular broadcast of sexist, racist and homophobic hate speech: . -- Female Cabinet members are ""Sex-retaries."" -- ""The NAACP should have riot rehearsal. They should get a liquor store and practice robberies."" -- The National Organization for Women is ""a bunch of whores to liberalism."" -- [Said to an African-American female caller]: ""Take that bone out of your nose and call me back."" These are just a few samples from the arsenal of degrading language Limbaugh deploys on women, people of color, lesbians and gays, immigrants, the disabled, the elderly, Muslims, Jews, veterans, environmentalists and so forth. Limbaugh doesn't just call people names. He promotes language that deliberately dehumanizes his targets. Like the sophisticated propagandist Josef Goebbels, he creates rhetorical frames -- and the bigger the lie, the more effective -- inciting listeners to view people they disagree with as sub-humans. His longtime favorite term for women, ""femi-Nazi,"" doesn't even raise eyebrows anymore, an example of how rhetoric spreads when unchallenged by coarsened cultural norms. At least this most recent incident has turned a spotlight back on the vile, damaging statements Limbaugh has been promulgating for years. His sponsors are dropping him; his stations have begun to follow suit. VoteVets, a coalition of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, released a statement by female vets, including Katherine Scheirman, former chief of medical operations in the U.S. Air Forces, demanding that the American Forces Network drop Limbaugh from its programming. They state, ""Our entire military depends on troops respecting each other -- women and men. There simply can be no place on military airwaves for sentiments that would undermine that respect."" Opinion: It's un-American to silence Limbaugh . That makes this a fitting time to inquire of his syndicator, Clear Channel Communications, whether it intends to continue supporting someone who addicts his audience to regular doses of hate speech. Clear Channel's Premiere Radio Networks Inc., which hosts Limbaugh's program, has defended his recent comments. If Clear Channel won't clean up its airways, then surely it's time for the public to ask the FCC a basic question: Are the stations carrying Limbaugh's show in fact using their licenses ""in the public interest?"" Spectrum is a scarce government resource. Radio broadcasters are obligated to act in the public interest and serve their respective communities of license. In keeping with this obligation, individual radio listeners may complain to the FCC that Limbaugh's radio station (and those syndicating his show) are not acting in the public interest or serving their respective communities of license by permitting such dehumanizing speech. Opinion: Democrats should reject Bill Maher's money . The FCC takes such complaints into consideration when stations file for license renewal. For local listeners near a station that carries Limbaugh's show, there is plenty of evidence to bring to the FCC that their station isn't carrying out its public interest obligation. Complaints can be registered under the broadcast category of the FCC website: http://www.fcc.gov/complaints . This isn't political. While we disagree with Limbaugh's politics, what's at stake is the fallout of a society tolerating toxic, hate-inciting speech. For 20 years, Limbaugh has hidden behind the First Amendment, or else claimed he's really ""doing humor"" or ""entertainment.""  He is indeed constitutionally entitled to his opinions, but he is not constitutionally entitled to the people's airways. It's time for the public to take back our broadcast resources.  Limbaugh has had decades to fix his show.  Now it's up to us.","Fonda, Morgan, Steinem: Limbaugh long made racist, sexist, homophobic remarks .
