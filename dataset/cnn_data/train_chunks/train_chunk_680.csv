Tory MP Robert Halfon will address Parliament tomorrow in the debate about the Corporation's future . The BBC licence fee is a ‘medieval anachronism’ and can only be justified if those who pay it elect the chairman and board, have a more direct say on programme-making and an input on celebrity pay, MPs will hear today. Tory MP Robert Halfon will argue the licence fee is a ‘coercive system backed up by the threat of fines and prison’ in a backbench business committee debate on the Corporation’s future. Mr Halfon believes the fact that fee-payers have little input into how the Corporation is run makes the BBC as undemocratic as a ‘feudal monarchy.’ A debate in parliament on the . Corporation’s future will hear that public trust in the BBC has been . eroded by the Jimmy Savile and severance pay scandals. The debate will hear that in order to win back public trust, the . licence fee should be reformed so fee payers are treated like . shareholders in a business they have invested in. Under proposals, Mr Halfon will suggest today people who pay the £145.50 a year licence fee should be allowed a vote on both the election of the chairman and the board. They would have some say over the . annual report, programme making and celebrity pay, and the ability to . call for board members who have ‘grown out of touch with public opinion’ to be sacked. While there . is a statutory requirement to consult its licence fee payers, Mr Halfon . said this process is in reality a ‘sham’ as most of the decisions they . are consulted on, are made well in advance. The MP calls for a new system . whereby the public are able to cast a vote online using a unique pin . number, as a cheap way to ‘democratise’ the BBC for viewers and . listeners. BBC Director General Tony Hall, pictured at the Corporation's headquarters, may come under fire in today's debate . He said it would also help to ‘spark a genuine debate - a battle of ideas-about the kind of BBC that we want, and how it should spend our money’. 'The BBC is monopolistic, with about a third of TV viewing and half of radio, it is often branded as anti-competitive because it does not have to make a commercial return on its products, and the licence fee is a mediaeval anachronism’, he told the Mail. Large staff payouts, such as those revealed by head of HR Lucy Adams, are cause for concern says Halfon . 'Some might feel that the licence fee is a regressive tax which penalises those on low incomes. 'Others will be upset by the salaries of senior BBC executives and celebrities. ‘The reality is that licence fee payers want choice. Some might want a beefed-up World Service, paid for by reducing expense elsewhere - perhaps by cutting the £50,000 a day that the BBC spends on taxis. ‘At the moment we are powerless' he said, adding: 'As licence fee payers, we are compelled to pay our dues, and if we do not like that, our only choice is to abandon TV altogether.’ The BBC made £3.6billion from the licence fee in 2012/13. It emerged this year that 3,700 a week were prosecuted for not having a TV licence - around one in ten of all cases coming before the courts in England and Wales. They face fines of £1,000, compared with £80 spot fines handed to shoplifters, petty vandals and drunken yobs. It later emerged a private firm employed to catch licence fee evaders has hundreds of officers who can earn four-figure bonuses for them to court. Yet BBC managers received £25milion in secret severance deals between 2009 and 2012, and nearly £3million was paid over and above what they were entitled to in their contracts in the six years to 2012, according to an official report this year. Mr Halfon will argue the Corporation has lost its viewers' trust in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal . A debate entitled ‘the Future of the BBC’ will be held this afternoon in the House of Commons by the backbench business committee, which represents rank and file MPs. Mr Halfon said it was no longer acceptable to argue that giving the public a say would result in dumbing down of content. ‘Look at Classic FM and Sky News’, he said. ‘The BBC cannot continue-dare I say it-to be a kleptocracy, indifferent to the public who pay for it. ‘Auntie pays out huge salaries to executives and celebrities alike. Her bureaucracy grows exponentially. Her undemocratic licence fee has become an anachronism in the days of multi-channel satellite television. ‘If the BBC really does depend on the licence fee for its survival, then there must be some genuine checks and balances. What better way than democratising the licence fee?’ ‘It would be similar to shareholders having the ability to hire and fire their board, but with one main difference-every licence fee payer would hold just one share and one vote.’","Robert Halfon feels viewers should have more say in Corporation .

A revolutionary restaurant has taken the phrase 'waste not, want not' to new levels and offers its guests a menu made entirely from 'waste' food. Rub and Stub in Copenhagen, Demark, creates dishes using food which supermarkets and farmers would usually throw away and is run and operated entirely by volunteers. Misshapen bananas, tomatoes which have a greeness to them and produce close to its best before date are some of the examples of the perfectly edible ingredients the restaurant use to make their meals- saving this food from being wasted. Waste not, want not: The Rub and Stub restaurant creates dishes like this one out of food that is destined for the bin . Tore Heerup, from Rub and Stub, said: 'The idea originated from the experiences many of us have had with food waste - why should so much good food go to waste? 'The whole world is trying to save money and work more efficiently with every other aspect of life- why not food as well?' The menu at Rub and Stub is planned on a day-by-day basis according to what surplus food has been donated that day, and is whipped up into fine cuisine by the head chef, ready to serve to the restaurant's 60 guests by the evening. Tore said: 'Everyday we have to be creative and think about how we can put together the groceries we receive and how we can set an exciting menu for the evening.' Quirky: The restaurant uses food close to its sell-by date or that farmers would throw away for being imperfect . Tasty: The menu is created on a daily basis to reflect what has been donated to the restaurant . Volunteers: The not-for-profit venture is staffed by 100 volunteers . Chef: The restaurant caters for 60 guests every evening and is hoping to build up a network of suppliers . The quirky restaurant has 100 volunteers who help manage the running of the kitchen, bar and service and there are only two members of employed staff, who are the chef and project manager. The non-profit restaurant opened its doors to the festival goers of Copenhagen this summer and proved hugely popular but is still in the beginning stages. Tore said: 'We are hoping to build up our network of suppliers, so we can offer more amazing food and also help cut down on food waste at the same time.'

Before she won the lottery, Jean Swatman would set her alarm for 5.30am, get up in the dark and be hard at work in a supermarket bakery by 6am. Now, after scooping a life-changing £2million prize... she does exactly the same. The 62-year-old grandmother, who still lives in the three-bedroom terraced house that has been her home for 20 years, said she has  no plans to retire from her £6-an-hour job. Lottery winner: Doughnut maker Jean Swatman, 62, who won £2million but is still working in her local Morrisons . Celebration: Despite winning more than £2million, Jean Swatman has made just a few modest purchases so far . ‘I really enjoy working at Morrisons and the people there are great,’  she said from her home in Lowestoft, Suffolk yesterday. ‘My daughter and son keep nagging on at me and saying there’s no need to get up so early to de-ice the car when you’re a millionaire. ‘But the win hasn’t changed me to be honest. Not to the extent where I’ve got flash cars and things. ‘I’m in the same house I was in before. I’m not one for extravagant things – I like a simple life.’ Mrs Swatman, who has worked at the supermarket for ten years, gets up at 5.30am four mornings a week so she can start her five-hour shifts at 6am. After she won the £2,021,379 jackpot on June 1 by matching six numbers with a lucky dip ticket, her daughter Kerry-Anne Utting, 40, threw her work shoes in the bin to try and make her stay at home. But Mrs Swatman, who did not check her winning ticket for more than 24 hours after the draw, was determined to stay grounded. She used the money to pay for a holiday to Cambodia and a trip to Vietnam to see her son Wayne, 46, who works in the oil industry in Ho Chi Minh City. Mrs Swatman, a widow, has also treated herself to a new car, but rather than splashing out on a Porsche or Ferrari, she has bought a more practical Vauxhall Antara 4x4 worth around £25,000. She said she will invest some of her prize for her five grandchildren, adding: ‘I think with that amount of money you would have a hard job to spend it all anyway.’ Doughnut baker: Despite scooping £2million on the Lotto, Jean Swatman is still working at Morrisons in Lowesoft, Suffolk . Big win: Mrs Swatman gets up at 5.30am to go to work - despite winning enough money to retire immediately . Every day she fries hundreds of doughnuts before injecting them with jam and sprinking on sugar. Mrs Swatman, who has two children and five grandchildren said the win had not caused her problems such as people asking her for favours. She said: 'Everybody has been absolutely fine.' Mrs Swatman admitted at the time of her win that she enjoyed eating the doughnuts she makes, buying them with her ten per cent staff discount. She said: 'You don't get sick of Morrisons doughnuts. They are lovely. I make hundreds of them every day and I still like them.' Her win meant she had enough dough to buy more than 22million doughnuts from Morrisons, using her staff discount, as they were on offer at £1 for two packs of five at the time of her win. Mrs Swatman whose husband Ben died six-years-ago added: 'At my age, I don't need to move to a big house or get anything flash.' Graham Pallet, the manager of Morrisons at Lowestoft, said: 'We're delighted for Jean and her family. She's a valued member of the team and we hope she enjoys spending some of her well-deserved winnings.'","GrandmotherJean Swatman, 62, starts work at 6am four days each week .

A 52-year-old man has been arrested after a commuter was filmed racially abusing a woman on the London Underground. The video, which has been posted on YouTube, shows the drunk man launching a foul-mouthed tirade of abuse at the innocent woman. Commuters were left horrified as the man, from Watford, Hertfordshire, reeled off a series of insults about the Japanese - labelling them 'nasty people', 'bad men' and a 'vicious bunch'. Scroll down for video . Shocking: The 52-year-old man launches a foul-mouthed tirade of abuse at the innocent Japanese passenger . Abuse: He reels off insults about the Japanese - labelling them 'nasty people', 'bad men' and a 'vicious bunch' He has been arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence, police have confirmed. In an expletive-littered rant, lasting almost six minutes, the man claims his uncle died in the River Kwai during the Second World War. He then aggressively points his finger at the young woman and accuses her of torturing his relative. 'You tortured him. Get yourself off the train, get yourself off the train,' he can be heard telling the passenger, who is sat on the other side of the tube on the Bakerloo line. 'You're nasty people. I mean this s***. You're nasty people. 'F*** off, get out of my country.' Illogical: He aggressively points his finger at the female passenger and accuses her of torturing his uncle . The unidentified man, who appears to be under the influence of alcohol, then repeatedly shouts 'Sayonara' - the Japanese translation of 'goodbye' - adding: 'Don't you torture my relatives'. He ignores the shocked woman's cries of 'I'm not nasty. You're nasty', before turning his attention to the English man filming the footage and asking where he comes from. The passenger replies: 'Does it matter, really? Are you going to start sorting everyone on the train, man, one by one? Why are you blasting at her? What have you got against the Japanese?' Leaning forward, the man shouts: 'They killed my f****** two f****** cousins in the Second World War.' 'But she didn't kill your cousins, did she?' asks the passenger. 'Why is she going to apologise? What has she done to you?' The . man, pointing his finger at the Japanese woman, replies 'She doesn't . even f****** realise that she's a bad man. The Japanese are bad - same . as the Germans.' Menacing: The unidentified man then repetedly shouts 'Sayonara' - the Japanese translation of 'goodbye' Despite the cameraman's best efforts to calm him down, the man then becomes increasingly violent - threatening to knock him out in 'one punch'. 'I’m ex-Parachute Regiment! What do you know? You're a f****** boy man. Shut the f*** up,' he says. 'I’ve done two tours in Northern Ireland and the Falklands. Don’t even f****** look at me.' He then produces a bottle of wine and takes a swig, before dangling the bottle menacingly in the passenger's face. 'Do you want some of that?' he asks threateningly. 'No, because you don't drink.' A British Transport Police spokesman . said: 'A 52-year-old man from Watford was arrested on Saturday, October . 19, on suspicion of a racially-aggravated public order offence. 'An . investigation was launched after we were made aware of a YouTube clip . of a man using racist language on board a Bakerloo line train.' Intoxicated: He produces a bottle of wine and takes a swig, before dangling it in the cameraman's face . She added that the man has been bailed, pending enquiries. He is expected to be brought before magistrates on October 30. The abuse is not the first of its kind to be filmed on the Underground. Last year, a woman was jailed for 21 weeks for hurling racist abuse at fellow passengers while drunk. Jacqueline Woodhouse, then 42, snarled at stunned commuters seated beside her: 'I used to live in England and now I live in the United Nations.' Her champagne-fuelled rant was recorded by a passenger, who posted the . seven-minute clip on YouTube where it caused a sensation. Speaking at Westminster Magistrates' Court at the time, District Judge Michael Snow said: 'Anyone viewing that would feel a deep sense of shame that our fellow citizens could be subject to such behaviour.'","The 52-year-old man launches foul-mouthed tirade at the Japanese woman .

"By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 18:05 EST, 22 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:09 EST, 23 October 2013 . Shoppers are being misled by supermarket price-match schemes that do not bring the lower  grocery bills they expect. Rules in the small print and exclusions mean the stores are not comparing like with like, warn campaigners. Major players like Sainsbury’s, Tesco and Asda insist their schemes save customers money and time as they do not need to shop around. But Which? said its research found that each store tended to skew its comparisons to give the impression that it was the cheapest place to shop. In theory, the schemes compare the total price of items in a shopping basket against the same items sold by two or more competitors. If a rival is cheaper, the customer should get a voucher at the till or online for the difference. Researchers looking at 20 receipts from Sainsbury’s found the store claimed to be the cheapest on ten and joint-cheapest on two others. But its Brand Match scheme failed to take the cost of own label products into account, which means the final bill could be lower at a rival. Every little helps: Researchers examining 20 Tesco till receipts said it claimed to be cheapest for ten shopping baskets . Small print means that Sainsbury’s can also refuse to match the lowest price of a branded product at a rival on some occasions. At the same time, the chain only matches its prices against Asda and Tesco – but not Morrisons, which may be cheaper. Researchers examining 20 Tesco till receipts said it claimed to be cheapest for ten shopping baskets. Britain’s biggest supermarket – like Asda – does include own brand products in its Price Promise but only those it considers are of comparable quality. Asda goes further with a Price Guarantee, which gives out vouchers if the store’s basket is not at least 10 per cent cheaper. Small print: Sainsbury's can also refuse to match the lowest price of a branded product at a rival on some occasions . Which? found Asda claimed to be cheaper in 17 out of 19 checked receipts. Supermarkets often have slightly different pack sizes on popular foods, like cheese, which make comparisons difficult, leaving them further leeway to deny a voucher. The cost of living squeeze has led many shoppers to cut the amount they buy and turn to budget brands. Which? executive director, Richard Lloyd said: ‘Price-matching should be taken with a pinch of salt.’ This concern is confirmed in a ruling today from the Advertising Standards Authority banning a ‘misleading’ Sainsbury’s advert. It implied the chain would match the lowest price on brands sold by rivals but this was not always true. Sainsbury’s insisted consumers understand how Brand Match works and it ‘does the hard work by giving them a coupon at the till’. Tesco said vouchers ‘make it up to customers in a way they notice’ if their bill would have been lower elsewhere. Asda said its scheme means it beats rivals on price rather than just matching them.","Which? said stores skew comparisons to give impression that it's cheapest .

Heroes who fought in Afghanistan are engaged in a fresh battle – to raise thousands of pounds for soldiers who have been killed or wounded. Crack personnel from the Parachute Regiment will be guests of honour at a Festival of Remembrance staged before Armistice Day. The event has been organised by the Afghanistan Trust, a charity set up to raise money to support Paras who were seriously injured on the Helmand battlefield and the families of those killed on operations in the warzone. Assistance: Among those helped by the charity are the family of Corporal Bryan Budd, 29, who died in a hail of bullets as he single-handedly stormed a Taliban position near the town of Sangin to save his comrades . Marching on: The Paras, who wear distinctive maroon berets, have a reputation for being among the toughest fighters in the Army . Among those helped by the charity are the family of Corporal Bryan Budd, 29, of 3rd Battalion the Parachute Regiment. He received a posthumous Victoria Cross - Britain's highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy - for 'astonishing bravery' in August 2006. The father-of-two died in a hail of bullets as he single-handedly stormed a Taliban position near the town of Sangin to save his comrades. At least 28 other Paras have died fighting in Afghanistan. The Festival of Remembrance - called 'A Night To Remember' - will take place at St Dunstan In The West church on Fleet Street in Central London, on November 6.

Nigel Winkley, pictured with wife Vicky, was made redundant by British Gas just five days after major heart surgery . Recovering in hospital from a heart operation, Nigel Winkley assumed the visit from two of his bosses was to bring him good wishes. Instead, the pair delivered a PowerPoint presentation that ended with bombshell news...he was sacked. The extraordinary scene took place in front of fellow patients. The 40-year-old was too distressed to respond and it was left to his wife Vicky, 34, to order the suited pair off the premises. Just five days earlier the father of one underwent major surgery after a heart attack. Following the redundancy incident he suffered a bout of angina blamed on stress. Mrs Winkley, who owns a pre-school, said the presentation had left her and her husband in shock. ‘What sort of idiots flounce into a hospital to deliver that sort of news to someone who’s has just had heart surgery?’ she added. ‘It’s a complete disgrace. I told them I was not interested in my husband losing his job, because I was more worried that he was going to make it through the night. Nigel had been seriously unwell and could have died. ‘I hadn’t slept, thinking I was about to be widowed. Then these two decide to come to the hospital to deliver a terrible bombshell. I couldn’t believe their audacity.’ Mr Winkley started experiencing chest pains in March and was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester, where he had the heart operation. He had worked as an inspector for British Gas for three years after it bought out his former employer Hillserve Limited. ‘I loved it and could count the days I took off on one hand,’ he said. ‘I was so shocked and distressed by their behaviour I couldn’t talk. It was completely out of the blue.’ The British Gas managers gave a PowerPoint presentation before announcing the redundancy in front of other patients at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester . His wife added: ‘We had no idea that they were making redundancies. I had been ringing his office every day to give them an update on his health. ‘We had even received a get well soon card signed by all his colleagues, so we were just in shock. They’ve let him down. Nigel was a grafter and was never sick.’ Following the incident, Mrs Winkley made a formal complaint to British Gas and the company offered her husband a different position, which she said was too physical for his poor health. As a result her husband is working nights at a supermarket where he earns £18,000 compared with his previous salary of £25,000. British Gas have apologised for the way Mr Winkley was made redundant and said lessons have been learnt . A British Gas spokesman said: ‘We are very sorry that Mr and Mrs Winkley are unhappy with the way we communicated with them. 'Our intentions have always been to ensure Mr Winkley was provided with the information fully and quickly, and to ensure he didn’t receive the details from colleagues or friends. ‘We met with Mr and Mrs Winkley recently to address their concerns and have apologised that the news of the site closure was communicated to them in a public place. 'We are reviewing this case to make sure lessons are learnt for the future.’","Nigel Winkley made redundant in front of other patients at hospital .

With its fearsome array of weapons, radar evading silhouette and $7billion price tag, this is one of America's most deadly - and expensive - warships ever. USS Zumwalt - the largest destroyer ever made - is just days away from leaving the specially constructed dry docks and entering the water. Equipped with guns capable of firing warheads 100 miles, stealth features, and engine able to generate enough power to run 78,000 homes, America is hoping it with guarantee its naval supremacy for decades to come. Fearsome: The $7billion first-in-class Zumwalt rises from the dry docks in Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine . Hulking: First-in-class USS Zumwalt is the largest U.S. Navy destroyer ever built . After embarrassing troubles with its latest class of surface warships, the Navy is hoping for a winner from a new destroyer that's ready to go into the water. So far, construction of the . first-in-class Zumwalt, is on time and on budget, something that's a . rarity in new defense programs, officials said. The christening of the ship bearing the name of the late Adm. Elmo 'Bud' Zumwalt was canceled a week ago because of the federal government shutdown. Without fanfare, the big ship will be moved to dry dock and floated in the coming days. In action: An artist rendering of the USS Zumwalt class destroyer which will be one of the more heavily armed and expensive ships in the U.S Navy . Meanwhile, the public christening ceremony featuring Zumwalt's two daughters will be rescheduled for the spring. Adm. Zumwalt served in destroyers during World War II and was awarded a Bronze Star for valor at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. As . the nation's youngest chief of naval operations, appointed at age 49 by . President Richard Nixon, he fought to end racial discrimination and . allowed women to serve on ships for the first time. Like its namesake, the ship is innovative. It is so big that Bath Iron Works, a General Dynamics subsidiary, built a 106-foot-tall, $40 million 'Ultra Hall' to accommodate its large hull segments. The ship is 100 feet longer than the existing class of destroyers. Deadly force: Armed with up to 80 Tomahawk cruise missiles and designed to back up Marines on amphibious missions the USS Zumwalt is so expensive only three will be built . Resembling a 19th century ironclad warship the USS Zumwalt uses a 21st century version of a 'tumblehome' hull . It features an unusual wave-piercing hull, electric drive propulsion, advanced sonar and guided missiles, and a new gun that fires rocket-propelled warheads as far as 100 miles. Unlike warships with towering radar- and . antenna-laden superstructures, the Zumwalt will ride low to the water to . minimize its radar signature, making it stealthier than others. Displacement: 14,564 long tons (14,798 t) Length: 600 ft (180 m) Beam: 80.7 ft (24.6 m) Draft: 27.6 ft (8.4 m) Propulsion: 2 Rolls-Royce Marine Trent-30 gas turbines driving Curtiss-Wright generators and emergency diesel generators, 78 MW (105,000 shp); 2 propellers driven by electric motors . Speed: Over 30 kn (56 km/h; 35 mph) Warpons: . 20 × MK 57 VLS modules, with a total of 80 launch cells . RIM-162 Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), 4 per cell . Tactical Tomahawk, 1 per cellVertical Launch Anti-Submarine Rocket (ASROC), 1 per cell . 2 × 155 mm/62 caliber Advanced Gun System920 × 155 mm rounds total; 600 in automated store with Auxiliary store room with up to 320 rounds (non-automatic) as of April 200570–100 LRLAP rounds planned as of 2005 of total . • 2 × Mk 110 57 mm gun (CIGS) Originally envisioned for shore bombardment, the ship's size and power plant that can produce 78 megawatts of electricity — enough to power 78,000 homes — make it a potential platform for futuristic weapons like the electromagnetic rail gun, which uses a magnetic field and electric current to fire a projectile at seven times the speed of sound. There are so many computers and so . much automation that it'll need fewer sailors, operating with a crew of . 158, nearly half the complement aboard the current generation of . destroyers. 'The concept of . the Zumwalt is sort of a bridge between the traditions of the past and . the new world of networked warfare and precision guided munitions,' said . Loren Thompson, defense analyst at the Lexington Institute. 'It's . not so much a radical concept as it is an attempt to pull off a full . range of missions with a ship that has one foot in the present and one . foot in the future.' The . Navy once envisioned building more than 20 of the ships. But the ship . has so many sophisticated features and its cost grew so high that senior . Navy officials tried to kill the program. Instead, it was truncated to . just three ships, the first being Zumwalt. The Zumwalt will cost more than $3.5 billion — about three times that of current destroyers — but the program has not been beset by big cost overruns or delays, officials said. The fact that construction has gone smoothly is a relief for the Navy, which has dealt with embarrassing troubles on its new class of speedy warship, dubbed the 'littoral combat ship.' Those smaller ships, designed to operate close to shore in littoral waters, have been plagued by escalating costs, production delays and mechanical problems. What you get for $7 billion dollars: A guide to the USS Zumwalt's unique features . A model of the Zumwalt Class destroyer to be built by Bath Iron Works and Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding is displayed during a contract signing ceremony at the Pentagon . Mission modules that give them the . flexibility to perform roles including anti-submarine warfare and . minesweeping are not ready, even though the first ships have been . commissioned. 'That ship is a total disaster,' said Norman Polmar, a naval historian, analyst and author. Against . that backdrop, shipbuilders at Bath Iron Works have been toiling away . on the Zumwalt, the first entirely new ship built on the banks of the . Kennebec River since the original Arleigh Burke was christened more than . 20 years ago. The keel plate for the USS Zumwalt-class destroyer the destroyers will be a new class of multi-mission U.S. Navy surface combatant ship designed to operate as part of a joint maritime fleet . Dan Dowling, president of Local S6, which represents 3,200 shipbuilders, said it's been a challenging project with a new hull design, composite materials and new technology. 'It is a radical departure from what we've known. Whether the Navy is satisfied with the design of the ship is up to them. We can only build what they asked for,' he said, adding, 'I hope they'll be pleased with it. We'd like to build as many of them as we can.'","USS Zumwalt will have cost $7billion when finally completed .

A grandmother was shot and killed by state troopers after high-speed chase through the streets of New Hampshire. Wendy Lawrence, 45, of Canterbury, N.H., was struck by gunfire four times by a state trooper, officials with the state attorney general's office said. Following the Monday night shooting she was taken to a nearby hospital, but was pronounced dead. Lawrence first attracted attention after a New Hampshire State Police trooper saw a Chevrolet Monte Carlo being driven 'erratically' on a southbound highway at roughly 6:30 p.m. Monday, according to a statement from Jeffery A. Strelzin, the senior assistant state attorney general. Lawrence produced a non-driver's ID when the trooper asked her to produce a licence. As the trooper checked out her ID in his car, during which time he discovered she was a habitual offender, she drove off. After a short pursuit her car was found on an inter-state road, but Lawrence then sped away, nearly striking a person who was on the highway, reported NBC News. Multiple state police troopers aided in trying to apprehend Lawrence, following her to Kennard Street in Manchester, before she was shot.

A grieving pensioner was ordered to pay a carer £3,500 for ‘unfair dismissal’ because he cut her hours when his wife died. George Lomas, 77, was told he breached Jayne Wakefield’s contract by not giving notice that her hours would decrease after his wife Rose’s death.  Mrs Wakefield had cared for  Parkinson’s sufferer Mrs Lomas for five years, with her wages paid by the council. When his wife died, Mr Lomas offered to pay the carer himself – for fewer hours than before – to help as he coped with his loss.  She sat next to the pensioner at Mrs Lomas’s funeral, holding his hand and wiping his tears. But the very next day, she resigned by letter, demanding redundancy pay. Grieving: Pensioner George Lomas, 77, has been forced to pay thousands of pounds in compensation to his carer who sued him for constructive dismissal when her hours were cut after the death of his wife Rose . Trusting: Mr Lomas said that wife Rose, who died earlier this year, would have been 'turning in her grave' if she had known about the request for money . Yesterday, the ‘devastated’ grandfather of one said: ‘How was I supposed to give her notice? You . don’t have notice when your wife is going to die. ‘My wife would be heartbroken because she trusted Jayne. We never thought she would do that. ‘At Rose’s funeral, she was telling . everyone she was going to look after me, then the next day she was . asking for redundancy money. ‘It’s unreal – we treated her like a daughter and she has betrayed us.’ Mrs Wakefield, 55, took Mr Lomas to an employment tribunal. A judge rejected her claim, but on . appeal she was awarded £3,568, including redundancy pay and compensation . for constructive unfair dismissal and breach of contract. Last night, her husband Leslie, 59, . said: ‘She’s been given the redundancy money which she is entitled to . and that’s the end of the story. ‘People die. Husbands die, children . die, wives die – it happens, I’m afraid. Mr Lomas was Jayne’s employer, . it is as simple as that. I don’t think it’s a large bill – he’s sitting . on loads of premium bonds anyway.’ Even though Mrs Lomas’s care was . funded by Cheshire East Council, Mr Lomas will have to pay the whole . compensation sum from his own pocket. That is because he is legally . classed as Mrs Wakefield’s employer after paying her privately for just a . few days after his wife’s death. The retired accountant said he does not know how he will cope and accused the council of ‘washing their hands of the issue’. Not responsible: Cheshire East Council said that as Mr Lomas was not in receipt of adult care services from the council it was not liable for claims made via the tribunal . He said: ‘I’m on a company and state pension, but I just haven’t got the money to pay for this.’ Mr Lomas said he offered to pay the . carer for 16 hours a week, when she had previously put in 30 hours a . week caring for Mrs Lomas. But Mrs Wakefield told the tribunal in Birmingham that she quit because there was no written offer. Mr Lomas added that the incident had taken its toll on him and he had since suffered a minor stroke. He said: ‘It’s ruined my health. My doctor told me it has been brought on by the stress of this case. ‘To contact me the day after I lost my wife is disgusting. ‘And when she pushed a letter through the door saying she was suing me – my world fell apart. ‘I will never forgive her,’ he said, speaking from his home in Scholar Green, Cheshire. Both Mr Lomas, and Ms Wakefield live in Scholar Green, Cheshire (pictured). Mrs Lomas's care had been paid for by East Cheshire Council, but these funds were stopped when she died . Mr Lomas started caring for his wife . of 51 years, a retired quality controller, when she was diagnosed with . Parkinson’s almost 25 years ago. As her condition grew worse, Mrs Wakefield, a neighbour of the couple at the time, came in as a carer. At first, the council paid Mrs Wakefield directly, but later Mr Lomas received a grant to cover the cost. His son Adrian, managing director of a digital agency, said: ‘All this has really upset dad. ‘One day she was sitting in the front . row of the church holding dad’s hand at mum’s funeral, the next there’s . a letter pushed through his door.’ Entitled: Jayne Wakefield's husband Leslie said that the carer had been given the redundancy money she was entitled to . The 44-year-old said pensioners who pay for care should be careful. ‘Once the council stopped paying for . care direct, people like Dad were made to employ people themselves and . then pay them out of the money the council gave them,’ he said. ‘That means they have a responsibility for PAYE, holiday pay and even redundancy payments. ‘But no one made this clear to my father. He had never employed anybody in his life. ‘This has been a real kick in the . teeth for all of us, especially dad. Legally I understand why the appeal . was upheld, but morally there’s something very wrong about this.’ A council spokesman said: ‘Mr Lomas has not been in receipt of adult care services from Cheshire East Council. ‘His care arrangements, therefore, . were a private matter and the council is not liable for claims made via . an employment tribunal.’ Mrs Wakefield was not available  for comment.","George Lomas, 77, was taken to employment tribunal by Jayne Wakefield .

With just two weeks to go until the final U.S. troops are expected to withdraw from Iraq, it was business as usual today in a Baghdad market. Vendors at the Bab al-Sharji market have seen an increase in the number of U.S. army items available to sell. Among the 'trophies' are everyday items ranging from detergents, wallets, glasses, bags and meals. However, the market sellers are worried about losing their jobs when the U.S. military - their best customers as well as stock providers - pulls out of Iraq at the end of the month. 'Trophies': A vendor sells U.S. army items on a stall at the Bab al-Sharji market in central Baghdad today . American goods: Among the U.S. army items being sold are detergents, wallets, glasses, bags and meals . President Barack Obama is today . expected to wind down the most unpopular U.S. military venture since . Vietnam by declaring an end to another war without victory. Mr . Obama's visit to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, will be a chance to tout . the completion of a troop pull-out from Iraq by year-end. This will fulfil a promise that helped him win the presidency in 2008 and which he hopes will help him keep it in 2012. But . even as the last American forces pack up and leave in the final days of . a costly, nearly nine-year engagement, the debate over Mr Obama's exit . strategy remains as heated as ever at home - and most experts say it . could be years before history delivers a clear verdict.

Having . inherited the Iraq war as well as the withdrawal timetable from his . predecessor George W Bush, Mr Obama is gambling that Iraq is now stable . enough to deal internally with a still-dangerous insurgency and . externally with any threat from neighbouring Iran. Yet to paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld, Mr Bush's former defence secretary, unknowns - both known and unknown - abound. Will . violent Islamic radicals, never completely defeated, resurge? Will . Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's government drift, as critics charge, . toward a strong-arm model? Will Iraq's minority Kurds be satisfied with . their partial autonomy? Mr . Obama, however, has never wavered from his pledge to end a war that . claimed the lives of nearly 4,500 U.S. troops and tens of thousands of . Iraqis and inflicted lasting damage to America's standing worldwide. 'It's cost us probably over $1trillion, when all is said and done,' Mr Obama told a Virginia television station yesterday.

As . an Illinois state legislator, he gave a stirring speech in 2002 warning . that invading Iraq would plunge the U.S. into a 'dumb war'. Mr . Bush launched the invasion in 2003 based on claims of weapons of mass . destruction and Al-Qaeda ties that turned out not to exist. Mr . Obama gained momentum using his anti-war stance to distinguish himself . from top Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2008 presidential . primaries by insisting that unlike her he never would have voted in . Congress to go to war in Iraq. He . then capitalised on voters' growing disillusionment over Iraq to help . him defeat Republican opponent John McCain, a leading supporter of Mr . Bush's Iraq policy. In . office, Mr Obama moved quickly to scale back what his aides had dubbed . 'Bush's war' and to shift military focus to Afghanistan and its border . with Pakistan, which he called the neglected battleground in the fight . against Al-Qaeda. End in sight: President Barack Obama is today expected to wind down the war, the most unpopular U.S. military venture since Vietnam . Long slog: Former President George W Bush launched the invasion of Iraq in 2003 based on claims of weapons of mass destruction and Al-Qaeda ties that turned out not to exist . Commentators . now see that conflict as 'Obama's war' and believe his legacy as a . wartime president will rise and fall more on the outcome of the . Afghanistan-Pakistan campaign than on any developments in Iraq. With . the curtain coming down on U.S. military involvement in Iraq, Mr Obama . will use his speech to returning troops at Fort Bragg, home of the 82nd . Airborne Division, to put a capstone on a war that strained America's . armed forces. He would have . preferred to keep at least several thousand troops in Iraq as trainers . but failed to reach a deal with Iraq's fractious government - another . source of Republican criticism of his leadership. As of Tuesday, there were about 5,500 U.S. troops left in Iraq, down from more than 170,000 at the height of the war. Mr . Obama will now try to capitalise politically on the moment - even . though the December 2011 deadline was actually set by Mr Bush after he . ordered a 'surge' of troops that helped pull Iraq back from the brink of . civil war. But what Mr Obama wants to avoid is the impression that he is taking a victory lap, aides say. The . White House is mindful of Mr Bush's landing on the deck of the aircraft . carrier USS Abraham Lincoln draped with a 'Mission Accomplished' banner . and his declaration of an end to major combat operations in May 2003. The stunt was widely ridiculed, given that the worst of Iraq's . insurgency was yet to come.","Vendors at the Bab al-Sharji market have seen an increase in U.S. army items - such as detergents, wallets and glasses - available to sell .

Facebook has removed a video of a woman being beheaded following the huge public outcry that was sparked by their lifting of a ban on gory imagery on Monday. The abrupt abrupt flip-flop came a day after a public outcry over news reports that Facebook, the world's No. 1 social network with 1.15 billion members, had lifted a temporary ban on images of graphic violence. Facebook said on Monday that gory videos, such as a video of a masked man beheading a woman in Mexico, are permitted on its site so long as the content is posted in a manner intended for its users to 'condemn' the acts rather than celebrate them. Gruesome videos of people being beheaded are to be allowed on Facebook once again. The social network claims that its users should be able to watch and condemn these videos, but not celebrate them . But Facebook said on Tuesday that it had decided to 'strengthen' its enforcement of the policy. 'When we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video,' Facebook said in a statement. 'Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience,' Facebook said. The flip-flop underscores a challenge for Facebook as it seeks to position itself as the go-to online destination where people share up-to-the-minute images and discuss breaking news events. Alert: Facebook has begun adding warning messages to videos on its website showing decapitations . Facebook initially claimed that the criticism it received did not affect its decision but later on Tuesday admitted it had. The British Prime Minister David Cameron went on the warpath on Tuesday accusing Facebook of irresponsibility after it lifted a ban on users posting videos of beheadings - and demanded the social networking site explain its decision to parents. Critics accused the firm of ‘taking leave of its senses’. Facebook had said that while the images must not be posted for ‘sadistic pleasure’ they should be available for those who wish to condemn them. However, last night it was revealed Facebook had removed the clip of a woman being beheaded and said it would use a broader set of criteria to determine when gory videos are permitted on the site. Facebook’s unpublicized change in policy came to light after it refused to remove a 57-second video showing a young Mexican woman, her hands tied behind her back and on her knees, being beheaded by a masked man in broad daylight. It was posted last week under the title ‘Challenge: Anybody can watch this video?’. The site, which is open to anyone over the age of 13, had banned footage of decapitation on its site in May citing concerns that it would cause long-term psychological damage . One disgusted viewer commented: ‘Remove this video, too many young innocent minds out there shouldn’t see this.’ Another wrote: ‘This is absolutely horrible, distasteful and needs to be removed... I’m very disturbed after seeing a couple of seconds of it.’ Facebook had introduced a temporary ban on decapitation videos in May but later removed it, explaining that the site is used to share information about world events, such as acts of terrorism and human rights abuses. While Facebook polices its site to remove pornography, hate speech and other forbidden content, the company must also make a judgment about when certain grizzly images, such as video of a terrorist attack, are in the public interest versus being shared for 'sadistic pleasure.' Facebook acknowledged on Tuesday that its previous approach, which permitted the video of the woman's killing in Mexico to remain on its site, was flawed. 'Based on these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it,' the company said. Facebook may now allow . videos of people being beheaded, but there are a number of subjects and . clips it will not allow to be published on in its site. Facebook . has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any . explicitly sexual content where a child is involved. Elsewhere, . the site imposes ‘limitations on the display of nudity’ but doesn’t ban . it outright - it depends on the context and circumstance. Female . nipples, as a rule, will be removed but male nipples are allowed. A . photo was famously removed last year when an elbow was mistaken for a . female nipple, before being reinstated. Breastfeeding images were removed in . 2012, but Facebook’s Community Guidelines now states the site ‘respects . people’s right to share content of personal importance’ and makes . explicit reference to breastfeeding. The . pictures are allowed if the child is seen ‘actively nursing’ but may be . removed if it shows the nipple. Children playing in the bath are . accepted as long as they are not graphic and explicit, while sculpture . and art work that depicts the naked body is allowed, but real-life . images and similar poses are not. Another . photo famously taken down showed Kylie Minogue holding a teddy bear . with her microphone positioned in such a way, between the bear’s legs, . that made it look phallic. Facebook removed it for violating the use of . ‘photos that contain nudity, drug use or violence.’ Any . video that condones violence, threatens or is abusive and bullying . towards another person or promotes criminal activity is prohibited. Any . promotion or encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders of drug . abuse is similarly banned. Facebook . does not permit hate speech, especially towards individuals, groups, . sex, race, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation – yet will . distinguish between ‘serious and humorous speech’ and will allow videos . and posts that ‘challenge ideas, institutions and certain practices.’ Sharing . graphic content for 'sadistic pleasure' is prohibited, yet if the . content is shared in the process of reporting current events it is be . allowed as long as it balances ‘the needs of a diverse community.’ Facebook . monitors photos, but also relies on its users to report content they . feel should be removed. If a photo is under investigation it may be . temporarily removed while Facebook looks into the complaint but will be . reinstated if it is found not to have breached the code.","Facebook banned decapitation videos in May due to psychological damage .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 12:17 EST, 23 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:36 EST, 23 October 2013 . Two men are facing multiple criminal charges after a prank on a friend who was acting as a grand juror went terribly wrong. The incident started on Oct. 16 when detectives from the Pinal County Sheriff's Office in central Arizona were alerted to a threat made against a 41-year-old man from Casa Grande who was serving as the foreman for grand jury proceedings. The foreman told police that, while on break from the proceedings, he had found a troubling handwritten note on his truck that said he had been followed home. The note said: 'You better not find my dad guilty! I followed you home last Wednesday. I know where you live, a--hole! Early Road sound familiar.' Official evidence: This is the note found on the car of a grand jury foreman who was serving in Pinal County Superior Court last week. The note was a prank left by two of the juror's co-workers, but was taken seriously and lead to an extensive process of investigations . The grand jury case was immediately halted as were put on the case to look into the threat. Investigators traced the note - which was written on a guest check commonly used in restaurants - to the L & B restaurant in nearby Florence, according to the Arizona Daily Independent. Upon showing a waitress the note left for the foreman, the waitress said she had found a similar note by the cash register when she came into work that day. She also said the note appeared to be in the same handwriting of another waitress that works at the restaurant. Detectives then spoke with the waitress who wrote the note, who they reported was very cooperate. She said that two men had been in the restaurant the day before and had asked for some writing equipment. They said they planned to play a joke on a co-worker. One of the men wrote the note and then asked the waitress to re-write it so their friend would not recognize the handwriting. The waitress told police she agreed to do it but told the men it was a bad idea. They assured her they intended to tell their friend about the prank the following day at work. Detectives then traced the credit card used to pay the bill at the establishment to a 'W Packard'. Traced: Detectives tracked the threatening note back to this restaurant in Florence, Arizona. As it turned out the two men asked a waitress to write it for them so their friend would not recognize the handwriting . They called the office of the foreman asking for a 'W Packard' but were told he was not in the office. A short time later police received a call from Will Packard, 33, of Marciopa, who said the entire incident was a prank he and Robert Marquez, 35, of Casa Grande, were playing on a co-worker. Packard said he and Marquez had taken photos of the note on the truck and planned to tell the foreman once he returned to work. Detectives notified the foreman about what had happened and he was reportedly upset by what the pair had done. While police were content with the investigations, Sheriff Paul Babeu said the implications of the prank - especially the interruption of a grand jury - were too serious to ignore. 'This case was investigated by multiple detectives who were pulled from other priority cases they were working on,' Sheriff Babeu told the Arizona Daily Independent. Repercussions: The threat interrupted a grand jury trial happening here, at the Pinal County Superior Courthouse . 'Grand jury proceedings were interrupted as well because of the prank these men tried to pull on their friend. 'Hopefully the men find it as funny when they are involved with the judicial process as detectives will submit the investigation to the County Attorney's Office and ask they review the case for criminal charges, including Influencing a Juror, Disorderly Conduct and Threatening and Intimidating.' Pinal Country attorney Lando Voyles aid the case had affected way too many people and cost way too much money to be glossed over as a prank. 'The trauma inflicted on the foreman, the risk of wrongful arrest for the innocent writer of the note, the great expense of the all-out investigation and, most importantly, the overall potential risk of tampering with the integrity of our judicial system requires my office's action,' Mr Voyles told The Arizona Republic. The case against the two men is currently being reviewed.","Will Packard, 33, and Robert Marquez, 35, decided to leave terrorizing note on the car of a co-worker, who was acting as the foreman in a grand jury proceeding in Arizona .

It is without doubt one of the most iconic symbols of the American Government - but while it may look good from a distance, it is in desperate need of a makeover. The U.S Capitol dome will be covered in scaffolding for around two years after it was announced today that the 150-year-old structure will undergo its first major restoration for more than 50 years. The Architect of the Capitol, the federal post responsible for maintaining the historic building, said that more than 1,300 cracks and other structural problems need desperate attention. Much needed repairs: The U.S Capitol dome is to be shrouded in scaffolding for two years as it undergoes a $59million makeover . Damage: Around 1,300 cracks in the famous dome will need to be repaired during the two year period . Wear and tear: Experts say that the structural damage is due to weathering rather than an after effect of an earthquake which hit DC in 2011 . Stephen T. Ayers said in a statement: 'Under the paint, age and weather have taken its toll.' The restoration is expected to cost around $59.6million. According to Mr Ayers spokesman, Justin Kieffer, the damage to the dome is not the result of the earthquake which hit Washington DC in 2011 and damaged other structures, including the Washington Monument. Repairs on the Capitol dome are not expected to affect legislative . business and are being designed to minimally affect tours and other . events. When possible, the architect's office said, repairs will be . done at night and on weekends. Inside the Capitol Rotunda, a . doughnut-shaped canopy will be built to protect visitors from . construction debris and will ensure the Apotheosis of Washington, a . fresco painting in the center of the Capitol, can still be seen. Minimal disruption: The Architect of the Capitol, which is in charge of overseeing all congressional grounds, said most of the construction will happen during nights and weekends . Regular updates: The Architect of the Capitol's office plans to post regular updates on the construction on its website . In a similar way to the Washington Monument during restoration work on that, the dome's scaffolding will be lit up at night. The Architect of the Capitol's office plans to post regular updates on the construction on its website. The dome was lasted given a facelift back in 1960 - just in time for the beginning of John F Kennedy's Presidency. Then the dome temporarily turned red - workmen removed paint from the iron dome and had to paint a red rust inhibiting coating on its surface. The Capitol building is not the only famous Washington DC landmark to undergo repairs. Still on view: Inside the Capitol Rotunda, a canopy will be built to protect visitors from construction debris and will ensure the Apotheosis of Washington, a fresco painting in the center of the Capitol, can still be seen . As well as the Washington Monument, which was damaged in the 2011 earthquake, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where many White House staff work, recently shed its scaffolding after years of repair. The building has been the home of at the centre of American Government since the first Congress sat there in 1800. Its construction was based on a revised version of architect William Thornton's design inspired by the east front of the Louvre in Paris. It was built at the east end of the National Mall on a plateau some 88 feet above the level of the Pontomac River. The building covers around four acres and has more than 600 rooms. Since it was built, the Capitol Building has been partially burned down, rebuilt, extended and restored.","The Architect of the Capitol announced the major restoration work today .

Wal-Mart: The nation's largest retailer has announced that customers can trade-in their old devices for up to $300 and that cash can go towards the thinner, lighter iPad Air . The trade-in plan echoes the program Wal-Mart introduced last month for smartphones, soon after Apple unveiled the IPhone 5s and 5c models. But Wal-Mart isn't the only retailer offering it. Others also see it as a way to attract customers who want the latest models of devices they already own, but now consider obsolete. Wal-Mart also revealed that it is slashing prices on older iPad models effective immediately, with the 16 GB iPad with Retina Wi-Fi now $449 from $499 and the 16GB iPad mini Wi-Fi now $299 from $329.

An Alabama man has admitted defeat in his four year legal battle to keep his wife’s body in a grave just yards from his front porch. James Davis’ decision to back down comes after the Alabama Supreme Court rejected his appeal earlier this month. Davis, 74, said his wife Patsy's dying wish in 2009 was to be buried in front of their log home in downtown Stevenson. The couple had been married for 48 years. James Davis, holding a photo of his dead wife Patsy, has agreed to have her remains dug up and cremated before he buries them outside his home in downtown Stevenson, Alabama . Now he has agreed to have her body dug up and cremated, provided he can put her ashes back in the grave. His wife’s request, he said, had been based on the fact that she was afraid of cremation, but enough time has now passed. ‘If she saw herself as she is now, I know she would not mind,’ he told the New York Times. Davis has spent several thousand dollars in a legal battle over the grave, but admitted after the supreme court’s decision on October 11 that he didn’t have the money to pursue the case any further. 'I still ain't got no justice,' he said. Loved one: Davis buried his wife in his yard in 2009 on her request and had hoped to be buried there too . James and Patsy Davis were married for 48 years and had five children . The couple both grew up in Dayton, Tenn., and first met when she was seven and he was 11 and he asked her to accompany him to a strawberry festival. 'We went on that one date, and it was me and her the rest of the time,' he said. They were married for 48 years and had five children. In her later years, his wife suffered crippling arthritis, and Mr. Davis retired from his job as an electrical worker to take care of her until her death in April 2009. Shortly before her death, Mr. Davis said, she expressed her wish to be buried in the yard of the house where they had spent three decades together. The City Council rejected Davis' request for a cemetery permit for his yard after his wife died, but he buried her a few feet from the front porch anyway. The headstone, which Davis keeps surrounded by flowers, is visible from the street. The city sued to make Davis remove the grave, arguing that laws prohibit people from using their yards as burial grounds inside the city limits, and a judge last year ordered Davis to move the remains to a licensed cemetery. The removal order was placed on hold to give a state appeals court time to rule, but Edmiston said the order would be enforced now that the Supreme Court sided with the town of 2,600 residents. In her later years, Patsy suffered crippling arthritis and so James retired from his job as an electrical worker to take care of her until her death in April 2009 .

'We're not talking about a homestead, . we're not talking about someone who is out in the country on 40 acres of . land. Mr. Davis lives in downtown Stevenson.' Edmiston said the man rejected several compromises from the city, including the offer of two plots in the municipal graveyard. Davis had planned to be bury beside Patsy after he death, and he hopes that his five children and 15 grandchildren will care for the property from then on.","James Davis has agreed to have the remains of wife Patsy dug up and cremated .

The amount of Americans who believe in the legalization of recreation marijuana continues to reach new highs, with a new survey showing that, for the first time ever, a clear majority of the country are in support of the drug. The latest Gallup survey has shown that 58 per cent of Americans believe that pot should be made legal. The figures represent a whopping 10 per cent jump in support in just 12 months . Gallup says the poll is proof of the 'unprecedented success' marijuana advocates have amassed over the last 12 months and that the results will likely inspire future legalization efforts. 'Whatever the reasons for Americans' greater acceptance of marijuana, it is likely that this momentum will spur further legalization efforts across the United States,' the Gallup poll analysis said. The poll surveyed 1,028 Americans by phone between October 3 and 6. Make it available: More Americans than ever are in support of the legalization of marijuana, with 58 per cent responding in a new Gallup poll saying they think it should be legal. Here Monique Rydberg weighs and packages medical marijuana at The Joint, a medical marijuana cooperative in Seattle . There are unforeseen dangers with making marijuana legal, the opposition claim, mainly that people are unaware of the potency and effects of the marijuana that is available today . While the majority of those in favor of marijuana were young and liberal, the biggest increase of support came from people who identified as independents. Some 62 per cent of independents favored legalization in 2013, an increase of 12 per cent on last year. - 58 per cent of the 1,028 people polled by Gallup said they supported marijuana being made legal for recreational use across the United States . - 53 per cent of people aged 65 and over remain opposed . - Only 35 per cent of Republicans were in support . - Largest increase in support came from Independents, with 62 per cent now in support . - Some 38 per cent of respondents said they had tried marijuana at some point . - In contrast, first Gallup poll on the issue in 1969 showed a support rate of 12 per cent . Republicans remain the only significant voting block opposed to legalization, with 35 per cent in support of the effort. That is compared to the 65 per cent of Democrats who said they favored legalization. The poll broke Americans down into five general age groups - 18 to 29, 30 to 49, 50 to 64 and 65 and older. The only age group generally not in favor of legalization were those aged 65 or older. Some 53 per cent of that group remain opposed. Gallup says the overall result of 58 per cent is a stark contrast to the group's first legalization poll in 1969, in which only 12 per cent of respondents said they favored marijuana becoming legal. The results also showed that 38 per cent of respondents said they had personally tried marijuana. 'Americans are increasingly recognizing that marijuana is less harmful than they’ve been led to believe,' the spokesperson for Marijuana Policy Project, Mason Tvert, told NBC News. 'I think it’s time to regulate marijuana like alcohol and most Americans appear to agree. 'We’re seeing support for ending prohibition in states across the country and efforts are being made to change state laws.'

Other states, including Rhode Island and Hawaii, are planning legalization initiatives for 2016 to coincide with the next presidential election. Marijuana is still considered an illegal drug by the federal government and is categorized as a hallucinogen by the Drug Enforcement Administration. President of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Craig T.

Currently both Colorado and Washington have passed laws that legalize recreational marijuana . 'We have entered a slippery slope that will be hard to turn away from,' he said. Founder of the Citizens Against Legalizing Marijuana initiative, Carla Lowe, said people were ignorant to the potency and effects of some strands of marijuana being created and made available. 'I’m concerned that these people that are saying that they are favoring legalization are really not aware or knowledgeable about the marijuana that’s out there today,' Ms Lowe  said. A poll conducted by Pew Research in April found that 52 percent of the country favored legalization.","Gallup poll says 58 per cent of people now support the use of recreational pot .

A three-foot cement replica of the Great Sphinx appeared in New York on Tuesday was the latest addition to Banksy’s street artist residency, until it was swiftly sold by a business owner before the day even ended. While many of the works have been vandalized, Bernardo ‘Choco’ Veles sold the one near his Millets Point, Queens auto-glass shop Tuesday afternoon to an eager art collector for an undisclosed sum. As men Veles hired began to haul the foam, cement and cinderblock sculpture away, a crowd there to take pictures booed and a fight very nearly broke out. Scroll down for video . Street sculpture: British street artist Banksy's October 22 addition to his New York residency was this foam and cement sphinx in Willets Point, Queens, though it wasn't there long . Banksy fever took over New York as soon as the first bit of street art—a stencil of two boys stealing an actual anti-graffiti sign—hit the city as part of the artist’s Better Out Than In. Veles is not the first to profit from the class crusader’s work. When a painting of a beaver popped up on an East New York wall, some men threw a pizza box over it and started charging people $5 each to see and photograph it. But he might be getting the richest from the found art. WATCH MORE AT THE UNDERGROUND FX . Protected: The sculpture was, while it lasted, surrounded by a moat of stagnant puddle water . 'No turn unstoned,' reads the caption on Banksy's website. 'A 1/36 scale replica of the great Sphinx of Giza made from smashe cinderblocks. You're advised not to drink the replica Arab spring water' ‘A big gallery truck pulled up and offered me money. He gave me a card,’ Veles told the New York Post. Veles said a female collector was desperate for the work, but ‘I don’t want to say more,’ he said. Just hours after it appeared, the statue was being pulled from the ankle-deep stagnant puddle it stood inside. As a truck backed toward it, some people in the crowd yelled ‘all the way!’ in an apparent call for the sphinx to be destroyed rather than carted off. Sold: Just hours after it was sighted, the sphinx was sold by the owner of a nearby auto-glass shop named Bernardo 'Choco' Veles for an unknown sum . Quick turnaround: Veles hired 20 guys to help him get the sphinx loaded into a truck . One of Veles’ workers even sold a brick out from under the sphinx for a hundred dollars. ‘You don’t own it,’ screamed Darwin Requena from the crowd. ‘Are you looking to start something,’ the worker said in Requena’s face. 'A big gallery truck pulled up and offered me money. He gave me a card,' said Veles. Veles said that an unidentified art collector desperately wanted the piece and she was swift in scooping it up. 'I don't want to say more,' he said. ‘I don’t want to fight,’ said Requena. ‘We just want to take pictures and you’re blocking it.’ Banksy's website has been documenting, and sometimes commenting on each of his one-per-day pieces. For October 22, the site read, 'No turn unstoned. A 1/36 scale replica of the great Sphinx of Giza made from smashed cinderblocks.You're advised not to drink the replica Arab spring water.' On Saturday, Banksy painted a picture of a boy about to smash a water sprinkler with a hammer, titled 'Better Out Than In', on the Upper West Side. Saul Zabar, of the famed grocery store family, has helped add protective Plexiglass, to preserve the artist's work on his family's building on West 79th St . Graffiti reading, 'Let the streets decide' has already been sprayed over - and cleaned off - the painting . Banksy's Monday offering to the streets of New York is this picture of a young boy writing graffiti in the South Bronx, 153rd Street and Elton Avenue, while being served by a waiter in tails . And in Greenwich Village, two Banksy works, 'Sirens of the Lambs' and 'Shoe Shining Ronald McDonald' made a rare appearance together outside a McDonald's .","'A big gallery truck pulled up and offered me money.

A Texas animal shelter may face legal action after putting a dog down last week for ‘unknown demons.’ The New Braunfels Humane Society’s euthanization of a puppy brought to the shelter after being found abandoned has been called unlawful by Elaine Buchhorn – and she is considering suing over the dog’s death. The animal’s execution was announced last week on the suburban San Antonio pet rescue center’s Facebook page despite Ms Buchhorn calling every day to check on the animal’s status, she told the Houston Chronicle. Playful: 'Baby George' is seen sitting on top of another of Elaine Buchholz's dogs before he was brought to the local shelter . Possessed by demons: 'Baby Geoge' (right) does not come off as aggressive in pictures posted by Ms Buchholz . Haunted by demons: The humane society claimed it 'set free' the puppy by putting it down . The post read ‘the pup is now free, free from whatever unknown demons were causing the aggression,’ said the Chronicle. The posting is no longer visible on the shelter’s page. Found in July by Ms Buchhorn’s son, she told the paper, the Dachsun-Chihuahua mix was only 11-weeks-old when brought to the Humane Society earlier this month. ‘Baby George’ was brought to the humane society with two objectives in mind, to make sure he was safe around Ms Buchhorn’s two-year-old granddaughter and to help find him a new home, she told the paper. ‘He was very socialized,’ the woman told the Chronicle. Ms Buchhorn told the Chronicle she also said to notify her if finding the dog a home was a problem. ‘I said, 'Before you try to euthanize this dog, I will appreciate a call because I'll take the puppy back and try to find it a home on my own.’ Write caption here . Humanized: 'Baby George' pictured with Ms Buchholz's two-year-old granddaughter . Only three days later, the dog was put down for aggression – leaving the animal lover shocked.‘They never admitted the puppy was aggressive to me over the phone.’ Ms Buchhorn told the paper she may sure the shelter for violating laws requiring they provide the dog with food, water, care, or shelter for an animal. Another local resident already filed a complaint with local police. A shelter official who spoke to MailOnline disputes Ms Buchhorn’s claims, saying she released all legal rights to the dog when she handed it over to the human society. ‘She signed a release form over to us releasing the animal and the rights to the animal over to us ,’ executive director Billie Zercher said. ‘Our policy is anything that shows aggression towards a person we cannot place up for adoption.’ Inhumane: The dog was euthanized by the humane society for 'unknown demons' ‘Baby George’ tried to bite two employees on two separate occasions, Ms Zercher explained, leading to the decision to euthanize him. When pressed over claims Ms Buchholz had asked to be notified in advance if the dog was to be put down, Ms Zercher replied ‘I’m not arguing what she’s telling local media.’ ‘We receive in numerous animals every single day,’ Ms Zercher further explained, ‘we cannot call every single person that releases an animal over to us.’ Of the 4,000 animals taken in by the shelter this year, 500 have been put down, according to Ms Zercher. She declined to break down the reasons for the animal deaths. This is an unfortunate circumstance,’ Ms Zercher said. ‘[but] we have to be careful what we adopt out.’ Ms Buchhorn told the Chronicle she has yet to receive an apology, and regrets bringing the dog in.‘It still haunts me, I'm living with the regret of taking him there.’","The puppy was brought to the shelter after it was found abandoned .

A woman whose right arm was amputated from the shoulder down when she was three years old after being misdiagnosed with cancer has received a bionic limb. Doctors later found that Ashley Kurpiel, 32, from Georgia, was in fact suffering from a rare, incurable disease called Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) which causes her soft tissues to turn into solid bone. After being fitted with her new robotic arm at the Denver Clinic for Extremities At Risk in Colorado last week, she told CBS News: 'I keep looking down and seeing two hands and it's just mind-blowing.' Overwhelming feeling: Ashley Kurpiel whose right arm was amputated from the shoulder down when she was three years old after being misdiagnosed with cancer has been fitted with a bionic limb . The prosthesis works through sensors placed on Ms Kurpiel's right shoulder. These detect minute electrical charges in her muscles and trigger small motors in the battery-powered arm to move. This means Ms Kurpiel can now multi-task. In front of a film crew she demonstrated how she can now use her cell phone and hold a drink at the same time. 'I put a cookie in there and just go for it,' Ms Kurpiel later said while popping a biscuit into her mouth. Brave: Ms Kurpiel, (right) is slowly losing her ability to move thanks to a disease disease called Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP) which causes her soft tissues to turn into solid bone . Lucky: Ms Kurpiel, who has already lost an arm to the condition, says she is happy her jaw hasn't locked . Ms Kurpiel is one of an estimated 700 people worldwide with Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP), a disease sometimes known as 'stone man syndrome' because its devastating effects can leave sufferers completely immobilised, like living statues. 'My condition has made me who I am - an optimistic person with an inner strength and determination to succeed,' Ms Kurpiel previously said. 'My condition has made me who I am - an optimistic person with an inner strength and determination to succeed' 'If I want to do something, then I normally find a way to do it. I don't know how much longer I will have movement in my body, so I want to experience as much as I can now. 'In other cases of FOP people have frozen solid, their jaws locking shut. They can't move and have to talk through their teeth long before they get to my age. So I actually feel extremely lucky.' The condition arises from a mutation of the body's repair mechanism which causes muscles, tendons and ligaments to convert to bone material when damaged. Ms Kurpiel,, whose mother Carol emigrated to Georgia from the UK before she was born, was diagnosed with the condition when she was three years old - six months after her right arm was amputated by surgeons who wrongly suspected she had cancer. Childhood: Ms Kurpiel, pictured with her mother Carol, was initially diagnosed with cancer at the age of three . Ambassador: She now hopes to raise awareness of her condition and met the Dalai Lama in 2007 . 'During my childhood my mobility was fine, because I was still young,' she added. 'But I was quite unhappy. I felt very different from the other children at school, and I didn't have many friends. I was quite shy and kept myself to myself. It wasn't much of a life.' Her symptoms first began to show when she was a teenager, with gradual muscle stiffening accelerating as she grew older. 'I began to feel my body stiffen gradually. I knew I was finally facing the onset of the condition,' she remembers. 'I'd been told what was going to happen, and feeling the first symptoms made me want to experience everything life had to offer - before it was too late.' She married Shawn Keeney, 31, a man she met online, but the pair divorced in 2005 after three years of marriage. 'I'm still on good terms with Shawn and I look back on our time together with nothing but fondness,' Ms Kurpiel said. Video source YouTube HitTheResetButton . 'Walking down the aisle, with full use of my limbs, was one of the happiest days of my life, and no one can take that memory away from me.' Despite her happy memories, in May 2006, Ms Kurpiel's life took a turn for the worse after she was involved in a serious car crash. She escaped without any broken bones but her right leg took a heavy impact. 'My doctor warned me that just the slightest bump could trigger the FOP to take hold. After the smash I fully expected my leg to freeze up permanently,' Ms Kurpiel said. Proud: Ms Kurpiel wants to do as much as she possibly can before being left immobile . 'One of my worst fears was that my body would fuse upright, meaning I'd never be able to sit again. 'When my leg locked in a standing position I was sure I was facing a worst-case scenario. Luckily when the swelling went down I was able to bend the leg slightly. 'I spent a lot of time sitting in the hope it would fuse in that position. At least then I could sit in a wheelchair and be wheeled around.' Her leg locked into a bent position permanently in May 2007, and Ms Kurpiel was fitted with a special platform shoe to help her maintain as much mobility as possible. Since the setback, Ms Kurpiel has been determined to do more with her life and so far, has learned to surf and completed a five kilometre course in a specially-adapted wheelchair in August last year. She has also become a full-time ambassador for amputees and families affected by the FOP and in December she is going on a Caribbean cruise with 100 friends who are amputees. 'I've been blessed to meet so many truly amazing people, especially the Dalai Lama - that was a real honour,' said Ashley of the religious leader, whom she met in 2007. 'I feel so humbled that so many people have taken an interest, and hopefully found some inspiration, in my life.' There's no known cure for FOP, but in 2006, a team at the University of Pennsylvania isolated the gene responsible for the disease. Researchers are now searching for a cure.","Ashley Kurpiel, 32, was misdiagnosed with cancer at the age of three but was later found to be suffering from Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva .

The country’s top GP yesterday rejected a Government crackdown on health tourism as ‘xenophobic’. Dr Clare Gerada, of the Royal College of General Practitioners, insisted doctors would not act as ‘a new border agency’ by asking about the immigration status of patients. And she cast doubt on the findings of a Government report warning of the huge cost of foreign visitors and short-term migrants. 'Xenophobic': Dr Clare Gerada, left, said doctors will not act as 'a new boarder agency' while Frank Field, right, said GPs have a duty to ensure those using the health services have 'paid their way' ‘The biggest problem is expats,’ she added. ‘There is a xenophobia. We are denigrating, yet again, immigrants who are more like to be caring for us [as NHS staff] than abusing the health system.’ But former Labour welfare minister Frank Field condemned her remarks, saying: ‘Dr Clare Gerada’s statement exposes the gap between what doctors expect in salaries and how far they are prepared to go to meet their duties as citizens. ‘No one is asking GPs to be part of the Border Agency but they do have a duty to their patients, who pay their salaries and all NHS bills, to ensure that those drawing health services have paid their way. ‘That’s the overwhelming view of their patients, who are increasingly fed up with a welfare state that rewards something for nothing rather than affirming the something for something principle.’ Suggestion: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was no suggestion GPs should act as border guards and any changes would be a part of normal day to day administration . An official report yesterday put the cost of NHS services used by foreign visitors and short-term migrants at £1.9 billion to £2 billion a year. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘No one is suggesting GPs should act as border guards.

A stroke victim was left in shock after waking up to find she was speaking in a Welsh accent. Deborah Ballard, 53, from Eastbourne, East Sussex, only realised she was suffering with foreign accent syndrome - where people's voices can change following trauma - when she was calling in her pets from the garden. Mrs Ballard suffered a stroke in February and a transient ischaemic attack - known as a mini stroke - on Sunday when she was at her job as a senior care assistant. She said: 'It wasn't until I called the animals in that I realised my voice had changed.’ The grandmother, who was born in London and grew up in Kent, said her son initially thought she was joking when he heard her. She said she couldn't put her finger on where her new accent was from but that friends and family said she sounded Welsh. She said: 'I texted my husband and told him not to be surprised when he came home as I had a bit of an accent. 'I got a bit embarrassed about it at first but everybody who has heard me said they think it's sweet. 'I spoke to the doctor about it and he said as long as I'm not in pain everything should be alright. 'I must admit when I was talking I was looking in the mirror and talking to myself, I was trying to work it out and was getting a bit upset.' Despite the change, Mrs Ballard is remaining positive and says she actually thinks the new accent is quite nice. She added: 'I kept putting my fingers in my ears trying to hear my own voice. 'I was trying to get my normal voice back, I was coughing. 'I realised I was speaking with an accent, and I knew it was serious. 'I did cry and get down initially but I think it could have been worse at least I still have my speech and the use of my body.' Mrs Ballard said she was initially embarrassed about the accent but that she feels better about it now as people have told her it is 'sweet'. She is thought to have developed foreign accent syndrome . Mrs Ballard, who is on medication for the stroke and a knee operation she had in August, is due to attend the stroke unit today. She said: 'I am trying not to let it get me down now, I am trying to take each day as it comes and take nothing for granted. 'A lot of people get down about strokes but I am trying to show that you don't have to be. 'I have a supportive family and think I have come out of my stroke really well.' Foreign accent syndrome is a medical condition in which patients develop what appears to be a foreign accent. It usually results from a stroke but can also develop from head trauma. Last month a woman from Plymouth hit the headlines after she developed a Chinese accent. Foreign accent syndrome is a very rare condition that results from damage to the speech centres of the brain. It makes the sufferer sound as though they have a foreign accent. It does not enable them to speak a language they did not previously know. Strokes are the most common cause of the syndrome but it can also result from a head trauma.","Deborah Ballard, 53, from East Sussex, had a stroke in February and a mini-stroke on Sunday after which she noticed her voice had changed .

Toyota has recalled 885,000 cars for the unlikely reason that spider webs can cause airbags to inflate accidentally (illustrated) Toyota has recalled 885,000 cars for the unlikely reason that spider webs could cause airbags to accidentally inflate and cause drivers to lose control at the wheel. The auto manufacturer has recalled Camrys - the best-selling car in the U.S. - as well as Venzas and Avalons that were built from 2012 onwards. The reason the company gave was that the arachnid's sticky webs could cause a blockage, which could in turn activate the driver-side airbags as well as cut the cars' power steering - potentially resulting in a nasty accident. The problem lies with the air conditioning condenser unit housing - an area of the car that can get warm and is dark and damp - ideal spider habitat. Toyota explained the spider webs can cause a blockage in a drainage tube that comes from the cars' air conditioning condenser. While the result is not immediately dramatic, the blockage causes water to drip down into the airbag control module, which short circuits and can lead to a worrying warning light to display on the dashboard, or more seriously, cause the airbag to inflate suddenly. The company warned that there is even a risk of complete loss of power steering and 'loss of steering assist results in increased steering effort'. Toyota is in the process of notifying owners of the affected vehicles and said its dealers simply need to apply sealant and install a cover to the air conditioning condenser unit housing seam located above the airbag control module, to fix the problem. The problem lies with the air conditioning condenser unit housing in threes models of car - an area of the vehicles that can get warm and is dark and damp - ideal spider habitat. It is not known if a certain species of spider is to blame . One of the models which needs repair is the Camry, which is the best selling car in the United States, having already sold 318,990 cars so far this year. Of the massive number which need fixing, 847,000 are in North America with the remainder in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. According to Toyota, there have been no crashes due to the error as yet. A Toyota spokesman told CNN Money the company is aware of three cases of airbags suddenly inflating and 35 cases of warning lights showing. The company said that in the cases it has investigated, the cause has been spiderwebs, but they cannot confirm that every instance has been created by the troublesome arachnids. This is not the first time that spiders have been blamed for car recalls. Problematic: The auto manufacturer has recalled Camrys, Venzas (pictured) and Avalons, as well as their hybrid counterparts, in the U.S. that were built from 2012 onwards . In 2011, Mazda recalled 52,000 Mazda 6 sedans because spiders built webs inside a vent for the petrol tank, which could have led to vent blockages and even fires. According to Gwen Pearson's blog for Wired, the culprit in the Mazda recall was the tiny yellow sac spider, which is commonly found in gardens. The creatures spin tubular webs in which they hide during the daytime and as their silk creations are quite dense and water repellent, they can clog an opening in a vent fairly easily. Popular: The Toyota Camry, above, is America's most popular car. Almost 319,000 have been sold in the US this year but its is one of Toyota's models that have now been recalled . Toyota has already issued two major recalls in recent months, asking for the return of around around 2.2 million vehicles. In September, the company called back around 780,000 Lexus and Rav4 models. That was a second recall of the same models after an initial call back in 2012 did not fix problems with the cars suspension systems. Last month, it also recalled 615,000 Sienna minivans in the US after a problem with the gear box was discovered. Analysts said the recalls could have an impact on its reputation with the customers. A statement on the car maker's American site, said: 'Owners of the involved vehicles will be notified by first class mail to return their vehicles to a Toyota dealer for the repair.'","Toyota has recalled 885,000 Camrys, Venzas and Avalons in the U.S. that were built from 2012 onwards .

The association has already started the training process and is bringing together 500 vendors from across the city on October 21 for an elaborate workshop. The eight zones - Nizammuddin, Chandni Chowk, Sarojini Nagar, Karol Bagh, Paharganj, New Delhi Railway Station, Tilak Nagar and Krishna Nagar Jheel - have been taken up in the pilot project because of their popularity and high footfall. In consultation with the government and food safety experts, NASVI has prepared elaborate guidelines to be followed by every vendor, which cover things as basic as not touching any part of the body while cooking and serving food, or specific techniques for food storage and handling. ""Vendors in these zones have been put together in groups for better cooperation and monitoring. We have appointed peer leaders for every area who would make sure that vendors follow the set standards. Their role will be crucial for the creation of such zones,"" said Arbind Singh, founder and coordinator, NASVI. Travellers are locals alike are attracted to Delhi street food as it looks good and is inexpensive . The registration of street food vendors by the Delhi Government under the Food Safety and Standards Act is yet to be completed, as the food safety department did not have enough staff to carry out the process. NASVI plans to professionalise the whole industry by bringing all stakeholders on board with its plans. ""The zones were identified in June this year and the training of street vendors has already begun. A few such vendors had also gone to Singapore for the World Streetfood Congress in May-June this year and learnt about the best practices. They will share them with other vendors at the training sessions,"" said Ranjit Abhigyan, programme coordinator, NASVI. NASVI has already sent a detailed project report to FSSAI following a survey of the vendors. The association met 139 food sellers in the eight zones to discuss the issues they had and also their level of awareness. The survey found that 127 admitted to scratching their body parts while cooking, all but one failed to wear aprons, and none of them used gloves while on the job. Most were unaware of the storage techniques for raw, cooked and leftover food.","Vendors surveyed admitted to scratching body parts while preparing food .

A graphic was displayed on the screen with Mr Cameron’s comments, and Mr Myrie appeared to stumble over his words before performing the hand gesture when the programme cut back to him. The gaffe - which happened at 9.45pm - was picked up on by viewers on Twitter, with Joshua Goucher saying: 'Clive Myrie taking the beheading news story very seriously. #CaughtYaClive.’ The University of Sussex law graduate has previously worked for the BBC in Paris, Washington, Tokyo and Los Angeles, but his first job for the corporation was as a reporter for BBC Radio Bristol. He has worked on various major stories during his career, including the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, the Mozambique floods, the war in Kosovo and the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan.

Mr Myrie was referring to Mr Cameron’s comments after the Prime Minister accused Facebook of irresponsibility yesterday for lifting a ban on users posting horrific videos of beheadings. Mr Cameron demanded the social networking site explain its decision to parents, and child internet protection campaigners accused the US firm of ‘taking leave of its senses’. Facebook said that while the shocking images must not be posted for ‘sadistic pleasure’ they should be available for those who wish to condemn them. However, last night it was revealed Facebook had removed a video of a woman being beheaded and said it would use a broader set of criteria to determine when gory videos are permitted on the site.","Clive Myrie was presenting segment for BBC News Channel last night .

A notorious gang ‘general’ who poses a ‘serious threat to the public’ could be back on Britain’s streets within months because ministers have failed to have him deported. Joland Giwa, whose street name is Dexter, led a campaign of terror on the streets of Croydon, South London, and is ready ‘at any time to use knives and weapons’, police say. He was thought to be from Nigeria or Sierra Leone, but both countries refuse to accept he is one of theirs and linguists have now said he has a strong London accent, despite finding that he used English spoken in Nigeria. In a gangster-style YouTube video, he is seen boasting about having stabbed a man ‘in the f****** head’ and threatening to attack other gangs who intrude on  his territory. He has been held since 2009 when he finished a jail sentence, but immigration officials have failed to secure him a passport because of the two African countries' refusal . Yesterday a judge ruled that immigration officials had three months to get him travel documents and if they failed Giwa should be released. In court papers seen by the Daily Telegraph, it was found that he had 'complicated' speech patterns and 'south London English'. Critics said the ‘ridiculous’ case demonstrated Britain’s powerlessness to remove foreign criminals living here illegally. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said: ‘A thug on the streets of south London who is terrorising innocent Londoners and who is not even in the country legally should be removed.’ Giwa, 24, is the self-proclaimed ‘general’ in charge of the Don’t Say Nothing gang – known as DSN –  with a string of convictions for theft and robbery. In 2007, the DSN gang was behind a surge in violence on the streets of Croydon which saw stabbings, shootings and murder, police say. Officers linked Giwa to at least 99 incidents of criminal or anti-social behaviour. One former officer told Giwa’s immigration hearing he has a ‘clear propensity for violence’ and poses a ‘serious threat to the public’. Darin Birmingham, a former police . sergeant, said Giwa had no fear of ‘confrontation and violence’ and was . ready at any time to use knives and other weapons. Held: In March 2011 Giwa was transferred to high security Belmarsh prison, pictured, after intelligence suggested he was involved in smuggling drugs into a detention centre . But he would also maintain a façade of respectfulness towards police officers. In a clip uploaded to YouTube, he is seen . shouting a string of obscenities and threats at the camera, stating: ‘I . am the f****** general.’ In an expletive-filled rant posted on YouTube, Giwa boasts of ‘shanking’ (stabbing) his rivals. He says:‘I am DSN rep in Croydon. Croydon is our town so no more catch you in Croydon.  Ask about DSN, who started it. I am the f****** general, say no more G. ‘I am a bad boy. I have shanked a man in the f****** head. I have shanked a man in the neck G. I saw him no. I was like Boom [inaudible]. Remember you caught me and you tried to stab me in my head G. Me and Moodz [the claimant’s brother] started chasing him. My brother Moodz yeah. Big old Moodz yeah. So we caught him in the f****** grass. We caught him in the park. And I bottled his head. Shank, shank, shank him in the f****** head. ‘Man, you can try. All you can do is try. But me, I don’t try, I get you. Get me. I’ll get you …  I’ll get you physically. DSN hold the evidence. He adds: ‘I have shanked [stabbed] a man in the f****** head.’ The video prompted a spate of gang violence against rival groups Terror Zone from Mitcham and a Thornton Heath gang called Shine My Nine. Giwa landed at Heathrow aged 10 on a flight from Nigeria with his twin brother but no parent or guardian, in 1999. He had no identity documents and claimed asylum on the spot, telling officials he was from Sierra Leone and his parents were killed in the civil war in that country. He claimed a stranger had rescued him and his brother and put them on a plane. His asylum claim was refused but he was given permission to stay for four years, before permanent leave was granted in 2005. By then he already had a conviction for handling stolen goods, and over the next four years he committed a string of robberies and thefts which resulted in a 27-month jail term in February 2009. Time served meant he was due for release later that year. At the time, he posted a picture on Facebook of himself in his cell, taken on a smuggled mobile phone. An internet post said he would be ‘touching road real soon’. But instead he was held in an immigration centre as officials tried to kick him out of the UK. In March 2011 he was transferred to high security Belmarsh prison after intelligence suggested he was involved in smuggling drugs into the detention centre. His brother Make was jailed for trying to smuggle heroin and sim cards in to Belmarsh last year. Meanwhile, both Nigeria and Sierra Leone have refused to recognise him as a national of their country or to give him a passport. After interviewing him in 2010 the Sierra . Leone High Commission said the ‘tribe he mentioned is not a Sierra . Leone tribe’ – and claimed he was Nigerian. But the Nigerian High . Commission says he isn’t Nigerian. In July this year a fresh approach . was made to Sierra Leone to get him a passport. A meeting with an . immigration official from the country is due to take place this week. Hearing: At the High Court, at the Royal Courts of Justice pictured, Giwa's lawyer said his detention was no longer reasonable, but the Home Office insisted there was a 'realistic prospect of removal' At the High Court, Giwa’s lawyer said his detention was no longer reasonable, but the Home Office insisted there was still a ‘realistic prospect  of removal’ to Sierra Leone. Judge John Keyser QC, said the Home Office was ‘entirely justified in coming to the view that the claimant presents a very significant risk both of absconding and re-offending’ and that he presents a ‘serious risk of violence’. But he said the length of his detention – 53 months – had been ‘pushed to the limit of what is capable of being considered reasonable’, and set a deadline of three months before Giwa should be let out. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘We are pleased with the court’s decision to dismiss Joland Giwa’s legal challenge against his detention. ‘Giwa is a dangerous individual and he remains in immigration detention while work continues to remove him from the UK.’","Joland Giwa, aka Dexter, led campaign of terror in Croydon, South London .

A man who was so desperarate to find work he auctioned himself on eBay and wrestled in gravy has finally found a job. Dan Conway tried everything he could think of to find employment, posting his efforts on a website to grab potential employers' attention. Now, the 28-year-old from Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, has landed his dream job as a marketing executive in America. Dan Conway has finally found work after a desperate year-long hunt which was documented on his website, The Extreme Job Hunter . The father-of-two tried everything to find work including posting pictures and videos to social media sites . Mr Conway was contacted by Vitamins Direct and offered the post which involves working from home as well as travelling to the company's headquarters in Florida. He said: 'This will mean a new world for me and my family. For the last year or so, we have been scrimping and saving to make ends meet. 'Hopefully, this is going to transform our lives.' Mr Conway lost his job a week before his second child was born last year. Despite applying for hundreds of posts, the university graduate was repeatedly turned down. As a last resort the father-of-two set up The Extreme Job Hunter website in the hope of finding work. His bizarre appeals for employment included walking around Newcastle wearing a billboard, and posting himself as for sale on eBay. He even posted a pleading video from his three-year-old daughter Lucy begging: 'please get my daddy a job' on the website, but to no avail. The 28-year-old sent pizza and doughnuts to companies in the hope they would give him work in return . After graduating from university with a . degree in advertising, Mr Conway had dreams of a career in advertising . or social media, but could only find work as a part-time youth worker at . school for children with additional needs. He was made redundant last June, a 'soul destroying' blow which led him to create the website. Among . his pleas for work included a free iPad for anyone that could find him a . job as well as sending companies doughnuts and pizzas as 'bribes'. Dan Conway has been made a marketing executive for Vitamins Direct in Florida . At one point he even offered to work for free after extravagant efforts such as sending his CV in pinatas and recording a song for BBC director Tony Hall failed to find him a job. Mr Conway admits that he was ready to give up about a month ago after hundreds of unanswered pleas. His family, wife Natalie and children Lucy and Jack, was quickly running out of money and were even unable to fix their car after it broke down. 'I was having to jump on the Metro or a bus to go around finding work but I didn't have any luck', he said. Thankfully his prayers were answered when Vitamins Direct made contact with a formal job offer. 'They said they wanted me to do what I was doing but do it for them, promoting their social media and website'. 'I'm really chuffed!' Mr Conway added. The company's president, Glen Robinson, said: 'We wanted to hie the life of the party. Dan demonstrated that so the choice was very easy.'","Dan Conway tried everything to find work after being made redundant last year .

The House stenographer who had to be dragged out of the chamber last week after a religious rant at the end of the shutdown debate has been put on administrative leave. During the vote on legislation to end the debt deadlock last Wednesday, Dianne Reidy began shouting about God, Freemasons and a 'House divided'. The 48-year-old. who has worked on the House floor for eight years, had been expecting to return to work yesterday, but that has now been delayed. Outburst: Dianne Reidy is forcibly removed from the House chamber after her about God and the Freemasons . 'She's on admin leave pending further review of the incident,' an aide told the Huffington Post yesterday. Her husband later said his wife had been . awakened by the Holy Spirit and had been told to deliver a message on . the House floor. CSpan viewers caught the rant as they . watched vote tallies on TV last week. As security officers escorted Mrs . Reidy to the hallway her shouts could still be heard. Messenger: Dianne Reidy said she was prompted to speak by the Holy Spirit . Because of decorum rules, the outburst has cast doubt on Mrs Reidy's future in the House, where she earns $126,050 a year. A spokesman for the House Clerk's Office refused to comment, telling the Huffington Post she was not authorized to discuss personnel matters. In a written statement after the outburst, Mrs Reidy said: 'For the past 2 and 1/2 weeks, the Holy Spirit has been waking me up in the middle of the night and preparing me (through my reluctance and doubt) to deliver a message in the House Chamber. That is what I did last night.' Her husband, Dan, said he was proud of his wife, who he called 'a sweet, level-headed wonderful woman of God'. Mrs Reidy was interviewed by Capitol police before being taken to hospital for evaluation after she took control of the microphone. 'He will not be mocked. He will not be mocked- don't touch me- He will not be mocked,' she had called out. 'The greatest deception here is this is not one nation under God. It never was. Had it been it would not have been. It would not have been. 'The Constitution would not have been written by Freemasons. They go against God. You cannot serve two masters. You cannot serve two masters. Praise be to God. Lord Jesus Christ. Praise be to Jesus.' Scroll down for video . Proud: Dan Reidy, pictured with is wife Dianne, and daughters, blamed the long working hours on the outburst . On her Facebook page, Mrs Reidy is a fan of several Christian-oriented groups, including the evangelical In Touch Ministries, led by TV preacher Charles Stanley. She does not drink, do drugs or have any medication issues, and was released from the hospital. 'I’m glad that I fulfilled God’s mission for me, absolutely. It lifted a tremendous burden. It was a very hard burden to carry as you can imagine,' she said in an interview with The New York Post. Her husband spoke for the majority of the interview, saying that the late nights that she worked during the shutdown drove her to the brink. 'God was preparing her for this vote . last night, because this was kind of the culmination of everything,' Mr Reidy told The Post. 'This . was the big one. Everybody’s there. And Dianne didn’t know what she was . sharing, she didn’t know when — but she just sensed in her spirit.' Mrs Reidy has worked as a stenographer for two decades and the past eight of those years were for the House Clerk- a job she reportedly enjoys because she appreciates the archaic parliamentary order to the ways that laws are passed and debates are organized. Mr Reidy told The Daily Beast that his wife took her job so seriously that she refused to call in sick even when she was suffering from morning sickness while pregnant with the couple's twin daughters. 'This whole mess has just kind of sickened her to the whole process,' he said of her disgust with what had been going on during the federal shutdown. 'The alliances between people who aren’t really allies. The finger-pointing on the dais, [then] the arms around each other… Where are the people being served in this whole deal? 'She was just like, ""Gosh, this is not what it’s about.""' Attention: Those in earshot of Mrs Reidy could be seen looking at her during the outburst . The couple are open about their devout . religious beliefs. 'Reading a Bible is not foreign to us, but getting . up in the middle of the night definitely is. It’s just not a part of our . life,' Mr Reidy told the Daily Beast. 'What . she was finding out was that God was impressing on her heart that He . had a message He wanted her to share with the House of Representatives.' CSPAN was recording the scene and had . the screen blocked with the breakdown of the vote that had just happened . to approve the debt ceiling increase and temporary budget agreement. Though it was not a clear shot, it was possible to see Mrs Reidy approach the microphone and begin gesticulating. A GOP aide told CNN: 'She’s a well-known person, she’s a perfectly nice person, a good colleague, somebody who’s respectable and dependable, and this is very surprising to everybody who works with her. I don't know, she just snapped.'","Dianne Reidy started yelling about God's message and the Constitution shortly after the debt ceiling vote in the House of Representatives .

'Tip of the tongue' lapses are more common in older people, but are not linked to dementia, a new study has revealed (library image) If those ‘tip of the tongue’ moments are becoming more frequent, fear not. They may be frustrating, but they do not indicate an increased risk of dementia, research has found. Anecdotal evidence has long suggested that this type of memory lapse happens more often as we age – but its relationship to cognitive decline such as Alzheimer’s had never been established. So American researchers asked more than 700 participants, aged 18 to 99, to give the names of famous places, common nouns or famous people, based on brief descriptions or pictures. The volunteers indicated which answers they knew, which they did not and which gave them a tip-of-the-tongue experience. Several descriptions were particularly likely to induce such a moment . like 'what is the name of the building where one can view images of . celestial bodies on the inner surface of a dome?' and 'what is the name . of the large waterfall in Zambia that is one of the Seven Wonders of the . World?' Of the pictures of the politicians and celebrities, Joe . Lieberman and Ben Stiller were most likely to induce a tip of the tongue . moment. Overall, older participants experienced more of these frustrating moments. But there was no association between the frequency of tip of the tongue occurrences and their performance on the types of memory tests often used in the detection of dementia. Actor Ben Stiller, left, and former senator Joe Lieberman, right, were most likely to induce a 'tip of the tongue' moment, researchers at the University of Virginia found . Psychologist Dr Timothy Salthouse, of the University of Virginia, said: 'We wondered whether these self reports . are valid and, if they are, do they truly indicate age related failures . of the type of memory used in the diagnosis of dementia' ‘Even though increased age is associated with lower levels of episodic memory and with more frequent tip of the tongue experiences, the two phenomena seem to be largely independent of one another.’","Anecdotal evidence has long suggested that 'tip of the tongue' lapses occur more frequently with age .

Lisa Martin was made redundant after exposing neglect at the Orchid View care home, which was shut down in 2011 . A whistleblower who exposed a care home where five residents died says she could lose her house because no one will employ her. Lisa Martin lifted the lid on Orchid View, which an inquest found was riddled with ‘institutional abuse’. The 46-year-old, who worked for the Southern Cross care home chain as business administration manager, called police after witnessing a catalogue of errors being covered up or ignored by senior staff. Her actions led to the £3,000-a-month home being shut down in 2011. As a consequence Miss Martin was made redundant from her £36,000-a-year job. And the mother of two says her decision to go to the authorities has left her feeling ‘victimised’. She said: ‘I have applied for well over 100 jobs in the last two years, mainly in care, and I’m still out of work. People just don’t want to know. ‘I feel like I’ve just been branded as a troublemaker and no one is willing to hire me, even though I have done nothing wrong. All I have done is told the truth.’ An inquest heard how residents at Orchid View, in Copthorne, West Sussex, were routinely given overdoses and were left soiled and in pain during two years of mismanagement and staff shortages. The coroner ruled that abuse and neglect contributed to the deaths of Jean Halfpenny, 77, Wilfred Gardner, 85, Margaret Tucker, 77, Enid Trodden, 86, and John Holmes, 85. Another 14 residents died of natural causes after suffering ‘sub-optimal’ care. Mrs Halfpenny died after being given three times the correct dose of the blood-thinning drug warfarin. Miss Martin, from Horley, Surrey, says she was asked to shred Mrs Halfpenny’s medical records and new ones were falsified. Lisa Martin gave evidence at the inquest but was made redundant as a consequence . She said: ‘I wasn’t completely sure what . it was I was shredding and with no medical training I felt I wasn’t in a . position to question my manager but alarm bells were starting to ring.’ Miss Martin said she became increasingly concerned about the welfare of residents after finding one elderly patient on a mattress eating his breakfast ‘out of a bowl like a dog’. She said: ‘There were things that were worrying me, bell cords were tied up and out of reach and residents were not being fed properly. ‘I felt a sense of responsibility and I didn’t know what to do or who to tell.’ Miss Martin said the stress caused her to lose three stone in weight. She also separated from her partner of 15 years. Orchid View, in Copthorne, West Sussex was shut down after an inquest found it was 'riddled with institutional abuse' A coroner ruled neglect and abuse contributed to the deaths of Wilfred Gardner and Enid Trodden among others . She now relies on her children – Luke 21, a golfer, and Lauren, 26, a chartered accountant – to help her pay the bills while her father, a retired businessman, pays the mortgage on her semi-detached home. She said: ‘It has been a nightmare and I can see why people are reluctant to whistleblow, but I’m glad I made that call. ‘If I had left it any longer we could be looking at another 19 deaths and no one wants that. ‘I’m proud that I was able to find the courage to speak out.

An Ohio man convicted in the killing of a woman, who was set on fire and left to die on the road, has escaped the death penalty after a jury recommended life in prison without parole. The same jury that found LaFonse Dixon Jr. guilty in the August 2012 death of Celeste Fronsman on Tuesday recommended life in prison for him instead of execution. In trying to spare the life of the 34-year-old Dixon, his attorneys told jurors of his troubled upbringing. He'll be sentenced Nov. 4. LaFonse Dixon Jr. stands between his attorneys, Larry Thomas and Isabella Dixon, Oct. 16, 2013, in Zanesville, Ohio, during his trial . Horrific end: Celeste Fronsman, pictured after two separate arrests, was found by an unnamed truck driver naked and covered in burns . Monica Jean Washington, 24, and Katrina Marie Culberson, 20, pleaded guilty in the case to avoid the death penalty. They testified that the trio took 29-year-old Fronsman to rural Muskingum County, where she was set on fire and abandoned. Dixon's attorneys argued the Canton, Ohio, man wasn't involved. LaFonse . D. Dixon Jr. pleaded not guilty to aggravated murder, kidnapping, . aggravated arson and conspiracy charges in September in Muskingum County . court. On Aug. 26, a . driver found Celeste Fronsman laying by a road near Zanesville in . eastern Ohio appearing so badly burned the motorist didn't even know if . she was human. Fronsman had been raped and burned over 80 per cent of her body while found wearing a strap around her neck. She died two days later at a Columbus hospital having suffered second, third and fourth degree burns. Dixon's attorney said her client said he didn't do it and wasn't there. Two women, Monica Jean Washington, 24, and Katrina Marie Culberson, 20, also have pleaded not guilty to aggravated murder, kidnapping and aggravated arson charges. Katrina Marie Culberson, 20, and Monica Jean Washington, 24, were eligible for the death penalty if convicted.

Appearance: Culberson is seen in court during her plea hearing wiping her eyes while potentially facing the death penalty . Police have yet to explain why they believe these three people were involved or what, if any, relation they have to the victim. 'It's just too sensitive a case right now to divulge any information,' Muskingum County Sheriff Matt Lutz told The Columbus Dispatch. The only facts known about the three suspects is that they- as well as the victim- have a long list of prior offenses. Culberson, . who was the first to be arrested, has at least six prior charges to her . name in the last two years. Those charges include soliciting for . prostitution, theft and burglary. In the prostitution case, Culberson pleaded no contest and was sentenced to two months in jail. As for the newly-arrested suspects, Washington was arrested twice for disorderly conduct, and Dixon has drug possession, felony endangerment of children. Police records received by MailOnline show that Ms Fronsman had an extensive criminal history, including a rap sheet with 25 arrests over the past nine years. Since 2003, she was arrested for a plethora of crimes including prostitution, drug possession and five counts of domestic violence. Her most recent arrest occurred on May 28 for having drug paraphernalia.

Her sister, Sarah Gulosh, told the Zanesville Times Recorder that despite her trouble with the law, Fronsman was a loving mother and a good sister and never failed to tell her grandparents how much she loved them. 'She was a good person,' she said, adding that Fronsman had a heart of gold. Gulosh said her sister was left tortured by the death of her Two-year-old daughter, Jordyn, in 2005, and the death of her mother in 2009. 'We always told her she needed to stop what she was doing and ask God for forgiveness,' Gulosh said. 'But she loved God, and she told us she had asked him for forgiveness.' Evidence: Empty gasoline containers were removed from the scene by investigators . Her father told the Columbus Dispatch that he last saw his daughter when she and a friend borrowed his truck, promising to return shortly. The father, whose name has not been released, said that he contacted authorities that morning. 'This is a vicious animal. They ought to be taken off the street and put away,' he said. The sheriff agreed, and the investigation continues as crime scene examiners were seen removing empty gas containers from the dumpsite. 'This is one of the most gruesome things I have ever seen in 23 and a half years in law enforcement,' Mr Lutz said.

Thirty per cent of youngsters are overweight or obese, putting them at risk of serious conditions in adulthood such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence claimed parents may undermine efforts to get fat children and teenagers to face up to the problem. ‘Efforts to manage a child or young person’s weight are not always supported, and are sometimes undermined, by members of the wider family,’ it said. ‘This is possibly because of a lack of understanding of the aims of lifestyle weight management programmes and the importance of managing the weight of obese or overweight children and young people.’ New guidance from Nice says families must be encouraged to recognise the problem – particularly as children with at least one obese parent are more likely to become obese themselves. The watchdog said it is ‘important to ensure the family and the youngster recognise and accept that they are overweight or obese’. It added that a ‘lack of recognition, or denial’ can prevent them from joining, and adhering to, a weight management course. These programmes can include Weight Watchers, which runs schemes of the type recommended by Nice. Figures released earlier this year showed . the NHS has spent £4 million on Weight Watchers courses for fat people . since 2007, with two-thirds of local health authorities offering them. Many overweight and obese children and young people may have, or come . from a family with, a ‘history of failed attempts to manage their . weight’ says the guidance. A family’s attitudes towards diet, exercise and the amount of time spent being sedentary should all be explored, it added. In 2011 in England, around 30 per cent of boys and girls aged two to 15 were either overweight or obese. In the 2011/2012 school year, around 23 per cent of children in . reception and 34 per cent in year 6 were either overweight or obese. Children and teens are being encouraged to follow weight management programmes such as Weight Watchers . The guidance calls for information to help families ‘master skills’ in reading food labels, ways to build activity into daily life and for providers to offer activities such as games, dancing and aerobics. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said Nice was ‘spot on’ with what needs to be done but added councils needed cash to carry out the job. Professor Mike Kelly, director of the Centre for Public Health at Nice, said ‘Parents should not have to face the challenge of obesity on their own. ‘Obesity in children and young people is a serious and growing concern. ‘We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. ‘These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long-term. Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games. ‘Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child’s quality of life. ‘It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised. Local commissioners - including local authorities - need to make sure that the right services are available when families need them. ‘They also need to be convenient and easy to access - so parents and their children can stick with them.’","National Institute for Clinical Excellence said parents may 'undermine' efforts to get obese children to face up to the problem .

A Norwegian comedy duo's surreal pop single and bizarre music video they hoped would be a flop has beaten all the odds and become a viral sensation. The Fox (What Does the Fox Say?), a spoof pop song created by brothers Vegard and Bard Ylvisaker, has received over 141million hits on YouTube and become the fastest viewed song since Psy's Gangnam Style. Like Gangnam Style the video features strange costumes, memorable dance moves and nonsensical lyrics which have helped it to become a top 100 hit in 18 countries. Scroll down for videos . Acquired taste: Brothers Vegard and Bard Ylvisaker have become an internet sensation following the release of their spoof pop song The Fox (What Does the Fox Say? Unusual: The video, a scene from which pictured above, sees dancers dressed in animal costumes prance around in a misty woodland, lit with neon lights . Spoof: As well as some crazy dance moves, the song features various nonsensical lyrics and an repeated refrain of 'What does the fox say?', pictured . It debuted in the US at number 29, and reached number one in Norway, number six in Finland, and nine in Estonia. The pair have also appeared on the Jimmy Fallon show, and as a special guest at the iHeartRadio festival in Las Vegas. The video was created as a favour by Stargate, the company which made Rihanna's Diamonds video, and was supposed to be a stunt for the brother's show I Kveld Med Ylvis (Tonight with Ylvis). The idea was to deliberately 'abuse' the company's talent by announcing their intention to make a fantastic video, only to return with the foxes song which they thought it would be impossible for anyone to like. However the show had to be completely re-scripted after the track became an accidental overnight hit. Last Halloween the success of Gangnam Stlye saw millions of Americans dress up as South Korean singer Psy, and this year it looks as if foxes will be the latest craze. After the song went viral Amazon, Spirit Halloween and Buycostumes - three of the biggest costume stores in the US - reported a huge surge in sales of fox costumes. The companies say they are struggling to keep up with a 40 per cent rise in demand and have been forced to order more stock, despite Halloween being over a week away. Huge hit: South Korean musician Psy has the most viewed video on YouTube ever with 1.8billion hits, though The Fox reached 100million views faster and could set a new record . The humorous pair have not revealed how much they have made from the single, though Psy's video, which was  viewed 1.8billion times, reportedly earned him £3.6million from YouTube clicks alone. The brothers have said that the original idea was to make a song about the problem of dancing in clubs and how there is no standard dance anymore - like the foxtrot or waltz - so three billion men head out every weekend without knowing what to do when they get into a club. However the plan was changed at the last minute to feature some sort of animal sound, and while lots of different creatures were considered, the fox eventually won out. Warner Music have now signed the brothers and are helping to promote the single, though they insist their first love will remain comedy and they have no desire to become pop stars. Bard told THR: 'We’re comedians.And we like to sing.' 'We'll never pursue pure music as a career,' added Vegard. 'This is very new for us and everyone is asking, ""What are you going to do now?"" We don’t know. We’re busy trying to figure out what to do the next day.' The comedians have produced music videos for their show before, but nothing has had quite the impact of their latest venture.

Poor standards: A study has found that English school leavers had poorer literacy, numeracy and problem-solving skills than their grandparents (library image) The collapse in educational standards was caused by the end of the British grammar school system, experts said last night. A report this month found that English school leavers had poorer literacy, numeracy and problem-solving skills than their grandparents –  the only place among 24 wealthy nations where this was the case. But a new analysis of the data has found that Britain’s over-55s actually outperform their peers in other countries. Researcher Dr Gijsbert Stoet said this was down to the quality of British schools in the Sixties and early Seventies. He added: ‘The general decline in performance is due to the ageing process. The UK was the only country where there was a blip. ‘It would seem that primary and secondary education was so good that it still has an effect today.’ Many grammars were replaced with comprehensives in the Seventies. Today, there are just 164 left. This decline in selective education corresponds with the last  significant intake of grammar pupils whose scores today as over-55s are so high. Those who  left secondary school in 1975 would be 56. Dr Stoet, a reader in psychology at Glasgow University’s School  of Education, said that in almost every nation studied, individuals showed a general improvement in the three areas until they reached their mid to late-20s. This was  followed by a sustained fall until retirement, which was put down to ‘general cognitive decline due to ageing’. But the only exception was the UK, where the older generation significantly outperformed contemporaries in other nations. Education: Britain's over-55s outperform their peers in other countries - a fact that researcher say is down to the quality of schooling in the 60s and 70s (library image) He said: ‘The school system changed . from one where children went to a secondary school based on ability, to . one where they went to any school, irrespective of ability. ‘It . is most likely many factors played a role in our findings but England . and Northern Ireland did so unusually well [in the 55-plus age group] . compared to other countries that it makes sense grammar schools were a . major factor.’ The first . comprehensives were set up in 1946, and huge expansion began in 1965 . under Harold Wilson’s Labour government. When the Tories took power in . 1970 it was too late to reverse the decline in grammar schools. By 1975, most local authorities had abandoned the 11-plus exam and adopted the comprehensive system. There was also a trend away from ‘streaming’ or ‘setting’ pupils according to ability within state schools under Labour after 1997. Mixed: 16 to 24 year olds in England and Northern Ireland came 22nd in literacy and 21st in numeracy tests . Streaming puts some pupils in the top classes for all subjects, and setting places them in classes in each subject according to ability. By 2007, the proportion of lessons taught according to ability stood at just 40 per cent, while in some subjects, such as history and geography, nearly three-quarters of lessons took place in mixed-ability classes. The original report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development looked at core skills among 16 to 65-year-olds. Those aged 16 to 24 in England and Northern Ireland came 22nd in literacy and 21st in numeracy. But 55 to 65-year-olds were among the best educated in the developed world. The Tories said the findings showed the last Labour government let academic performance slide, even as marks went up. Dr Stoet suggested exam marks had . become ‘more realistic’ since Education Secretary Michael Gove demanded . an end to grade inflation. He said underperformance among 16 to 55-year-olds compared to other countries could be explained by the comprehensive system. Experts have criticised the dumbing down of syllabuses, particularly since the Seventies, and the introduction of trendy teaching methods. Mr Gove is introducing a curriculum that involves more learning by rote and in-depth study. Education expert Professor Alan Smithers, of the University of Buckingham, said: ‘Grammar schools picked out highly able children  and brought them together with very good teachers and helped them develop. ‘In English there was an emphasis on grammar and being accurate and maths required the ability to carry out basic calculations. Now there is a more cavalier attitude.’ Robert McCartney, of the National Grammar School Association, added: ‘There is no doubt that the advent of the comprehensive was the beginning of a downward trend in literacy, numeracy and problem solving.’","School leavers had poorer literacy, numeracy and problem-solving skills than their grandparents, a report by Glasgow University has found .

A mother who was preparing dinner for her children was horrified after finding hundreds of black bugs crawling inside a packet of pasta she had just bought. Hayley O’Shea, 39, began pouring out fusilli from Tesco to make a tuna pasta bake for her daughters Maisie, seven and Amelia, five, when she saw the infestation of weevils. The mother-of-two quickly threw the Cook Italian brand pasta and the bugs in the bin and sealed up the bag that had not been opened before. Upset: Maisie O'Shea, seven, and her sister Amelia, five, at their home in Bournemouth, Dorset holding the pasta which contained weevil bugs . She has no idea how the swarm of the beetle-type bug got into the 500g bag. Mrs O’Shea called Tesco to complain and was at first told someone would come and collect the packet from her home in Bournemouth, Dorset, so they could investigate. When nobody arrived she emailed the supermarket giant again but was then told she would have to return it to a store. Mrs O’Shea, an account manager at a marketing company, said she is concerned that other bags of pasta could contain the bugs.

A weevil is a type of beetle which is usually less than six millimetres (0.24 in) long. There are more than 60,000 species in several families and can often be found  in dry foods including nuts and seeds, cereal and grain products, such as pancake mix. In the domestic setting, they are most likely to be found when a bag of flour is opened. Their presence is often indicated by the granules of the infested item sticking together in strings, as if caught in a cobweb. 'I opened it and tipped some into a pan for my children’s dinner and noticed lots of little black things. 'Initially I thought it might have been something burnt on the bottom of the pan so I drained the pasta under the tap, then I looked closer and saw they were insects. 'I looked at the rest of the packet and it was absolutely crawling with them. There must have been hundreds of the things. 'My two children were horrified and now won’t eat pasta again. 'I had no idea what they were so I looked it up on the internet and realised they were weevil bugs. 'I contacted Tesco and they said . someone would come and collect the pasta but they didn’t turn up, so I . emailed them and they told me that it wasn’t their policy to do so.

"By . Chris Pleasance . PUBLISHED: . 11:09 EST, 18 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:16 EST, 18 October 2013 . An Arkansas teacher has been fired from a Catholic school because she married her lesbian lover. The principal of Mount St Mary school, in Little Rock, is alleged to have phoned Tippi McCullough on her wedding day in order to fire her. Diane Wolfe claimed she had found out about the union 'through the diocese' and, according to Mrs McCullough, told her: 'I never thought this day would come, but I have to terminate you.' Mount St Mary Catholic girls school in Little Rock, Arkansas, called one of its teachers on her wedding day to tell her she was being fired after finding out her bride was a lesbian . It has been reported that the English teacher, who had been at the school for 15 years, was offered a 'glowing recommendation' letter and told she could voluntarily resign. Mrs McCullough wed Barb Mariani in Alberquerque on Wednesday, as the state has previously legalised gay marriage. But 45 minutes after the ceremony Mrs McCullough was called by a school secretary and warned not to go through with the engagement which they had apparently learned about 'through the diocese'. Later Ms Wolfe called back and, after confirming the wedding had taken place, fired Mrs McCullough. Mrs McCullough claims that the school knew that she was a lesbian and was aware of her relationship, which started just a year after she joined. Mrs McCullough has since said she will not be returning to the school and is not listed as a staff member on their website. The former Miss Mariani said: 'It is impossible to believe that the first call we received after the . most joyous occasion of our lives was a vocal pink slip. 'Tippi has been a beloved teacher . at Mount St. Mary’s for 15 years and it’s a sad day when she is fired . for doing nothing more than committing to the person she loves – me.' The school were not told about the ceremony and say they found out 'through the diocese' The school is replying on a clause in its contract which states that staff can be dismissed for leading a lifestyle contrary to church teachings. When Mrs McCullough asked how her marriage had violated the clause, Wolfe responded by saying she wasn't going to have a theological debate and that there was nothing else she could do. Mariani added: 'They hire people who aren't Catholic, with a lot of different belief systems. What's upsetting to me is that the morality clause covers birth control, premarital sex and they are certainly not pro-choice. 'It's disturbing to me that no straight teacher is called in and asked if she's using birth control or unmarried and having premarital sex with a boyfriend.' No law protects McCullough from being fired as a religious institution citing church teaching would be exempt from discrimination laws. Human Rights Campaign president Chad Griffin said: 'To fire a beloved teacher simply because she is gay is morally reprehensible. 'At a moment when Pope Francis is urging the Catholic hierarchy to put aside judgment and a decades-long campaign targeting devoted LGBT Catholics, it’s shameful that this school is ignoring that hopeful message in favor of explicit and baseless discrimination.' Diane Wolfe and school president Karen Flake have previously been unavailable for comment. Mount St Mary was founded in 1851 and is an all-girls Roman Catholic School, is sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy, and says it focuses teaching on their three tenets of compassion, mercy, and justice. Mount St. Mary has been in the news recently because of a criminal case in which a former teacher, Kelly O'Rourke, pleaded guilty to a sexual affair with a student and another teacher, Kathy Griffin, was convicted for failing to report the abuse.","Tippi McCullough has left Catholic Mount St Mary school, Little Rock .

This is the female New England Patriots fan who was punched in the face by a New York Jets supporter at a football game. Jaclyn Nugent was struck by convicted killer Kurt Pashcke in a brutal attack following his team's last-minute win on Sunday night. Pashcke has been become a national hate figure after video of the attack appeared on the internet. New Jersey State Police charged four people on Tuesday - including Nugent. Her fellow Patriots fans Amanda MacDowell and David James Sacco also face charges along with Paschke. Victim: Jacklyn Nugent, 26, was the New England Patriots fan who was punched twice in the face by a Jet's fan after Sunday's game . Police have reviewed the fight and found that both MacDowell and Nugent were first observed kicking and punching Paschke. Soon afterwards, Paschke punches Nugent in the face. Sacco then struck Paschke in the face. The four fans have been charged with simple assault and disorderly conduct. They are scheduled to appear at East Rutherford Municipal Court. MailOnline can now reveal Nugent is a 26-year-old graduate from the University of Massachusetts, with a bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice and Corrections. She has worked at a health care technology company Meditech as an Application Specialist for three years and three months. Yesterday she spoke out for the first time, talking to MailOnline from her office in Norwood, Massachusetts. Dragged away: The man in the number 80 green jersey is already being removed from the brawl by another man . Angry: This blonde woman seen in the red and white jersey advances towards the Jets fan . Hit: The blonde woman reels back as she is punched in the face by the large man . She confirmed that police had been in . touch with her since the assault and when asked whether Pashcke was . going to be charged, she replied: 'I really don't know as this stage.' Before her time at Meditech she spent seven months working in IT for Granite Telecomunications. Her .

'Build and maintain positive working relationships with both customers and associates. 'Lead radiology and departmental software seminars for customers to convey processes and capabilities. 'Provide exceptional levels of detail in documentation. 'Possess strong organizational skills crucial for time management and prioritizing tasks.' She lives an apartment based in converted townhouse In the Charlestown area of Boston. It is believed her mother, father and two younger brothers live in Marlborough, a small town around 40 miles west of Boston. Jaclyn has a clean record with no criminal convictions. The incident was caught on video showing a large man wearing camouflage shorts and a Wayne Chrebet jersey being hauled away from the crowd by another man. Violent past: Paschke (right) seems to have channeled his energies into a love of all things New York Jets, but his passions overwhelmed him Sunday when he was involved in a brawl . It's unclear what started the brawl, but a new rule that helped the Jets clinch the victory may have had something to do with it. According to Newsday, the new rule stipulates that a player may not push a teammate into the opponent's formation. The rule was brought to bear when Patriot Chris Jones pushed his teammate Will Svitek forward in an attempt to block the kick. After Jones was penalized, the Jets got 15 yards closer and Nick Folk made a 42-yeard game-winning kick . A Jets team spokesperson released a statement saying, 'We are aware of the situation, and we do not tolerate that behavior. Parties involved were detained, and this matter is now in the hands of the New Jersey State Police.' The New York Daily News spoke to Paschke's mother, who says her son punched Nugent to protect her. Colleen Paschke was at the game with her son and daughter on Sunday, in which the Jets bested the Patriots 30-27. Jets generations: Kurt Paschke (back left) is pictured with friends and family including his mother, Colleen (front left) 'He’s the victim, really,' she told the New York Daily News from her home. 'He was just concerned for his mother and himself.' Colleen Paschke says that from the beginning of the game she and her children were heckled by a group of Patriots fans. Those same fans, of whom Nugent was one, allegedly set upon the Paschkes as they were leaving the stadium. 'He was just hitting back to defend himself,' she said. 'It wasn't done deliberately. If you see the video, they just went wild.' Colleen Paschke told the Daily News that when Nugent left, she flicked blood - blood drawn by Kurt Paschke - at her. According to the New York Post, Paschke was originally charged with murder but was convicted of the lesser crime. The Jets Mobile: Paschke (left) has a van he has decked out with Jets paraphernalia that he drives to home games . 'I am deeply sorry,' Paschke said at the time of his sentencing in 1995. 'I can honestly say I never sought the confrontation, but when it came, I did what I had to do.' The father of the deceased told the New York Post that Paschke 'got off lightly' for the stabbing of his son because Paschke's father was a Suffolk County police officer. 'I wrote the judge a letter, that this guy is going to kill again,' Robert Ferrer, 80, told the New York Post. 'He killed for no reason. He went out of his way to get a knife to stab my son.

Democratic congressional candidate Sean Eldridge has released his latest financial report showing that he put in a quarter of a million dollars in his quest to be elected to office. While Eldridge's millionaire husband Chris Hughes, who was one of Mark Zuckerberg's college roommates and an early leader at Facebook, is not listed as a donor in the latest filing, plenty of the couple's famous friends chipped in. Zuckerberg contributed the maximum amount of $2,600 in both the primary and the general election, as did his wife Priscilla Chan meaning that the Zuckerberg-Chan household contributed a total of $10,400 to the New York state campaign. Capital New York notes that Other famous donors include music producer David Geffen who contributed $2,600 and California-based talent agent Bob Gersh who gave $1,000. Heading into the campaign: Sean Eldridge (right), who is married to Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes (left), announced on Sunday night that he is running for Congress in New York's 19th District . The 27-year-old is running to represent a district in upstate New York but that does not mean that many of his big-money donors are his neighbors in the rural farming town of Shokan. Instead there are a number of donors based in Manhattan, who live near Hughes and Eldgridge in the SoHo apartment. In addition to neighbors, there are some other New York personalities who have decided to lend their name- financially, at least- to the cause including Project Runway judge Tim Gunn who gave $1,000 and Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner who donated $5,200. The biggest donor by far was Mr Eldridge himself who gave $250,000 to the campaign in the third quarter of this year. His personal payout does not come as a significant surprise to those who have been following the couple's rise to prominence as Mr Hughes is believed to have a personal net worth of around $500million. Power players: Eldridge has been making a name for himself in political circles, seen here with New Jersey Senatorial candidate Cory Booker, Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, who owns the New York Observer . Sleek: Their latest property- a $2million two-bedroom in Shokan- means that they are residents of New York's 19th District and on Sunday Eldridge announced his candidacy in the Congressional race for that area . His campaign went on to explain that the number he donated is seen as a match to the donations he has received from others. 'Unlike most campaigns, I will not accept donations from corporate PACs. Voters in NY-19 deserve an independent representative who will stand up to Big Oil and Big Banks and do what’s right for middle class families in our region,' Mr Eldridge said in a press statement when the filing was released. The two political action committees that contributed to Mr Eldridge's warchest were New York Senator Kirsten Gilibrand's and Congressman Joe Kennedy's. Mrs Gilibrand has been a friend of Eldridge's for some time and attended his wedding to Mr Hughes in July of last year.","Sean Eldridge, 27, is running for Congress in New York's 19th District .

"PUBLISHED: . 07:13 EST, 22 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:11 EST, 22 October 2013 . This chart shows how much time internet users lose carrying out different offline activities in favour of spending time online . Sites including Facebook and Twitter are a procrastinator's dream, but new research has revealed the true extent of how these sites directly affect our lives. Research conducted by the Technology Policy Institute in Washington has found that every hour spent online equates to, on average, 16 fewer minutes working. The sites also affect our sleep - we lose seven minutes sleeping for each hour online; spend 17 minutes less outside in the real world and miss out on a staggering 18 days seeing friends. For his paper, What we are not doing when we're online, economist and researcher from the institute, Scott Wallsten studied eight years of government data about Americans online from 2003 to 2011. The act of replacing real-world time with online time is referred to by Wallsten as 'crowding out.' Each minute of time spent online, according to Wallsten, directly correlates with 0.27 fewer minutes working, which over an hour equates to 16.2 minutes. Over the course of a day, this adds up to 388.8 minutes, or around six and a half hours, which over a year means employers lose around 8 days a month. Wallsten said: 'This research is a small step forward in understanding the economic effects of the Internet. 'The data clearly show that time spent and the share of the population engaged in online leisure isincreasing. 'The analyses suggest that new online activities come at least partly at the expense ofless time doing other activities.' Over the course of five years, from 2006 to 2011, the amount of time people spend socialising with friends has dropped. For every minute people spend online, research claims they lose 0.05 minutes socialising, which works out at around 18 days each year . People watch 0.28 fewer minutes . watching television, to each minute of online activity. This is 16.8 . minutes an hour, or almost 7 hours a day, on average. Surfers . spend 0.12 fewer minutes sleeping and 0.05 fewer minutes socialising . with friends. Over the course of a year, this means we lose 18 days . seeing loved ones. The trend also has an adverse affect on the eduction of young people, in particular, according to Wallsten's research. The younger an internet user, the more time they spend online compared to studying and 'education-related tasks'. People aged between 15 and 19 crowd out almost 0.3 minutes worth of studying in place of going online and using social networks. This is almost seven hours a day, on average. Wallsten concluded that the loss of real-world time could have an affect on the economy but further research needs to be done into how damaging this could be. According to research from Washington's Technology Policy Institute, browsing social networks including Facebook and Twitter is now the most common activity online, at 22.5 per cent. Online games are second. Videos and movies make up just 4.4 per cent .","For each hour spent online we spend 16 fewer minutes working .

Former District Attorney Mary Lacy said in 2008 that evidence suggests the killer was a stranger, not a family member. Records: A Colorado judge has ordered the release of grand jury documents related to the 1996 killing of JonBenet Ramsey, pictured left and right. She had won several beauty pageants before her murder . Revelations? Boulder District Attorney spokeswoman Catherine Olguin declined to say whether the documents, which have been sealed since the grand jury was dismissed in 1999, will include an indictment against parents John, right, and Patsy, left, Ramsey . A reporter for The Camera and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed a lawsuit to seek the records. The news comes just days after JonBenet's father said he didn't want secret grand jury indictments from his daughter's case released to the public. John Ramsey's attorneys sent a letter Monday to the Boulder County District Attorney saying the release of such records without releasing the entire grand jury record would only defame the former beauty queen's parents. Reports earlier this year suggested the secret indictments were of both John and Patricia Ramsey. John . Ramsey's attorneys argued Monday that to release only the indictments, . and not the entire grand jury record, would put him at a disadvantage. Help us find the killer: John Ramsey looks on during a 1997 television appearance as wife Patsy touts a reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the murderer of JonBenet . 'Public release of the allegations of an un-prosecuted indictment only serves to further defame (John Ramsey) and his late wife Patricia,' the letter said, according to the Daily Camera. 'Mr. Ramsey will have no access to whatever evidence the prosecutors presented to the grand jury and will have no ability to disprove those allegations in a court of law,' the letter continued. 'Nor will the public have any ability to evaluate the propriety of the indictment unless the entire grand jury record is unsealed and opened to public view.' The move to make the indictments public is an effort between the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press and a Boulder Daily Camera reporter. The indictments were earlier this year reported to be of child abuse leading to their daughter's death, according to the paper. A grand jury voted at the time to go forward with the charges, but the district attorney declined to proceed over fears he could not prove guilty without a reasonable doubt, according to the paper. Q&A: The Ramseys appear at the Newseum in 2000 to answer questions about their experience with the media from journalism students . Sent on John Ramsey's behalf, the letter was in response to a judge ruling last week that found releasing the indictments would not be in violation of grand jury secrecy rules, the paper said. That judge ordered the current DA to provide reason why it should be kept secret, according to the Daily Camera. He provided them to a judge on Tuesday to determine if they were suitable to be released. John Ramsey's attorneys argued against this move, saying the father was never contacted about the release of any documents from his daughter's case - adding that without releasing the entire record, the objective will not be achieved. 'The District Court found 'transparency' to be the determinative factor in its order to show cause,' he said the letter. 'Transparency can only be accomplished if the entire record is made public.' 'The court should also order release of the entire grand jury record, including all witness testimony, all exhibits, all colloquy discussions between prosecutors and the grand jury and all drafts of potential indictments presented by the prosecutors of the grand jury,' the letter continues. Officials responded to the letter by stating they only release the secret indictments in such a way that would not hinder potential future prosecution under charges where the statute of limitations has not yet expired, according to the paper. The Ramseys were exonerated in 2008 from any responsibility for the girl's death by the then-DA. The statute of limitations for the abuse charges expired in 2002.","JonBenet Ramsey, 6, was found murdered in her family's basement on Christmas Day, 1996 .

Radu Dogaru, Alexandru Bitu and Eugen Darie, told a Bucharest court today that they took the multimillion-dollar paintings from the Kunsthal Museum in October 2012. They are charged with the theft and of bringing the paintings into Romania. The works have never been found, and may have been burned. Guilty plea: Romanian suspects Eugen Darie (R) and Radu Dogaru (L) pleaded guilty today to stealing paintings worth millions of dollars from a Dutch museum in Rotterdam . Alexandru Bitu, left, and Eugen Darie, right, are both charged in connection with theft of seven paintings from a Dutch museum, including works by Matisse, Monet, Picasso and Freud . In their depositions to prosecutors, the suspects, who were arrested in January, said they brought the paintings to Romania, tried to sell them on the black market, then left them with Dogaru's mother, Olga Dogaru. Chief suspect Radu Dogaru told the court Tuesday that when he stole the paintings on the night of Oct. 15-16 he thought they were fakes.

Two friends died within half an hour of one another after taking a super-strength ecstasy drug nicknamed 'Dr Death'. Car welder Chris Goodwin, 30, said he could not see and cried 'get out of my body' before he and Emma Johnson, 21, collapsed and died following a night out in Bolton, Greater Manchester. An inquest heard the pair took up to five times the lethal dose of Para-Methoxyamphetamine (PMA) - almost certainly without realising what it was. Cocktail: An inquest heard Chris Goodwin, 30, and Emma Johnson, 21, drank heavily and took other drugs, including the former legal high mephedrone - but it was the super-strength ecstasy PMA which proved fatal . The pair had taken a crystal form of the drug PMA, nicknamed Dr Death, similar to the one pictured above. It also comes in the form of pink tablets. The drug has reportedly claimed the lives of a number of young clubbers . Pathologist Dr David Bisset said: 'I suspect people buy this drug when they are looking for something else. It can lead to high blood pressure, hallucinations, coma, seizures and there is no specific treatment. 'These things come with no quality control or testing whatsoever. One of the dangers is that it is slow in effect so people tend to think nothing much has happened so they take another.' Three of the pair's friends were also taken to hospital for side effects of a mixture of drink and drugs. The inquest heard Mr Goodwin, a car welder, and Ms Johnson, a finance worker, met friends for a night out in Bolton on April 28 this year for a friend moving to the Cypriot resort of Aya Napa . They had gone out separately but met in a club where they drank alcohol and took drugs, including mephedrone and cocaine. They then headed to a friend’s house in the early hours. The pair and another friend ran out of drugs so they went to Chris’ home, . where he said he had ‘whizz’, a term used to describe amphetamine. The drug was in fact a pale crystal-like form of PMA, which is also known to come in the form of pink tablets nicknamed 'pink ecstasy'. They also took the former legal high mephedrone, nicknamed 'bubble', which was initially blamed for the pair's death. However, the inquest ruled out mephedrone as the fatal drug. Stacey Feathers, who was on the night out, told the inquest: 'We were in . the club and Emma and her friend bought some coke and shared it in the . toilets. Dangerous: The drug has been linked to at least 10 deaths in the Manchester area, including those of Chris Goodwin, left, and Emma Johnson, right. Experts say it is often sold as ecstasy and without revellers noticing . The house in Bolton, Greater Manchester, where Goodwin and Johnson took lethal doses of the Dr Death drug. Friends said 30-year-old Goodwin complained he was hot and was cooling himself with a fan . Family photo: Emma Johnson with her mother Ann, who is pictured above right leaving the inquest at Bolton Coroner's Court. Coroner Jennifer Leeming told her: 'I can’t imagine the pain of losing a child and I am so sorry' 'We went back . to our friend’s house at about 3am where she and Emma finished off the . coke and the rest of the bubble. Chris had some too. Our friend went to . bed and the rest of us stayed until about 6am. 'We . then decided to get some more drugs. Chris said he had some whizz at . his house, so me, him, Emma and another friend went there. 'We . all took some amphetamine in a cigarette paper and swallowed it. Chris . had two to start with when everybody else had one. We all felt quite . spaced out. It didn’t feel the same as when I had taken it once before. PMA has been blamed for the deaths of more than 10 young people within a 60-mile radius of Manchester this year. It is better-known in the form of pills costing as little as £3. They are sometimes pink and shaped like Love Hearts sweets, or stamped with an 'M'. It also comes in a crystal-like form, pictured above. The drug often has the same street names as ecstasy as it has a similar effect to ecstasy's main chemical, MDMA. But the active ingredient in PMA is five times stronger and takes longer to kick in, meaning many revellers take extra pills. The youngest known victim was 16-year-old Ellie Jones, who died after suffering breathing difficulties at a friend’s house in Warrington. Nine recent deaths in the north-west have been linked to possible contaminated ecstasy. PMA has also been linked to deaths in Canada, Norway and Denmark. Gym instructor Travis Barber, from Salford, was just 19 when he suffered a violent fatal reaction to PMA. His mother, Dr Louise Barber, said after an inquest: ‘I would say [to young people] just don’t do it and please avoid all drugs. 'It’s like playing Russian Roulette with your life.' 'We . all felt really hot so Chris went and brought a fan down from upstairs. About two hours later Emma and I had another smaller one and Chris had a . larger one.” Michael . Bowland, who had organised the night out, said he went downstairs at 10am the next day and saw Ms Johnson 'flicking her legs and making weird noises and . rolling off the sofa'. 'I told him [Goodwin] to get them an ambulance,' he told the inquest. 'I said she . was a mess. 'She just looked high and more gone than the others but Chris was bog-eyed too and said he was high. 'A . couple of hours later I heard noises coming from Chris’s room - it was . all fidgeting and groaning, so I just thought someone was having sex so I . didn’t want to go in. After a while I heard a big bang. 'I . went in and saw Chris on the bed and it was broken and the curtains had . come down. Chris seemed more like Emma was earlier. I started asking . him if he was alright. 'He . was talking normal one second then speaking gibberish the next. I . didn’t think the worst because I had seen him take drugs before and he . had done mad things. 'Then he started saying ""get out of my body"" and at this point I asked if he needed an ambulance but he said he was alright. 'He . was saying he wanted to get it out of his system. I phoned a friend for . advice. We didn’t phone the ambulance straight away because you don’t . want to get your friend in trouble. 'He started drinking some orange . juice so I thought he was recovering.' A . friend picked up Ms Johnson at 11am, when she was still . suffering the effects of the drug. Soon afterwards she collapsed and stopped breathing. She was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead at 1.30pm. Police arrived at Chris's home at 2pm, but he died in the living room despite paramedics' efforts. Coroner Jennifer Leeming recorded a verdict of accidental death. Car welder Chris Goodwin told friends he wanted the drug out of his body before collapsing in his living room . She told the families of both victims: 'Nothing that happened here was in any way intentional - but the fact is they, and other young people, are taking risks with their lives. 'There is a culture of it out there and I would say just don’t do it and don’t let others do it. Please learn from this and help others learn from this. 'I can’t imagine the pain of losing a child and I am so sorry.' Greater Manchester Police said they were waiting for phone records to trace the drug's origin, which could be used in a possible criminal case. Det Insp Chris Walker told the inquest: 'These deaths were extremely tragic. Young people need to be educated about the dangers of taking drugs and as they don’t understand what they are taking. 'It’s part of the culture now. People have got to know the perils of taking drugs they don’t know about.'

UPDATED: . 11:38 EST, 24 February 2013 . Former heavyweight world champion Herbie Hide has allegedly offered to help throw a world title fight for £1million . Former heavyweight world champion Herbie Hide has allegedly offered to help throw a world title fight for £1million, it was revealed today. Video footage of Hide - nicknamed the destroyer - apparently boasting about being able to fix boxing bouts has been published by the Sun on Sunday. They also allege that Hide offered to arrange for cocaine to be bought. Hide reportedly said: 'Whoever, which round you want, whatever you want as long as you put the money. 'I can guarantee one thing, you can get whoever is the favourite, you can get them to step down for a million pounds. 'You need a big name on good record — yeah, like myself!' The twice-crowned champion talked about pulling another unwitting top boxer into the scam. He described boxing as not about 'who is best' but instead called it a 'business'. The 41-year-old British heavyweight also arranged for cocaine to be delivered to undercover reporters for £100 a gram, the paper claims. The cocaine dealer claimed that Hide gave out the number of the reporters - posing as businessmen who were interested in organising exhibition bouts in the Middle East - to arrange a deal. Police have confirmed they are investigating drug allegations. Hide, nicknamed the Dancing Destroyer, reportedly lives in a £1.5million home in Norwich — the scene of tragedy last year when a 25-year-old was stabbed to death at a party. Tafadzwa Khan - known as Taffy - was knifed up to three times in the chest when fighting broke out at the sportsman’s £1.5million mansion. Mr Hide was not at the house at the time. Hide tried to persuade reporters to bankroll his comeback. Professional competitive bouts are officially recorded on a boxer’s record - allowing millions be punted on the outcome. Hide is currently not licensed to fight, but he claimed he could easily obtain permission. He said he would 'fight a bum' just to get warmed up. Video footage of Hide - nicknamed the destroyer - apparently boasting about being able to fix boxing bouts while they also allege that Hide offered to arrange cocaine has been published by the Sun on Sunday . Hide suggested the name of another big name fighter with an impressive winning record to take part in the championship bout - claiming 'money speaks'. However, there is no suggestion that the other boxer has ever been involved in match-fixing . Hide explained how his inside knowledge could help fix betting on fights by staging press conferences and sparring sessions held before them. These sessions are seen as key indicators of how fighters are likely to perform. They have a large impact on betting odds. Hide attempted to justify the £1million bout fixing fee he was demanding by saying: 'Money speaks and that’s where you can get people that will do it.' He said one boxer accepted a bung mid-fight to feign injury so his opponent would stay undefeated but warned reporters that he was 'telling them secrets'. After his heavyweight success Hide stepped down to cruiserweight and has won 14 successive fights and remains unbeaten at that weight. There is no suggestion that any of his previous fights have been rigged. A Norfolk Constabulary spokesman said: 'We have on Saturday 23 February, been handed information in the form of two short sections of video concerning alleged drug activity. 'The material appears to relate to an incident on 31 January 2013. 'The Police are examining this and working with the provider of the information to investigate the full circumstances.  Norfolk Constabulary takes allegations of illegal drug activity seriously and information passed to police is thoroughly investigated.'","Hide - nicknamed the destroyer - 'boasted about being able to fix boxing bouts' and 'offered to arrange cocaine'

A 3-year-old girl from Florida spent 30 hours hiding alone scared in her father’s closet and bed after she saw him get shot 19 times in the stairwell of his Philadelphia apartment building. Armone Stanley, 34, and his daughter, Aryana, had been preparing to leave for Philadelphia International Airport on Wednesday after she spent two weeks visiting him. Stanley, who had a lengthy criminal record in Florida, had been ambushed by an unknown gunman while walking down the stairs with Aryana’s pink Hello Kitty suitcase and shot dead on the second-floor landing. The girl was discovered curled up in his bed on Thursday, hungry and traumatized, after her worried mother, Anna Caddieri, 24, from Hollywood, Florida, called the landlord of the otherwise unoccupied building near 49th and Arch Streets, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Traumatised: The 3-year-old girl from Florida, Aryana, spent 30 hours hiding alone scared in her father¿s closet and bed after she saw him get shot 19 times in the stairwell . Ambushed: Armone Stanley, 34, and his daughter, Aryana, had been preparing to leave for Philadelphia International Airport on Wednesday when he was shot 19 times . Motherly love: Anna Caddieri, 24, from Hollywood, Florida, left, with her daughter Aryana, who she had sent to see her father in Philadelphia for two weeks . Past arrest: Stanley has a crime-ridden past. He was arrested in 2010 with three others for being a member of an identity theft ring . The landlord found Stanley’s bullet-riddled body in the stairwell and then discovered the little girl. Cassieri flew to Philadephia late Thursday but child welfare officials only permitted the mother to see Aryana for 10 minutes on Thursday and two hours on Friday. ‘I told her I would come back, but she was yelling, kicking and hollering, asking why she couldn't go with me,’ said Cassieri. ‘I couldn't explain it. It was heart breaking.’ Officials from Philadelphia's Department of Human Services (DHS) said they had to hold the child in protective custody for 72 hours to investigate the case. Saturday morning, a judge ordered the agency to immediately release Aryana to her mother's custody. In a statement, DHS officials said they ‘fully support’ the judge's decision to return Aryana to her mother, adding that they had kept her in temporary care because of an initial lack of information on her case. ‘DHS has to take all the facts into consideration in assessing the safety of children in our care,’ the statement read.

I don't want anything to do with Philadelphia ever again.’ Stanley's South Florida relatives said they are mystified by his killing. ‘He was a good man. He loved his kids,’ said Marlon Bryant, 29, his brother. ‘He was a big brother to me. He didn't have any trouble with anyone.’ In 2010 Stanley was arrested with three others for being a member of an identity theft ring in Bucks County, according to ABC 6 Action News. Police at the time said they recovered 35 driver's licenses, 53 credit cards, 50 personal checks or checkbooks, and a number of cellular phones and iPods. Murdered: Stanley, 34, was ambushed and shot dead in the stairwell of this apartment building in Philadelphia . Police said there are between 90 and 100 victims from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and as far south as Florida. Stanley was arrested along with Earl Johnson, 31, Ronnie Lodge, 22, and Javaris Williams, 23. Police say all four men were from the Fort Lauderdale area of Florida. Homicide detective Lt. Philip Riehl said the gunmen who shot Stanley on Wednesday had stood over him and ‘emptied a gun into him’, according to the Sentinel. Philadephia police Officer Jillian Russell said Monday that no arrests have been made in Stanley's death.","Aryana, from Hollywood, Florida, had been visiting her father, Armone Stanley, 34, for two weeks in Philadelphia .

A Kate Spade tote bag is drawing negative response on social media platforms for seeming to support Ugandan terrorist and warlord Joseph Kony. The $228 bag, which is clearly intended to read ‘I [heart] KSNY [Kate Spade New York]’, features a playing card ‘spade’ symbol in place of an ‘S’. But the rotund symbol could also be interpreted as an ‘O’, much to the amusement of many Twitter users. A mishap?: An abbreviation on Kate Spade's new tote bag is drawing an unfortunate comparison to Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony . On Sunday, Washington D.C.-based PR professional Lauren Jenkins tweeted a photo of the bag saying ‘Not sure Kate Spade thought this design through #ILoveKony.’ The post went semi-viral, receiving over 703 retweets and 719 ‘favorites’. Responses on Twitter responses ranged from ‘Oh my’, and ‘Yikes’ to ‘He was the glitteriest of the warlords.’ Another wrote: ‘I prefer to think some designer with a sardonic sense of humor did that on purpose.’ A representative for Kate Spade issued the following statement to MailOnline: 'This bag was designed as a celebration of Kate Spade New York, using the abbreviation of our name, kate (spade) new york.  We regret the interpretation of this tote's design and apologize for any misunderstanding.' They added:  'We take customer feedback seriously and are actively working to withdraw these items from our stores and wholesale partners.' Kony is an unfortunate comparison for the Kate Spade label, given that he is known to abduct children and turn them into child soldiers – information that came to light in filmmaker Jason Russell’s Kony 2012 documentary that has been watched over 98,500,000 times on YouTube. He is now being sought for arrest by the International Criminal Court. Sought by the ICC: Joseph Kony (above) drew widespread notoriety in the United States last year with a YouTube documentary that illustrated his many alleged war crimes . The tote was issued as part of Kate Spade’s Call To Action collection—a line of bags printed with declarative, millennial-friendly slogans like ‘Eat Cake for Breakfast’ and ‘Tequila Is Not My Friend #bagconeggandcheeseplease’. It is still available for pre-order through online retailers including Nordstrom. Made of cotton, leather, and PVC-trim, the item’s online description instructs consumers to ‘show the love with a canvas tote that features leather trim and a hot-pink zip tab.’","Following Internet outcry, Kate Spade is 'working to withdraw' the tote from its stores and wholesale partners' shelves ."

The prevalence of raccoon attacks at Marble Station on the Metro-North railroad has forced the local sanitation department to clean up the street in front of the station.

The 28-year-old told the New York Daily Post: 'I was scared. I started screaming. I don't want this to happen to me again.' There have also been reports of raccoons and skunk attacks at another subway station, Bedford Park. Speaking about another raccoon experience last month, Andre Mayes, 40, told the paper: 'It's kind of unnerving.

Starbucks has been accused of unnecessarily hiking their prices in China by the country's state-controlled media. In a seven-minute report aired by television channel CCTV, broadcasters claimed a tall latte in Beijing is more expensive than in London, Chicago and Mumbai. But the worldwide coffee chain dismissed the damning report, saying you cannot compare different markets. The story on Sunday gave the price of a Beijing latte as 27 yuan ($4.42), compared with 24.25 yuan ($3.97) in London, 19.98 yuan ($3.26) in Chicago and 14.6 yuan ($2.39) in Mumbai. Under attack: This Starbucks coffee house in Beijing is one of many that supposedly mark up their lattes . It follows a stream of attacks on the Seattle-based firm from China's state-run newspaper Economic Information Daily, accusing it of 'profiteering'. The publication's latest article on the topic was headlined: 'Starbucks can't justify high prices in China.' Analysts say the recent outcry is partly an official response to public frustration over high prices for imported goods. But it is one of many attacks on overseas firms, that experts warn will raise alarm in the international business community. Beijing - 27 yuan (£2.74) London - 24.25 yuan (£2.46) Chicago - 19.98 yuan (£2.03) Mumbai - 14.6 yuan (£1.48) Earlier this year, US tech giant Apple was accused of 'unparalleled arrogance' towards Chinese customers in a barrage of attacks earlier this year by state media. The criticism stopped after Apple CEO Tim Cook apologised. Foreign baby food manufacturers and pharmaceutical firms have also been targeted by authorities over allegations of price-fixing and corruption over the past year. The media focus on Starbucks was because 'most probably Starbucks is the biggest and most famous' coffee chain in China, said Kevin Yeong, managing director of the Benchmark Asia Research Group. 'For the past few months, I've been very concerned about...any foreign-owned company, because it looks like the local government is trying to do something to restrict foreign companies,' he added. In a statement, Starbucks said that its pricing in different cities is based on a variety of factors, including infrastructure investment, real estate, currency valuation and labour costs. 'Each Starbucks market is unique and has different operating costs, so it would be inaccurate to draw conclusions about one market based on the prices in a different market,' the company said. Outrage: According to the report, a tall latte from this London outlet is 28p cheaper than coffees in China . 'We continue to be humbled by the support we have received from our customers and the relevant authorities within the Chinese government,' it added. But on its verified account on China's hugely popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, it posted a photo of a pencil with a toy horse on its end - a visual pun on a highly offensive Chinese obscenity. Starbucks opened its doors in China in 1999 and now has more than 1,000 stores in the country and growing. China is likely to overtake Canada as Starbucks' second-largest market after the US next year, and it is aiming to reach 1,500 stores by 2015, according to a spokeswoman. Analysts said price differences could be explained not only by Starbucks' varied operating costs across the globe but also by the different role the coffee chain plays in the lives of Chinese consumers. In the US, Starbucks gets much more of its revenue from takeaway sales. But in China most business comes from customers who take their time inside the store, noted James Roy, a senior analyst with the Shanghai-based China Market Research Group. Other cases: Apple CEO Tim Cook also had to answer to attacks from Chinese state-run media after being accused of poor customer treatment earlier this year. Pharmaceutical firms have also been targeted . 'In China, it's a different positioning and a different value proposition,' he said. 'They invest more in making these stores themselves more premium options and making more of the environments as well.' One new location opened in Beijing last month is a glistening two-storey, 24-hour store featuring live music at the weekend. Yeong noted that while Starbucks' prices may be cheaper outside China, they are on a par with - and in some cases, cheaper than - those of its foreign competitors within China. Some Internet users mocked the CCTV report. 'The price of housing, cars and gasoline, Internet service and taxes in China are all more expensive than in other countries,' argued one Sina Weibo user. 'Why can't Starbucks be more expensive, too?'","Television channel CCTV broadcast seven-minute attack on coffee chain .

Victory: Polish born Barbara Jurga, 56, above, who has won her harassment claim after being told not speak her native tongue to children in the school, even though some of them were Polish . A Polish nursery school teacher who was banned from speaking her native language at work has won a £7,000 payout for harassment. Barbara Jurga, 56, complained that Lisa Howes, deputy head of Lavendale Montessori nursery School in London, branded her mother tongue 'one of those weird languages’. Married mother-of-four Mrs Jurga told how she had some children in her class who were Polish and spoke English as a second language. She said that their parents spoke to her in Polish and asked her to help their children by using the language when necessary. But Ms Howes banned Mrs Jurga from speaking any Polish, even to colleagues when she was on her break. Mrs Jurga then complained to couple Nuala and Neil Todd, owners of Lavendale Montessori nursery school in Woodside Park, north London. But after quitting her job and issuing her tribunal claim, Mr Todd, a retired Metropolitan Poice Senior Detective sent her 'intimidating' letters. A panel at Watford employment tribunal found the school guilty of race discrimination, harassment and victimisation. The school then agreed to pay Mrs Jurga £7,000 in compensation for injury to feelings. Mrs Jurga, of Burnt Oak, north-west London, is originally from Poznan, Poland. She settled in the UK in 1991 and joined the school in January 2009. She first complained to the nursery owners that in 2011 after Ms Howes had instructed her: ‘No Polish language to be spoken in the nursery’. Ms Howes told the tribunal she considered it 'rude and exclusionary' for staff to speak to each other in Polish during breaks. But Mrs Jurga insisted it was a 'fundamental right' of staff to use their preferred language in their free time away from the classroom. She also said that national education guidelines provided that where teachers are able to speak a pupil’s first language, they should do so when it is in the child’s best interests. After her complaints were repeatedly ignored, Mrs Jurga resigned in May 2012 and brought a race discrimination claim. Mr Todd, 60, then wrote to her saying staff would attend the tribunal and prove her allegations to be . 'false and vindictive'. He warned her: 'I look forward to making financial claim against your lies.' Multicultural: Mrs Jurga said her first language was useful for speaking to Polish students at the Lavendale Montessori nursery school in Woodside Park, north London, above . Giving evidence, Mr Todd told the tribunal: 'I wrote it because it became ever more clear what Mrs Jurga was after, namely to get a few pounds at the cost of the nursery by abusing the tribunal system.' In a second letter in November 2012, Mr Todd threatened Mrs Jurga for contacting witnesses who might support her case. He wrote: 'I am of the strong opinion that I now have sufficient evidence to present to my solicitor and seek instructions regarding your activities in trying to pervert the course of justice.' Mrs Jurga told the tribunal: 'I believe this was deliberately threatening. I feel completely bullied.' In its judgment, the panel ruled it was 'entirely reasonable' for Mrs Jurga to object to being banned from speaking Polish in appropriate circumstances. Victimised: Mrs Jurga, who was born in Poznan, received threatening letters from the nursery's owner, Neil Todd, after she threatened tribunal action . Ruling on Mr Todd’s letters, the panel found: 'It has to be remembered when considering this that Mr Todd is not unfamiliar with the legal process. 'He is a retired senior detective from the Metropolitan Police as he told us. 'Anyone can approach a witness. It is likely we suspect that Mr Todd knew this too.' It ruled that his 'totally disproportionate' attempt to put her off her legal action amounted to victimisation. Speaking after the judgment, Mrs Jurga said she felt 'happy and relieved' to have won. She said: 'I feel that finally justice has been done. 'As a dedicated Montessori school teacher, I believe in its founding philosophy which promotes the freedom of the individual and rejects all prejudice.' Her solicitor Nick Fry, of law firm Bindmans, said: 'This decision should highlight for employers the importance of addressing discrimination complaints early to promote equal opportunities and prevent workplace relations from deteriorating.' Mrs Jurga, who now works at another north London Montessori nursery school, failed in her claim that she was constructively dismissed on the grounds of race. The school declined to comment on the judgment.","Barbara Jurga was told not to speak her native tongue, even in free time .

Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani has won a further hearing in his legal battle against extradition. A panel of three High Court judges - headed by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas - ruled today there are outstanding legal issues the court must decide. Dewani, 33, is fighting removal to South Africa to face trial over his wife Anni’s death until he has recovered from mental health problems, including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Scroll down for video . Standing together: Anni Dewani's family (l-r) - mother Nilam Hindocha, brother Anish Hindocha, sister Ami Denborg and father Vinod Hindocha - outside the High Court after Shrien Dewani was granted another extradition hearing . His lawyers have stressed at various hearings that he will be willing to defend himself at trial once he is fit to do so. Lord Thomas ruled his case must be reopened to consider two key issues. The first relates to Dewani’s status as 'an accused person'. The . second concerns whether it would be 'unjust and oppressive' to . extradite Dewani 'regardless of the prognosis' of his mental condition. Lord Thomas said the further hearing should take place 'as soon as possible'. Legal experts said the renewed hearing, which could lead to appeals all the way to the Supreme Court, could delay any possibility of Dewani being extradited for months, if not years. Fighting removal to South Africa: Dewani pictured (left) outside court during a previous extradition hearing in 2011 and (right) with his wife Anni whom he is accused of murdering . CCTV footage taken from the couple's honeymoon hotel in South Africa shows the final hours of Anni Dewani who was murdered in 2010 . CCTV footage from the same night shows Dewani making what looks like a gunslinger gesture to his wife Anni, hours before she was shot dead . Anni Dewani’s mother Nilam Hindocha said outside court: 'I am the mother of a murdered daughter. How long do I have to wait? 'It is nearly three years since she was killed and we have kept our dignity and respect throughout. 'I was brought up to believe British justice is the best in the world so it is very hard to understand why we are still here.' In July, Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle ruled at Westminster Magistrates' Court that Dewani should be extradited and rejected his attempt to stay in the UK for further hospital treatment. He said Dewani, from Bristol, was still not fit to plead or stand trial at present, but there was evidence that he would receive the care he needed in South Africa. Judge Riddle had originally given the go-ahead to Dewani's extradition in 2011, but had to reconsider the position after the High Court allowed his appeal in March last year. Guilty: Taxi driver Zola Tongo (pictured) was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing . Dewani is suspected of ordering the killing of his new wife Anni, 28, who was shot as the couple travelled in a taxi on the outskirts of Cape Town in November 2010. So far, three men have been convicted over Mrs Dewani’s death. Last year, South African Xolile Mngeni was convicted of premeditated murder for shooting her. Prosecutors claimed that he was a hitman hired by Dewani to kill his wife, something that Dewani has consistently denied. Taxi driver Zola Tongo was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing, and another accomplice, Mziwamadoda Qwabe, also pleaded guilty to murder and was handed a 25-year prison sentence. Dewani’s family have said that he remains committed to returning to South Africa 'when his health would permit a full trial and when appropriate protections are in place for his health and safety'.","High Court judges say case should be reopened to consider two key issues .

A lesbian couple claiming £22,000 a year in benefits want a new house from the council for their four children, saying they are too stressed to work. Civil partners Lisa and Carrie-Ann Beaney say homophobic bullying from neighbours has left them unable to hold down a job. Carrie-Ann, 23, has never worked and Lisa, 30, quit her McDonald’s job after three months because it made her too anxious. It meant when the government’s benefit cap was introduced their housing payments were slashed and the pair were evicted from their rented home. Carrie-Ann Beaney, left, with daughter Calise, 14 months, and Lisa, right, with son Tommy, 16 months. The couple say they have received homophobic abuse saying they didn't deserve to have children . Since then they have been living in a single B&B room at a cost of £608 a week to the taxpayer. On top of their £21,900-a-year income from child and income support, that totals an equivalent cost to taxpayers of £53,000 a year. The couple argue they would be able to work if they weren’t bullied about their sexuality - and afford a house themselves. Lisa said: 'It does feel like we were . persecuted against because of our sexuality and I think the council . needs to show us some sympathy. 'When Dillon went to school he would have kids throw abuse at him and punch him because we were lesbians' - Lisa Beaney, 30 .

Lesbian couple Lisa and Carrie-Ann Beaney with Tommy, 16 months, and Calise, 14 months. They say they are unable to work due to bullying . Former neighbour Sheila Eagle, 69, retired, said: 'We didn’t even know they were lesbians for a long time. 'I don’t even think any of the neighbours knew them. I do not believe for a single second they received homophobic abuse.' She added: 'The landlords came round here asking about the family because they hadn’t been paying rent or bills. 'But we saw them with cars full of stuff from Argos where they had been buying new things though. 'They wanted to be given a council house and this was a way of getting it, if you ask me.' The couple from Ashford, Kent, describe themselves as bisexual and became legal partners in December 2010. Lisa already had son Devon, seven, and Carrie-Ann had son Dillon, eight, from their previous heterosexual relationships. They persuaded a male friend to donate the sperm they needed for artificial insemination at home, and fell pregnant at the same time. Last year Lisa gave birth to Tommy, now 16 months, and partner Carrie-Ann had daughter Calise, now 14 months. But when the benefit cap was introduced in April, the family were unable to afford the £850-a-month rent on their three-bedroom house. The family currently claim £141-a-week in Employment Support Allowance as a result of Lisa’s depression. They also receive £60-a-week in child benefit for their four children with an additional £11,437-a-year in child tax credits. It means the couple have a joint income of £21,900-a-year. With . the £608-per-week B&B rates the government is covering the family . receive the equivalent of £53,000-a-year - although this will . drop if they are given a housing association property. They would be exempt from the cap if they worked - but they say they receive too much harassment about their sexuality. Ashford Borough Council said the couple and their children have been offered a three bedroom-home which they are viewing tomorrow. A spokesman said: 'We did offer the family a property through our social lettings agency but they declined the offer, again on affordability. 'However, they have now successfully bid through Choice-Based Lettings for a three-bedroomed property. 'We also have one of the 70 private sector leased properties become available and these are available as a longer-term option.

Policemen from Romania and Poland are being drafted in to help British forces combat an Eastern European crimewave. Scotland Yard has recruited the officers, who have flown to the capital for a two-year ‘tour of duty’ to help identify and deport overseas offenders. The move comes ahead of the lifting of border controls on immigrants from Romania in two months’ time. London beat: Romanian policemen in the capital . The special squad, comprising eight detectives from Romania and three officers from Poland, will join the Metropolitan Police on raids, interviews and working in custody suites to crosscheck records with their own police database. But they will have no powers of arrest or any other powers of the traditional British bobby. The unprecedented move comes after it emerged last year that 28 per cent of the 300,000 suspects the Metropolitan Police arrests each year were foreign nationals, with Poles and Romanians at the top of the list. More than 27,000 Romanian citizens have been held for serious offences in London in the past five years, including ten for murder, 142 for rape and 666 for other sex offences. Earlier this month, Roma beggars were targeted by police in Westminster with help from Romanian officers . The number of Romanians arrested is second only to that of Poles, 34,905 of whom have been detained since 2008, including 84 for murder. Police hope that the new unit will disrupt major organised criminal networks. Under the scheme, whose £1.7million cost will be met by the EU, the foreign officers will be deployed on rotation in London for two years. The arrangement will allow the Met to gain access to national police computers in Romania and Poland, enabling them to fast-track the exchange of intelligence and forensic science data. The officers, who speak English, will operate mostly in plain-clothes roles but be able to wear their national uniforms if a situation requires it. They will tackle a wide variety of migrant crime from low-level offences such as begging to human trafficking, serious sexual assaults and money laundering.

The majority of small investors who took part in the stampede for shares in Royal Mail will get less than half of the stock they wanted – with 36,500 people getting nothing. More than £37billion, including £4billion from ordinary savers, was offered, but they were chasing just £1.7billion of shares that were available to buy. Yesterday the Prime Minister hailed today’s flotation of the State-owned giant as ‘a piece of popular capitalism’, with an extraordinary 730,000 people signing up to buy shares. But in a move slammed as ‘unwise and unfair’, anybody who applied for more than £10,000 of shares will get nothing. Sell-off: Business Secretary Vince Cable has made clear that small investors applying for the minimum £750 stake in Royal Mail will be prioritised for shares . Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, said the decision to freeze out wealthier investors ‘struck the right balance’. Even the government has been surprised by the level of interest in the privatisation of Royal Mail. More than 700,000 people applied for shares, making it seven times over-subscribed. Shares . were initially priced at between 260p and 330p, but the stampede from . investors means ministers have opted for the top price of 330p, which . would value Royal Mail at around £3.3 billion. The government is selling 52.2 per cent of the company, arguing private money is needed to ensure its future survival. Royal Mail has had to adapt to changing demands, as we post fewer letters but more parcels as we shop more online. 'Conditional share dealing', where City institutions can buy and sell the shares, will begin on Friday. Full trading will begin next Tuesday, October 15, when all investors can buy and sell shares in Royal Mail. Everybody who applied for £10,000 or . less of shares will get the same amount – 227 shares equal to £749.10. The minimum they could apply for was £750. A . No 10 source said: ‘If you are investing £100,000 or even £20,000 in . shares, then there is frankly an argument that being presented with £750 . of shares would be little more than an annoyance.’ Of the 730,000 small investors who wanted to buy shares, a  minority – 93,000 – had actually wanted only £750 worth. Last . night, official figures from the Department for Business showed around . two-thirds of people received less than half of the shares they had . applied for. To add to their . frustration, unsuccessful small shareholders have to wait until as late . as October 21 to get their money back, according to the detail buried . in the 447-page report. In a . controversial move, they will not receive a single penny in interest on . their money, but the Government will scoop interest on the enormous . cash pile. Private investors had the money immediately removed from . their debit card, or cheque cashed, for the full amount that they wanted . to buy. As a result, they handed over around £4billion, but will get . just £568million of shares, leaving around £3.4billion of money earning . interest until the deadline for the money to be refunded. This could trigger a windfall of around £2million, according to calculations by the financial website Moneycomms. City . institutions were also turned down in massive numbers. Of the 800 . institutions who wanted to buy shares in Royal Mail, 500 were turned . away, a process knowing as ‘zeroing’. Sources . reveal ‘a small number’ of hedge funds were  allowed to buy shares, . although Mr Cable insisted earlier in the week that only ‘responsible, . long-term institutional investors’ would be permitted. The . scale of the interest in Royal Mail fuels fears that the privatisation . was chronically under-valued. Lord Forsyth, former Conservative cabinet . minister, said: ‘Clearly the pricing has been wrong.

She said: 'Strays getting into homes through cat flaps is very common, but I have not heard of a cat attacking someone who was asleep. 'Cats can be bold and territorial and it could be that the cat felt threatened by the man suddenly moving when he was asleep.

'You can get cat flaps with powerful magnets and fit a magnet on the cat’s collar, which allows it to open,' she added.","Paul Goodrum awoke at home in Humberstone, Leicester, covered in blood .

The number of children diagnosed with special education needs has plummeted by 70,000 after the government announced a crackdown. In 2011-12, 1.62 million pupils were labelled as having some form of learning difficulty, behavioural problem or speech impediment. This fell last year to 1.55 million - a difference of almost five per cent in just 12 months. In 2011-12, 1.62 million pupils were labelled as having some form of learning difficulty (file picture) SEN diagnoses have been viewed with some suspicion as they can be used to claim extra funds and are taken into account when assessing exam results - potentially improving a school's place in league tables. Three years ago a damning Ofsted report estimated 450,000 children had been classed as SEN to hide poor teaching. The Coalition subsequently announced it was tackling the problem by introducing tougher screening measures. Figures from the Department for Education show a quarter of boys (943,430) officially have a problem that affects academic performance - almost double the 511,570 girls. Girls were more likely to have hearing impairments and moderate learning difficulties, while boys had a greater chance of autism or behavioural, emotional or social difficulties. The rate among children receiving free school meals - a key indicator of poverty - was 30.1 per cent compared to 14.1 per cent among those from more affluent homes. Black children were the most likely to be diagnosed with special needs. The lowest rates were among Chinese and Indian families. Pupils with SEN are 11 times more likely to be permanently excluded and five times more likely to be suspended on one or more occasions. Those with a statement of special educational needs - which can release extra money, staff time and equipment - are eight times more likely to be expelled and six times more likely to be suspended at least once. Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said schools were still 'miles away from a real figure for SEN'. He added: 'Schools have a vested interest in identifying children as having SEN as it attracts extra funding and tends to disguise failures in teaching. 'The tragedy for children with genuine need is that resources are being spread very thinly as a result.'","Coalition introduced tougher screening measures .

Barbara Fari claimed to be totally disabled after tripping over, but surveillance proved she had no mobility problems, a court heard . A mother-of-13 has been accused of exaggerating an injury in an attempt to claim more than £750,000 compensation from a housing management organisation after a fall. Lawyers for Homes for Haringey - which manages council housing in Haringey, north London - told a High Court judge that Barbara Fari, 59, lied about how badly she was hurt and should be found to be in contempt of court. The woman then told Central London County Court that the only way she could get up and down the stairs was by dragging herself on her buttocks. Her husband Piper Fari claimed to be working as a full-time carer for his wife and demanded that the council pay for a carer, since she was said to need 10-16 hours of care a day. But undercover surveillance quickly revealed that Mrs Fari had no serious mobility problems. Her medical records showed a knee complaint which pre-dated the supposed fall by years. After suggesting the injury was worth no more than £1,500 the case was thrown out by Judge Christopher Mitchell and contempt proceedings were launched. At a subsequent hearing, Mr Justice Holroyde observed that Mrs Fari was ‘using stairs without assistance’ and ‘carrying her shopping bags without difficulty’. Mrs Fari has yet to put her side of the story but is expected to deny the claims. The hearing - at the High Court in London - is due to end later this week. The lawyers said Mrs Fari claimed damages after falling five years ago - and said the claim had been dismissed by a county court judge. They accused Mrs Fari and her husband Piper of interfering with the 'due administration of justice'. David Melville QC, acting on behalf of Homes For Haringey, said, ‘On 16 May 2008, Mrs Fari...fell onto her right knee. ‘She served a schedule of loss in support of her claim, in which she claimed that her niece was being paid £40 per fortnight by her and her husband was providing her with care at a rate of £296 per week. ‘The claimant and her husband stated that Mrs Fari had had to give up fostering because of the accident. ‘Mrs Fari said she had to mobilise with two walking sticks.’ Mr Melville told the court that Mrs Fari had initially been offered a £7,500 settlement, but had rejected the offer as ‘derisory’. Piper Fari arrives at the Royal Courts of Justice. He claimed he had been forced to abandon his career, in order to care for Barbara, the court heard . Piper claimed he had been forced to turn his back on his career, in order to care for Barbara, the court heard. Upon visiting leading surgeon Mr Andrew Jackson, Mrs Fari ‘had to be helped from the chair a few steps across the room to the couch for the purposes of the examination, accompanied by pleas for glasses of water and pain-killers’, Mr Melville said. As suspicions grew, the firm Roberston & Co were hired to secretly film Mrs Fari, on September 1 and September 20, 2011. The first film, taken ‘no more than a . fortnight’ after her last visit to a doctor, showed Mrs Fari with ‘no . stick, or crutch of any sort...to be seen, nor was there...her husband . or her son or anyone else who might have needed to help her’. ‘She lives at the top of a hill in Hornsey, and she was carrying three shopping bags - full - on one of the days. ‘Her credibility was accordingly exploded’, Mr Melville said. The medical experts who had been duped were later shown the surveillance footage, ‘and stated in a joint statement...that they had been misled by Mrs Fari’. ‘The had been cheated’, Mr Melville said. Mrs Mori complained of the ‘shame and the stigma’ of her condition and pretended ‘when out, I am always accompanied by my husband and we always use taxis’, the court heard. Mrs Fari sat with her husband, her head bowed, while many of their children attended in support. The hearing continues.

Warning: Prime Minister David Cameron said Facebook had to prove it was protecting children . David Cameron today challenged Facebook to prove that its system protected children after the site was forced to reinstate a ban on beheading videos. The Prime Minister led criticism against the social networking site after it lifted a ban on users posting graphic videos of violent killings. The firm yesterday bowed to pressure from child internet protection campaigners by taking down a graphic video of a woman being beheaded in Mexico. Facebook’s . unpublicised change in policy came to light after it refused to remove a . 57-second video showing a young Mexican woman, her hands tied behind . her back and on her knees, being beheaded by a masked man in broad . daylight. It was posted last week under the title ‘Challenge: Anybody . can watch this video?’. Mr Cameron yesterday condemned Facebook's 'irresponsible' actions and demanded the firm 'explain their . actions to worried parents.’ After the video was removed, the Prime Minister today welcomed the change of heart but warned youngsters using the site needed to be protected. Mr . Cameron wrote on Twitter: ‘I'm pleased Facebook has changed its . approach on beheading videos. The test is now to ensure their policy is . robust in protecting children.' Facebook had said that while the . images must not be posted for ‘sadistic pleasure’, they should be . available for those who wish to condemn them. However, last night it was revealed . Facebook had removed the clip of a woman being beheaded and said it . would use a broader set of criteria to determine when gory videos are . permitted on the site. Challenge: The Prime Minister used rival social media site Twitter to keep up pressure on Facebook . Alert: Facebook has begun adding warning messages to videos on its website showing decapitations . The . website had earlier begun adding alerts to videos showing decapitations . or other extreme violence, saying: 'Warning! This video contains . extremely graphic content and may be upsetting'. ‘When . we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic . look at the context surrounding a violent image or video,’ a Facebook . spokesman said. ‘Second, we . will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it . responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and . sharing it with an age-appropriate audience.’ Terrible: The filmed executions of people like Ken Bigley would have been allowed to be shown on Facebook after they quietly lifted a ban - now reintroduced . The . change underscores a challenge for Facebook as it seeks to position . itself as the go-to online destination where people share . up-to-the-minute images and discuss breaking news events. The . US firm acknowledged last night that its previous approach, which . permitted the video of the woman's killing in Mexico to remain on its . site, was flawed. ‘Based on . these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic . content and have concluded that this content improperly and . irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it,’ the company said. Suicide . prevention charities had denounced the original move to lift the ban on . beheading videos, warning that the clips were ‘psychologically . destructive’ to teenagers. Others . accused Facebook of double standards for allowing footage of beheadings . but restricting what breastfeeding mothers can post and demanding women . remove pictures of their mastectomy scars. After the video of the Mexcian woman being beheaded was posted, Facebook users reacted with outrage. One disgusted viewer commented: ‘Remove this video, too many young innocent minds out there shouldn’t see this.’ Another . wrote: ‘This is absolutely horrible, distasteful and needs to be . removed... I’m very disturbed after seeing a couple of seconds of it.’ Gruesome videos of people being beheaded are to be allowed on Facebook once again. The social network claims that its users should be able to watch and condemn these videos, but not celebrate them . One of Facebook’s advertisers, car-sharing companty ZipCar, . withdrew its adverts in protest, saying: ‘We do not condone this type of . abhorrent content being circulated on Facebook.’ Dr . Arthur Cassidy, of suicide prevention group the Yellow Ribbon Program, . said: ‘It only takes seconds of exposure to such graphic material to . leave a permanent trace – particularly in a young person’s mind.’ Facebook may now allow videos of people being beheaded, but there are a number of subjects and clips it will not allow to be published on in its site. Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a child is involved. Elsewhere, the site imposes ‘limitations on the display of nudity’ but doesn’t ban it outright - it depends on the context and circumstance. Female nipples, as a rule, will be removed but male nipples are allowed. A photo was famously removed last year when an elbow was mistaken for a female nipple, before being reinstated. Breastfeeding images were removed in 2012, but Facebook’s Community Guidelines now states the site ‘respects people’s right to share content of personal importance’ and makes explicit reference to breastfeeding. The pictures are allowed if the child is seen ‘actively nursing’ but may be removed if it shows the nipple. Children playing in the bath are accepted as long as they are not graphic and explicit, while sculpture and art work that depicts the naked body is allowed, but real-life images and similar poses are not. Another photo famously taken down showed Kylie Minogue holding a teddy bear with her microphone positioned in such a way, between the bear’s legs, that made it look phallic. Facebook removed it for violating the use of ‘photos that contain nudity, drug use or violence’. Any video that condones violence, threatens or is abusive and bullying towards another person or promotes criminal activity is prohibited. Any promotion or encouragement of self-mutilation, eating disorders of drug abuse is similarly banned. Facebook does not permit hate speech, especially towards individuals, groups, sex, race, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation – yet will distinguish between ‘serious and humorous speech’ and will allow videos and posts that ‘challenge ideas, institutions and certain practices.’ Sharing graphic content for 'sadistic pleasure' is prohibited, yet if the content is shared in the process of reporting current events it is be allowed as long as it balances ‘the needs of a diverse community.’ Facebook monitors photos, but also relies on its users to report content they feel should be removed. If a photo is under investigation it may be temporarily removed while Facebook looks into the complaint but will be reinstated if it is found not to have breached the code.","Facebook banned decapitation videos in May due to psychological damage .

Accused: Derek Annan is accused of being part of a failed plot to steal £3million from RBS customers' accounts . A bank cashier has denied being part of a plot to steal almost £3million from Royal Bank of Scotland customers' accounts. Derek Annan, 24, is accused of passing customers' security details and passwords on to fraudsters who attempted to withdraw large sums of money from their accounts. The gang had only managed to take £135,000 before they were caught, but attempts were made to withdraw a further £2.5million. The Old Bailey heard that members of the gang would go into RBS branches and attempt to cash cheques stolen from their victims using fake identification. If they were challenged with security questions by the cashier, they were able to answer the questions thanks to the information allegedly supplied by Annan, who worked part time at RBS branches in Chelmsford and Colchester, in Essex. Prosecutor Nicola Merrick told the court that Annan provided the names of signatories on bank accounts, information about the signatures themselves, how much money was in the accounts as well as security details and passwords. One of the victims, Peter Hewitt, from . Solihull, West Midlands, had £14,800 taken from his account in three . withdrawals in January 2011. Undertakers . LM Funerals Ltd had its chequebook stolen and 98 cheques were put . through the banking system in an attempt to take around £836,000 in May . 2011. Fortunately, RBS investigator Richard Cross discovered the fraud before the gang were able to steal any more money. Hearing: The Old Bailey heard that Annan allegedly passed customers' security details onto the gang . A subsequent probe found that each account had been accessed by Annan shortly before the cash was withdrawn. Annan, who worked part time for RBS while . studying finance at Southbank University, in south London, was arrested on suspicion of fraud in December 2011, but denied any involvement. He was arrested for a second time in March of this year in connection with another 20 attempts to defraud RBS customers. This time he refused to answer police questions, the court heard. Ms Merrick said: ‘Mr Annan obtained (customers') information because as a bank employee he was able to access accounts and get all of that information and provide it to others.

A combative hedge fund has snapped up more shares in Royal Mail than any other investor, it was disclosed last night. The Government had hoped to sell shares to pension funds and long-term investors during the flotation, which was one of the largest since the days of Margaret Thatcher. But Royal Mail documents show that The Children’s Investment Fund, which is run by Chris Hohn who was once dubbed the 'locust' for his aggressive tactics, has built up a 5 per cent holding in the company – making it the largest single shareholder. The revelation will increase . pressure on ministers over whether the firm was substantially . undervalued before its sell earlier this month. Shares in the firm were up 11.25p at . 510.25p in early trading today - some 55 per cent above the float price . of 330p, but off their all-time high to date of 538.5p. Any . investor who owns more than 3 per cent has to declare their holding. TCI – run by Mr Hohn and one of the initial 300 institutions to get . shares at 330p in the float – is the first to bridge the threshold. The holding of 58m shares is worth £280million, although it is not known at what price the fund bought its extra postal shares. The fund has picked fights with governments and companies across the world in pursuit of higher returns. Mr . Hohn was once described as a ‘locust’ after helping to remove the boss . of Deutsche Börse, a German firm that was trying to buy the London Stock . Exchange. He is also one of the UK’s leading philanthropists, having given an estimated £800m to children’s charities since 2003. Surge: The price of shares in the Royal Mail has soared since the government sold off more than half the firm at £3.30 earlier this month . Labour's shadow trade minister Ian Murray said: 'David Cameron's Royal Mail fire sale has seen the vast majority of shares going to big money investors in the City while the taxpayer is left short changed. 'The Tory-led Government claimed that the sale would prioritise long-term investors but serious questions will be asked on whether this is the case, not least given the huge volume of trades in Royal Mail shares which we have seen in the first days of trading running into hundreds of millions. 'Thanks to David Cameron, taxpayers have been left short changed to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds at a time when families across Britain are facing a cost of living crisis.' The Government has been slammed for selling Royal Mail at such a low level, when analysts were saying it should be valued at more than £5billion. Business Secretary Vince Cable will appear before MPs next month to answer questions over why shares were sold by the government at £3.30 but have since soared to more than £5. He will appear alongside Lazard, one of the banks advising the Government. Mr Cable has claimed threats of strike action forced ministers to cut value of Royal Mail on the eve of its sell-off. In a letter to the Business Select Committee on Friday he said potential investors pulled out of the deal before the flotation as unions vowed to ballot for industrial action. Grilling: Business Secretary Vince Cable is to face questions from MPs next month on whether Royal Mail was sold off on the cheap . Bankers at Goldman Sachs, UBS and Lazards handling the sale persuaded ministers not to increase the offer price above £3.30, fearing it could hit demand, Mr Cable claimed. He said that earlier in the preparation for the sell-off during the summer, the threat of strikes by Royal Mail workers left some buyers ready to pull out. In early August a list of 20 potential investors was drawn up but later that month it became clear that a new pay agreement with postal workers was no longer achievable before the sell-off. It meant the Communication Workers Union (CWU) were likely to ballot for strike action at or around the time of the privatisation.","The Children's Investment Fund run by philanthropist Chris Hohn .

A stand up comedian was killed as he left a Las Vegas nightclub after trying to tackle an armed man who had just shot the club manager and a bouncer. Kenneth Brown, 40, has been hailed as a hero by Metro police after he was shot twice attempting to stop the gunman at the entrance to Drai's After Hours nightclub inside Bally's Casino. But while Mr Brown's mother describes her son's death as 'an unbearable pain', she said she has no ill will against the man accused of killing him. Norma Sattiewhite told News 3: 'I wouldn't wish this on any mother, father, sister, brother, anyone. 'But I have no hate for the man. I have to love no matter what and pray for him - and I do.' Police believe that Mr Brown, who moved to Las Vegas from Los Angeles last year to be closer to his mother, saw Benjamin Frazier, 41, shoot a bouncer and a security guard in an argument about payment to get into the club. Brown, who also worked as a club promoter, rushed to the pair's aid and attempted to jump on the alleged gunman but was also shot. He later died in hospital. Popular venue: Mr Brown was fatally wounded as he was leaving an after hours nightclub at Bally's Casino, pictured . The manager and the security guard, who were shot in the arm and the stomach, both survived the shooting. Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie described Mr Brown as a hero.

A nurse who called her black housemate an 'a***hole' apologised today but claimed the word is a 'figure of speech in Scotland'. Anne Gallacher is also accused of slapping the woman and making racist comments about black people and foreigners, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. Gallacher, who works at the Princess Elizabeth Hospital in Guernsey, admitted calling the woman an a***hole and saying ‘the black girls in the lounge’, but denies that this was racist. Nurse Anne Gallacher called her housemate an 'a***hole' - which she claims is a figure of speech in Scotland - because she feared she was going to call the police . ‘I did call her an a***hole,’ she told the hearing. ‘I was frightened of her phoning the police. ‘I’m sorry, I apologise, but I called her an a***hole. It’s a figure of speech in Scotland. I didn’t mean it in a bad way. ‘The police arrived and asked if it was me who had phoned about the disturbance and I said, no, it was the three black girls in the lounge. ‘I wasn’t trying to be derogatory and I didn’t say it because of their skin colour.’ The row began in the communal lounge of their accommodation on Route de Cobo, Castel, Guernsey on June 4, 2011. Gallacher and her boyfriend entered the room where the woman was sitting with two friends. The hearing heard the boyfriend began threatening the housemate and she called the police. Gallacher is then accused of slapping the woman in the face, though she claimed she was trying to push the phone away. ‘She was hysterical and I was trying to get the phone away from her ear and try to get her to calm down and stop phoning the police,' the nurse said. ‘I reached over and wanted to move the phone away. I don’t remember if I touched the phone - in the heat of the moment it’s possible I could have. ‘It’s possible I may have touched her face but I don’t believe I did. ‘If I did touch her face I would class it as assault, if I did touch her face it was an accident. ‘I did lean across but I didn’t slap her. I wanted to try and stop her phoning the police, there was no intention of hitting or slapping.’ Gallacher is then accused of slapping the woman, though she claimed she was trying to push the phone away . When questioned about changing her story, Gallacher said that the transcript from the police interview was wrong and later admitted lying to officers. ‘I don’t think it has been typed up properly - they have misunderstood some of my words,’ she said. Rachel Ellis, for the NMC, accused Gallacher of hurling racist abuse at the woman and her friends. ‘She was crying and you started mocking her,' Ms Ellis said. ‘The reason she was crying is because you assaulted her. ‘It’s correct that you leaned across, slapped her in the face and pushed her shoulder. ‘You were convicted of assaulting her at Guernsey Magistrates Court, you pleaded not guilty and gave evidence and the judge was satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that you assaulted her.’ The housemate told the hearing: ‘She managed to slap me on my left side. ‘I just couldn’t believe she had hit me and she started singing ""you hit me, you hit me - I should have hit you until you were black and blue you f****** c***, you a***hole"".' Gallacher, originally from Glenrothes, Fife, then went on to talk about ‘you lot taking over the place’, the woman claimed. ‘She was just speaking to anyone that would listen to her - police and other nurses that were there. With her arms she was gesturing into the room,’ she said. ‘I have never seen her with a face like that before. She was more like snarling at me - it was like nobody mattered.’ Gallacher is also accused of racially motivated abuse to another woman known as Miss B, after allegedly saying ‘these foreigners are taking over the house’ and referring to ‘all of the black people’ on an unknown date. The Scottish nurse was found guilty of assaulting Ms A - but claims the attack was racially motivated were dismissed. Judge Philip Robey said while Gallacher was aggressive and abusive, the assault was a minor one and imposed a bind over order to be of good behaviour for two years. She was previously convicted of disorderly conduct and fined £600 at Guernsey Magistrates Court on 9 August 2010. Gallacher was also convicted of driving while unfit and resisting or obstructing police at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court on 29 June 2004. On that occasion she was put on probation for 18 months, disqualified from driving for four years and ordered to pay £300. The hearing continues.","Anne Gallacher apologised at Nursing and Midwifery Council hearing .

A toddler died when his head became trapped between two stair gates intended to keep him safe in his family home, an inquest has heard. Xander Stephenson, who was just two weeks from his second birthday, was left unable to breathe when he got his arm and neck wedged between the gates, which were installed to stop him falling down the stairs. The little boy's mother found him in the doorway of his bedroom but, despite efforts to save him, Xander was pronounced dead at the scene. An inquest has heard how toddler Xander Stephenson was 'strangled' just two weeks before his second birthday when he became trapped between two stair gates installed to stop him falling down the stairs of his home . A post mortem-examination showed that his cause of death had been asphyxia. An inquest into the tragedy was told that Xander, of Poulton, near Blackpool, . Lancashire, had become 'increasingly persistent and successful' at getting . out of his room in the weeks leading up to the accident on September 13. Despite already having a stair gate, he had used his toys to climb over it and managed to wander downstairs. His mother, Samantha Pickford, 26, who was training to become a childminder, had feared for her son's safety and so borrowed a second gate to use above the one she already had, on the advice of other parents. Miss Pickford told the hearing in Lancaster: 'Xander started climbing as soon as he could move really. 'In the last six months he began climbing out of his cot and would come into my room before we would go downstairs. Persistent: An inquest into the tragedy heard that Xander had become 'increasingly persistent and successful' at getting out of his room in the weeks leading up to his death . 'It got to a point where I would keep putting him back in his bed and every time he would climb out again, sometimes before I’d even left the room. 'One night he climbed out of the cot about 50 times and that is when I decided to put the first stairgate in. 'I didn’t want to put it at the top of the stairs because if I had and he had climbed over he would have fallen down the stairs. 'The . stair gate worked fine for a couple of months, until he started to use . toys to climb over the gate. I tried taking the toys out, but eventually . he learned how to climb over the gate himself. 'One morning I came downstairs and he had emptied my washing powder all over the floor. 'He . had a spoon in his hand and was going to eat it. Another morning he had . emptied my frozen food all over the floor and was trying to eat it. Adventurous: Xander's father Mark Stephenson said that the little boy loved exploring and would be sorely missed . 'I . was looking for something to help me keep him in his bedroom because I . was scared that I would come down one morning and I would find him . dead.' Miss Pickford then decided to use the second gate, however just 36 hours after it was installed, little Xander had managed to squeeze his arm and neck between the two gates. The . bottom bolts on the top gate became loose, leaving the gate swinging . and fixed by only two top bolts, trapping the boy between them. Miss Pickford carried Xander downstairs in his pyjamas before lying him on the sofa. She then ran into the street screaming when she told a passer-by, hairdresser Lindsay Kerry, that a stairgate had 'strangled' her son. Paramedics were called and Miss Kerry tried to carry out CPR until the ambulance arrived. However, despite the medics’ best efforts Xander was pronounced dead at the scene. Recording . a verdict of accidental death, Wyre Coroner Dr James Adeley said this . was the first time he had come across such an accident. He said: 'The presence of a second stair gate, to me, seems sensible after learning how adventurous Xander was. 'The position of the stair gate an inch and a half to two inches above the other also seems sensible. 'Miss Pickford, who is training for a qualification in childcare, had even checked that the gates were safe. Paramedics rushed to try to help little Xander Stephenson but there was nothing they could do to save his life (file picture) 'I have been a coroner for nine and a half years,' Dr Adeley said. 'I have presided over some 22,000 deaths, and I have never come across a death involving a stair gate before.'He told Miss Pickford: 'You must not blame yourself. There is no evidence that getting to Xander a few moments earlier would have made any difference.' In a statement Mark Stephenson, 33, Xander’s father, said that the youngster would be missed by everyone who knew him. He said: 'He was just a baby, not even two yet. Needless to say I am devastated and heartbroken. 'He was adventurous and loved exploring. He also loved Mickey Mouse. Xander will be sorely missed by everyone who knew him. 'I can’t sleep, I can’t imagine what I’m gonna do without my boy, my baby, my son.'","Xander Stephenson was just two weeks from his second birthday .

The first picture has emerged of the bride-to-be who turned up to her wedding venue only to find it swarming with police after the groom had made a hoax call pretending explosives were hidden there. Amy Williams arrived at St George's Hall, in Liverpool, wearing her white dress on her wedding day, but found bomb disposal units and police officers searching the venue from top to bottom. Neil McArdle sparked the bomb scare because he did not want to tell Miss Williams he had failed to finalise their wedding plans. Amy Williams (left) arrived at her wedding to find it swarming with police after groom Neil McArdle (right) made a hoax call because he had forgotten to finalise their wedding plans . He was jailed for a year yesterday at Liverpool Crown Court, which was told the couple are still together but, six months on from the incident, have . still not tied the knot and have no plans to do so. Miss Williams, who is still living at the couple's address in Kirkby, Merseyside, today refused to comment. A neighbour said: 'They had both been very quiet over the last few days and I hadn't seen them since before the weekend. 'What he did was very stupid and it's a shame because she's a lovely young girl. 'Amy's devastated at everything that's happened and I think she just wants some time to herself to try and take it all in.' The couple had pencilled in a date at the iconic building but the groom realised he had not filled in the 'right to marry' forms to legalise the marriage. Miss Williams is believed to have no plans to marry McArdle, although she is still living at the couple's address in Kirkby, Merseyside, . Threats: McArdle called the Grade II-listed St George's Hall in Liverpool and told staff that there were explosives hidden inside the famous building . The 36-year-old admitted making a hoax call in a panic, from a phone box near his home. He told a receptionist: 'There’s a bomb in St George’s Hall and it will go off in 45 minutes.' Following the call the building was placed on lock down while bomb disposal units and police officers searched the venue from top to bottom. 'Amy's devastated at everything that's happened and I think she just wants some time to herself to try and take it all in' - A neighbour of Miss Williams . However, when the building was re-opened later in the day, the venue confirmed that no booking for the wedding had been made. McArdle had planned to marry Miss . Williams at Liverpool Register Office, which is situated within the . listed St George’s Hall, on April 24. He pleaded guilty to a single charge of communicating false information with intent at an earlier hearing at Liverpool Crown Court. Sentencing . McArdle yesterday, Judge Norman Wright said: 'I just don’t accept that . the penny dropped on the night before the wedding. 'You . are an intelligent man with a degree. Maybe there was an ambivalence in . your mind about the wedding and suddenly you got yourself into quite a . predicament. 'It seems that you buried your head in the sand until the day of the wedding.' The judge said that the hoax call had . been made just days after two explosions went off at the finish line of . the Boston Marathon, leaving three dead, and that the tragedy 'must have . been at the very forefront of peoples’ minds'. Plans: McArdle and his fiancée had pencilled in a date to get married at the hall, but he never filled in the 'right to marry' forms to legalise the marriage . He . added: 'Your call to St George’s Hall must have struck sheer terror in . the heart of the person that received the call and fear in the minds of . the people who are charged with the responsibility of the safety of . people inside the building. 'You knew that the wedding couldn’t take place and you didn’t try to level with your partner. 'Instead, you tried to weasel your way out of the situation.

Hunt: The NYPD are looking for four bikers involved in the vicious assault on a family driving through Manhattan on September 29 . Several members of the motorcycle gang are being sought out for questioning by the NYPD . The officer, a seven-year veteran of the force, is expected to be charged with criminal mischief, according to CBS. The . officer is assigned to the NYPD Intelligence Division, but sources did . not reveal whether he was on assignment or whether his actions were a . ploy to protect his cover. Michael Palladino, president of the NYPD detectives' union, said the undercover officer was forced to make a difficult decision. Hurt: Alexian Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by . bikers in New York as he tried to protect his wife and child. It has now emerged that an undercover cop was part of the group that attacked . Smashed: Police claim there is video evidence that appears to show Braszczok smashing the rear window of the SUV . 'Compromising . his identity could compromise all the work he's doing and his safety as . well,' Palladino told NBC. 'It's very difficult to lead a double life.' The officer now faces an internal investigation because . he didn't inform higher brass that he was with the bikers, let alone . the crime scene, until three days after the attack, the Post said. Manhattan district attorney’s Trials . Division, Karen Friedman Agnifilo said that the city cannot chase . everyone involved saying: 'Prematurely charging individuals with . low-level crimes does not further the goals of the investigation and . could weaken the cases we expect to bring against the perpetrators of . serious crimes.' The explosive development came as another biker headed to court over the incident. In court: One of the bikers, Craig Wright, was arraigned on Tuesday on charges of gang assault in the attack . Accused: Wright, with his attorney Mitchell Elman, allegedly stomped on Lien three times in the video . Craig . Wright, 29, was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on Tuesday and . ordered held on $100,000 bail, even though his lawyer said he was . innocent. Prosecutors . argued that Wright, from Canarsie, Brooklyn, had been caught on video . stomping of Lien at least three times after he was dragged from the SUV. Wright was arrested Monday on charges of gang assault, assault and unlawful imprisonment. Before and after: Edwin Mieses Jr suffered a . broken spine, fractured ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve . and now may never walk again . Cruz is charged with reckless driving and unlawful imprisonment, but he has retained an attorney and is fighting the charges . Police . say the bikers swarmed the SUV on a highway and when driver Alexian . Lien bumped a motorcycle whose rider, Christopher Cruz, had apparently . deliberately slowed down, several bikers surrounded the SUV and began to . damage the vehicle. Christopher Cruz, pictured here, could face additional charges, police say . Lien . sped off, plowing into a motorcyclist. Bikers chased the SUV, pulled . Lien from his vehicle and began beating him in front of his wife and . two-year-old daughter, police said. Large portions of the September 29 incident were captured on video and posted online. Three . other bikers, including Robert Sims, 35, and Reginald Chance, 37, both . from Brooklyn, have been charged in the incident. Authorities say Sims . is the man captured on video pulling open the door of Lien's SUV, and . that Chance was seen using his helmet to bash in the vehicle's window. Christopher Cruz, faces charges of unlawful imprisonment, reckless endangerment, reckless driving, endangering the welfare of a child and menacing. Police say Cruz triggered the initial confrontation by slowing down his bike and then going to confront Lien after being bumped. Cruz has denied brake-checking Lien and says he was merely trying to exchange driver information. Lien has not been charged. The biker he ran over, Edwin Meises Jr., suffered two broken legs and spinal injuries that his family says will leave him paralyzed. Lien's wife has said her family was in danger and her husband had no choice but to flee the scene. Busted: Reginald Chance is accused of shaming Mr Lien's window with his helmet before beating him . Chance turned himself into police and was arraigned in Manhattan this weekend . This comes as Cruz says it's his life that's ruined. The . 28-year-old father of two claims he never intended to box in Lien's . Range Rover SUV on New York City's West Side Highway - he was only . changing lanes and looked back to see where his friends are. Cruz . isn't charged with participating in the horrific six-on-one beating . that left Mr Lien hospitalized, but police believe that he was trying to . force him to slow down or stop. He is charged with reckless driving and . false imprisonment. He says the charges and the publicity from the case have ruined him. 'It's turned my life upside down right now,' he told ABC's 'Good Morning America' Monday. He also denied that he was driving recklessly. Charged: Robert Sims in court after he was . arrested and charged with Attempted Gang Assault 1 and 2 and Criminal . Possession of a Weapon against a Alexian Lien and his family on . September 29, 2013 in New York City . 'I had no intentions to slow him down . or to cause any type of problem,' Cruz said. 'I didn't think I was . doing anything wrong by just cutting into another lane.' Video from a fellow rider's helmet cam shows Cruz looking back as he changes lanes inches in front of the SUV. Lien then struck Cruz's motorcycle. After the collision, Mr Lien then panicked and plowed through the crowd of bikers that stopped around him. Mr Lien called 911 and attempted to flee the bikers, but they chased after him. When he exited the highway and had to stop for traffic, several furious bikers attacked the SUV, pulled Mr Lien and brutally pummeled him - including stomping on his head. Towed away: The car was brought to the NYPD's 33 precinct on Friday . Scary: The Liens said they feared for their lives during the shocking mob attack . But Cruz says he has no guilt about the incident, which all started with the crash he is accused of causing. 'I don't feel responsible,' he said. 'But I do feel bad for the family that go hurt.' The New York Post reported this weekend that detectives believe up to six bikers participated in the savage beatdown of Mr Lien. Kevin .

Her conduct in the months since her rescue from the family friend who kidnapped her and allegedly murdered her mother and brother has been the subject of intense scrutiny. Now, MailOnline can reveal, members of Hannah Anderson’s own family are confused by the 16-year-old’s behaviour in the aftermath of the brutal double murder and her kidnap, with one branding it, ‘downright disturbing.’ Jennifer Willis, Hannah’s great-aunt, has broken her silence in a soon to be published book, ‘The River of No Return: On the Trail of Hannah Anderson and Jim DiMaggio.’ Face of grief? The very day she appeared on the Today show Hannah posted these pictures of herself and friend Alan McNabb joking around in her New York hotel room . The teenager has regularly posted to her public Instagram account in the wake of her mother and brother's tragic deaths. She added this picture on her way to do a Today Show interview . Speaking to author and criminal profiler, Chelsea Hoffman, Mrs Willis admitted: ‘We haven’t seen her grieve at all. ‘It’s not the Hannah we know. It’s downright disturbing.’ Mrs . Willis was so close to her niece Christina that the women were, she . said, ‘more like sisters.’  Revealing her own profound pain in the . aftermath of Christina and Ethan’s killings she said: ‘I can hardly . breathe most of the time.’ A victim in every sense of the word: Hannah and her father, Brett, as she is interviewed by the Today Show's Savannah Guthrie. Investigators are adamant that Hannah is a victim in every way .

She and several other relatives admitted to being deeply troubled by Hannah’s apparent lack of grief and string of outlandish, often sexually precocious, postings on social media, according to Hoffman. On the day of her mother and brother’s funeral she tweeted pictures of herself and a friend, fingers posed like guns, with the hastag ‘true-thugs’. Doubts: Jennifer Willis, pictured left after hearing Hannah was safe, has expressed her concern over the teenager's behavior . Sexually precocious: Hannah posted this picture of her shirtless boyfriend making her breakfast after boasting that her grandmother, with whom she lives, allows him to sleepover with her . And the very day that the teenager spoke fully for the first time, reliving the ordeal of being forced to play Russian Roulette while hearing her brother crying from another room - on the Today show, she posted images of herself with a male friend, pouting, giggling and ‘twerking’ her New York hotel room. While Hannah was there, she excitedly posted pictures on her Instagram account, including several close-ups of Miley Cyrus' live performance. Two days ago she boasted online that her grandmother, with whom Hannah now lives, allowed her boyfriend to sleep over and pictured him shirtless and making her scrambled eggs for breakfast. A family at odds with itself: Her father has asked for privacy to allow Hannah to process the trauma of her ordeal but just last week his daughter was tweeting about family difficulties. Speaking to MailOnline Miss Hoffman, 29, said: ‘It is very clear from the family members I’ve spoken with that this is not a family united in their shared grief at all. It’s sad but it’s a family very much at odds with itself.’ Only last week Hannah tweeted: ‘My family still can’t get along. Wtf?!’ According to Mrs Willis there were often tensions between Christina’s side of the family and that of Hannah’s father, Brett. But in a poignant admission she revealed that Christina, who was estranged from her husband, at the time of her death, had harbored hopes of a reconciliation and of ‘having her family back together again.’ Instead all hopes ended in a scene of utter devastation. In the weeks before her brutal murder Christina Anderson, pictured here with son Ethan, Hannah and estranged husband, Brett, had harbored hopes of reconciling and of having her family back together . In her book Miss Hoffman examines Hannah’s own account of the events that lead up to that day and its aftermath and the book points to what Miss Hoffman considers to be a myriad of inconsistencies and unanswered questions by which some of Hannah’s own relatives admit to being troubled. The burned bodies of Christina Anderson, 44, Ethan, 8, and the family dog were found by fire-fighters in the charred remains of family friend Jim DiMaggio’s burned out home in Boulevard, California on 4 August. In the weeks before her murder Christina habored hopes of 'having her family back together again.' Christina’s mouth and neck was wrapped tightly with duct tape and her ankles bound with plastic cable. She had been viciously bludgeoned to death. Investigators were not able to determine Ethan’s cause of death as his body was almost completely consumed by fire. But what little remained suggested extreme suffering and violence. The grim discoveries marked the beginning of a massive FBI manhunt as it quickly transpired that DiMaggio, believed to have time devices to ignite at his home, had abducted Hannah. Seven days later DiMaggio and Hannah were traced to a riverside in a stretch of Idaho wilderness called No Return when four horseback riders who had encountered them on the trail returned and raised the alarm. The world in her hands: Jim DiMaggio took this picture of Hannah on one of their trips. Weird crush: Jim DiMaggio and Hannah who later claimed that she felt uncomfortable with the 40-year-old family friend after he admitted to having a 'family crush' on her . #hardnight#misshim: Hannah posted this image of herself with her little brother expressing her grief and simply stating 'It's not the same and it never will be.' DiMaggio was gunned down by six snipers in the rescue that followed. By then a disturbing portrait had emerged of the family friend, as a 40-year-old man with inappropriate sexual feelings for the teenage Hannah. DiMaggio was Hannah’s father, Brett’s, best friend and had known the teen all her life. According to Hannah in the weeks before her abduction, DiMaggio had admitted to having a ‘crush’ on her. Hitting back: Many of Hannah's online posts have appeared to speak directly to her many critics and those who have questioned her . The public instinct was to embrace Hannah as a teenager who had survived an unimaginable trauma only to be told that the mother and brother she thought were waiting for her, were dead. But as investigators worked to establish the nature of Hannah’s relationship with her abductor troubling details began to emerge which sparked a change in public opinion. Authorities have been adamant in their assertion that Hannah is ‘a victim in every sense of the word.' But many have struggled to square the teenager’s online persona and postings with this tag. Hannah and DiMaggio exchanged 13 phonecalls on the day of the killings before both phones were switched off simultaneously. In addition to this officers executing a search warrant at DiMaggio’s home found letters written from the teenager to DiMaggio in which she shared grievances about her mother with whom she was not getting along. The moving leg-brace: Hannah initially tried to claim that these pictures were taken on different days before ultimately explaining the switching brace by saying the left leg was injured in Idaho, the right one was the result of an old sports injury . True thugs: Many were surprised by Hannah's decision to post this image of her posing with a friend on the day of her brother and mother's funerals . It was revealed that the pair took . trips together. One eye-brow raising tweet posted just weeks before the . abduction, showed Hannah on one such trip. The picture, taken from . behind, shows Hannah in cut-off denim shorts. It . was taken by DiMaggio and was tagged by Hannah ‘when you got the world . in your hands nobody can stop you …#bye #Hollywood #bye #Malibu #hello . #river’ The hardest day of her life: Hannah posted this image on 11 October, the day her little brother Ethan would have turned 9 . A public expression of private grief: Hannah regularly posts pictures of Christina and Ethan saying how much she misses them . Baby cakes: Investigators were unable to determine the cause of Ethan's death as his body was all but destroyed in the blaze that tore through DiMaggio's house in California . In relating how it was that DiMaggio . overpowered her Hannah has said that he gave her a pill she now believes . to be Ambien.  She has said she was unconscious from that moment until . waking in Idaho and has no recollection of even being put in his car. Criminal profiler Chelsea Hoffman's book exploring the Hannah Anderson case is published on 2 November . But video released from security . checkpoints on the route shows Hannah, apparently wide awake and seated . in the passenger seat next to DiMaggio, according to Hoffman. The author also focusses on how Hannah has claimed that she . hurt her left knee during days of gruelling hiking through inhospitable . terrain, during which she carried two 50lbs backpacks for DiMaggio and . tweeted pictures showing her heavily strapped leg. Pictures taken later the same day show the leg brace on her right leg. When online commentators picked up on the strange switch Hannah initially claimed the pictures were taken on different days. When it emerged that they were taken on the same day she retorted that one knee had been injured in Idaho and the other had arthritis due to an old sporting injury. Miss Hoffman said: ‘There are so many unanswered questions in this case that it’s my sincere hope it is reopened. What happened was so shocking and what’s come after it is just very sad. ‘Hannah is letting off steam through social media and has cut herself off from some of the people who care for her and who are going through their own profound grief. ‘Jennifer is one of them. She sees the way Hannah is behaving and she just doesn’t understand what’s going on – this Hannah is not the little girl she helped raise.'

Schoolgirls are being investigated by police following the suicide of a 12-year-old girl who suffered relentless cyber-bullying, authorities said today. Rebecca Ann Sedwick leaped to her death from a cement silo at an abandoned factory a mile from her home in Lakeland, Florida. Her body was discovered at 6.45am on Tuesday morning after her mother reported that her daughter had not returned from school on Monday evening. Polk County sheriff Grady Judd said on Thursday that law enforcement and the school district were not to blame, adding that he planned to press charges against the bullies if enough evidence is found. Scroll Down for Video . Devastated: Rebecca Ann Sedwick, 12, (pictured with her mother Tricia Norman) is believed to have leaped to her death from an abandoned cement silo in Florida after being relentlessly bullied by girls online . Judd told the Orlando Sentinel: 'Girls can get pretty catty as kids. The system cannot manage all that cattiness … I truly . believe the school system tried but we don't live in a perfect world.' Detectives are now looking at 15 girls . who may have been involved and the sheriff said today that if there is . enough evidence to prove that the law has been broken, he will recommend that . they be charged. A vigil was held for 12-year-old Rebecca at the abandoned factory where she took her own life on Wednesday night. Following her suicide, Rebecca's family found online bullying directed at her just four days before, according to 10 News. The family believed that the bullying had stopped after the 12-year-old was moved school. Rebecca's mother Tricia Norman told the Lakeland Ledger that . girls had bullied her daughter viciously online at Crystal Lake . Elementary School last year, bombarding her with messages on her cellphone such as: 'You're ugly'; 'Why are you still alive?' and 'Go kill . yourself'. At one point the 12-year-old was physically attacked in school. Ms Norman pulled her daughter out of Crystal Lake and moved her to Lawton Childs Middle . Academy. Remorseless: This is believed to be the Ask.Fm page of Rebecca Ann Sedwick - showing some examples of the abuse she suffered . Despite being moved school and shutting down her Facebook account, the remorseless bullying carried on online through other sites and services. The girl's devastated mother said that a group of . five or six girls at Crystal Lake who bullied her on Facebook continued . to torment the 12-year-old even after she had left. The mother was so incensed by the bullying at Crystal Lake that she filed two complaints to the school. 'She has been bullied before and people had told her she needed to kill herself,' Sedwick’s sister, Summer Howard, said to The Ledger. 'But we all thought she was fine now. No one had known.' Tragically, Ms Norman said that she was . never informed that her daughter did not show up for class on Monday . morning because of a problem with Lawton Chiles Middle Academy's . automated system. Lonely death: Rebecca Ann Sedwick's body was discovered at the base of this cement silo just a mile from her home . Deputies discovered her body at around 2.25am on Tuesday on the ground at a former Cemex cement site. Summer Howard said she told deputies that her sister had snuck into the site, around half a mile from their home, before and used to climb on the cement silos. Police forensic officers were seen on Tuesday afternoon at the top of one of the cement silos dusting for fingerprints. 'I don’t know what I’m doing,' Norman said to The Ledger. 'I don’t know what I’m supposed to do next. I just lost my world. 'My life is just never going to be the same, I’m missing a big part of it, a huge part of it.' The Polk Country Sheriff's Office . revealed that Sedwick had been caught cutting herself and making . comments about wanting to hurt herself before Monday, but Norman said . she didn't know the cyber-bullying had resumed. Bullied: Rebecca was withdrawn from her elementary school for home-schooling in the aftermath of he cyberbullying being uncovered and her mother Tricia (right) said that she believes it to be a warning to all parents to be vigilant . Norman said that the bullying at Crystal Lake became so bad earlier this year that her daughter was hospitalized with self-inflicted cuts on her arms and legs. 'When she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, how she was stupid,' Norman said. 'And I said, ''Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.''' However, once police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm. 'People just need to stop bullying, period,' Howard said. 'You never know whose life you’re affecting.' An autopsy was completed on Tuesday but results are pending toxicology results, the Sheriff’s Office said.

When the helicopter didn't respond . during a routine 10-minute check-in around 6.20am, authorities began . searching by air and ground. They found the burning wreckage in a wooded . area of Somerville, about 45 miles east of Memphis. The helicopter crashed and burned in Tennessee as the aircraft was headed to pick up an ailing child (crash site in Fayette County, TN, pictured) 'This was a very experienced pilot . and a very experienced crew and a great helicopter, so we're all anxious . to know what happened,' Armour said. She estimated that the aircraft was about a half hour into the flight when it went down. Fayette County Sheriff's Office Inspector Ray Garcia spoke by phone from the scene on Tuesday afternoon. 'There . not very much left of (the helicopter), and what little there is is . badly burned,' he said. 'It's just basically debris at this point.' Barlow worked as a nurse in West .

"By . Tim Shipman . PUBLISHED: . 16:35 EST, 22 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:17 EST, 22 October 2013 . Tax breaks for married couples should be more generous and be introduced well before the general election, says Lord Lawson. Margaret Thatcher’s Chancellor endorses the principle of David Cameron’s plan for transferable tax allowances worth up to £200 a year. But he says the tax break should be extended and must come into effect earlier than the start date announced by the Government, which is April 2015 – just one month before the election – to avoid the risk of it being rolled back by Labour. Lord Lawson has said marriage tax breaks should be more generous and be introduced earlier than David Cameron has previously announced . The Prime Minister last month announced plans that would allow a husband or wife to transfer £1,000 of their tax-free personal allowance to their spouse. It would apply if couples are both basic rate taxpayers with one spouse earning less than the allowance. Gay couples in civil partnerships would also be eligible. Around four million people are expected to benefit but Lord Lawson says it should be more generous. More than a million married couples will gain only £1.35 a week from David Cameron’s tax break – a third of the amount promised. The Prime Minister said ‘most’ couples eligible under the scheme would gain £200 a year but a report by economists says many are likely to pick up only £70 extra, including most of those with children. From April 2015, married couples and civil partners who are not higher rate taxpayers can transfer £1,000 of their tax-free allowance to their spouse or partner. However, the Resolution Foundation think tank says the tax break will be undermined by Universal Credit. Devised by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, it will come into force in 2017 and replace some benefits paid to working couples. Unlike current benefits, it will be based on family income after tax. As a result, much of the money that couples gain through the tax break will be lost due to reduced Universal Credit payments. The report says 2.7million working couples will benefit from the new allowance, but 1.1million will get only £1.35 after benefits have been reduced. Around 900,000 of those will have children. Only 600,000 couples with children will get the full £3.85. ‘It’s understandable that it is only introduced at the level which has been proposed at the present time,’ he said last night. ‘But once it’s up and running that gives us the opportunity to ask for it to be increased subsequently.’He also said that it should be introduced earlier, otherwise it would be easier for Labour to reverse the measure if they won the election in 2015. ‘I’m sure it will be in the next Finance Bill but the question is over the start date,’ said Lord Lawson. ‘I think it should be up and running during the lifetime of this Parliament. It makes it easier to reverse it if it’s not up and running because you’re not taking anything away from people that they already have.’ Some Tories have called for the tax break to be extended to all married couples and for the £1,000 transferable allowance to be increased. Lord Lawson will speak today at the publication of a report entitled ‘Independent Taxation – 25 years on, Does it meet today’s needs?’ In 1988 he was the first Chancellor to give married women an individual tax status. He proposed transferable allowances between married couples but his were plans were not implemented. The report was sponsored by the Christian charity CARE and concludes that the benefits of independent taxation have been undermined by the failure to include transferable allowances. Lord Lawson describes such allowances as ‘family-friendly’. He says they also a more cost-effective means of reducing the tax burden on low-income households than across-the-board increases in personal allowances. In today’s speech he is expected to criticise Nick Clegg for delaying the measure because he does not support the plans. ‘I think it’s well known that they have been foot-dragging, for reasons which I think are wholly without merit,’ he says. A Downing Street spokesman said the Prime Minister’s plans show that the Government ‘values commitment’.","Lord Lawson believes tax breaks for married couples should be more generous .

"By . Becky Barrow and Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 06:47 EST, 23 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:19 EST, 23 October 2013 . Petrol prices are predicted to soar by up to 10p a litre if a huge British oil refinery closes after its petrochemical division was put into liquidation. Production at the refinery in Grangemouth in central Scotland has been suspended for over a week because of a strike threat by militant trade union Unite. In a dramatic move today, owner Ineos closed the petrochemical side of the plant – with the loss of 800 jobs – threatening the refinery’s future and a further 570 jobs. Desperate: Staff stage a protest at Grangemouth in a last ditch attempt to save the refinery . 'Sad day': Workers walk through the Grangemouth oil refinery in Falkirk, Scotland, following a meeting where owners Ineos have decided to shut down the petrochemical side of the complex . Ian Fyfe, Ineos human resources director, admitted: ‘The petrochemicals plant going into liquidation cannot be good news for the refinery.’ The strike threat at the refinery was scrapped but Ineos kept the plant closed, insisting that workers accept a three-year pay freeze, cuts to overtime pay and an end to their gold-plated final salary pension scheme. It is understood the refinery could close permanently as early as December, after a 45-day consultation period for staff to accept new contracts. The Swiss-based firm – run by billionaire Jim Ratcliffe – is insisting workers also accept a no-strike deal. Unite has said workers will agree to this but Ineos claims there are too many strings attached to their offer. Grangemouth supplies 13 per cent of the fuel used by the whole of Britain and 85 per cent of fuel in Scotland, where it is the sole refinery. If it closed, an AA spokesman said: ‘It could add between 8p and 10p on to a litre of petrol.’ The average price of a litre of petrol is currently £1.32. The number of refineries in Britain has fallen to seven from 22 in 1973. BP was yesterday holding crisis talks about a potential closure because the huge Forties pipeline – which carries oil from more than 50 North Sea fields – is powered by steam from the Grangemouth site. Workers: Grangemouth workers walk from a staff meeting where management informed the workforce that the Grangemouth plant is to be closed . Dispute: Some 800 people will be out of work . Decision: The owners of the plant, Ineos, said the site is being shut down because it is losing £10m a month . The industrial dispute at the refinery began when employee Stephen Deans was suspected of conducting Labour Party business on company time. Mr Deans, who has worked for the company for 24 years, is chairman of the Labour Party in nearby Falkirk and is a shop steward with Unite. He was suspended and the union balloted for a walkout. He was reinstated and Unite withdrew the strike threat, but Ineos had already decided to suspend production at the plant. Leaving: Owners of the plant say it is losing £10million a month. Ineos said it would reopen the site if the union agreed not to strike . Upset: Calum Maclean, Grangemouth Petrochemicals chairman, said 'we have tried our hardest to convince employees of the need for change' Mr Maclean said: 'The workers were offered sizeable pay cuts as well as a substantial reduction in pension and holiday allowance, but employees refused to give into the demands' Last night, Energy Minister Ed Davey insisted that he would ‘not leave any stone unturned to try to get to a resolution in this matter’. Michael Moore, who lost his job as Scottish secretary in the recent . Cabinet reshuffle, said closure would be an ‘act of industrial vandalism’. Ineos said it had ‘no option’ but to close the petrochemical division because it was losing £50million a year. Last night, Unite launched an 11th-hour attempt to save the petrochemical plant. However, Calum MacLean, chairman of Grangemouth Petrochemicals, said: ‘I was given a very clear message by the shareholders that this was a final decision. I will take back any proposals the union give us and give them to Jim Ratcliffe.’","AA says closure reflects concerns in the refining industry .

They line up against a film about an elderly man who tried to dig a tunnel from Cumbria to Africa and a series of large scale portraits of fictional figures as the strange mix of artworks by the shortlisted artists were unveiled in an exhibition to showcase their expertise. The exhibition, which has travelled outside England for the first time, is being staged on the site of a former military barracks in Londonderry, Northern Ireland. Naked ambition: Turner Prize nominee David Shrigley with his piece entitled 'Life Model' at the Turner Prize exhibition in Londonderry . Housed inside a newly converted soldiers' dormitory once hidden behind miles of bullet proof corrugated iron and barbed wire, the Ebrington show will run until January 5. Penelope Curtis, director of Tate Britain, said: 'We are delighted to be staging Turner Prize 2013 at Derry/Londonderry. This year's shortlist showcases artists whose work spans live encounters, film, sculpture, drawing and painting. 'Visitors to the exhibition at Ebrington will gain a good sense of the diversity of British art.

The winner will be announced at an awards ceremony in Derry on December 2. Among the best known artists in the running for the £25,000 prize money is Berlin-based Tino Sehgal, 37, whose work This Is Exchange consists of live 'encounters' between interpreters dressed in black T-shirts and the audience. There are no actual objects or displays on show. Visitors enter the white gallery and can earn £2 if they choose to engage in a meaningful conversation about the market economy. 'They can't just say it's good or awful, they have to give their opinion and discuss it a bit. I will then give them a password and they can pick up £2 from the reception,' said Derry born interpreter known only as, Conor. Sehgal's nomination is the first time a live, partially structured exhibition has been included in the Turner Prize shortlist. The bookmaker's favourite to win is Glasgow-based artist David Shrigley whose piece Life Model features a larger than life naked male robot. Show-goers are encouraged to take part by drawing the model and their efforts are displayed around the gallery. Mr Shrigley said: 'The drawings are part of the artwork. The idea is that people can take a bit of the artwork away. I hope they enjoy trying to figure out what it's about. 'All the drawings seem to have merit regardless of whether they are really objectively well rendered or whether they are crude and quite primitive or sarcastic.' Life Model was shown in Manchester last year. He added: 'It's interesting because most people seem to have signed their drawing rather conspicuously. That didn't happen when I showed it in Manchester.' Easels stand in an exhibition space for members of the public to draw David Shrigley's 'Life Model' Installation: London-based Laure Prouvost is also vying for the award.

Vivian Vosburg, 30, of Lakeland, FL., was arrested after a video of her punching two fighting children and screaming profanities allegedly emerged on Facebook. Ms Vosburg is the stepmother of 14-year-old cyber-bullying suspect Guadalupe Shaw. Shaw and Katelyn Roman, 12, have been accused by officials of cyber-bullying Rebecca Sedwick, 12, to the point she committed suicide by jumping from a tower at a concrete plant. Scroll down for video . Mother of the year: Vivian Vosburg, mother of accused cyber-bullier Guadalupe Shaw, is brought in to the Polk County Jail Booking area after being arrested for punching two fighting juveniles . Accused: Katelyn Roman, 12, left, and Guadalupe Shaw, 14, right, were arrested and charged with aggravated stalking in connection with the death of Rebecca Sedwick . Booked: Ms Vosburg is currently sitting in Polk County Jail . Bedlam: These two stills from the video showing the fight depict a chaotic scene . 'The video was of two juvenile subjects fighting, an adult female punching the fighting juveniles and screaming profanities,' said an affidavit from the Polk County Sheriff's Office. There were 'several other juveniles shouting profanities and moving around in what appears to be a bedroom of a residence.' Six minors between the ages of nine and 14-years-old were also seen in the video, the affidavit said. Ms Vosburg has access to all of the children seen in the video, the affidavit continued. The children fighting in the video are two boys, but several other children are watching the fight. The video was posted to Facebook in July and was visible as recently as Friday morning, the affidavit noted. 'It is clear, not only has Vosburg demonstrated she cannot control the behavior of children she has access to without using violence, but she is obviously not monitoring the social media sites of children she has access to either,' said Sheriff Grady Judd. Ms Vosburg has claimed in media interviews that Ms Shaw is her daughter, but she is apparently the teen's stepmother. 'She says she is the mother, but we are finding out the relationship is different,' Polk County spokesperson Donna Wood told MailOnline. It is not clear where the troubled teens biological mother is, nor is it known how long Ms Vosburg has been with the girl's father. Ms Vosburg's daughter was arrested for cyber-stalking after allegedly posting a heartless Facebook post mocking the dead girl's suicide leap. 'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***],' Ms Shaw allegedly posted . Rebecca was 'terrorized' by . as many as 15 girls who ganged up on her and picked on her for months . through online message boards and texts. She jumped to her death from a tower at an abandoned concrete plant on September 10. Judd said they decided to arrest Shaw after she posted the message on Saturday. 'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' he said. Roman was Rebecca's former best friend, but Judd said the . 14-year-old turned her against Rebecca. Other girls also stopped . being friends with her in fear of being bullied, the sheriff said. Missed: Rebecca Sedwick took her own life after being relentlessly bullied . 'Several students corroborated stories of both girls bullying Sedwick on . different occasions, through name-calling, intimidation, threats to beat . her up, and at least one actual physical fight,' the sheriff said today. He warned parents in a news conference today: 'Watch what your children do online. Pay attention to what your kids are doing. Quit being their best friend and be their best parent.' Roman and Shaw were . arrested on Monday night and detained at the county's juvenile center . before being released to their parents, the Orlando Sentinel reports. They were charged with felony aggravated stalking. It is believed the bullying started when Shaw started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend. Witnesses told investigators she sent messages to Rebecca, calling her ugly, telling her to 'drink bleach and die', and encouraging her to kill herself. Sedwick's computer searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked questions like, 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' . One of the Florida girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track. She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.' Devastated: Rebecca Ann Sedwick, 12, pictured with her mother Tricia Norman, is believed to have jumped from an abandoned cement silo . Tragic loss: Rebecca with her sister Amy . Aftermath: Rebecca's sister Summer (left) and a friend sign a poster after her death. Two people have now been arrested in connection with the bullying . Polk County Sheriff Judd said Rebecca had been 'absolutely terrorized' by the other girls. 'We can see from what we've been investigating so far that Rebecca wasn't attacking back,' Judd said. 'She . appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. And quite frankly, the entire investigation is exceptionally . disturbing.' Even when her mother took Rebecca out of school, the bullying was carried out online. The bullying started . over a boy last year at Crystal Lake Middle School and at one point she . was suspended for fighting with another student - believed to be Roman. Last December, . Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her wrists because . of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff. 'When . she was being bullied at Crystal Lake Middle, she used to come home . every day and tell me how she wasn’t worth anything, that she was ugly, . how she was stupid,' her mother Tricia Norman said after her death. 'And . I said, ''Baby what on earth would make you think that? You’re the most . beautiful person I know and the smartest person I know.''' Bullied: Rebecca was withdrawn from her . elementary school after being bullied and was home schooled by her mother Tricia (right) who says her daughter's death should be a warning to all parents to be vigilant . Tributes: Flowers, candles and messages are left out in memory of 12-year-old Rebecca . Later, after Rebecca . complained that she had been pushed in the hallway and that another girl . wanted to fight her, Rebecca's mother began home-schooling her, Judd . said. This fall, Rebecca . started at a new school, Lawton Chiles Middle Academy, and loved it, . Judd said. But the bullying continued online. 'She put on a perfect, happy face. She never told me,' Tricia Norman told the Lakeland Ledger. 'I never had a clue. I mean, she told me last year when she was being bullied, but not this year, and I have no idea why.' Once . police checked her cell phone they discovered that the bullying had not . stopped, especially on Kik Messenger, Instagram and Ask.fm. 'They would tell her she's ugly, stupid, nobody liked her go kill herself,"" Ms Norman said. She has started a Facebook page to try to fight back against online bullies, called Rebecca Sedwick Against Bullying. Ms Norman told 10 News she was inspired to start it after reading her daughter's journal. In . it, Rebecca had written: 'Every day more and more kids kill themselves . because of bullying. How many lives have to be lost until people realize . words do matter?' Ms Norman . wants online bullies to face harsher consequences, and begged other . young victims to stay strong and seek help, adding: 'Don't ever give up, . like Becca did.'","Vivian Vosburg, 30, the stepmother of Guadalupe Shaw, 14, has been arrested for child abuse .

There were fears that an eagerly anticipated comet thought to be 15 times brighter than the moon had broken up, leaving skywatchers who had hoped to spot it from Earth disappointed. But a new Hubble Telescope photo has confirmed that the fragile icy ball appears to be intact and is on track to visit our inner solar system from November . to January. It is hoped that Comet ISON, which is making a precarious path around the sun, will put on a spectacular show for people who live in the Northern hemisphere. A colour composite image of Comet ISON confirms the eagerly-anticipated icy ball's nucleus is still intact. It was taken by Nasa's Hubble Telescope on October 9 when the comet was inside Mars' orbit and about 177 million miles from Earth. The comet's coma appears a greenish-blue colour due to gas. The tail forms as dust particles are pushed away from the nucleus by the pressure of sunlight . The eagerly anticipated comet could be 15 times brighter than the moon, with a massive tail, making it visible even in broad daylight. A new image of the sun-bound Comet shows that it is still in one piece, despite fears from experts that its icy nucleus might disintegrate as the sun warms it. Some astronomers had predicted that Comet ISON could break apart before November 28 when it is predicted to travel just 730,000 miles from the surface of the sun. In July, experts had claimed that ISON was fizzling out and astronomer Ignacio Ferrin, of the University of Antioquia in Colombia, said: 'The future of comet ISON does not look bright, . But Nasa's Hubble Space Telescope has taken the image that will make sky watchers hopeful for a sighting of a lifetime, as ISON has been decribed as the 'comet of the century'. In July, the ISON was pictured on the opposite side of the Sun at around 378 million miles away from Earth, travelling at over 50,000 miles per hour . While the image, taken on October 9, . cannot pick out the comet's solid nucleus, astronomers said the . telescope would most likely have discovered evidence of fragments if the . comet had disintegrated. Experts from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, which operates the telescope, also said the 'head' surrounding the nucleus is 'symmetric and smooth'. 'This would probably not be the case if clusters of smaller fragments were flying along. What's more, a polar jet of dust first seen in Hubble images taken in April is no longer visible and may have turned off,' they wrote in a statement. The most recent image from the Hubble Telescope was taken within the orbit of Mars, around 177 million miles from Earth, they said. The comet will pass closest to the . sun on November 28 and is predicted to make its closest approach to . Earth on December 26 at a distance of 39.9 million miles. There . is still a chance the comet will not survive its journey close to the . sun, but if it does, Astronomers could learn a lot about the comet's . composition by observing which gases boil off it as it nears the sun. It could reach temperatures . of about 4,900 degrees Fahrenheit (2,700 degrees Celsius) which is hot . enough to melt lead and runs the risk of being pulled apart by the sun's . gravity. Comet ISON is roughly heading towards the centre of our Solar System. It will pass within one million miles of the Sun's surface on 28th November. At the time of discovery in September 2012, ISON was over 584 million miles from the Sun . Some . scientists are optimistic the comet will survive as its nucleus is . estimated to be up to 1.2 miles across and therefore big enough to . weather the sun's heat. Other . researchers are also hopeful that we will be able to see the comet from . Earth if it has standard density and spin charcteristics. According to NBC News, . sky watchers have organised a global ISON observation campaign so that a . number of Earth-based telescopes can keep an eye on the comet's . progress. Images of Comet ISON obtained using the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph at Gemini North on February 4, March 4, April 3, and May 4, 2013 (left to right, respectively) If comet ISON survives the encounter, it . could take thousands - potentially millions - of years before the comet . passes back through the inner solar system. The comet, named ISON after the International Scientific Optical Network that made its discovery, was found in September 2012 by two amateur Russian astronomers. Scientists . believe the comet hails from the Oort Cloud, a cluster of icy rocks . that circle the sun about 50,000 times farther away than Earth's orbit. Spotted in space: Two astronomers from Russia discovered the icy ball, pictured here dimly lit against background stars . Comet ISON is roughly heading towards the centre of our Solar System. It will pass within one million miles of the Sun’s surface on 28th November. At the time of discovery in September 2012, ISON was over 584 million miles from the Sun. Its average speed throughout July was 55,405mph. It will continue to accelerate steadily until November when it will whip around our Sun at an astonishing 425,000mph. Early data analysis suggests Comet ISON’s size to be around three miles in diameter. If . ISON doesn’t fizzle out, you can expect to see the comet without specilaist equipment anywhere between the middle of November until the middle of . January 2014.","There were fears that Comet ISON, which promised to be visible from Earth in broad daylight later this year, had fizzled out .

Tragedy: Laurence Gunn, 32, died after being 'hurled' into the air when he was hit by Mohammed Rashid's Ford Focus in Hampstead Heath, north London . A journalist was mowed down and fatally injured on a pedestrian crossing by a short-sighted motorist who wasn’t wearing his glasses, a court heard. Laurence Gunn, 32, died after being ‘hurled’ into the air when he was struck by 23-year-old Mohammed Rashid’s Ford Focus in Hampstead Heath, north London, as he and a friend walked their dogs, the court was told. Mr Gunn, from Maida Vale, north west London, landed on the other side of the road and was knocked unconscious. He was taken to hospital, but died the next day from head injuries. Rashid was unable to read a . registration plate 25 feet away when police asked him to do so after the . fatal collision, the court heard. Mr . Gunn, originally from Essex, had spent the day with his friend Marsha . Peterson drinking in two pubs in Hampstead, between walking their dogs . on the Heath, Blackfriars Crown Court was told. He was hit as the pair headed for Hampstead Heath station along East Heath Road at around 7pm that evening. When questioned by police at the scene, Rashid said he had not worn his glasses in over a year and didn’t know where they were. PC Mark Apan, who questioned Rashid at . the scene, said: 'Mr Rashid told me ‘I saw a guy hit my windscreen and . tried to swerve to the right and tried to brake. 'My . windscreen then shattered and I stopped my car and ran and called 999. My headlights were on but I still couldn’t see him because it was . dark’.' PC Apan then asked Rashid if he wears glasses, to which he replied: 'Yes, I wear glasses. I was meant to be wearing them today. 'I haven’t worn the glasses for about one year and have not had an eye test for two years. I am meant to wear glasses, but I don’t know where they are.' Officers . then gave Rashid a ‘not particularly scientific’ eye test at the scene, . but he could only read the license plate on the car just 7ft away. His name also flashed up on a police database search as someone who should wear glasses when driving, the jury were told. PC . Apan said: 'We walked up to 25ft away from the police vehicle and I . asked him to tell me at what point he could see the licence plate. He got 6/7ft away before making out the number plate.' Rashid was not over the speed limit and had not been drinking, the court heard. Mr Gunn had spent the day with his friend Marsha Peterson drinking in two pubs in Hampstead, between walking their dogs on the Heath, pictured. He was struck as they walked home . Richard Scott, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Gunn and Ms Peterson met at Hampstead Heath train station at around 1pm. They had known each other for a few months, having first met walking their dogs on the Heath. 'They started off their walk around the Heath and after a few hours stopped in a pub. Mr Gunn had a couple of glasses of wine and Ms Peterson had a pint of beer and a glass of wine. 'Afterwards they continued there walk around Hampstead Heath before stopping again at another pub. They spent the next hour or so whiling away the evening, drinking two glasses of wine each before deciding to make there way back to Hampstead Heath train station. 'Ms Peterson was behind Mr Gunn and, as he and his dog Misty get halfway across the pedestrian crossing, he is struck by Mr Rashid. 'He was hurled into the air and landed on the other side of the road. He was knocked unconscious.Mr Rashid did not stop immediately, but carried on down the road before putting his hazard lights on and stopping. 'Ms Anderson noted that while Mr Rashid was not travelling with excessive speed he didn’t make any effort to slow down at the crossing.' He added: 'It was dark that evening, but this was a brightly lit road with a clearly marked pedestrian crossing. Mr Rashid was not travelling at excessive speed, but you may argue that would be even more reason for him to have stopped in time to avoid hitting Mr Gunn. But he didn’t.' Police gave Rashid a ‘rudimentary’ eye test at the scene, the court heard. Mr Scott added: 'From 25 feet away he could not read the number plate of a police car. 'The defendant was seen squinting to read the number plate. It was only when he got to seven feet away that he found that he could read the number plate. 'He was asked by the police office ‘why weren’t you wearing your glasses?’ To which he replied ‘I have not been wearing my glasses for over a year. I am meant to wear glasses, but I don’t know where they are.’ Mr Gunn was a fitness fanatic who wrote a healthy living blog, and worked as sub-editior for Incisive Media, publishers of a range of leading industry magazines. Rashid, of Kensal Rise, north west London, denies one count of causing death by dangerous driving. The trial continues.

Mulligan and co-stars Tom Sturridge and Michael Sheen are filming the adaptation of the Thomas Hardy classic in the Dorset town. Shops outside the abbey have been given a period makeover and some areas have been cordoned off to the public for filming. One guard, a 59-year-old man from Devizes, Wiltshire, suffered bruising and cuts to his body and was taken to Yeovil Hospital for treatment. Mulligan plays Bathsheba Everdene in the adaptation of the Thomas Hardy classic . The second guard, a 47-year-old man from Lewes, East Sussex, suffered swelling to his face and body in the attack at about 1am on Sunday. Detective Constable Gerald Marchant said: 'This was an unprovoked attack that left both men requiring treatment.' It is thought the five men broke onto the set after leaving a local pub, the Evening Standard reported. Hours before the attack, Mulligan, 28, was pictured in character as Hardy's Bathsheba Everdene - the West Country heiress loved by three men. The actress was seen in period costume and wore a long navy blue coat. Carey revealed earlier this week that she was finding the shooting of the new project 'exhausting', but hugely rewarding. She said: 'I'm getting picked up at 5.30 in the morning tomorrow - to Dorset. I am so tired! 'I am enjoying it so much, it's brilliant. It's outside a lot. 'Seventy per cent of the film is fields, exteriors and outdoorsy things, which is really great but it's cold and really tiring.'

The police should be forced to film every encounter they have with the public to prevent a repeat of the Plebgate scandal, a senior Conservative MP has warned. As three senior officers accused of lying to force Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell out of office prepare to grilled by MPs later, there are fresh warnings about a ‘crisis of ethics’ in the police service. Former shadow home secretary David Davies, a close ally of Mr Mitchell, warned the only way to tackle a ‘decline in public trust’ was to force officers to wear cameras and microphones at all times. Recording: Former shadow home secretary David Davis said police should wear wear body cameras all of the time . Mr Mitchell resigned as the government’s Chief Whip a year ago, just weeks after an altercation at the gates of Downing Street with officers who told him to get off his bike. In particular he faced calls to resign from three senior officers from the Police Federation who are now accused of lying about a ‘clear the air’ meeting with Mr Mitchell, in which he explained what happened during the altercation. Inspector Ken MacKaill, from West Mercia Police, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton from Warwickshire Police and Sergeant Chris Jones from West Midlands Police have been called before the home affairs select committee today. Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May have called on the officers and their constables to issue a full apology to Mr Mitchell, warning the revelations strike at the heart of public trust in the police. Forced to quit: Andrew Mitchell arriving at Downing Street on his bike . Statement: Chris Jones, Stuart Hinton and Ken McKaill, pictured leaving the meeting with Andrew Mitchell, today issued a half-hearted apology for talking to the media . On October 12 last year Andrew Mitchell met three members of the Police Federation to discuss the 'Plebgate' case. A tape recording of the reveals Mr Mitchell going to great lengths to explain what happened in Downing Street. He . said: 'I did not say and I give you my word, I give you my word, I did . not call an officer an f'ing pleb I did not say you are an f'ing moron . and I did not say you should know your f'ing place. 'I would never speak to anyone like that least of all a police officer and you have my word I never said those things.' Later . Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton said to Mr Mitchell: 'I appreciate your candour, and we . appreciate you have gone beyond what you said in, to the media.' But . minutes later outside the meeting, Inspector Ken MacKaill, from West . Mercia Police, accused Mr Mitchell of refusing to give any more detail . of the incident. Mr MacKaill said: 'I think Mr Mitchell has no option but to resign. 'He is continuing to refuse to elaborate on what happened. I think his position is untenable.' Mr Davies today warned the Mitchell case was the ‘latest in a long list of police investigations set up to seek the truth but conducted as clumsy cover-ups’. He suggested that the only way to restore public confidence that officiers uphold truth and the law was to constantly record them. ‘The police put millions of innocent people under surveillance in order to catch a tiny minority of wrongdoers. Perhaps now it is time to make officers wear a camera and microphone while on duty,’ Mr Davies wrote in The Times. ‘When they tried this in California, use of force by police officers dropped by two-thirds in a year. This technology could also help to defend police officers who have vexatious claims made against them.’ Mr Davis' intervention comes as the row between police and politicians shows no sign of being resolved. Mr MacKaill, Mr Hinton and Mr Jones will be questioned at a Home Affairs Select Committee inquiry into the row. As the plebgate row reached fever pitch, Mr Mitchell met the three senior members of the Police Federation. It followed a leaked police log claiming he called officers ‘f***ing plebs’. He has always denied using the word ‘pleb’ but admits swearing at officers who told him he could not ride his bicycle through the main gates of Downing Street on September 19 last year. On October 12, a meeting was set up to ‘clear the air’ between the MP for Sutton Coldfield, and members of his local police forces. Mr Mitchell recorded the meeting, in which he made clear to the officers exactly what he said during the altercation. But Mr MacKaill told journalists after the meeting that the senior Tory was 'continuing to refuse to elaborate on what happened'. Doubts: CCTV footage of the original exchange between Mr Mitchell and police officers at the gates of Downing Street raised questions about the official police log . The Independent Police Complaints Commission last week accused the officers of pursuing a political campaign against Mr Mitchell in protest at government spending cuts, and raised issues of ‘honesty and integrity’. The IPCC said West Mercia Police were wrong to conclude that the three men had no case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct. The three officers this week said they were sorry for . ‘poor judgment’ in addressing TV cameras to call for Mr Mitchell to quit . the Cabinet, despite reassuring him at a private meeting that they . appreciated his explanation of the infamous row at the gates of Downing . Street. However it fell short of the full . apology demanded by Mr Cameron and rejects criticism from the . independent police watchdog which questioned the officers’ ‘honesty and . integrity’. In the joint statement, Mr . MacKaill, Mr Hinton and Mr Jones said: ‘We are making this statement in . response to public concern generated by the widely reported outcome of . West Mercia's investigation into matters arising from the meeting we had . with Andrew Mitchell MP in his constituency on 12th October 2012. ‘The reputation of, and public confidence in, the police service is of immense concern to each of us. ‘We . acknowledge the investigation’s criticism relating to our poor . judgement in talking to the media following the meeting with Andrew . Mitchell, for which we take this opportunity to apologise. ‘We . would like to emphasise (as we did to the investigation) that in no way . did any of us ever plan or intend to mislead anyone about what occurred . during this meeting or otherwise.’","Former shadow home secretary David Davis calls for greater surveillance .

This reconstructed image of Earth is one of the first snapshots transmitted back home by Nasa's Juno spacecraft in the wake of Wednesday's flyby. Juno was due to be flying over South America and the southern Atlantic Ocean . The $1.1 billion spacecraft will use nine instruments to probe deep inside Jupiter and reveal glimpses into the planet's origin. On Wednesday, the solar-powered, windmill-shaped spacecraft slipped into Earth's shadow as planned, but engineers were puzzled when it emerged. At closest approach, it hurtled 350 miles above the ocean off the coast of South Africa. The space agency later learned that Juno had entered safe mode- a state that spacecraft are programmed to go into when they sense there's a problem. The Juno mission will use nine instruments to probe inside Jupiter and reveal glimpses into the planet's origin . This day side raw image of Earth is one of the 1st snapshots transmitted back to us by Juno.

The probe cost $1.1 billion and was launched in 2011. The windmill-shaped spacecraft travels at 78,000 mph. It has nine instruments to investigate Jupiter’s gravity field, magnetic field, and polar magnetosphere. Juno will also search for clues about how Jupiter formed, including whether the planet has a rocky core. It will also study Jupiter's deep winds, which can reach speeds of 384 mph. The spacecraft's name comes from Greco-Roman mythology. The god Jupiter drew a veil of clouds around himself to hide his mischief, but his wife, the goddess Juno, was able to peer through the clouds and see Jupiter's true nature. Nasa said skywatchers with binoculars or a small telescope might have seen it streak across the sky, weather permitting. Ham radio operators around the globe were encouraged to say ‘Hi’ in Morse code - a message that might be detected by Juno's radio. Up until Wednesday, when Juno whipped around Earth in a momentum-gathering flyby, the spacecraft had been performed without problems. Previous missions to the outer solar system have used Earth as a gravity slingshot since there's no rocket powerful enough to make a direct flight. The Galileo spacecraft buzzed by Earth twice in the 1990s en route to Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet located 484 million miles from the sun. Launched in 2011, Juno flew beyond the . orbit of Mars, Earth's closest planetary neighbour, before looping back . toward our home planet for a quick visit. By space mission standards, Juno's Earth . rendezvous was low-key compared with the Curiosity rover's nail-biting . landing on Mars last year, which drew crowds. Since flybys have been executed before, project managers predicted a smooth flight. Despite . a government shutdown that has prevented Nasa from updating its website . or tweeting, the space agency's missions continue to operate. Earlier this week, Nasa’s newest spacecraft, LADEE, slipped into orbit around the moon. Since the 1970s, spacecraft have circled or flown past Jupiter including the Voyagers, Pioneers, Galileo, Ulysses, Cassini and, most recently, the New Horizons barreling toward Pluto. Missions have beamed back stunning views of Jupiter's trademark Great Red Spot, a raging hurricane-like storm, and its many moons. Juno promises to inch closer to Jupiter than previous spacecraft, orbiting the planet for at least a year and studying its cloud-covered atmosphere and mysterious interior to better understand how the giant planet formed. Juno's trajectory has carried it beyond the orbit of Mars and then back into the inner solar system where it did a velocity boosting Earth flyby on Wednesday to gain the energy needed to reach Jupiter .","The probe sent the image despite unexpectedly going into ‘safe mode’

A record of Neanderthal history, thought to have been lost a century ago, has been re-discovered in the Channel island of Jersey. The island is believed to be one of the last places the Neanderthals lived after teeth were discovered on its Cotte de St Brelade cave in 1910. The cave has so far produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together. A record of Neanderthal history, thought to be lost a century ago, has been re-discovered in Jersey. The island is believed to be one of the last places the Neanderthals lived after teeth were discovered on its Cotte de St Brelade cave (pictured) in 1910 . British archaeologists have now found that a large portion of the site contains sediment dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. ‘In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles,’ said Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research. ‘Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site.’ British archaeologists have now found that a large portion of the site contains sediments dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. Pictured is Dr Jean-Luc Schwenninger retrieving dating samples from the rediscovered deposits at La Cotte de St Brelade in Jersey . The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called Optically Stimulated Luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. The results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought. According to the researchers, they probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region. ‘The discovery that these deposits still exist and can be related to previously excavated deposits opens up a range of exciting possibilities,’ said Dr Martin Bates, University of Trinity St Davids, who is leading current fieldwork at the site. The results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought.

The findings bring the large collections of stone tools, animal bone and the Neanderthal remains from the area under renewed study. ‘Excavation in the future will provide us with the opportunity to subject the site to the wide range of approaches we use today in Palaeolithic archaeology and Quaternary science,’ he added. ‘For example we are hoping to be able to link our site with the broader Neanderthal landscapes through study of similarly aged deposits around the island and, through bathymetric survey, on the seabed.’ ‘We were sure from the outset that the deposits held some archaeological potential, but these dates indicate we have uncovered something exceptional,’ explained Dr Pope. ‘We have a sequence of deposits which span the last 120,000 years still preserved at the site. Crucially, this covers the period in which Neanderthal populations apparently went “extinct”’. It was during this period that Neanderthals appear to have been replaced by our own species - Homo sapiens. The project is set to continue exploration of the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years.

A pregnant mother and her toddler were stabbed to death by  her deranged ex-lover after police failed to warn her they were at ‘high risk of homicide’, a jury ruled yesterday. Andrew Cairns, who had a history  of mental illness, killed Rachael  Slack and their 23-month-old son  Auden days after twice being held by police – the second time for threatening to kill her. The inquest heard that despite the golf tutor telling Miss Slack ‘You have no idea what I’m capable of … I will kill you and take him [Auden] with me’, he was freed on bail pending further police inquiries. Mother and son: Ms Slack, pictured with her son Auden, was expecting her second child with her new partner when she was killed . Killer: Andrew Cairns, who had suffered from declining mental health over a number of years, stabbed his former partner and her child to death before turning the knife on himself . Five days later, Cairns delivered on his horrifying promise, brutally attacking Miss Slack with a kitchen knife at her village home as a neighbour looked on in horror, before stabbing himself to death. Last night Cairns was branded a ‘ticking timebomb’ by Robert Barlow, the father of Miss Slack’s unborn child, as an inquest jury ruled Miss Slack, 38, and her son were unlawfully killed. The jury said the deaths were ‘more than minimally contributed to by a [police] failure to impress upon’ Miss Slack the conclusion of a risk assessment conducted by officers which placed the pair, of Holbrook, Derbyshire, at high risk of death or serious injury. The inquest heard that while police had called Miss Slack, a human resources manager, to warn her that Cairns had been released on bail, officers failed to tell her of their own risk assessment. Knifed to death: Rachael Slack and her son Auden, aged 23 months, who were stabbed to death in Holbrook, Derbyshire, by Andrew Cairns who then turned the weapon on himself . New partner: Ms Slack, left, was pregnant with Robert Barlow's child when she was stabbed to death in June 2010 . The jury ruled police had also failed to advise Miss Slack of  steps she could have taken to address the potential of harm towards her son, such as asking neighbours to look out for Cairns – whose bail conditions barred him from approaching the mother and son. Following the jury conclusions, coroner Dr Robert Hunter said that he would write to Home Secretary Theresa May, the Department of Health, Derbyshire Constabulary and the Association of Chief Police Officers. He said he would share his concerns about deficiencies in police powers to deal with suspects who breach bail over alleged domestic violence and the sharing of information between mental health services and police. Triple deaths: Rachael Slack, her son Auden and her former partner Andrew Cairns were all found dead in this property in Holbrook, Derbyshire . Victims: Auden and his mother Rachael Slack who were both discovered dead in Holbrook, Derbyshire in June 2010. Today an inquest jury ruled that police failures contributed 'more than minimally' to their deaths . After the case, Mr Barlow told the . Daily Mail the police should be ‘damned’ for the ‘shocking’ failure to . warn his partner that her life and that of her son was at risk. He said that he and Miss Slack - who . planned to call their unborn son George - ‘were not given a good enough . chance to prepare ourselves for the possibility of Andrew turning up at . the house’. Mr Barlow added: ‘We could have looked . at moving to stay with a relative while they investigated him for . threatening to kill Rachael. ‘Instead, we carried on with our normal routine – Rachael and Auden remained in the cottage while I went off to work.’ The 42-year-old joinery company boss . said Cairns was always liable to erupt because he could not accept Miss . Slack had moved on with her life and settled down with a new partner. Brutal killing: Ms Slack was stabbed 32 times in the back and chest during the attack in her home, the five-week inquest heard . The family of Miss Slack said  that . instead of spending last  weekend celebrating her 42nd birthday and . reflecting on Auden’s first term at school, they had spent six weeks in a . coroner’s court, ‘hearing about the failings of Derbyshire Police’. The inquest heard Derbyshire . Constabulary and NHS mental health services had countless opportunities . to prevent the deaths in the run-up to the tragedy at Miss Slack’s . village home. Cairns, who had been separated from the trained artist and . human resources manager for 18 months, had been in the care of . Derbyshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust since mid-2008. Over the following two years he was . seen by two consultant psychiatrists and numerous other health . professionals and had been diagnosed as having a ‘narcissistic . personality disorder’. In the week before the bloodbath, Cairns’ mental . health rapidly deteriorated. On May 26 he was held under  the . mental health act after Miss Slack was forced to drive to Ripley police . station when he refused to get out of her car. Killing: Ms Slack had driven to a police station with Cairns in her car after he refused to get out days before she was stabbed to death, the inquest heard . The following morning, he turned up at . Miss Slack’s cottage without  warning. The terrified mother took him to . a park with Auden, a ‘ploy’ to kill time until she could collect Mr . Barlow from work. It was at the park that Cairns issued his chilling . threat to Miss Slack’s life. Mr Barlow and Miss Slack reported the sinister promise to police that evening and Cairns was arrested but later released. Just two hours before the June 2 . atrocity, Cairns visited his GP in  an ‘agitated’ state and clutching  a . picture of Auden. He warned  the medic: ‘Today will be the  most . important day of your career.’ The jury found Cairns had taken his own . life. Dr Hunter, the coroner for South . Derbyshire, said the inquest  had shone a spotlight on a national . ‘epidemic’ of domestic violence and he would ‘urge’ the Home Secretary . to amend legislation to give police more options when detaining suspects . accused of violent or sexual offences. Dr Hunter said he would also  ask the . new College of Policing to consider drawing up national guidelines for . investigating domestic violence, so that officers across the country . work to the same ‘robust’ standard.","Rachael Slack, 38, and her 23-month-old son Auden were stabbed to death .

A coroner said Louis Holford may have contracted leukaemia as a result of radiation exposure on Christmas Island . A nuclear test veteran who died after contracting leukaemia may have gotten the cancer from being exposed to dangerous levels of radiation as a serviceman, a coroner has ruled. Louis Holford, 71, had a number of health problems through his life after he witnessed atomic bomb blasts on Christmas Island, near Indonesia, in the Pacific Ocean, in 1958. The Ministry of Defence has never admitted fault, but a coroner ruled this week that his death may have been caused by the exposure. Father-of-two Mr Holford was adamant . that his cancer - as well as two strokes and thyroid problems - had been . caused by toxic fallout. He . and 31 other servicemen launched High Court action against the Air Force . in 2007 for negligence. They claimed they had been used as ‘guinea . pigs’. But the test cases were thrown out, with judges saying the veterans had lodged their claims too late. Mr . Holford, who died while undergoing intensive treatment for acute myloid . leukaemia following a fall in 2009, never saw a verdict reached. But a coroner has ruled that his condition could have been caused by his exposure to radiation. North Staffordshire coroner Ian Smith branded the nuclear tests ‘appalling’ and said Louis must have been exposed to unnatural levels of radiation. Recording a verdict of accidental death yesterday, Mr Smith said he could not rule out a link between Mr Holford’s condition and his experiences in the Pacific Ocean. But he said he would leave it to ‘others to deal with the tricky issues’. The coroner said: ‘What happened on Christmas Island was an appalling and inhumane process with potentially devastating effects to those exposed. ‘That was then, however. Times are very different but, even so, it seems very hard to justify. ‘In Mr Holford’s case, his acute myloid leukaemia could have been or could not have been caused by his exposure. ‘The most obvious cause of death was a fall leading to a head injury potentially brought about by AML and potentially exacerbated by his AML.’ Giving evidence, wife Geraldine, 74, told the inquest RAF clerk Mr Holford and thousands of others were ordered to watch A-Bomb and H-Bomb blasts without protective clothing. Mr Holford with his wife, Geraldine, who believes the radiation caused her to have three miscarriages . She said: ‘They had to sit with their backs so they weren’t facing it. They were told to put their hands over their eyes and not to look. There were five bombs in total.’ She also blamed the exposure to radiation for three miscarriages she suffered after the couple married in 1961. Mr Holford was within 20 miles of three H-Bomb and two A-Bomb explosions when he spent six months at the RAF HQ on Christmas Island. Speaking in 2009, the retired office manager described the ‘spectacular’ bomb tests which he had watched as a 20-year-old. He said: ‘At the time, without knowing everything that happened since, it was quite a spectacle. ‘You heard the plane coming over, then we had to turn away from the bomb site with our hands over our eyes. ‘Ten seconds after the explosion someone said we could open our eyes and turn round. ‘It was like a bright new sun, then the dust formed a cloud and you could feel the heat. ‘When one bomb went off the wind veered towards us and we had to get on to a landing craft and go out on the water. ‘There was never any mention of possible dangers.’ British troops on Christmas Island in 1957, when they would have been exposed to atomic bomb explosions . Around 22,000 men are thought to have witnessed nuclear blasts between 1952 and 1967, with 3,000 surviving today. Of those that remain, it is thought around three will die each month. In March last year the Supreme Court ruled on ten test cases lodged by Christmas Island veterans who witnessed nuclear tests in the Pacific. The court found nine of the claims, brought against the MoD in 2009, had been entered too late and threw them out of court. A spokesman for the MoD said: ‘The MoD recognises the debt of gratitude we have to the servicemen who took part in the nuclear tests. ‘The Supreme Court ruled in favour of the MoD that the claims brought by Nuclear Test Veterans were time barred and declined to allow the claims to proceed under the statutory discretion.’","Louis Holford, 71, was adamant his ill health was caused by MoD work .

They came at each other out of the fog – opposing armies in a battle that would change the history of England. This was one of the most important clashes in the Wars of the Roses, fought between the Houses of York and Lancaster on a site some 12 miles north of London. In a few hours of fighting, the Battle of Barnet helped reshape the monarchy and decide a dynastic conflict. Old Ford Manor Golf Club wants to turn part of its course, which is the scene of the 1471 Battle of Barnet, into an industrial landfill site . The site is where 'kingmaker' Earl of Warwick (played by James Frain in BBC's White Queen) was killed . Warwick (seen here in the period drama) was killed on the battlefield, which led to a change in monarch . That was back in the 15th century. Yesterday two sides in a new conflict were mustering forces for a fight over land on which the original battle, immortalised by Shakespeare in Henry VI, is said to have taken place. Squaring up in one corner is Old Fold Manor golf club, which sits on the 1471 battlefield – and wants to dump thousands of tons of rubbish on it. A proposal agreed at its annual general meeting would see it become a landfill site to allow the re-landscaping of several greens. On the opposing side are the forces of heritage and preservation, determined that one of the nation’s most historic battlefield sites must not be wiped out. One historian said it would be ‘an act of wickedness’ to bury centuries-old artefacts and the prospect of historically important finds, particularly when experts believe the site has exciting new secrets to reveal. Dr Gillan Greer from Barnet Museum said it would 'absolutely criminal' to destroy potential evidence about handgun use at the battle . Historian Graham Bird said the move would 'completely destroy the archaeology of the site' Researchers had just sought permission . for a dig to determine the exact location of the fighting. Some think . the Battle of Barnet – and not the 1485 Battle of Bosworth, as is . currently thought – saw the first use of handguns in a major British . conflict. If so, and if archaeologists can uncover evidence, it would give Barnet an even more notable place in history. Dr Gillian Gear, historian and archivist at Barnet Museum, said: ‘It would be absolutely criminal to destroy the evidence.’ Now historians are banding together to save the site for future generations, ‘rather than being annihilated to make a fast buck’, as one put it. Yesterday I was shown the swathe of land on which Edward IV is said to have led his Yorkist forces against the Lancastrian armies, which backed Henry VI. Back then, the clash of swords and the rallying calls of knights sounded a death knell for more than 1,500 soldiers. Soon, if approval is granted, the drone of diggers will form the soundtrack as the historic site is turned into a quagmire of mud and rubbish. Historian Dennis Bird, 65, says he often imagines the battle unfolding in the early hours of April 14, 1471. The . former teacher, whose home overlooks an obelisk marking where defeated . ‘kingmaker’ Earl of Warwick was slain, said: ‘It will completely destroy . the archaeology of the site.’ He points out a row of oak, ash, hawthorn and hornbeam trees where a hedge was purportedly used as cover by the Lancastrians. Historians say it would be 'an act of wickedness' to bury centuries-old artefacts at the scene of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick's death (pictured) We cross an expanse of green upon which fighting is likely to have taken place. It is now the seventh tee, thought to be one of those earmarked for landfill. The 125-acre site is owned by the London Borough of Barnet and leased to the golf club, which is seeking permission to develop part of its 6,500-yard course. The club has not made specific proposals public yet. Manager Adrian Jackson added: ‘We have to ensure we have the best design and playing surface around.’","Old Fold Manor golf club wants to turn Battle of Barnet site into landfill tip .

Inspirational: Ray Widstrand, pictured, was beaten within an inch of his life but he has forgiven the five teens responsible for the shocking, unprovoked attack . A 15-year-old boy from Minnesota charged with beating a man into a coma over the summer has been sentenced to 18 to 24 months as part of a plea deal. The minor, who has not been named because of his age, pleaded guilty this week to first-degree felony assault and agreed to testify against his alleged accomplices in the brutal August attack on 26-year-old Ray Widstrand in St Paul. The teenager will spend up to two years in a secure juvenile facility and will remain under enhanced supervision until his 21st birthday, MyFox Twin Cities reported. If he violates the conditions of the plea agreement, the 15-year-old would have to serve more than eight years in prison, The Star Tribune reported. On the night of August 4, then-26-year-old Widstrand was walking home in the vicinity of near Payne and Minnehaha avenues when he found himself in the middle of a terrifying gang confrontation and was kicked, stomped on and left for dead. Widstrand spent several days in a medically induced coma and suffered potentially fatal brain swelling. The 27-year-old victim has undergone multiple surgeries and still has months of physical therapy ahead of him. But in an interview earlier this month, the St Paul resident said he bears no hatred toward his assailants. 'That was just a freak accident,' Widstrand told the Star Tribune. 'It was just young kids lashing out. I was a young kid once. I lashed out.' He added: 'I'm indifferent towards them. I wish them the best. But I am recovering and I'll be back soon enough, hopefully I can go back to work, back to my normal life, back to living on my own and back to business as usual.' Five people, one adult and four juveniles, have been charged in the assault on Widstrand. The jury trial for Issac Maiden, 19, who faces first-degree assault and aggravated robbery charges as well as two counts of gang-related crimes, will start November 4. Cindarion Butler, 16, was certified as an adult last week and will appear at a hearing later this month. A pair of 15-year-olds are still awaiting a judge to decide if they will stand trial as adults. A third 15-year-old suspect will learn whether his case will be handled in juvenile court or criminal court in December. The inspirational cable programming assistant said he'd learned a lot from the harrowing experience, which left him in a wheelchair and unable to perform basic tasks like shaving or using the bathroom alone. Harrowing experience: The 27-year-old, pictured this week, said he'd learned a lot from the harrowing experience, which left him in a wheelchair and unable to perform everyday tasks. He also wears a helmet . 'My dad was right. He said there are more builders than there are tearers down. ...The world is a good place if you just give it a chance,” Widstrand told the Tribune from his room at the rehab center. He thanks his friends, family and the community for their support. 'I have people praying for me. I have to go the extra mile,' he said. The young man is due to undergo more surgery in November, this time to have the blone flaps on his head put back into place. He's hoping to be home by Christmas. Earlier this month, soon after he began constructing sentences again following his severe brain injuries, Widstrand gave his first interview from his wheelchair at a fundraiser held in Minneapolis to help pay for his treatments. Suspect: Five people, one adult and four juveniles, have been charged in the assault. The trial for Issac Maiden, 19, pictured, will start Monday . Speaking slowly and haltingly, Widstrand told a local news station that he has no recollection of the night heartless youths robbed and beat him to the brink of death. The 27-year-old was walking home in . his neighborhood on St Paul's East Side when he was attacked by a group of 30 to 50 juveniles and young adults. He was hit in the head with a 'can in a . sock', stomped on, had his pants ripped off him and was robbed. He was . placed in a medically-induced coma when he was taken to hospital. Wearing . a helmet to protect his head, Widstrand spoke about the difficulties he . has faced in the two months since the beating occurred. 'It's been trying at times,' he said. 'But it's also been a learning experience for me,' Widstrand told KSTP. 'I quit smoking since I've been in the hospital. I eat less junk food. I'm healthier, so that has been nice.' Widstrand has already undergone two surgeries for brain swelling and skull fractures and will face a third in November. He has been undergoing intensive rehabilitation at Courage Kenny Rehab . Institute where he's slowly re-learning basic skills like walking and . speaking. Widstrand told KSTP that he faces months of physical, occupational and speech therapy as he recovers from his serious brain injury. Despite the hardships he has faced, Widstrand has been overwhelmed by the love and support of his family and community. 'Seeing all the support - I just had a birthday last month, and it . has been so cool, getting all the cards,' said Widstrand, who turned 27 . on August 31. He will remain in hospital in the coming months, with a tentative release date of December 1. No memory: Widstrand, pictured before the life-changing attack, was hit in the head with a 'can in a sock', stomped on, had his pants ripped off him and was robbed. He was placed in a medically-induced coma . Strong: Widstrand has already undergone two surgeries for brain swelling and skull fractures and will face a third in November . 'They're talking December first,' said . Widstrand's father Peter Widstrand, who says he doesn't know if his son . will be able to move home. 'Moving somewhere,' Widstrand said. 'Moving on to the next thing.' Widstrand said he has no recollection of the night his life changed forever. 'I didn't even know I got beaten up till the next day,' he said. 'It was longer than the next day,' said his father. 'To me it seemed like the next day,' Widstrand said. He suffered 'potentially fatal . brain swelling' and 'permanent and protracted loss of brain function' as a result of the beating. Peter Widstrand told The Pioneer Press: 'It seems every day we see some steps . forward. Every day, I see something, . whether it's in his eyes or something he does. '[But] we're still in the place where we don't know if he'll return to work or . return home. We might not know for years. Progress can stop tomorrow. It might not stop two years from now.' The young man had moved to an apartment in the Minnesota city two . months before the attack and was working for a local community channel. Crime scene: Mr Widstrand was walking through his local neighbourhood on St Paul's East Side when he was brutally assaulted, robbed and stripped . Brutal beating: After Mr Widstrand was knocked over one person was seen stomping on his head after which a third stripped him of his trousers to search his pockets . Speaking at a press conference in August, Peter Widstrand said his son had never ‘expressed any concerns' about living on the East Side. 'I . can't imagine why someone would do this to another person. Hopefully . they will at least answer to that,' Peter Widstrand added. The . large group was fighting on a street located mere blocks from the local . police station and turned the violence on Widstrand when he tried to . get past them, witnesses told police. A . local newspaper reported that the fight had started at a party nearby . and a group of girls had taken it to the street after which the brawl . escalated into a bust-up between local gangs. 'An innocent man was walking down the street and brutally attacked by a group of youth,' police spokesman Sergeant Paul Paulos, told Pioneer Press. 'He was out for a walk and decided to go through this group and was assaulted and knocked unconscious.' Family support: Ray Widstrand's parents Linda and Peter spoke during a press conference alongside his sister Alice, expressing their shock and disbelief at the violent assault on their son and brother . According to the police report, Widstrand was hit over the head with a 'can in a sock' which knocked him to the ground. Witnesses reported seeing blood coming . from his head after which a second man stomped on his head while a . third removed Widstrand's trousers and the group searched his . pockets. Police found Widstrand lying on the ground, bleeding from his nose and mouth, his pants removed and shirt torn, according to a criminal complaint filed by the Ramsey County attorney's office. Tips from witnesses led to five arrests: 19-year-old Maiden and four juveniles. Trials for the underage teens, two of whom are just 15 years old, are underway.

A second black Barneys customer has claimed store clerks racially profiled her after she bought a designer bag - and police officers pounced on her, demanding to know how she could afford it. Kayla Phillips, 21, said she was stunned when she heard of the case of Trayon Christian, a black 19-year-old student, who was held by police after buying a $350 designer belt from the store. The young mother, from Brooklyn, New York, said she experienced similarly shocking treatment from staff at the Madison Avenue store in February when she bought a $2,500 Céline handbag. She has now filed a $5 million notice of claim with the city showing her intention to sue the NYPD. Scroll down for video . Complaint: Kayla Phillips, 21, says cops demanded to know how she could afford to buy a $2,500 Céline bag from Barneys in New York - in a case that echoes that of a teen accusing the store of racial profiling . 'As I was walking into the train station, four undercover police officers attacked me,' Phillips told the New York Post. 'They were very rough,' she added to the New York Daily News. 'I didn't know what was happening.' She explained to the cops that she had used a temporary Bank of America card to make the purchase - and they demanded to know why her name was not on it. She called her mother, Wendy Straker, who said that the police officers had asked her daughter: 'What are you doing here in Manhattan? Where'd you get the money to buy that expensive bag?' Straker added that the police were on the phone with a Barneys employee about the transaction. Police finally let her go after she showed them her ID and new debit card, which arrived that morning. Shock: She called her mother Wendy Straker (right with Kayla) who said she heard police ask her daughter: 'What are you doing here in Manhattan? Where'd you get the money to buy that expensive bag?' Treat: She had just bought a $2,500 orange suede Céline handbag when she was stopped by cops . 'Jay Z is getting ready to do a . campaign with Barneys, but they’re looking at these African-American . kids like they're thieves,' Straker said. The case comes after it emerged that another shopper, Trayon Christian, was stopped and handcuffed after he bought a $350 Salvatore Ferragamo belt in the store. Christian, 19, has now filed a lawsuit for unspecified damages against the Madison Avenue store and the NYPD who wrongly accused him of fraud. Mr Christian, who lives with his mom in Queens, had decided to splash out on the belt after seeing one of his favorite music stars, Harlem rapper Juelz Santana, wearing the accessory. However once he had paid for the belt . and had left Barneys on April 29 this year, the fashion-loving teen was . grabbed by undercover officers on the street. According to the civil rights lawsuit, the 19-year-old was asked 'how a young black man such as himself could afford to purchase such an expensive belt'. Trayon Christian, 19, has brought a lawsuit against Barneys and the NYPD after they wrongly accused him of fraud when he purchased a designer belt . Barneys department store is facing a lawsuit after a 19-year-old black student claims he was wrongly grabbed by store detectives because of his color and accused of stealing a designer belt . Mr Christian's lawyer Michael Palillo told the New York Daily News: 'He's never been arrested. His only crime was being a young black guy buying a $300 belt.' A . Barneys store employee had asked the 19-year-old for ID when he used . his Chase debit card to buy the belt. Mr Christian showed the clerk his . state ID. Harlem rapper Juelz Santana (pictured right) wearing the belt coveted by his teenage fan . The store cashier then subsequently called the police to claim that the purchase was a fraud, according to the lawsuit. Officers took the teenager to a local precinct. Mr Christian once again showed his ID, debit card and receipt for the belt. Officers still refused to believe the teenager. Finally Chase bank was contacted who verified that the debit card belonged to Mr Christian. It was only then that he was allowed to go after spending two hours in a holding cell, the suit claims. The NYPD denied this and said the student was only held for 42 minutes. The student, who has no history of arrests, said that he will never shop at Barneys again following the incident. A Barney's New York spokesman said: 'Barneys New York typically does not comment on pending litigation. 'In this instance, we feel compelled to note that after carefully reviewing the incident of last April, it is clear that no employee of Barneys New York was involved in the pursuit of any action with the individual other than the sale. 'Barneys New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination and we stand by our long history in support of all human rights.'","Kayla Phillips splashed out on the Céline handbag at the Manhattan department store in February - and four cops approached her in the street .

A bodybuilder has become allergic to all insects after suffering a severe reaction when he was bitten by a poisonous spider. Gary Meadows, 34, from Teesville in Middlesbrough, required a skin graft after a venomous false widow bit him in 2011, and has reacted badly to all insects ever since. The care-home worker has now been hospitalised four times in two years after encounters with bugs saying he 'blows up' like Violet Beauregarde from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory every time he is bitten. Nightmare: Bodybuilder Gary Meadows has been hospitalised four times because of  insect bites since he was first bitten by a false widow spider in 2011, leaving him requiring a skin graft (right) The worrying revelation comes just a day after a school in Gloucestershire was closed because of a false widow infestation. Yesterday the Mail Online also reported a grandfather nearly died and came close to having his leg amputated following a severe reaction to a false widow bite. Last week, Mr Meadows required hospital treatment after a midge . bit him in the chest and four weeks early he was taken to A&E after . being bitten by a red mite. He said: 'My immune system is shot, basically, and when I’m bitten I blow up like that girl off Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I’ve been back in hospital four times since that first bite.' Mr Meadows was tending to his allotment when the poisonous spider bit him in 2011. He said he swelled up 'like a boxing glove' and at one stage was told by doctors his arm may have to be amputated. 'I told them ""You can’t take my arm off, I work, I go to the gym five times a week"". 'I . go swimming and fishing. They told me they would have to cut out part . of my arm and I would be left with a really big scar, but it was either . that or lose my arm.' Sever: Last week the 34-year-old was treated at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough after a midge bit him on his chest . After the flesh had been removed, he had a skin graft taken from his leg to cover the hole left in his arm. He was off work recovering for seven months and was left with a permanent scar. He said: 'Ironically, before I was bitten by the spider, I lived in Australia for six months and saw huntsman spiders, red widows, swam with crocodiles and sharks and never had anything bad happen to me.' Mr Meadows, who works at Primrose Court Nursing Home in Middlesbrough, has seen his life altered forever, but says he tries not to let it overwhelm him. 'I don’t think about it too much,' he said. 'If it’s going to happen it’s going to happen, I can’t stay inside for the rest of my life.' Rest: He was off work recovering for seven months after the bite in 2011 . Moving around: There has been a spate of spiders reported around the country in the past week . The false black widow, which is said to be spreading further north due to warmer weather, has the worst bite of any spider in the UK. There have been a spate of bites reported across the country in the past few weeks. Amateur Devon footballer Steve Harris, for instance, had to undergo emergency surgery after a bite on his leg last week. The spider is a cousin of the black widow and is about the size of a 50p piece. It delivers venom that can kill those who are allergic to it. It first came to the UK more than 100 years ago in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands. The Natural History Museum’s Insect Information Service hears of about ten cases of spider bites each year, although no one in the UK has ever died as a result of one. The distribution of the false widow spider is expected to increase northwards in the UK due, at least partly, to mild summers in recent years.","Gary Meadows, 34, was bitten by the spider while gardening in 2011 .

As soon as animal welfare workers placed disabled kitten Thumper in his custom-made walker, they knew he was ready to make some giant leaps. Footage shows the long-limbed kitten take a few tentative steps forward, and then, seeming to realize he's walking all by himself, Thumper takes off. Thumper was found with his brothers and sisters abandoned in a yard with two other litters of kittens by People and Cats Together (PACT). SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . First steps: As soon as Thumper was put in his walker, he knew what to do . Nine kittens were saved that day, including a little white one with black markings they named Thumper. But from the beginning, PACT staff noticed something different about Thumper. 'He was very lanky,' says PACT member Jane. 'Almost built like a newborn deer. He had no ability to walk. He was dragging himself.' Vets diagnosed the kitten with a rare neurological disorder for which there is no cure. A lot of heart: Thumper's carers all teared up watching him take his first steps . Rare disorder: Thumper didn't seem to have any control over his back legs, dragging himself around by his front paws . PACT staff despaired of his chances. 'His neurological challenges... it's just so hard,' says Jane, breaking down. 'They don't survive environments like that.' As the other kittens were progressing, Thumper was falling behind developmentally. He couldn't play with them and vets didn't know if he'd ever be able to walk. PACT came up with an idea: why not get a little walker for Thumper to make walking a bit easier for him? The walker, which holds Thumper upright in a sling, enabled the cat to exercise his legs without losing his balance and falling over. Striding ahead: Within weeks, Thumper was walking around confidently . 'We got him in his walker, and from the minute we put him in, he took off,' says Jane. Within weeks, Thumper was racing all over the place in his new walker - and strengthening his legs and back as he went. When Thumper decided he was strong enough to go it alone, he made it clear to his carers he wanted the walker gone. Unstoppable: Thumper is now the one to initiate play with the other cats when before he could only watch . Made for walking: Thumper now seems to have endless energy and play, runs and chases all day long . And when he stood up and walked by himself for the first time, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. Now, Thumper has almost caught up with the other kittens. He still has a distinctive walk, but Jane thinks that's part of his charm. 'He's just a great little guy,' says Jane. 'There's something in these little ones that we can't quite grasp.' Thumper is up for adoption and looking for a home. 'He's got so much heart and he need someone who will love him as much as we love him,' says Jane.","Abandoned kitten Thumper has a rare neurological disorder and couldn't walk .

Have you ever noticed how clouds, when viewed from far away, can take on shapes of familiar faces? Or how close-up microscopic images of an insect can look remarkably like space images of an alien planet? The phenomenon is all down to how scale distorts our perception. Without knowing how close or far away something is, nature’s patterns can take on remarkable, and strikingly similar forms. Two scientists have since created and collected more than 50 images for display in 'Macro or Micro' exhibition which aims to challenge our perceptions of the world. This image is an interferogram of the Vatnajokull Glacier in Iceland, showing topography, including a depression in the center of the image, caused by a sub-glacial volcanic eruption. It has a scale of approximately 5 km by 3 km . This is something that Stephen Young, a geography professor at Salem State University, noticed when he was studying vegetation on Earth using satellite imagery. In 2004, professor Young had an exhibition at the Klein gallery in Philadelphia in which an image of the Mississippi delta was mistaken by many people as a medical scan. ‘At this point I started to wonder how people perceive satellite imagery,’ he told MailOnline. Does this look more like a river or a medical scan? During an exhibition at the Klein gallery in Philadelphia this mirror image of the Mississippi delta was mistaken for a medical scan.'This is the image which began my thinking of how people perceive satellite imagery,' said Professor Young . Without knowing how close or far away something is, nature's patterns can take on remarkable, and strikingly similar forms. This image is of an emerging eye of a larval zebrafish. The width of the image is around 300 µm (the same size as a dust mite) In 2012, Professor Young noticed some electron-microscopic imagery on the office walls of his colleague Paul Kelly. 'Some of his images looked like satellite images of the Earth,' he said. One such picture is this landsat image from west Africa . ‘Then, in 2012, one day I noticed some electron-microscopic imagery on the office walls of my colleague Paul Kelly,' he said. ‘Some of his images looked like satellite images of the Earth. 'As a joke I put one of my satellite images on his door and he thought that it was an electron microscopic image created by his officemate.’ The scientists soon realised that there must be some recurring patterns in nature at different scales, and they started to work together to look the similarities between each other’s imagery. This may look like a splattering of paint, but it is in fact Moscow by night at a scale of around 1400 km by 900 km. Data downloaded from NOAA Geophysical Data Center, and processed by Professor Young with the Idrisi Image processing software . The surface of the wing of a Blue Darner Dragonfly is shown at a width of around 3mm. This images was taken using colourised scanning electron microscopy . The work had a difference in scale of a million times or more, with Professor Kelly’s images showing objects millimetres and Professor Young’s revealing scales in kilometres or greater. As reported by Megan Gambino in Smithsonian.com, the two scientists have since created and collected more than 50 images for display in ‘Macro or Micro?,’ an exhibition currently at both Salem State University’s Winfisky Gallery and Clark University’s Traina Center for the Visual and Performing Arts. ‘Most people had trouble determining the differences in scale and most people were only able to get about 60 per cent of the images correctly identified,’ Professor Young told MailOnline. ‘We also noticed during these focus groups that people enjoyed many of the images from an aesthetic perspective.’ This is an image of a variety of ice types off the coast of East Antarctica. The original images was taken by Nasa Earth Observatory. 'Most people had trouble determining the differences in scale and most people were only able to get about 60 per cent of the images correctly identified,' Professor Young told MailOnline . Professor Kelly's images show objects in millimetres and Professor Young's reveal scales in kilometres or greater. This image shows the surface of a green alga, Marchantia as shown at a width of around 1mm . This colourful image is a 30 arc-second Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for Antarctica. 'We also noticed during these focus groups that people enjoyed many of the images from an aesthetic perspective,' said Professor Young . Professor Young said that even biologists who do microscopic imaging and geographers that use satellite images have had trouble determining the scale of some of the images. The exhibition aims to be both aestically pleasing as well as challenging how people view the world on different scales. In addition to exploring perception, the researchers want to promote a public understanding of science and how scientists study the earth at different scales. ‘Along with galleries in the United States we hope to have international shows as well,’ said Professor Young. ‘I lived and worked in London for a year and hope to bring the exhibition to the UK in the future.’ At approximately 60 km by 40 km, this is a landsat image from central Mali. The raw data was taken from Global Land Cover Facility. The exhibition aims to be both aestically pleasing as well as challenging how people view the world on different scales .

Australian researchers have created a ‘super horse’ with 3D printed titanium shoes they say could give racehorses a major advantage. The horse, nicknamed ‘Titanium Prints’, had its hooves scanned with a handheld 3D scanner. Using 3D modelling software, the scan was then used to design the perfect fitting, lightweight racing shoe. Here, researcher Chad Henry presents 'Titanium Prints' the 'super horse' with its new 3D printed shoes. The researchers behind the project believe the bespoke horseshoes say could give racehorses a major advantage . Four customised shoes were printed within only a few hours and experts say the technology could give horses a major advantage on the track. Traditionally made from aluminium, a horseshoe can weigh up to one kilogram but the horse’s trainer, John Moloney, says that the ultimate race shoe should be as lightweight as possible. 'Any extra weight in the horseshoe will slow the horse down,' he said. To make the shoes pictured, which are half the weight of aluminium horseshoes, the horse's hooves were scanned and digital 3D models made. From these models the custom-made titanium horseshoes were printed . 'These titanium shoes could take up to half of the weight off a traditional aluminium shoe, which means a horse could travel at new speeds. 'We’re very excited at the prospect of improved performance from these shoes.' The precision scanning process takes just a few minutes and for a horse, shoes can be made to measure each hoof and printed the same day. The project by Australia’s National Science Agency, CSIRO, was developed to show off a new 3D printing technique invented by the team. Could horse races be faster in the future? Horse trainer John Moloney said the titanium shoes could take up to half of the weight off a traditional aluminium shoe, which means a horse could travel at new speeds. Here, three horses with normal shoes race at Curragh last month . John Barnes, Titanium Technologies Leader at CSIRO said: 'There are so many ways we can use 3D titanium printing. At CSIRO we are helping companies create new applications like biomedical implants and even things like automotive and aerospace parts.' 'The possibilities really are endless with this technology.' He said that 3D printing a race horseshoe from titanium is a first for scientists and demonstrates the range of applications the technology can be used for.","Researchers from Australia’s National Science Agency, CSIRO have created a ‘super horse’ with 3D printed titanium shoes .

From the Leaning Tower of Pisa to the crumbling Mayan step-pyramids at Tikal, some of the most precious heritage sites around the globe are at risk from forces of nature and humans. But now scientists are using advanced 3D scanning technology to digitally document much-loved landmarks in a bid to preserve them on computers for generations to come. A new organisation intends to preserve 500 cultural sites digitally over the next five years and build a 3D-digital library of the world's most important monuments. Scientists are using advanced 3D scanning technology to digitally document much-loved landmarks including Mount Rushmore (pictured) in a bid to preserve them on computers for generations to come . Unlike precious artefacts that are carefully preserved in museums, sites such as the Mayan pyramids, Mount Rushmore and the ruins of Pompeii, are open to the elements and are being slowly eroded. Increasing numbers of tourists visiting the famous sites can also accidentally cause damage to them, leading a new charitable organisation to try and preserve selected locations. Launched today at the Tower of London, CyArk's '500 Challenge' is a mission to save cultural heritage sites across the globe before they are ravaged by war or terrorism, affected by climate change, earthquakes or floods or fall victim to sprawling cities. Mapping the sites is a laborious process. Here, abseilers map Mount Rushmore, which forms one of the 40 heritage sites mapped and collected by the organisation so far . CyArk intends to preserve 500 cultural sites digitally over the next five years and build a 3D-digital library of the world's most important sites. This is a scan of Chichen Itza in Mexico that dates from 600 AD. The precious pyramid is visited by 1.2 million tourists every year . The project uses 3D laser scanning and other reality-capture technologies to create digital models of sites, such as this ancient Stabiae in Pompeii, that are accurate to just two to six millimeters. This level of detail preserves delicate works of art such as mosaic floor (pictured) Ben Kacyra, co-founder of CyArk, based in Edinburgh, said: 'Our mission is to create a 3D-digital library of the world’s most important heritage sites. 'While there isn’t enough time or money to save all these sites physically, we have the technology to digitally preserve them. 'By . doing so, we will ensure that these treasures are available for . appreciation and study for years to come. It’s not an option; it’s our . responsibility. CyArk's '500 Challenge' is a mission to save cultural heritage sites across the globe before they are ravaged by war or terrorism, affected by climate change, earthquakes or floods or fall victim to sprawling cities. Pictured is the scan of the remarkable Kasubi Tombs in Uganda . 'Otherwise, we will lose our shared history and an important piece of our cultural identity.' CyArk has already mapped 40 sites, including Babylon, the Titanic, the Sydney Opera House and the Tower of London. The project uses 3D laser scanning and other reality-capture technologies to create digital models of the sites that are accurate to just two to six millimeters, enabling details to be captured that could otherwise be damaged by weathering. This scan of the Leaning Tower of Pisa shows just how precarious the monument is. The organisation is scanning 500 landmarks to make sure they are available to study for years to come and sees its as a responsibility . In each mapping exercise, experts capture billions of data points and as much as 10 terbytes of information. Using . the data collected, CyArk develops tools to help conservators in . managing and preserving locations, that can be a magnet for tourists, as . well as letting researchers and members of the public have access to the . maps via its website. The data collected from each project is stored in an underground bunker in western Pennsylvania by a company called Iron Mountain, alongside other priceless collections including musical recordings from Capitol/Universal Music musicians such as Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley and films like E.T and Jaws from Universal Studios. The organisation today launched the CyArk 500 Fund to enable governments and individuals to nominate sites for preservation and donate money to support the cause. Sites worthy of scanning will be chosen by a council of international heritage experts, chaired by Gustavo Araoz, president of the International Council of Monuments and Sites. He said: 'The first task of the Advisory Council was to develop criteria for selecting the 500. 'While the risk factor will be a chief criterion in selecting sites, we want to use the technology beyond mere documentation to promote capacity building in all regions, and to assist management in periodic monitoring, interpretation, public awareness, and promotion of visitation.' In each mapping exercise, such as this colonnade in Pompeii, experts capture billions of data points and as much as 10 terbytes of information .","CyArk wants to preserve 500 cultural sites digitally over the next five years .

She was a contemporary icon who suffered a very modern death but Amy Winehouse appears every inch the Tudor lady in a portrait painted by fine art student Aaron Illsley, 21. Renamed Lady Winehouse of Southgate, the Enfield artist has given the singer, who died two years ago, an exquisite golden dress - although her trademark beehive remains in place. And Illsley hasn't stopped at Winehouse. The portrait is part of a series of paintings of deceased celebrities who have been 'Tudorised' by the artist. Lord and lady: Sid Vicious (left) and Amy Winehouse (right) reimagined as Tudor courtiers by Aaron Illsley . The paintings, which also show Beatles star John Lennon, frontman of glam rock group T. Rex Marc Bolan and Sex Pistols singer Sid Vicious, were commissioned by Grade I-listed Henry Tudor House bar and restaurant in Shrewsbury. 'I spent a lot of time at the V&A and the fashion museum, looking at patterns and clothing,' explained Aaron. 'I didn't want to be accused of copyright [theft] so I had to make a lot of it up. I did research [Henry VIII's court painter] Hans Holbein the Younger's paintings, along with Rembrandt and Agnolo Bronzino to get the colours right. 'I'd never done anything like this before. I usually work from photographs. I was quite surprised how they turned out. They work really well in the context of the bar. I'm very happy with them.' New look: T. REX singer Marc Bolan (left) and Beatles star John Lennon (right) get a Tudor make-over . It was bar owner Graham Jenkins who . came up with the concept of 'Tudor-fying' contemporary musicians to . adorn the walls of his oak-framed restaurant and pub . The . building dates back to the early 1400's and once sheltered the founding . king of the Tudor dynasty, Henry VII, who was en route to the Battle of . Bosworth where his army dispatched King Richard III and ended the . Plantagenet line. Graham's son Sam, 20, a guitarist studying commercial music in his final year at Bath Spa University, introduced his dad to fellow student Aaron and the project took flight. 'He sent me Aaron's self-portrait and I thought ""this is a guy who can really paint"",' said Graham. Aaron, who takes a month to complete each painting, is currently working on a portrait of the very much alive Dr Dre, which will depict the rapper with headphones in the style of Botticelli's Birth of Venus. Graham said: 'Music is an integral part of what we offer here. We attract some brilliant touring artists, looking for an intimate venue. Masterpiece: Illsley is currently working on a reimagining of Botticelli's famous Birth of Venus - also for Graham . Real deal: Holbein's 1537 Henry VIII (left) and rapper Dr Dre (right) who will replace Venus in Illsley's new work . 'I thought that having pop icons painted to a medieval theme would be in tune with the surroundings. 'Aaron is under threat of death not to repeat the work. We've had such a positive reaction that we're thinking about getting prints done. It is Marc Bolan, of T. Rex who attracts the most attention, perhaps because he's a bit more niche. 'We've had people making pilgrimages here just to see him. One lady comes in every two to three weeks and keeps increasing her offer on the John Lennon picture - we've had offers of five times what it cost to paint but we are not considering selling.' He said he thought the paintings might now be worth 'thousands of pounds'. The paintings are unprotected, as Graham wants them to 'live and breathe with the building' and Amy's has already been splashed with wine. 'That doesn't happen in the National Gallery,' he added. Aaron says he is still exploring his potential as an artist and is unsure, as yet, where it will take him, but is open to further commissions. 'I don't understand my potential in painting yet,' he said. 'I would like to think I can do more. I would love to be a commissioned artist, earning my living from painting.'","The works were created by fine art student Aaron Illsley, 21 .

A Wisconsin couple are headed to trial after being accused of starving the man's 5-year-old daughter and restraining her 7-year-old sister with zipties until she passed out from a heat stroke. Shawn Paholke, 33, and Jennifer Fendryk, 31, together face 23 felony counts of mistreating the two girls. They waived their right to a preliminary hearing in Oconto County Circuit Court Wednesday. A criminal complaint filed in Oconto County Circuit Court says a social worker told authorities the 5-year-old appeared to be severely underweight and that ‘bones were protruding from her face and body.’ Bad parenting: Shawn Paholke (left) and Jennifer Fendryk (right) have been charged with 23 felonies relating to the alleged abuse of Paholke's daughters, ages 5 and 7 . The older girl told investigators Paholke used plastic restraints to tie her hands to a pole July 4, 2012, according to the complaint. Medical records show the 7-year-old was taken to a Green Bay hospital for treatment of ‘disfiguring’ second- and third-degree burns to her arms five days later, WLUK-TV reported. Paholke told doctors at the time that she'd slipped and her arm got stuck on a hot deck, the complaint said. In interviews with investigators, Mr Paholke denied tying his daughter to a pole, but acknowledged using zipties on her arms and wrists for 10 minutes as a part of a timeout. On her part, the 7-year-old told officials that she fainted from the July heat while standing tethered to the pole, and when she came to later, she had a burn on her arm and her father was giving her a cold shower. 'Happy' family: Paholke, seen here with his two girls, alleged tied the 7-year-old to a pole in the July heat until she fainted and suffered severe burns . The younger of the two sisters told . investigators that one time, her father got mad at her and dragged her . on the floor, causing the 5-year-old to cut her chin, the station WBAY reported. On another occasion, the parents allegedly grabbed a knife and threatened to cut off the child's hands. Fendryk is not the children's biological mother. She has an 8-year-old son from a previous relationship who was also living in the family’s Breed home, but was reportedly spared abuse. The 5-year-old weighed only 24lbs when the investigation started in May, the complaint said, which is about half the healthy weight for a girl her age. She also told investigators she was locked in her dark, sparsely furnished bedroom most of the time and was only allowed out by her ‘daddy’ to exercise, scrub the floor and use the bathroom. Crime scene: The alleged abuse of the two girls took place at the family's home in Breed, Wisconsin, where Fendryk's 8-year-old son lived as well . Justice: The couple are being held on $250,000 bond, and Fendryk (left) faces up to 134 years in prison if convicted . The social worker reported the room's single window was covered with a piece of cardboard. The girl told investigators she couldn't play with her sister or Fendryk's 8-year-old son. Paholke and Fendryk told investigators they would withhold food and send the 5-year-old to her room for disciplinary reasons, according to the criminal complaint. 'It’s not only tragic, it’s sadistic,' special prosecutor Wendy Lemkuil said in arguing against a bond reduction for Fendryk. Fendryk's attorney, Bradley Schraven, said she will plead not guilty at arraignment scheduled for October 29.

A satellite that can spot asteroids on collision course with our planet which previously could not be seen due to their close proximity to the sun is to be launched into space next month. Until now, astronomers have not been able to see asteroids that orbit between Earth and the sun as powerful radiation from the latter blinds telescopes on earth. One such orbit hit the Earth in February - smashing into the Russian town of Chelyabinsk, almost 1000 miles east of Moscow. A satellite which can spot asteroids in orbit between the sun and Earth will be launched into space next month by the European Space Agency . However, the European Space Agency (ESA) is soon to launch its Gaia space satellite - and one of its missions will be to track these previously unseen asteroids. The £800m probe will sit in orbit 90million miles from Earth. Gerry Gilmore, a professor of experimental . philosophy at Cambridge University’s Institute of Astronomy, who is a . lead scientist on the project told The Sunday Times: 'Gaia will measure all the asteroids including those between us and the sun which are the really nasty ones because we cannot see them.' However, the main goal of the Gaia mission is to make a precise three-dimensional map of our galaxy - the Milky Way. It will do so by photographing and surveying around one per cent of the galaxy's 100 billion stars. During the mapping, Gaia - which is so powerful it can spot a button on the moon - will detect and accurately measure the motion of each star in its orbit around the centre of the Galaxy. It is hoped that by creating a detailed map of the stars, the probe will provide a tool to help scientists study the formation of the Milky Way. One of the dangerous 'unseen' asteroids crashed 900 miles east of Moscow in February this year . Those behind the probe hope that Gaia will make other discoveries during its five-year lifetime, including planets around other stars, icy bodies in the outer Solar System and even far-distant supernovae. Gilmore added: 'Gaia . will follow a billion stars for five or six years, plotting their . movements 80 times so that we can work out their exact tracks.' Earlier this week, Nasa issued a 'reality check' on news that an asteroid could hit Earth on August 26, 2032. The Crimean Astrophysical Observatory found the massive asteroid, called 2013 TV135, last weekend. The international scientific community has already rated it as one of the two most dangerous asteroids ever recorded. But . Nasa said that the probability of an Earth impact is only one in . 63,000.That means astronomers are 99.9984 per cent certain that it will . miss Earth's orbit. The Gaia satellite will also map our galaxy - the Milky Way, pictured above in near infra-red light . The Earth has frequently been hit by . asteroids - with perhaps the most famous being the impact 65m years ago . that is thought to have contributed to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Another best-known hit was in 1908 when a small asteroid exploded above Siberia with the force of a nuclear bomb. Geologists have also found hundreds of craters from smaller impacts, including one under what is now the North Sea.","Astronomers have been unable to spot asteroids in orbit between the earth and the sun due to powerful radiation from the latter .

A bride who claimed that the cliff-fall death of her husband of just eight days was an accident was charged with murder by a grand jury on Thursday. Jordan Linn Graham will today make a plea to magistrates in a Missoula court against charges of first and second-degree murder and making false statements in the death of Cody L Johnson. In a rage, Graham is said to have pushed Mr Johnson, 25, with both hands in his back, sending him tumbling hundreds of feet over a sheer cliff edge at Glacier National Park in Montana, US. Happier times: Jordan and Cody Johnson got married eight days before she allegedly pushed him to his death . The area is so rugged a helicopter had to be used to recover the body. It emerged recently that a singer . created a custom song for the newlywed couple with lyrics about falling . and climbing up hills that seem spooky to her in light of the court case. Graham, 22, has . been under house arrest and fitted with a GPS monitoring bracelet . while staying at her parents' Kalispell, Montana home. The revelations about the seemingly prophetic song adds another layer of intrigue to the case, as the woman who wrote the song said that she came up with the lyrics based on a series of interviews with the couple before their wedding. 'I used words like ""you helped me to climb higher for a better view, you're my safe place to fall, you never let me go,""' songwriter Elizabeth Shea told CNN. 'Now when I hear those words, it's a little creepy.' Influence: The songwriter says that she interviewed the couple and met with Jordan before coming up with the lyrics, that now seem eerily prophetic in light of the way how Cody died . Jordan Linn Graham, 22, (left) was allegedly having second thoughts about getting married around the time the body of her husband, Cody Lee Johnson, 25, (right) was discovered . Authorities say Graham has admitted to shoving Cody Lee Johnson, 25, off a cliff in Glacier on the night of July 7 during an argument. According to charging documents Graham had been having second thoughts about getting married around the time the body of her husband was discovered. Songwriter: Elizabeth Shea came up with the lyrics based on interviews she had with the couple before the wedding . Prosecutors revealed that an email was allegedly sent from a man named 'Tony' while Graham's husband was still missing. The email, sent three days after Cody Lee Johnson went missing, claimed he had fallen and died after going hiking with three friends. According to the affidavit, the message also suggested 'the search should be called off', according to the Missoulian. Graham (left) 'pushed Johnson (right) with both hands in the back, and as a result, he fell face first off the cliff,' an affidavit states . Jordan Graham, who goes by 'JoJo' is pictured on her wedding day . Family friend Tracey Maness told the Missoulian that Johnson was excited about his wedding and in love with Graham . However, the email was traced to a . computer belonging to Graham's stepfather Steven Rutledge, and it was found . to have been written on the day the gmail account it was sent from was . created, FBI Special Agent Steven Liss said. She made her confession to . police only after this email had been sent. Her . 25-year-old husband died on July 7 and Graham allegedly confessed to . pushing him on July 16, but she wasn't arrested on second-degree murder . charges until Monday. When . she interviewed by the police on July 18, Graham admitted that she had . lied about the death of her husband and provided false statements, . according to ABC News. Graham posted this photo around the time of Cody Johnson's death. She said she was doing some 'modeling' after a night of bowling .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . PUBLISHED: . 11:16 EST, 23 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:34 EST, 23 October 2013 . Execution: Robert Glen Jones Jr was declared dead after being given a lethal injection today . Despite a last-minute hope for an appeal, a robber who killed six people during a two-week crime spree in 1996 was executed by lethal injection this morning. At least 22 relatives of his victims were expected to attend the execution of Robert Glen Jones Jr, who was declared dead at Florence state prison at 10.52am today. The 43-year-old was the second person this year to be put to death in Arizona. Jones was sentenced to death in 1998 after raiding a smoke shop and a firefighters union hall, where he and accomplice Scott Nordstrom shot dead six people. Last-minute appeals based on his lawyer's claims that the original prosecutor withheld evidence during Jones' trial were rejected by the courts. The killer declined the traditional last meal, telling assistant federal defender Dale Baich: 'It's just another meal, and there's nothing special about the day to me.' For the families of his victims, the execution date was welcomed. 'It's about time,' Donna Schoonbeck, whose son-in-law Clarence O'Dell was one of the victims, said. Ms Schoonbeck, 90, is one of the witnesses believed to have watched as the lethal injection was administered. Mr O'Dell, 47, was shot in the back of the head by Jones, who was on parole at the time after a sentence for burglary. 'He had just gone inside the door of the smoke shop when it happened. He didn't deserve that,' Ms Schoonbeck said, adding that Mr O'Dell had two young children. Guilty: Robert Jones, pictured at his murder trial in 1998, has been executed . Comfort: Kay O'Dell and Pat Risedort embrace after Jones was sentenced to death in 1998. Many of his victims' relatives attended the execution today . The sickening crimes had a lasting . impact on the Arizona communities where they were committed. The Arizona . Daily Star reported how Jones remained expressionless at his 1998 . sentencing, refusing to look at any of his victims' relatives. During his time on death row Jones also threatened the daughter of one of his victims after hearing that she had contacted people who knew him. Jones . called Ryanne Costello from jail to threaten her if she continued to . ask his friends questions as the young woman tried to come to terms with the death of her father, Richard Roels. 'There was just nothing there. I almost felt . sorry for him,' Miss Costello, who attended his execution today, said. Loss: Bar tender Carol Lynn Noel, left, trusted customers at the union hall, her daughter Carly, right, said . Victim: Thomas Hardman was one of six people shot dead by Jones and Nordstrom in 1996 . Court records show that Jones had entered Moon Smoke Shop with Nordstrom on May 30, 1996. As well as killing Mr . O'Dell, a second man was wounded and Nordstrom killed another victim who . tried to flee. The two robbers grabbed money from a cash register and fled in a pickup truck being driven by Nordstrom's brother, David. Co-defendant: Scott Nordstrom who took part in the fatal robberies, is on death row . In a separate raid on June 13, Jones and . Nordstrom burst into a Tuscon firefighters union hall, where Jones made three . customers bend forward with their faces flat on the bar before he shot . each one in the back of the head, prosecutors said. A bartender who was ordered to open a safe was shot because she didn't know the correct combination for the lock. The killers, who were convicted of six counts of murder each, were arrested when David Nordstrom contacted the authorities. Along with Mr O'Dell, Jones was found guilty of killing Thomas Hardman, Maribeth Munn, Carol Lynn Noel, and Arthur and Judy Bell. He was given a separate life sentence for killing Mr Roels in Phoenix, then using his credit cards to buy cowboy boots and pizza, USA Today reported. Ms Noel's daughter, Carly Noel-Anderson, has spoken previously of losing her mother, who worked at the union bar. 'My mom loved her job and she was friends with anybody that walked through that door, and trusted, and had confidence about the people of Tucson,' she told Tuscon News Now in 2004. Leann Bell, the daughter of two of Jones's victims, added: 'When these guys are put to death, I can start a new chapter in my life, but I can't start that new chapter in my life, I can't put it to rest until my parents' killers have seen justice.' 'And they haven't seen justice as long as they're breathing air,' she added. Sickening attack: Tuscon police officers stand outside the firefighters union hall in 1996 where Jones lined three victims up at the bar before shooting them in the head . Death row: Jones was kept at Florence State Prison while awaiting his execution . As well as the murder charges Jones was also convicted of attempted first-degree murder, aggravated assault, armed robbery and burglary. Nordstrom remains on death row in Arizona, where 36 people have been executed since the death penalty was reinstated in 1992. The U.S. has put 31 inmates to death this year, according to the Death Penalty Information Center.","More than 20 witnesses watched Robert Glen Jones Jr be put to death .

The parents of the two boys wounded by a seventh-grader who fatally shot their teacher before turning a semi-automatic handgun on himself said today that they don't believe their children were targeted in the schoolyard rampage. Police were interviewing dozens of students who witnessed the shooting as investigators continued to try to unravel the mystery of what motivated the shooter, whom they still have not identified two days after he took his own life on an asphalt basketball court outside Sparks Middle School, Nevada. Sparks police Lt. Erick Thomas said investigators still don't know whether the shooting spree 15 minutes before the start of school on Monday morning was random or targeted specific individuals.

Math teacher Michael Landsberry with his wife Sharon. He was shot dead by a student gunman at the middle school in Sparks, Nevada as he tried to intervene . But parents of the two 12-year-olds recovering from gunshot wounds said they don't think they were singled out. One said her son was trying to help the dying teacher, Michael Landsberry, when he was shot in the abdomen with a bullet that exited his back. 'We do not believe he was in any way the target in this shooting,' Jenifer Davis told reporters outside Renown Regional Medical Center, where she said her son Mason was 'doing well ... in good spirits, although saddened by the loss of his friend, Mr Landsberry'. She said: 'On Monday morning Mason was hit with a bullet to the abdomen which exited through his backside. 'From what we've learned from others at the scene, Mason's first instinct was to intervene and he did all he could to help Mr. Landsberry. 'It is my understanding that he was trying to help Mr. Landsberry at the time he was shot.' Mrs Davis also told Kolo8: 'I just need to add as a result of this incident I will be getting involved with issues around gun safety in the hopes of preventing this kind of situation in the future,' Jenifer Davis, whose son Mason was shot in the stomach, said today he was injured by the teenage gunman while coming to the fatally wounded teacher's help . Wounded: A student is loaded into an ambulance after being shot at Sparks Middle School. Two 12-year-olds were wounded in the shooting, both are expected to survive . A parent of the other boy, who was shot . in the shoulder, declined to be identified or speak with reporters but . said in a statement released by the hospital, 'We do not believe our son . was a target in this shooting.' Students, staff, local church leaders . and others planned a candlelight vigil Wednesday night outside the . school in a working-class neighborhood about 5 miles northeast of . downtown Reno. Investigators . have confirmed the 12-year-old shooter acted alone, Thomas said, but . little else since Landsberry, a 45-year-old math teacher and ex-Marine, . was killed while trying to talk the boy into turning over his weapon. 'We're . still investigating how this all happened. We are investigating the . motives, all the facts and circumstances that both led up to it and were . involved in it,' Thomas told The Associated Press on Wednesday.

Michael Landsberry's reputation as a big fan of Batman figures prominently in the makeshift memorial in front of Sparks Middle School . 'It's a very complicated investigation as far as the number of witnesses and the seriousness of the crime,' he added. Thomas, . the lead investigator in the case that also involves Reno police and . Washoe County School District police, said he couldn't comment on some . reports from fellow students that bullying may have played a role in the . shooting. 'I can't release any information on any provocation or anything like that,' he said. Adding to the mystery surrounding the case is the fact that police have refused to release the shooter's identity. Mr Landsberry is a former Marine who was popular with his students at Sparks Middle School . The Reno Gazette-Journal published an editorial on its front page Wednesday calling for police to immediately identify the 12-year-old so the circumstances that led to the shooting might be better understood. To do otherwise was a violation of state law, the newspaper said. Media organizations, including The Associated Press, have filed formal public record requests for the boy's name. Sparks City Attorney Chet Adams said Wednesday he believes Nevada law exempts information concerning juveniles from public records laws. But he said that even if it didn't, police have not completed their investigation or 'generated any document that would be considered a ''record'' subject to dissemination.' 'Moreover, releasing the requested information will hinder the (Police) Department's ability to thoroughly investigate the incident and draw accurate findings about Monday's events,' Adams said in a statement. Thomas confirmed the investigation extends to the boy's home, where he apparently obtained the gun - something police acknowledged could lead to prosecution of his parents or other adults if they knowingly made it available to the boy. He said he couldn't provide any information as to whether the gun was locked up. 'We're continuing to investigate the weapon and where it was obtained and how it was obtained,' Thomas said. Sparks Middle School in Nevada was closed for the rest of the week after a student opened fire before the start of classes on Monday .","Mother Jenifer Davis said her son Mason was doing well but was saddened by the death of his teacher Michael Landsberry .

Four Lithuanian men charged with murder of Italian Joele Leotta, 19, who died 10 days after coming to the UK . An Italian waiter who  described his new life in Britain as ‘perfect’ was beaten to death just days after arriving. Joele Leotta, 20, who came to the UK to improve his English, was sharing a flat with a friend and had already found a job in an Italian restaurant. But on Sunday night a group of men are said to have kicked down the door to the flat before launching a savage attack on Joele and his friend. Up to seven men are said to have kicked and punched the pair and neighbours heard loud shouting’ in a foreign language. Joele was taken to hospital but doctors were unable to save him. His friend, Alex Galbiati, was taken to another hospital and is believed to be recovering. It is not known what caused the dispute between the Italian pair and the men, believed to be from Eastern Europe and thought to live in the flat on the floor above them. Joele had travelled from the village of Nibionno, near Milan, on October 14 and found a job as a waiter at the Vesuvius Italian restaurant in Maidstone, Kent. He had hoped living in the UK would improve his English. He and Mr Galbiati rented the middle-floor flat of the three-storey Victorian terrace building above the restaurant. Days before he died, he wrote on Facebook that everything in the UK was ‘perfect’. ‘I’m in England. I’m trying to get settled,’ he wrote. ‘I’ve found work in  an Italian restaurant with Neapolitan origins and now I’m learning to be a waiter :) I’m getting to know Italians who work with me. Truly everything is perfect.’ Police cordon: Officers have taped off the Vesuvius restaurant (at the right of the picture) in Maidstone, Kent, while the investigation continues . Joele’s grief-stricken father Ivan and mother flew to London in the wake of the attack. ‘The only thing that is certain is that my son has been killed,’ Mr Leotta said yesterday. ‘He had only arrived a week ago.

Driver: Businessman Darren Jarvis, pictured arriving at Cardiff Crown Court, is charged with causing death by dangerous driving after a road traffic accident which left Jacek Stawski & Lee Williams dead . A businessman whose car number plate read 'Who's bad' lost control on a country lane while showing off his sports car at 100mph and killed two married fathers, a court has heard. Property developer Darren Jarvis, 42, was driving friend Lee Williams in his white turbo-charged Nissan Skyline sports car when he lost control. Cardiff Crown Court heard Jarvis span across the road and crashed into a Citroen Xsara driven by Jacek Stawski. Mr Williams, 40, and 38-year-old Mr Stawksi - both married with two children - were killed 'almost instantly' in the horror smash in Cwmbach, south Wales, in August last year. But Mr Stawski's four-year-old-son Thomas miraculously survived in the back seat of the family car. Prosecutor Nicholas Jones said Jarvis was speeding at 100mph on a winding road to show off in the £30,000 3.8 litre turbo sports car. He said that although the car's number plate was WHO6 BAD, a screw had been put through the number six to make the registration read 'Who's bad' from a distance. Mr Jones told the court: 'Jarvis and his passenger Mr Williams were at the head of a line of traffic - there was no one in front of them. 'Jarvis put his foot down and accelerated hard. 'Witnesses behind them in cars heard the sound of the exhaust and saw dust and gravel being kicked up by the wheels. 'As he came around the bend he started to lose control and the nearside wheels hit the kerb and went onto the grass verge for some distance until the car started to spin. Tragic: Lee Williams, who was a passenger in Darren Jarvis's car when it crashed was killed almost instantly . Victim: Father of two Jacek Stawski (pictured) was in another car that was hit head on in the collision. He was also killed in the crash . 'A woman was coming the other way and she swerved and managed to avoid the car somehow as it came across the road. 'Mr Stawski behind her was not so lucky.' Witnesses said Jarvis was 'frantically' trying to wrestle back control of the speeding car as he span into the oncoming traffic. Mr Stawski was driving well below the 60mph speed limit with son Thomas in the back seat when his family saloon was hit 'broadside' by the spinning sports car. Mr Jones said: 'The Citroen had almost stopped when the crash occurred. 'It was struck with such great force to the front that it was knocked backwards and spun 180 degrees. 'Both Mr Williams and Mr Stawski suffered the full impact of the collision and were declared dead within minutes of the paramedics arriving.' Personalised: The sports car driven by Jarvis had the number plate 'WHO6 BAD' Father-of-two Jarvis, of Radyr, Cardiff, was airlifted to hospital. He was treated for broken ribs, internal bleeding and spinal injuries and released after five days in hospital. When interviewed by police he said he couldn't remember anything. Mr Jones told the jury: 'There seems to be two issues Jarvis relies on. Sports car: Mr Jarvis was driving a Nissan Skyline, similar to the car pictured . 'First that he may have had some sort of fit or seizure during the crash, and second that the crash speed was considerably lower than the 100 mph. 'Our case is that he put his foot down as fast as he could and probably to show off to the passenger in his car. 'This was a case of deliberate acceleration and dangerous driving.' Jarvis denies two charges of causing death by dangerous driving. Nissan claims that the top speed of the 3.8litre Skyline is 193mph. The trial continues.

However, they didn't ruled out suing Polk County schools or the parents of two girls who were arrested in connection with Sedwick's death. Norman and her attorneys spoke today at a press conference after an attorney for one of the girls, 14-year-old Guadalupe Shaw, entered a written not-guilty plea on her behalf.

Tragic death: Rebecca Sedwick committed suicide after a months-long bullying campaign against her . Shaw will next appear in court on October 29 for a pretrial conference. According to the Orlando Sentinel, Norman hired prominent law firm Morgan & Morgan to review the evidence for possible civil suits. Among the attorneys representing Rebecca Sedwick's mother, Tricia Norman, is former Governor Charlie Crist. Norman's attorneys said at a news conference today that they plan to establish a website to help her raise money to pay for funeral costs. Any additional funds will be used for anti-bullying causes. Two of Sedwick's schoolmates, Shaw and 12-year-old Katelyn Roman, who deputies say were primarily responsible for the bullying, were arrested last week. They were charged with stalking. Shaw and Roman have been . accused by officials of cyber-bullying Rebecca Sedwick to the point . she committed suicide by jumping from a tower at a concrete plant. Big issue: Former Florida Governor Charlie Crist (left) talks about the need to protect the vulnerable from bullying by new technology, in Tampa, Florida . Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd says the two girls 'repeatedly and viciously' harrassed Rebecca at Crystal Lake Middle School in Lakeland, forcing her to switch schools. Sedwick had no relief from the bullying at her new school though, because the girls would allegedly taunt her through social media and her cell phone . It has emerged that the family of Katelyn Roman has also hired a prominent lawyer, Jose Baez. Baez represented Casey Anthony in her trial for the murder of her daughter. Meanwhile, Shaw's parents have their own worries after step-mother Vivian Vosburg, 30, was arrested last week after a video of her punching two fighting children and screaming profanities allegedly emerged on Facebook. Appearing this weekend in front of a Polk County judge, Ms Vosburg was charged with two counts of child abuse with bodily harm and four counts of child neglect, according to the Polk County Sheriff's Office.

'Yes IK [I know] I bullied REBECCA nd [sic] she killed her self but IDGAF [I don't give a f***],' Ms Shaw allegedly posted. Rebecca was 'terrorized' by . as many as 15 girls who ganged up on her and picked on her for months . through online message boards and texts. She jumped to her death from a tower at an abandoned concrete plant on September 10. Judd said they decided to arrest Shaw after she posted the message on Saturday. 'We decided that we can't leave her out there. Who else is she going to torment, who else is she going to harass?' he said. Roman was Rebecca's former best friend, but Judd said the . 14-year-old turned her against Rebecca. Other girls also stopped . being friends with her in fear of being bullied, the sheriff said. Missed: Rebecca Sedwick took her own life after being relentlessly bullied . 'Several students corroborated stories of both girls bullying Sedwick on . different occasions, through name-calling, intimidation, threats to beat . her up, and at least one actual physical fight,' the sheriff said today. He warned parents in a news conference: 'Watch what your children do online. Pay attention to what your kids are doing. Quit being their best friend and be their best parent.' Roman and Shaw were . arrested on Monday night and detained at the county's juvenile center . before being released to their parents, the Orlando Sentinel reports. They were charged with felony aggravated stalking. It is believed the bullying started when Shaw started dating Rebecca's ex-boyfriend. Witnesses told investigators she sent messages to Rebecca, calling her ugly, telling her to 'drink bleach and die', and encouraging her to kill herself. Sedwick's computer searches revealed she had searched for ways to commit suicide and asked questions like, 'What is overweight for a 13-year-old girl' . One of the Florida girl's screensavers also showed Rebecca with her head resting on a railroad track. She changed one of her online screen names to 'That Dead Girl.' She messaged a boy: 'I'm jumping.' Devastated: Rebecca Ann Sedwick, 12, pictured with her mother Tricia Norman, is believed to have jumped from an abandoned cement silo .

'She . appeared to be beat down. She appeared to have a defeatist attitude. And quite frankly, the entire investigation is exceptionally . disturbing.' Even when her mother took Rebecca out of school, the bullying was carried out online. The bullying started . over a boy last year at Crystal Lake Middle School and at one point she . was suspended for fighting with another student - believed to be Roman. Last December, . Rebecca was hospitalized for three days after cutting her wrists because . of what she said was bullying, according to the sheriff.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:07 EST, 24 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:49 EST, 24 October 2013 . A drone operator has revealed the emotional toll years of remotely aiming missiles at people on the other side of the world has had on him. For more than five years Brandon Bryant worked as a U.S. Air Force drone operator, firing missiles remotely from a Nevada base. But the 27-year-old said watching the grisly consequences of his actions unfold on a computer screen led to drinking, depression and finally a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder. Haunted: Brandon Bryant is suffering from PTSD after years of working as a drone operator . 'I can see every little pixel if I just close my eyes,' Mr Bryant, who believes he is responsible for more than 1,600 fatal hits, said. His experiences have been shared as two human rights groups raised serious concerns about the consequences of drone strikes in Yemen and Pakistan, CNN reported. While the U.S. argues that the strikes are vital in the fight against terror, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have said some attacks, which have killed scores of civilians, could amount to war crimes. For Mr Bryant, who described being in 'zombie mode' as he monitored drone cameras, the effect of the strikes caused personal problems because he could never escape the deadly impact of his work. The Montana native, who signed up to the Air Force when he was 19, made his first kill in 2007, an event he remembers in vivid detail. After aiming a Hellfire missile at three men on a dirt road in Afghanistan, Mr Bryant watched the aftermath unfold on a monitor. Control room: Drone operators are surrounded by screens showing targets and confirmed hits . Destructive: Residents look at a burned car hit by a drone in Yemen. The U.S. says the strikes are vital but human rights groups disagree . Spike: A graph shows the rise in drone attacks in Afghanistan (blue) and Yemen (yellow) under Presidents Bush and Obama . 'The smoke clears, and there's pieces of the two guys around the crater. And there's this guy over here, and he's missing his right leg above his knee,' he said in a November article for GQ. 'He's rolling around, and the blood is squirting out of his leg, and it's hitting the ground, and it's hot. His blood is hot,' Mr Bryant said. 'It took him a long time to die. I just watched him. I watched him become the same color as the ground he was lying on.' While the U.S. continues to back its drone program, even under international criticism, Mr Bryant said remotely operating the devices led to his decision to quit the air force and turn down a $109,000 bonus. Horror: Bryant says he finds it hard to relate to others after years of watching grisly drone strkes . 'People say that drone strikes are like mortar attacks,' he told NBC News. 'Well, artillery doesn't see this ... It's really more intimate for us, because we see everything.' As Mr Bryant came near to the end of his drone service he was presented with what amounted to a score card showing the number of fatal hits he had made. 'I would’ve been happy if they never even showed me the piece of paper. I've seen American soldiers die, innocent people die, and insurgents die. And it's not pretty. It's not something that I want to have - this diploma,' he said. Among the many upsetting scenes Mr Bryant witnessed was an incident when his drone recorded insurgents burying a roadside bomb in the path of U.S. soldiers. 'We had no way to warn the troops,' he said, adding that three servicemen were killed after driving over the device. Detached: Drones may be operated remotely but the servicemen controlling them see the results of strikes firsthand . He also remains haunted by the image of a small figure running towards a building he had just aimed at in Afghanistan. Mr Bryant was convinced the figure was a child, but his superiors told him it was a dog. He claims that in the final report of the strike, neither a child or dog was mentioned. His experiences left Mr Bryant 'feeling like a sociopath', he said. 'I don’t feel like I can really interact with that average, everyday person. I get too frustrated, because A) they don't realize what's going on over there. And B) they don't care.'","Brandon Bryant left with post traumatic stress disorder after six years of watching horrific injuries and deaths caused by strikes .

Ohio officials suggest in a new report it's possible Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro may have died of auto-erotic asphyxiation, not suicide. A report from the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction says Castro's pants and underwear were pulled down to his ankles when he was found. It also says Castro did not leave a suicide note and 'multiple levels of assessment' did not find tendency toward suicide. Monster: Ariel Castro kept three young girls captive in his house, torturing and raping them for over a decade, before he was found dead after having been in prison for a month . The state forwarded those facts to police to consider the possibility of auto-erotic asphyxiation, whereby individuals achieve sexual satisfaction by briefly choking themselves into near unconsciousness. The report also says two prison guards falsified logs documenting their observation of Castro in the hours before he killed himself. The report says video indicates no checks were done on Castro at least eight times before he died. Earlier details about his death, which was originally believed to be a suicide, revealed that he had a handwritten list of Bible verses and the names of all of his children and grandchildren. Victims: Amanda Berry (left) and Gina DeJesus . (right) are two of the three women who were held captive by Castro for . about ten years each. Berry is the one who escaped and got police to the . scene . Strong: Michelle Knight was the third victim and the only one to speak at his sentencing . A Bible open to the book of John was also found when prison guards discovered his lifeless body hanging from a hinge from his cell window using a bedsheet. Franklin County Coroner Jan Gorniak said she's awaiting toxicology results before issuing a final report on Castro's September 3 suicide. The preliminary notes indicate he suffered from hardening of the arteries. The significance of why he had the Book of John open at the time of his death is unknown, but some of the more prominent stories told in that section of the Bible include descriptions of the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus. Castro, 53, pleaded guilty in August to nearly 1,000 counts related to his imprisonment of three women in his Cleveland home for a decade, including aggravated murder – for forcing one of the victims to miscarry – kidnapping, rape and other crimes. Castro kidnapped the women – Michelle Knight, Amanda Berry, and Gina DeJesus – between 2002 and 2004 when they were 14, 16 and 20 years old. Berry escaped on May 6 and alerted authorities, at first bringing joy to the city where they had become household names after years of searches and vigils, then despair as details of their treatment emerged. Castro's suicide is the subject of three prison reviews. Two, looking at the circumstances of his death and at mental and medical health treatment he received beforehand, are due at month's end. Shame: Investigations into Castro's death are still underway . A third review is being done by two nationally known prison conditions experts. That review, announced this week, also examines the Aug. 4 suicide of death row inmate Billy Slagle three days before his scheduled execution.The study, due November 15, will also examine prison suicides over the past two years and make recommendations for any changes to the state's policies and procedures for stopping inmates from killing themselves.","Ariel Castro was found dead in his prison cell on September 3, just over a month after he was sentenced to a life sentence plus 1,000 years in jail .

The shocking news came after German newspaper Der Spiegel published a detailed report analyzing a document leaked by Edward Snowden. It alleges that the US National Security Agency (NSA) has a division called 'Tailored Access Operations' (TAO), meant for difficult missions. It claims that the TAO published a report in 2010 saying it 'successfully exploited a key mail server in the Mexican Presidencia domain within the Mexican Presidential network to gain first-ever access to President Felipe Calderon's public email account.' The NSA allegedly hacked into the public email account of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, seen in this 2012 file photo, while he was in office. The operation was reportedly known as 'Flatliquid' by the NSA . The NSA's reportedly said the email domain was also used by cabinet members, providing 'insight into Mexico's political system and internal stability.' The operation was known as 'Flatliquid,' Der Spiegel adds, and is believed to be the source of increased tension between the US and Mexico. The files' existence was initially revealed by journalist Glenn Greenwald in September, The Daily Dot notes. Greenwald told a Brazilian TV channel that he had a Powerpoint presentation given to him by Snowden, showing how the NSA intercepted emails and text messages. Pena Nieto, Calderon's successor, was spied on by the NSA even before his July 2012 election, The Daily Dot adds. The NSA allegedly looked into his emails. In the wake of this revelation, Nieto reportedly summoned the American ambassador, seeking an investigation. Emails belonging to Mexican President Pena Nieto, seen here in a file photo with US President Obama, were also allegedly hacked by the NSA even before his July 2012 election . Der Spiegel's goes on to say cell phone communications between Nieto and nine of his associates were analyzed. Using a database called 'DishFire,' contact information for select individuals was singled out and spied on. An alleged 85,489 text messages were intercepted by the NSA using this technology. Mexico is not the only Latin American country to be spied on by the NSA. 'The communication methods and associated selectors of Brazilian President Dilma Rouseff and her key advisers' were also spied on, the paper adds. In the wake of the allegations, Rouseff cancelled a trip to Washington earlier this fall. Der Spiegel claims that Rouseff believes Washington's espionage is based on economic reasons. Other leaked documents allegedly reveal that the US spied on communications at oil company Petrobas, which the Brazilian government has a stake in, the paper adds.

Scores of Australians have evacuated their homes in mountains west of Sydney as intensifying winds fanned wildfires that have ravaged the region for days. As they fled, fire investigators today claimed the largest of the wildfires that have ravaged New South Wales this week was sparked by a military training exercise. The massive fire near the city of Lithgow, west of Sydney, began on October 16 at a nearby Defense Department training area and 'was started as a result of live ordnance exercises' at the army range, the Rural Fire Service said in a statement. The fire has burned 47,000 hectares (180 square miles) and destroyed several houses, but no injuries or deaths have been reported in the blaze. Scroll down for video .

Mr Greg Keightly, a wildlife rescue co-ordinator in the Blue Mountains, said burned animals that had managed to emerge from their destroyed habitat included wallabies, possums, lizards, echidnas and birds. 'Many are distressed, they've been burned and they've been badly affected by smoke,' he said as volunteers treated the animals.

A killer who used a crossbow to murder a man on his own doorstep over a £6,000 drugs debt was today sentenced to 24 years in prison. Russell Gill shot a metal crossbow into the heart of Darrell Farnham 'with unerring accuracy' in what jurors were told was a 'Medieval-style execution'. The jury had previously heard that Mr Farnham, 44, managed to slam shut the front door . before yanking the arrow out. Russell Gill (left) shot Darrell Farnham (right) in the heart with a crossbow in a 'Medieval-style execution' The bolt had penetrated eight inches into his chest and Mr Farnham then bled to death. Gill was jailed today after a jury reached a majority verdict on the murder charge at Reading Crown Court. Judge John Reddihough told him: 'There is no justification whatsoever for the drastic steps you took to end his life. 'You took a lethal weapon and pointed it at the deceased’s chest and killed him. 'The sentence has to be one of life imprisonment and I have found you must serve a minimum period of 24 years before you can be considered for release on parole.' The crossbow bolt penetrated eight inches into Mr Farnham's chest . The judge compared a crossbow with a . firearm telling the defendant: 'In my judgement it is akin to a firearm . if used at short range as was the case here. 'A bolt fired at somebody’s chest with a cross bow is really not dissimilar to the effect of firing a gun at somebody’s chest.' Gill had denied murder, saying he fired the crossbow by mistake after he took it to threaten Mr Farnham over a £6,000 pounds debt he owed to him. The jury had previously heard how police officers and paramedics were powerless to save Mr Farnham’s life after the crossbow bolt penetrated his heart. Gill was a former tenant at Mr Farnham’s house in Aylesbury. After his arrest, he told police Mr Farnham was a bully and 'out to get him' over a £6,000 pounds drug debt he owed to him because of his addiction to amphetamine. Gill had told someone earlier that night that he 'would get to him first' and had brandished the crossbow and a Samurai sword in the garage of his nearby home. He told the 15-year-old witness, who cannot be named for legal reasons, that 'this will kill him' as he brandished the high velocity weapon. Gill cycled the short distance to Mr Farnham’s house armed with the crossbow and sword with the intention of killing Mr Farnham at 10.30pm on June 23. Gill claimed he fired the weapon by mistake after Mr Farnham’s crossbreed dog, Princess, bit him on the leg while the pair argued on his doorstep. He had admitted manslaughter but jurors disbelieved his version of events and convicted him of the more serious charge. Gill cycled to Mr Farnham's house with the crossbow and a Samurai sword before murdering him on his doorstep . Forensic officer's at the scene of Mr Farnham's murder in June . Detective Superintendent Chris Ward, investigating officer for Thames Valley Police, said Gill had pre-planned the murder with 'the most lethal of weapons imaginable'. 'The victim, Darrell Farnham, had no way of defending himself against this attack and the jury have made their conviction on overwhelming evidence,' he said. 'I hope that this conviction can help Darrell’s family and friends come to terms with what has happened and offer some closure to them.' In a statement, Mr Farnham's family said: 'We are satisfied with the verdict of murder, and that justice has been carried out. 'Gill is a cold, dangerous and evil man, who killed Darrell in his own home with calculation and precision, providing no opportunity for self-defence. 'Gill has shown no remorse or sadness for this terrible act but attempted throughout the trial to justify his actions and destroy the reputation of Darrell and thus causing further distress to Darrell’s family members. 'Gill left Darrell to die and then proceeded to carry out his day to day life without a second thought for his actions. 'We are devastated in the way Darrell was taken from us at a young age in such a tragic way, and words cannot express the pain and grief we feel. 'His partner, parents, sisters and daughter have to live with this every day and find it hard to come to terms that another human being has taken Darrell’s life. 'This terrible act not only took Darrell’s life but has taken the laughter and joy from our family, and our lives will never be the same again.'","Russell Gill fired the crossbow bolt into Darrell Farnham's heart .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:23 EST, 23 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:53 EST, 23 October 2013 . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers may try to save him from the death penalty in the Boston Marathon bombing trial by arguing he fell under the murderous influence of his older brother, legal experts say. The outlines of a possible defense came into focus this week when it was learned that Tsarnaev's attorneys are trying to get access to investigative records implicating the now-dead brother in a grisly triple slaying committed in 2011. In court papers Monday, federal prosecutors acknowledged publicly for the first time that a friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev told investigators that Tamerlan participated in the unsolved killings of three men who were found in a Waltham apartment with their throats slit, marijuana sprinkled over their bodies. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (pictured left) is trying to be saved from the death penalty - by arguing he fell under the muderous influence of his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right) Tsarnaev's lawyers argued in court papers that any evidence of Tamerlan's involvement is 'mitigating information' that is critical as they prepare Dzhokhar's defense. They asked a judge to force prosecutors to turn over the records. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, faces 30 federal charges, including using a weapon of mass destruction, in the twin bombings April 15 that killed three people and injured more than 260. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died in a gunbattle with police days later. The government is still deciding whether to pursue the death penalty for the attack, which investigators say was retaliation for the U.S. wars in Muslim lands. Miriam Conrad, Tsarnaev's public defender, had no comment. Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said the defense may be trying to show that the older brother was the guiding force. Massachusetts State Police are pictured on April 19, 2013, in the aftermath of the Boston Marathan bombing . 'If I was a defense attorney and was seeking perhaps to draw attention to the influence the older brother had in planning the bombing, I would use his involvement in other crimes to show that he was likely the main perpetrator in the Boston bombing,' Dieter said. 'I would take the position that my client, the younger brother, was strongly influenced by his older brother, and even if he is culpable, the death penalty is too extreme in this case.' Similarly, Aitan D. Goelman, who was part of the legal team that prosecuted Oklahoma City bombing figures Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, said the defense may be looking to minimize the younger brother's role in the bombing. 'I think the mostly likely reason is that if they are arguing some kind of mitigation theory that the older brother was a monster and the younger brother was under his sway or intimidated or dominated by him,' he said. Investigators have given no motive for the 2011 slayings. One victim was a boxer and friend of Tamerlan Tsarnaev's. Federal prosecutors said in court papers that Ibragim Todashev, another friend of Tamerlan's, told authorities that Tamerlan took part in the killings. Todashev was shot to death in Florida in May by authorities while being questioned. Prosecutors argued that turning over the records would damage the investigation into the killings.","Older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev allegedly participated in the unsolved killings of three men in 2011 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:28 EST, 23 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:41 EST, 23 October 2013 . A woman who nearly drowned during a school swimming lesson 13 years ago has won a landmark ruling from the UK’s highest court which paves the way for her to pursue compensation from a local education authority. Annie Woodland was a pupil at Whitmore Junior School in Basildon, Essex, when she had to be pulled from the water and resuscitated at Gloucester Park pool in July 2000. Miss Woodland, now in her 20s and living with her family in Blackpool, suffered severe brain damage as a result of which she is now incapable of looking after her own affairs. Ruling: Annie Woodland was left brain damage after she nearly drowned during a school swimming lesson as a 10-year-old in 2000. Following a landmark Supreme Court ruling her family have been told they can sue Essex County Council for compensation . Her father Ian launched a claim for compensation on her behalf against the local education authority, Essex County Council, and other parties. To date the family has suffered setbacks to the damages claim with rulings in the High Court and Court of Appeal which blocked her action against the county council. In October 2011 a High Court judge threw out Miss Woodland’s claim against Essex on the basis that it was bound to fail, and in March last year his view was backed in a majority ruling by Court of Appeal judges. However, today, Supreme Court justices in London allowed her appeal against those findings which means that there will now be a High Court hearing to determine whether or not she was the victim of negligence. Five justices unanimously allowed the appeal and ruled that the local authority owed a 'non-delegable duty of care'. Lawyers acting for Miss Woodland said before the ruling that the Supreme Court’s decision was 'anxiously anticipated by parents and local education authorities alike'. At previous hearings lawyers argued that Essex had a non-delegable duty of care 'in the capacity loco parentis'. When the case was dealt with in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Tomlinson and Lord Justice Kitchin said that given the circumstances, it would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose the non-delegable duty upon the authority. Lord Justice Tomlinson added that the . imposition of such liability would be likely to have a chilling effect . on the willingness of education authorities to provide valuable . educational experiences for their pupils. It . would have significant implications not just for all education . authorities but also for all those who operated schools and hospitals . and, he suspected, all those who operated institutions which provided . what might loosely be described as education or healthcare. Care: The Supreme Court ruled that Essex County Council owed a 'non-delegable duty of care' as Annie's parents had entrusted their daughter to her school . The county council was obliged under the National Curriculum to provide its pupils with swimming lessons and it organised regular sessions at a local pool owned by Basildon Council. The teaching of the swimming lessons were contracted out. Lawyers acting for Miss Woodland argued that the school owed her a duty of care covering all mainstream activities, which applied even where third parties were contracted to provide teaching. The issue before the Supreme Court justices at a hearing in July related to the criteria to be applied in 'determining the circumstances in which a school’s duty to its pupils under the National Curriculum can be delegated'. Ruling that the local authority owed a 'non-delegable duty of care', Lord Sumption said parents were required to entrust their child to a school and had no influence over arrangements a school may make to delegate or over the competence of 'delegates'. He concluded that if third parties were found to be negligent. Essex County Council would be in breach of a duty of care. Lady Hale said the decision was a 'development of the law' and avoided the 'unsatisfactory possibility' that one child could sue but another could not. Miss Woodland’s mother, Alison Morris, said she was 'greatly relieved that justice has been done'. She said: 'It should never have come to this in the first place. No child should suffer in this way. This ruling will make such a difference to families in the future.' Ms Woodland’s father Ian posed the question: 'How could the school not be responsible for our daughter during a national curriculum lesson? 'Yet everywhere we turned, we were let down. We are so glad that our lawyers at Pannone continued to support us and put so much effort into getting this judgment in Annie’s favour. 'I hope that, in the light of this judgment, no other family has to go through the same as we have done.' Relief: Annie's parents Ian Woodland and Alison Morris, shown with a photograph of their daughter, said they were 'greatly relieved that justice has been done', and that they hoped no other family would have to endure what they had been through . Lord Sumption said the appeal arose . out of a 'tragic incident' when Ms Woodland was 10. She got into . difficulties during a lesson and was described as being found 'hanging . vertically in the water'. One . of the allegations is that her injuries were due to the negligence of a . swimming teacher and a lifeguard, neither of whom were employed by the . education authority. Lord Sumption said their services had been provided to the authority by Beryl Stopford, 'an independent contractor who carried on an unincorporated business under the name of Direct Swimming Services, and had contracted with the education authority to provide swimming lessons to its pupils'. The challenge before the court related to Miss Woodland’s claim that the council owed her a 'non-delegable duty of care' with the result 'that it is liable at law' for any negligence on the part of the swimming teacher and lifeguard. Lord Sumption said: 'The courts should be sensitive about imposing unreasonable financial burdens on those providing critical public services. 'A non-delegable duty of care should be imputed to schools only so far as it would be fair, just and reasonable to do so.' However, he said he did not accept 'that any unreasonable burden would be cast on them' by recognising the existence of a non-delegable duty on criteria which 'are consistent with the long-standing policy of the law' to 'protect those who are both inherently vulnerable and highly dependent on the observance of proper standards of care by those with a significant degree of control.' Referring to Ms Woodland’s case, Lord Sumption concluded: 'The alleged negligence occurred in the course of the very functions which the school assumed an obligation to perform and delegated to its contractors. 'It must follow that if the latter were negligent in performing those functions and the child was injured as a result, the educational authority is in breach of duty.'","Annie Woodland wins a landmark ruling from Supreme Court .

The green taxes that account for nearly 10 per cent of spiralling energy bills will be ‘rolled back’ before the next election, David Cameron pledged yesterday. He shocked MPs by announcing that the Government is to tear up environmental levies which add £112 a year to the average household’s annual bills. The move prompted consternation among his Lib Dem coalition colleagues, who accused him of a ‘panicky U-turn’. The Prime Minister gave them only half an hour’s notice of the announcement. David Cameron shocked MPs by announcing the Government is to tear up environmental levies, which add £112 a year to the average household's annual bills. The move prompted consternation among Lib Dems . Senior sources told the Mail that environmental schemes seen as important – such as offering pensioners and those with energy-inefficient homes help with insulation – were likely to be switched to general taxation. Others could be scrapped altogether. Mr Cameron’s dramatic announcement came as he faced rising pressure to act on inflation-busting increases in gas and electricity bills. Labour leader Ed Miliband has proposed a 1970s-style, 20-month price freeze to be imposed on energy firms, while former  Conservative prime minister Sir John Major this week suggested a windfall tax on their profits. Instead, Mr Cameron told the Commons that household bills were at ‘unacceptable levels’– and green taxes would have to give. ‘We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down,’ he told MPs. ‘We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills. ‘I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place.’ Details of the measures were scant yesterday. But they are likely to form part of Chancellor George Osborne’s autumn statement on December 4. Number 10 sources insisted they would be put in place before the election in 2015. The Prime Minister also announced a new annual review of competition in the energy sector, a move aides said could lead to the break up of the six big energy giants. Downing Street sources said green taxes would account for 14 per cent of bills by 2020, or £194 a year for the average household, and Labour’s plan to sign up to further commitments to reduce carbon emissions would add another £125 a year. They rejected the charge of an overnight U-turn, pointing out that Mr Osborne had been speaking publicly of the need to rein in environmental levies for 18 months. Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was a far cry from Mr Cameron's old invitation to 'vote blue, go green' But Mr Miliband, who introduced a series of environmental levies as Energy Secretary in the last government, said it was a far cry from Mr Cameron’s old invitation to ‘vote blue, go green’. A senior Lib Dem said: ‘Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked up policies in front of us. ‘But we will not allow a panicky . U-turn during PMQs to dictate Government policy. The way to provide . stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the . hoof.’ In the Commons, . Mr Miliband also raised a Number 10 aide’s hastily withdrawn response . last week, in which he agreed people might consider ‘wearing woolly . jumpers’ to help bring energy bills down, though the aide said Mr . Cameron would never ‘prescribe’ such advice. Number . 10 said the Prime Minister had ‘never said it, never thought it’ and it . was ‘totally inappropriate’ for Mr Miliband to raise it. Four in five low income households are worried about the cost of heating their homes this winter, according to Citizens’ Advice. It . added that two in three poorer families and pensioners are being forced . to live in cold conditions because they cannot afford to put the . heating on.","David Cameron under pressure to act after tax call from Sir John Major .

Expelled: Pupil Leonarda Dibrani was detained on a schoolbus and told to leave France along with the rest of her family . A 15-year-old girl who was detained on a schoolbus and expelled from France has turned down an offer to return to the country - unless the rest of her family can come with her. Earlier this week Leonarda Dibrani was detained by police as she got off a bus . from a school trip. The schoolgirl was then expelled from France along with the rest of her family, who entered the country illegally in 2009. Today president Francois Hollande spoke on national television to say the girl could return to France to study - but her family must remain in Kosovo where they are being persecuted for being Roma. Leonarda refused the offer - and accused Hollande of having 'no heart'. The unusual case has caused outrage across the country - with some left-wing and green politicians comparing the incident to the roundups of Jews under Nazi occupation. The story has since become more . complicated, with the girl's father admitting he lied in his asylum . application when he said the entire family fled Kosovo, where they were . persecuted for being Roma, or gypsies. Leonarda, and most of her . siblings, were born in Italy, though they do not have Italian . citizenship. A government . report found that the police followed the law, although . the report said they didn't seem to realise the sensitivity of what they . were doing. Hollande went today tried to walk the line between maintaining a tough stance on illegal immigrants and showing compassion for the girl caught up in the storm. Refusal: Leonarda, pictured with her younger sister Medina, has snubbed Hollande's offer for her to return to the country to study unless the rest of her family can come with her . Family: Leonarda, second right, with her family - from left: mother Xhemile, father Resat and sisters Medina, centre, and Ljaria, right, near to their shelter in Kosovo . He said Leonarda, considering the circumstances of her detention, could come back to France to go to school, if she wishes. But only she can come back. He said: 'She will be welcomed back, and her alone.' In Mitrovica, Kosovo, where the family is now living, Leonarda told reporters she would not come back without her family. Her father threatened to return to France, even if it was illegal. She said: 'Mr Hollande has no heart for my family? He has no pity?' She had earlier said that she was deeply ashamed when the police took her away in front of her classmates. Her words come as police in Kosovo say the girls parents, Resat and Dzemila Dibrani, were accosted Sunday by another Roma couple. Vulnerable: The family, Leonarda and brother Ronaldo pictured, are being persecuted for being Roma in Kosovo - and the girl's parents were recently attacked . Dzemila, who was briefly hospitalized before being discharged, sustained unspecified injuries when the Roma man inquired about the fate of a child from their past romance, a Kosovo official said on condition of anonymity. Both couples are being questioned by police. In his broadcast Hollande also said local authorities would be told that, from now on, no such detentions can happen while children are in the care of their schools, whether inside the building, at the exit, on a bus or in after-school activities. Although polls show that the majority of French people don't think the family should be allowed to return to France, some say the case has threatened to destabilise the Hollande government. Thousands of teenagers rallied in central Paris on Friday after shutting down their high schools the day before to protest against expulsions like Leonarda's.","Leonarda Dibrani detained by police as she got off a schoolbus in France .

The animal lover, of Puckeridge, near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, has donated all his wealth to the Friends of RSPCA Southridge, near Potters Bar. His elderly parents, Margaret and John, had both died and he had no children or siblings to leave his savings to. Mr Johnson, who ran his family's Clockhouse Nurseries in Enfield, north London, adopted Chelsea from RSPCA Southridge after losing his previous two German Shepherds, Max and Heidi. Kevin owned Chelsea for about seven years and she was nearly ten when she died. Mr Johnson's aunt, Myfanwy Gillham, . 90, of Enfield, said: 'Kevin was totally devastated at losing Chelsea - . she was the apple of his eye and his biggest friend. He just lost heart after she went. 'His . mother had died and Kevin said as he now had more time because he . didn't have mum to look after he would get another German Shepherd. Kevin had owned Chelsea for about seven years and she was nearly ten when she passed away following a stroke . 'We went to Southridge together one day on the off chance of finding one and immediately spotted Chelsea. 'They bonded straight away from their very first meeting as soon as he set eyes on her. She had been very badly treated and Kevin gave her a whole new life.' The mother-of-two and grandmother-of-one added: 'Chelsea was always with him, playing all day at the garden nursery. He never went anywhere without her. 'And then one morning he came downstairs and found Chelsea collapsed. She couldn't even stand up. It was a real bolt out of the blue - she was a real ball of energy and very fit. 'The chap from the pub over the road came over and he and Kevin took her straight to the vet, but nothing could be done and she had to be put to sleep. 'Kevin couldn't get over it and started letting his business go. It was totally unexpected when Chelsea had the stroke because she was always such a lively dog. 'Two months later he had a heart attack and was found dead on his bed. We're sure he died of a broken heart.' Mrs Gillham said he had remembered Chelsea in the best possible way by leaving all his money to the RSPCA. 'Kevin's left a fantastic legacy to the animal centre ' and the gift will help to rescue and look after a great many dogs like Chelsea,' she said. Grateful Terry Pavey, chairman of the . Friends, said: 'Words cannot express enough our gratitude to Kevin for . leaving us this staggering inheritance. 'It will do so much good, notably safeguarding our fostering scheme for years to come.' A new dog agility and play area at Southridge will now be dedicated to the memory of Kevin and Chelsea and a special plaque is to be put up in their memory.","Kevin Johnson, 59, bequeathed £364,568.68 to the animal charity .

Very interesting: Jonathan Goldsmith, pictured, the white-bearded, gravel-voiced 75-year-old who parallel parks trains as the 007-style character in the beer adverts, said this week he once rescued a drowning girl and saved a boy who was having an epileptic fit . He added to Esquire: 'But because I had been trained when I . was 18 as a counselor, 20 years before the incident, I knew. I just . instinctively reacted.' He went on to describe how he saved the life of another child while on an overnight camping trip with a group of disabled children. 'It sounded like a hardware store walking down the railroad tracks, all these braces,' he said of walking to the camp with the kids whose disabilities ranged from muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, sick cell anemia and amputations. 'These kids were having a ball. And all of the sudden, I had this one kid, little bastard (laughs) would only take his epileptic medicine with apple sauce,' he said. 'Well, we didn't have apple sauce, so he . wouldn't take his (laughs) f****ing medicine. And sure enough, there's . Nathan screaming at the sky, and he drops like a stone.

'It was tough because they're spaced so I couldn't get a direct step, and my toe would hit the top of the railroad tie, my instep on the bottom,' he said. 'And to this day, I sometimes have to wear a night brace when I sleep, with ice and all the rest of it. And that was 55 years ago.'

A sacked security guard has been found hanging inside his flat surrounded by thousands of pounds in unpaid bills - eight years after he committed suicide (picture posed by model) The body of a depressed security guard has been found hanging inside his flat surrounded by thousands of pounds in unpaid bills – eight years after he committed suicide. Thomas Ngin’s death in a Paris suburb is now being used as an example of how isolated people can become in modern society. His body was only found after his £400,000 apartment was sold at auction and the new owner visited for the first time. Mr Ngin, a 42-year-old immigrant from . Cambodia, was fired from his job in the French capital in 2005, and was . spending more and more time at home in nearby Bussy Saint Georges. He . was involved in increasingly complicated legal proceedings with his . former bosses, and was also having to shell out on loans repayments. Mr Ngin cut off all contact with his two brothers and two sisters, and stopped speaking to friends as he became more depressed. His obsessively neat lifestyle alienated him from other people, including a brother he had once lived with. ‘He was extremely neat, and he couldn't tolerate his brother's habits,’ one source told the Parisien newspaper. Mr Ngin hung himself in 2005, but that did not stop the bills arriving. Some £12,000 worth built up on the floor of his apartment’s letterbox. Those who were owed money had their letters ignored for years, leading Mr Ngin’s bank to finally seize his flat and put it up for auction for around £400,000. Neighbours had voted for the sale, as the money would be used to pay back his fees to the residents’ association. The apartment was sold on October 3 and the new purchaser found the horrifically decomposed corpse. Explaining the flat sale, a legal source told the Parisien: ‘He would have received letters, but by definition this type of decision by a court doesn't require the consent or agreement of the individual concerned.’ For confidential support on suicide matters call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 or visit a local Samaritans branch or click here.","Thomas Ngin, 42, was surrounded by thousands of pounds of unpaid bills .

Tragic: Keith Bandy died after a paramedic refused to treat him while he was suffering a severe asthma attack . A trainee driving instructor was left to die on his kitchen floor after an experienced paramedic failed to spot signs he was having a severe asthma attack, an inquest has heard. Keith Bandy, 30, dialled 999 after falling critically ill at his Northampton home in 2010. Clive Leach, 69, from East Midlands Ambulance Service, arrived at the scene but left after just 16 minutes, refusing to assess Mr Bandy because he was being 'uncooperative'. But, the victim's reluctance to let the medic treat him may have been an indication he was suffering a severe shortage of oxygen. The paramedic of 43 years also left vital life-saving equipment in his car and failed to test the amount of oxygen in the patient's body, despite his severe breathing problems. Mr Leach then left the property in Northampton because he was not concerned for Mr Bandy's health as he did not look 'pale or clammy'. But just an hour after Mr Leach left Mr Bandy alone his mother Avril, 66 found him collapsed on the kitchen floor and he died two hours later. An inquest at Northampton County Hall heard the trainee driving instructor’s life could probably have been saved if had simply been taken to hospital. Northamptonshire Coroner Anne Pember . said: 'There was a failure to determine whether Keith Bandy’s lack of . co-operation was due to hypoxia or any other medical condition or . whether he was just being non-compliant. Collapsed: Mr Bandy (pictured with girlfriend Yin Yin in Vietnam) died two hours after the ambulance left his home . 'There was also a failure to measure Keith Bandy’s oxygen saturation which could be vital in assessing a patients’ respiratory level. 'On the balance of probabilities, if Keith Bandy had been given appropriate treatment and been conveyed to hospital it is likely he would have survived.' The two-day inquest heard that when Mr Leach attended the 'category A' 999 call he twice failed to get Mr Bandy to blow into a peak flow meter. After failing to blow hard enough, Keith 'threw himself' onto his bed and 'shrugged away' Mr Leach’s hand. The paramedic then called his control room before leaving the property. Giving evidence at the hearing Mr Leach told the family: 'May I say I feel dreadful. 'I can’t imagine how you feel. For your loss I am very sorry.' Career: Mr Bandy was training to be a driving instructor before he passed away . Discovered: Avril Bandy, 66, found her son collapsed on the kitchen floor after he had been abandoned by the medic . Speaking after the inquest, Mr Leach, who has since retired, added: 'It is incredibly sad and distressing what has happened. 'In my experience, he did not cause me concern from his physical signs. Life-long illness: Mr Bandy (pictured here age 12) was diagnosed with asthma from a very early age . 'I made a decision and it has turned into a very sad state of affairs and as I hope the family can now get some peace. 'I have been going over what happened for the last three years, thinking, maybe I could have done things differently. 'I wished he spoke to me, but he didn’t and I will have to live with that.' Dr . David Sprigings, a heart consultant at Northampton General Hospital, . said he believed Mr Bandy would have survived if he had been taken to . hospital for treatment straight away. Independent medical expert, Mark Ainsworth-Smith, compiled a report for the coroner and also concluded he had concerns about the 'quality of care' the patient had received. The coroner told the family she would be writing to East Midlands Ambulance Service - which was branded as the UK’s worst performing trust earlier this year. They were placed at the bottom of a league table measuring response times and launched an investigation this year into the deaths of 13 patients, including one person who died after an ambulance took four hours to reach them. After the case Mr Bandy's devastated mother, Avril, added: 'Keith was diagnosed with asthma from a very early age and it affected him throughout life. Poor performance: East Midlands Ambulance Service was ranked the worst in the country after recording the longest response times . 'His passion was driving, he could do that just like everyone else and was training to be a driving instructor. 'My son was very special, he was a big family man, he would visit everyone and would be there to help whenever anyone needed something. 'His death has affected the family badly and he is sorely missed. 'It has taken three and a half years to get to the point we are at now and things do not get any easier, we miss him dearly.' East Midlands Ambulance service have been approached for a comment but have not yet responded.","Keith Bandy, 30, dialled 999 after suffering a severe asthma attack in 2010 .

He may have missed his chance at moving into the White House but wealthy former presidential candidate Mitt Romney is certainly making sure there is some old school intrigue to his latest property venture. An overview of the floor plans to the Romney family's new vacation house in Holladay, Salt Lake City, has found a small 11-foot-by-5-foot room hidden behind a bookshelf in the study. With Romney planning to tear down the home that currently sits on the land, blueprints for the soon-to-be-constructed house show the secret passageway is twice as long as it is wide, with the entry ominously marked in the documents as 'hidden door'. A fake bookcase would swing open into the study to get into the secret room. The special alcove runs along the back of the 'coat room' and 'powder room' and is not far from the main entryway. The plans show the room is lined with cabinets. 'X' marks the spot: Architectural layout drawings of Mitt Romney's soon-to-be-built home in Holladay, Utah, show plans for a 'hidden door' and secret room just off the study and sequestered behind shelving . Wider view of the floorplan of Mitt Romney's new vacation home in Holladay, a suburb within Salt Lake City. The blueprints show how the 'hidden door' is accessed from the study, with the secret room sitting behind the coat room and 'powder room' (bathroom) The enormous property is set to start building any day now. Romney's study features a book case that swivels open and leads into secret room, The Salt Lake Tribune reports, based on records it obtained . Storage or safe haven? Floorplans uncovered for the new house Mitt Romney is building in Utah show a hidden room will be built behind the study. Fake bookshelves, perhaps like the one pictured here, will mark the doorway to the room, which will be twice as long as it is wide. The plans mark it as being used for 'office storage' So what's the plan, guys? Mitt Romney and wife Ann have declined to comment about the blueprints of their new house in Holladay, Salt Lake City, which have revealed a hidden room . Front of house: Despite being of decent size already, Romney and his wife Ann will tear down this home they bought in Holladay - their second Utah property - and build something that will better fit their huge family. 'That¿s a good-size house, but he has a lot of grandkids so he needs a place to host everybody,' said Taylor Oldroyd, chief executive of the Utah County Association of Realtor. The Salt . Lake Tribune, which discovered the room by getting access to the floor . plans through an open records request, said it has been marked for . 'office storage'. However the Atlantic Wire has suggested the obvious explanation is that the space would be used as a 'panic room'. 'If we learned anything from the first decade of the 21st century, it's that fancy houses have special rooms in which residents can hide in the event of a home invasion,' The Wire reported. 'Since the Romney's had to give up their Secret Service protection last November, it only makes sense that the family would go out of its way to ensure its safety.' A spokeswoman for Romney declined to comment on the room. Panic rooms were made famous by a 2002 thriller starring Jodie Foster, about a mother and daughter who buy a New York brownstone only to be attacked by burglars the night they move in. The movie, simply called Panic Room, was inspired by a news story at the time about the rise in popularity of fortified rooms being built in grand residences as a safe shelter or hiding place for the owners, according to director David Fincher. The 5,900-square-foot Holladay house will be the fifth home for the former Republican candidate and his wife Ann, who have five sons and 23 grandchildren. Leafy oasis: The Holladay vacation house lies at the end of this secluded driveway . Sold: The Romney's only recently bought the property from Bere Regis Realty . Romney recently bought an expansive log cabin in the Utah mountain resort of Park City that was on the market for $8.9 million, reports Forbes. In 2009 Romney sold a similar mansion he had owned in the same area for 14 years. The new Utah abode was built in 1991 and features six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and over 8,700 square feet of space. The listing described it as: 'As featured in Architectural Digest, this ‘Utah Rustic’ home gave renowned local architect Fred Babcock the opportunity to stretch beyond what one assumed could normally be achieved in log construction. Comprised of whole logs and many local materials, interior designer David Krajeski created an interior that invites both grand entertaining and cozy relaxation. The architectural design is centered on the two-story great room with massive stone fireplace and magnificent views to the Uinta Mountains and beyond.' Following much controversy, the California Coastal Commission decided earlier this month to allow the Romney's to move forward with plans to raze their La Jolla beachfront home and replace it with an 11,000-square-foot mansion. A neighbour had complained the house would be too big and block the beach views of other residents . This current house will be torn down for the new uber-home to be built . Romney's third house, in the coastal California town of La Jolla, north of San Diego, has been a recent source of contention. The politico had planned to tear down the existing 3,000-square-foot home he bought in 2008 for $12 million and build a whopping 11,000-square-foot dream home. However the plans were stalled on the complaint of a neighbor, who believed the home would be too big. On Oct. 11 Romney was given the go-ahead after it was concluded the 'vast majority of the square footage will be contained in the basement and first floor' and that the house would not impede on public views along the beach it overlooks. Rounding out his property portfolio, Romney also has a cabin in New Hampshire and a condo in Belmont, Massachusetts. Romney's bid to be president came up short when he lost to Barack Obama in the 2012 election. He has spoken previously about how, when first starting out, he lived in an apartment too small for a dining room table and that he ate dinner off an ironing board. Ann Romney recently released a new cookbook, 'The Romney Family Table', in which . she writes about recipes and the food shared by the family through the ups and . downs of their lives. 'It's really about love and sharing the table and what you learn at the . table, how you enjoy each other, how you establish traditions,' Ann told The .

It's perhaps the ultimate bar snack - but it could leave you just as hungover as the liquid refreshments on offer at your local pub. A U.S firm has introduced a range of unique beer ice creams, and unlike your usual tub of raspberry ripple, cookie dough or vanilla, they are alcoholic. The ice cream, called Frozen Pints, comes in seven different flavours with the strongest having an alcohol level of 3.2 per cent - the same as a low-point beer. Comfort food: A U.S firm has created the ultimate bar snack - beer ice cream . Drink up: The range of ice creams comes in seven different flavours with a range of alcoholic strengths . The new range is the brainchild of Ari Fleischer, from New York, who says that the idea was born purely out of accident. 'We were having a party and a friend brought over an ice cream maker to make homemade ice cream,' explained the 29-year-old. 'But another friend spilled a beer nearby, and I watched it happen and thought ""this is a great idea!"" 'I'm really passionate about craft beer, and love ice cream, so I picked it up as a hobby and started experimenting with different flavour combinations. 'We start with the beer as it is all about finding the best, most flavourful craft brews - and then build a flavour around them.' Unusual: Among the flavours on offer are Malted Milk Chocolate Stout, Peach Lambic and Vanilla Bock . Alcoholic: A full pint goes into each tub - but you'd have to drink a lot of it to get drunk . Flavours on offer at a variety of bars and stores in and around Atlanta, Georgia, include Peach Lambic, Honey IPA, Pumpkin Ale, Brown Ale Chip, Cinnamon Expresso Stout, Vanilla Bock and Malted Milk Chocolate Stout. The Pumkin Ale flavour is the strongest at 3.2 per cent, while Peach Lambic is the weakest. Each 450ml tub is $6.99 (£4.33). Although you'd have to drink a lot of the ice cream to actually get drunk, it's perhaps the only frozen snack that you might need ID to buy. Novel: The idea for the ice cream came about purely by accident - one of the company founder's friends spilled some beer near an ice cream machine at a party . Mr Fleischer added: 'The amount of alcohol varies by flavour - it depends on the content in the beer, as well as how much beer is added to the mix. 'Our current flavours range between one per cent and 3.2 per cent but sometimes our specialty, limited release flavours come out a little higher. 'You must be of legal drinking age to purchase and consume and we believe it's the first product of its kind. 'One pint of Frozen Pints ice cream is equal to one pint of beer - so you would have to eat a lot of ice cream to get drunk!'","Frozen Pints come in seven different flavours including Brown Ale Chip .

All 1,067 foot of the ship will be dismantled, scrapped and recycled once it is towed from the Navy's inactive ship facility in Philadelphia to the company's facility in Texas later this year, the Navy announced.

According to Fox News, more than 16,000 engineers, draftsmen and builders worked on the ship which cost an estimated $217 million - or $2 billion in today's dollars - to build. It launched on December 11, 1954. The ship - named after the former Navy secretary and the first U.S. Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal - was in the Gulf of Tonkin for the Vietnam War effort. On the morning of July 29, 1967, a stray voltage triggered a rocket to launch from an F-4 Phantom on the flight deck and struck an armed A-4 Skyhawk - piloted by a young Lt. Cmdr. John S. McCain III.

The rocket ruptured the fuel tanks of . the plane, sparking a chain reaction of fires and explosions on the . deck, which was full of fueled up, parked aircrafts.

Ship: The remarkable supercarrier is pictured left and right in 1956 . However, the ship's rich history and nearly four decades of service are not enough to save it. After it was decommissioned on September 11, 1993 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register, the Navy tried to donate the historic aircraft carrier for use as a memorial or a museum, but no 'viable applications' were received. 'It's something that the Navy is caught between a rock and a hard place,' historian for the USS Forrestal Association and a survivor of the 1967 incident Ken Killmeyer said, according to Fox News. 'They have to have these vessels no matter how big or small they are, and they use them as you would your car until they’re no longer financially viable. So, they decommission them.'","The decommissioned USS Forrestal was snapped up for the bargain price by Texas company All Star Metals on Tuesday .
All 1,067-feet of the ship will be dismantled, scrapped and recycled once it is towed from the Navy's inactive ship facility in Philadelphia to the company's facility in Texas later this year .

Websites such as Airbnb.com have revolutionised tourism, allowing travellers to stay with locals in cities around the world for a fraction of the price they would pay for a hotel. But officials in New York City are now cracking down on short-term sub-letting, arguing that the practice is illegal, undermines the hotel industry and could endanger visitors. Airbnb has been ordered to turn over data on its users in New York to the state's attorney general, who is investigating the possibility that residents might be breaking a law which bans sublets lasting fewer than 30 days. Popular: But New York City officials are cracking down on the subletting of rooms via Airbnb.com . Middleman: Airbnb puts those with spare rooms to rent in touch with travellers visiting new towns . Many tourists have welcomed the chance to find accommodation in the city for as little as $35 a night - compared to an average $275 for a hotel room. In addition, many New Yorkers say they need the income from renting out their spare rooms to afford the city's sky-high rents, which currently stand at $3,000 per month on average. 'I use Airbnb to supplement my income, and it's allowed me to go back to school,' says Mishelle Farer, a 32-year-old former U.S. Army sergeant who rents her second bedroom in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighbourhood for $60 to $70 a night. In addition to covering half her rent with the proceeds, she says she has had the chance to meet 'wonderful people' from all around the world. Lifeline: Mishelle Farer sublets a room in her Williamsburg apartment to help her pay the rent . Pauline Frommer, author of a series of travel guides, welcomes sites such as Airbnb, flipkey.com, couchsurfer.com and housetrip.com, saying they provide an important service to tourists. 'New York hotel prices are truly outrageous,' she said. 'The city is overwhelmed with visitors, and it's practically impossible to find an affordable hotel room, so you need some kind of outlet.' Airbnb was invented in San Francisco five years ago by two roommates who could not afford their rent so decided to install air bed and rent them out to guests, and now offers 500,000 places to stay across the globe. In New York alone, 15,000 rooms are on offer, ranging from $35 for a space in a Brooklyn studio apartment to more than $900 for an antique-filled loft in Tribeca in downtown Manhattan. Under threat? New York is well known for its exclusive luxury hotels such as the Waldorf-Astoria . However, city officials claim that many of the sub-lets are illegal because the apartments' occupants are not there at the time. In addition, they are worried about damaging hotels, which make up a large part of New York's economy, and say the city is being cheated of lodging taxes. NYC & Company, the city's official tourism agency, issued a statement saying: 'This illegal practice takes away much needed hotel tax revenue from city coffers with no consumer protections against fire- and health-code violations.' But Airbnb says that 87 per cent of its users stay at home while hosting paying guests, and describes the subpoena of customer information as an 'unfounded fishing expedition'. Landlords and tenant organisations have long complained that short-term sublets are a violation of most leases, and pose security problems. Crackdown: Officials fear that Airbnb will undermine the city's hotel industry, which boasts the Plaza among other world-famous institutions . Having strangers coming in and out of a residential building 'is a terrible problem,' says Tom Cayler, chairman of the Illegal Hotel Committee for Manhattan's West Side Neighborhood Alliance. 'If you come home at night and there are people in the lobby or elevator who you don't know, you should be scared.' Sam Shaber, a musician who used to rent space on the Lower East Side for $150 to $225 a night, says she welcomed guests from France, Argentina, Sweden and elsewhere. 'In this day and age of Craigslist, we have a radar for who's weird,' Shaber said. 'We never had one problem.' Some visitors prefer renting rooms from residents because it allows them to pick up tips on local highlights and live like a native. Sergio Verdasco, an engineer from Spain who stayed with Ms Farer in Williamsburg for three nights, said: 'It was an amazing experience - a soft landing in a city where I don't know the people and don't speak the language well. It's not the same as taking up a guide and doing what a million people do.'","Website allows users to sublet their spare rooms to strangers .

Smoking and drinking should no longer be termed ‘risky behaviours’ because it is too judgmental, says the chief medical officer for England. Instead, binge-drinking, unprotected sex and taking drugs should be renamed ‘exploratory behaviours’ in ‘order to be fair and destigmatise’ them. Professor Dame Sally Davies said that young people had expressed the concern that behaviour that was dubbed risky when they did it was commonplace among adults. 'Judgemental': Professor Dame Sally Davies said drinking and smoking should not be deemed 'risky' (picture posed by models) Public health campaigns frequently urge restraint when it comes to activities that could affect the health of youngsters. But Professor Davies insisted that changing the terms would not encourage children to experiment, but offer chances for health professionals to make such behaviour appear less risky and  perhaps less appealing to those tempted to experiment. This could be achieved, for example, by recommending the use of condoms during sex to avoid pregnancy and infections. However, the National Institute for Care and Excellence – which advises on how public health campaigns on smoking, unprotected sex and binge drinking should be delivered – said those covering on ‘risky behaviour’ such as smoking need to scare an audience as well as soothe them in order to get people to take care of their health.

A 25-year-old Hawaii surfer has survived a dramatic attack by a 12-foot tiger shark by jumping on top of it and punching it in the eye. Jeff Horton, a former boxer, said he was surfing off Pila'a Beach near Kilaueai in Kauai on Sunday with friends when he spotted a dark shape moving toward him and his board through the water. He explained that he was looking for a wave and seated with his feet dangling from the board. 'I look down and see what I thought was a sting ray,' Horton told Fox News. 'It came up on me and I jerked my foot and kicked it a couple of times. It went for the bite and missed my leg.' Scroll down for video . Lucky escape: Jeff Horton, a surfer in Hawaii, has survived a shark attack after hitting it in its eye . Damage: The shark's teeth marks can be seen on Horton's board - which he said he'll be putting on his wall . Horton pulled his left leg from the water and got on the surfboard, but was knocked off when the shark clamped its teeth down on the board. 'I rolled to the top of the shark and punched it in the mouth and got one shot in the eye,' Horton said. 'I thought I was going to die unless I put up the best fight I ever had.' He estimated that he hit the shark, which he guessed was about 12 feet long, about eight times. But when he punched it once in the eye, it recoiled, giving him a chance to jump on his board and frantically paddle back to the shore with another surfer. 'At that point I was pretty much in a full panic and started swimming for my life,' he said. 'I saw the shadow of its belly following me underneath.' Attack: He was attacked by the tiger shark (file photo) as he looked for waves on Sunday afternoon . Even though the shark followed, it did not attack again. When they reached the shore, he was welcomed back by a group of people and a tourist gave him $50 and told him to buy a bottle, The Garden Island reported. Horton's only injuries were scratches from the shark's rough skin on his knuckles and legs. 'I'm lucky to be here today,' he said. The 7-foot board, however, was left with a semi-circle imprint of the shark's jaws. Horton, who surfed again Monday at another beach, said he plans to put it up on his wall. Horton moved to Kauai from Washington D.C. two years ago and said, while he's been traumatized by the experience, he will be returning to the water. Scene: The shark was seen just off Kilauea, pictured, which has had no other shark attacks this year . But he said he won't be using the board - which displays the circular teeth marks of the shark - again; instead he plans to hang it on his wall. 'I'll surf the rest of my life,' he told The Garden Island. Tiger sharks are considered dangerous due to their size and indiscriminate feeding behavior and willingness to eat nearly anything - including objects at the surface, Hawaii Sharks explains. Some bites sustained by people are thought to be the result of investigatory behavior as the sharks bite creatures or objects to determine whether they are suitable to be eaten. There have been no reported shark attacks around Kauai this year. Three were recorded last year.

The bullish comments came amid a wave of economic good news as figures showed the number of private businesses now trading in Britain has soared to a record of nearly five million.

A separate report showed a 40 per cent jump in mortgage lending to its highest level since 2009, and business lending on the rise after years of decline. Booming car production and soaring sales at Argos, Homebase, Sports Direct and online fashion retailer Asos bolstered hopes that the recovery is picking up pace. But the Bank warned that the recovery ‘might be less well balanced’ than hoped as exports remain muted and growth is driven by the housing market and debt-fuelled spending. Official figures published tomorrow are expected to show the economy growing at its fastest rate since the general election in May 2010.

Three babysitters watched as a three-year-old boy died in a cruel punishment called 'The Wrap' - where he suffocated after being tightly covered in a blanket. Michael Lee McMullen died after being wrapped in six layers of blankets at the Florida home he was living in. Manslaughter charges were filed against Donella Trainor, 45; Douglas Garrigus, 21; and the child's grandmother, Gale Watkins, 56, according to a Lee County Sheriff's lieutenant. Trainor, a friend of the boy's grandmother, told investigators she had disciplined her own grandchildren that way, using a technique all three adults knew as 'the wrap,' Lieutenant Larry King said. He said she pinned the boy's arms to his side and rolled him in a king-sized blanket. 'There were six layers of cloth over this child. The loose ends would be folded over his head and feet and tied into a knot, all in an effort to prevent the child from moving,' King said. 'You could use a mummy reference.' The boy, Michael Lee McMullen, screamed and pleaded to be released as Trainor wrapped him and put him in his crib for a nap on Saturday, the sheriff's report said. The boy's grandmother, and his stepfather, Garrigus, checked on him at . different times as he cried and struggled, the report said.

Trainor returned, found the knot loose and retied it, then put pillows around the child, the report said. She later found him unresponsive and soaked in sweat, it said. Paramedics took him to a hospital in Fort Myers on Florida's southwest coast where he was declared dead, and the medical examiner classified the death as a homicide. The exact cause was still pending, King said. Trainor, Watkins and Garrigus were charged with aggravated manslaughter of a child. Trainor, 45, was also charged with aggravated child abuse 'for the torture and unlawful caging' of the boy, King said . Watkins had custody of her grandson because the child's mother had been involved in domestic violence, and Trainor was helping her care for him, King said.

When Darlene Yasick's husband Gene died in 1989 aged 48, the family was at a loss over what had claimed him so suddenly. Only years later did they learn he was killed by a rare and deadly genetic disease called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome - and that it was only just beginning to devastate the family. In 2006, Darlene's son Steve died aged 40 and in 2010, it claimed another son, 42-year-old Tom. Still the disease continued to ravage her family - claiming the life of her son Michel, 49, this spring. And then on Saturday her grandson - Michael's son - Christoper passed away, aged just 25. Scroll down for video . Heartbroken: Darlene Yasick has lost her husband, three sons and grandson to the same genetic disease . Loss: In 2006, her son Steve, 40, died followed by Tom, 42, in 2010. A third son Michel, 49, died in Spring . The family, who live in Chicago, Illinois and Wyoming, Michigan, have just learned that Darlene's six-year-old grandson also has the condition. Speaking with WoodTV from her Michigan home, Darlene said it is like 'a nightmare and you can't wake up from it.' All of the men suffered from the most severe form of the disorder, vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which can cause the walls of the blood vessels or intestines to rupture. The condition - for which there is no cure - can also weaken the heart's largest artery, the aorta, as well as the arteries to the kidneys and spleen. Missed: Most recently, her 25-year-old grandson Chris, pictured, died from the disease on Saturday . Sudden: When her husband Gene, pictured, died in the 80s the family were not aware of the disease . Sufferers of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome have faulty collagen - which usually acts as a glue in the body - in their connective tissues. It means that EDS weakens the bonds that hold organs, vessels and arteries together. There are six different kinds of EDS. All five of Yasick's family members who died had the Vascular Type, which is the most serious form. It can lead to the sudden rupturing of arteries or organs as the result of even minor trauma. There is no cure for the condition. According to the Ehlers-Danlos National Foundation, the vascular form of EDS affects about one in every 250,000 people. It is thought many more die from the disease but many victims don't know they had it. It is genetic and if you have it, there is a 50 per cent chance your children do too. The disease affects connective tissues . such as the skin, joints and blood vessel walls and its cause is . genetic; if you have it, there is a 50 per cent chance your children . will have it too. 'There is no treatment,' Darlene told WoodTV. 'There is no therapy. Right now, there is nothing if you have it you have it. 'For us, it's like, what's the end? It just keeps happening and happening until there is no one left for it to happen to.' Despite the family's struggles, she said she is proud of the men in her family and the legacy they have all left behind. 'There . is no way that I could have been prouder of them,' she said.

Jose Baez will represent Katelyn Roman, 12, when she goes to trial to face accusations of bullying Rebecca Sedwick, 12, to the point she committed suicide last month. When reached Wednesday by MailOnline, a spokesperson for Mr Baez said he was not available for comment because he was spending the entire day getting to know the family and reviewing the case. Well known: Casey Anthony attorney Jose Baez will represent Katelyn Roman, 12, in her cyber-bullying trial . Made famous for defending Ms Anthony to a jury that found her not guilty of murdering her daughter, Mr Baez was approached by the Roman family, the spokesperson said. The Orlando Sentinel first reported he had been hired to represent the 12-year-old girl.

Apple is said to be hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its smartwatch - dubbed the iWatch. According to the Financial Times (FT), the tech firm wants to bring in fresh pairs of eyes to look at the device because its in-house developers may be struggling to solve the problems. A source told the paper that Apple started 'hiring aggressively' in recent weeks, which suggests that the smartwatch is nowhere near being ready for release and could be pushed back to next year. Apple is said to be hiring outside help to tackle design flaws with its iWatch, pictured. According to the Financial Times, the firm only began hiring in recent weeks suggesting the wearable tech won't be ready until 2014. This image is an artist's impression of how the device could look and work . Speculation around Apple's iWatch - the wearable technology that can connect to smartphones and display . texts, Facebook notifications and more on a device on the wearer's wrist - began at the end of last year. Chinese websites reported in December that the computer . giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It is thought to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Other rumours suggest that the iWatch will feature Siri voice control to let users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The screen could switch on when a user flicks their wrist. It would connect to an iPhone via Bluetooth meaning wearers could see messages and access menus without getting their phone from their pocket. The iWatch could also be Wi-Fi enabled and show tweets, weather and be able to download apps. The watch could also be as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. The iWatch would be a move away from Apple's current iPhone, iPad and iPod products and one source told the FT that the device involves 'hard engineering problems that they [in-house staff] have not been able to solve'. Apple is believed to have started 'seeking out acquisitions . of early-stage start-ups working on connected devices.' A senior member of the iWatch team, who recently considered leaving . the company, decided to stay after being given a pay rise, one source told the FT. The FT even claims that Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, could still decide to shelve the product. Indro Mukerjee, the CEO of Plastic Logic that makes flexible displays like the one rumoured for the iWatch, told MailOnline he isn't surprised Apple is seeking outside help: 'In order to make a smart watch and use the whole surface (not just the face), there needs to be the ability to make a display which can be completely bent around the wrist and remain robust enough to be able to frequently put it on and take it off. 'As the market for wearable technology grows, the search for specialised talent will also intensify.' Speculation around Apple's iWatch - the wearable technology that can connect to smartphones and display . texts, Facebook notifications and more on a device on the wearer's wrist - began at the end of last year. Chinese websites reported in December that the computer . giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget. It is thought to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone. Patent applications published in March suggested that Apple was . working on a device with a bendy strap that could be snapped onto a . wearer's wrist, and would have a flexible display. Similar devices are already on the market, including the Pebble smartwatch that launched from a successful Kickstarter campaign, and the Android.ly device developed by Indian college students. Apple is believed to have 100 people working on its iWatch, according to recent rumours, but is hiring new members because the existing team have been unable to solve issues with the design and engineering. Here is MacUser magazine's mockup of what the iWatch could look like . Samsung announced earlier this month it is 'investing heavily' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health. Samsung's watch concept, pictured, shows a solid wooden band, and the watch face can be simply slipped out and put in a pocket when running, for example . Samsung announced earlier this month that it, too, is 'investing heavily' in wearable computers and revealed it is even developing systems for stick on patches to monitor health. ‘Eventually you won’t even know you’re wearing the device, it could be the fabric in your clothing, your glasses or your watch,’ Samsung’s Chief Strategy Officer, Young Sogn, told the Mobilebeat conference in San Francisco at the start of July. As well as the iWatch, Apple is rumoured to be working on a plastic version of its iPhone, pictured, according to images leaked on a Chinese site . If the FT's sources are to be believed and Apple has only just begun hiring development support, the release date of the iWatch could be pushed back to 2014 - previous reports expected the device to be announced later this year. During April's earnings call, Mr Cook said: 'Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software and services that we can't wait to introduce this fall.' Aside from the iWatch, Apple is also thought to be working on a low-cost colourful iPhone Mini, as well as the follow-up to the Apple iPhone 5 - dubbed Apple iPhone 5S. And earlier this month, International Business Times magazine claimed that one, or possibly both, of these products will be launched in September. The new, cheaper handset could be made of plastic to keep costs down and may be sold in a range of colours including white, black, pink and blue. The new iPhone 5S model is believed to look identical to the current iPhone 5 but includes a faster processor and updated camera. It will also run iOS 7, the major new version of Apple's iPad and iPhone software launched last month. Both handsets could be released in time for the iOS 7 roll out in October. Apple recently hired Paul Deneve, from Yves Saint Laurent, to work on undefined 'special projects'. The FT continued that Deneve may have been brought in to use his experience in fashion and luxury goods to help develop the branding for the iWatch. After Chinese sites began reporting on the iWatch rumours in December, a number of designers created realistic concept images in a bid to predict what it would look like. This concept was by Italian designer Antonio De Rosa . A Japanese patent in February detailing Apple's plans for an iWatch followed an earlier application to the U.S Patent Office in 2011. This image, taken from the American Patent Application describes a 'wearable accessory device' which mounts a touchscreen on the user's wrist using the same technology as a slap wrap . A patent application filed by Apple in February revealed that its iWatch could use the same technology as a . child's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user's wrist. Later that month a number of designers from Sweden, San Francisco and Italy - among others - began creating mock-ups of what the watch could look like. These included glass and coloured straps with digital, touchscreen faces. In March, MacUser magazine designed a mock-up of what the watch could look like and its version contained a small screen - similar to the iPod Nano - would be mounted to a traditional leather strap. Cook then fuelled the rumours further by telling the AllThingsD conference in June that wearable tech was an area 'ripe for exploration' and 'incredibly interesting'. Apple has not made any official comment about the iWatch or the news reported by the FT. Swedish designer Anders Kjellberg's rendition of the iWatch. The device is expected to connect to an iPhone via Bluetooth meaning wearers could see messages and access menus without getting their phone from their pocket. The iWatch could also be Wi-Fi enabled and show tweets, weather and be able to download apps .","Apple believed to be 'aggressively' hiring people to work on its iWatch .

Poignant: The diamond encrusted brooch that prisoner Katarzyna Krauze managed to hide in the Gulag . A gold brooch a World War Two prisoner stitched into her cardigan seam to hide it from her captors has emerged on the Antiques Roadshow. The precious heirloom was sewn into the lining by Polish woman Katarzyna Krauze asshe and her family were forced out of their home by the invading Russian army in 1939. While interned at the labour camp in Siberia where her husband died of pneumonia, Ms Krauze had all her possessions taken from her - except for her cardigan. After the Russians changed sides in the war Katarzyna and her 18-year-old daughter Irena were released and they eventually fled to England via Palestine. It was only after the war when she moved to south London that she felt it was safe enough to unstitch the star-shaped brooch from its hiding place. The piece of jewellery has been treasured by the family and handed down through the generations. Victoria Wilson, her great-granddaughter, took it along to the Antiques Roadshow in Surrey to show experts and reveal the lucky star's remarkable story. Victoria, a 31-year-old HR manager from Guildford, said: 'The brooch is the only item left of my family's life in Poland. They lost everything apart from this brooch. 'It clearly meant a great deal to my great-grandmother as it was the only piece of jewellery she saved. She deliberately stitched it into a tatty old cardigan thinking that none of her guards would want it.' Moving: Victoria Wilson showing expert John Benjamin the brooch belonging to her great-grandmother on the Antiques Roadshow . Priceless: Ms Wilson says she is hoping to pass on the brooch to her daughter Esme as a piece of family and world history . 'It is a priceless heirloom that I keep locked in a safe and only wear for very special occasions.' It is believed that Victoria's great-great-great grandmother acquired the white gold brooch in the late 18th or early 19th century and handed it down through the family. Days after the Germans invaded Poland from the west, the Russian Red Army moved in from the east and commandeered the Krauzes' home in eastern Poland. Katarzyna, her husband Stanislaw, son Walter and 18-year-old daughter Irena, were later arrested by the Russians, wrongly accused of spying and throw into a gulag. The family were separated and the mother and daughter never saw Stanislaw again. Victoria said: 'The Russians gave my great-grandparents a few hours to pack up some possessions and move put of their home. 'My great-grandmother took a heavy cardigan and in the lining of it she sewed this brooch. Remarkable journey: Katarzyna Krauze and her daughter Irena after release from the Gulag in 1942 . 'During their time in captivity she and my grandmother moved from camp to camp and all their possessions were stolen from them. 'But even with all the searches and the de-lousing that went on, the brooch survived in the cardigan.' After the two women were released from the gulag in December 1941 they travelled by cattle train to Persia where Irena joined the Polish army as a nurse. In June 1944 they were evacuated to England and Irena worked in a military hospital. She added: 'The brooch remained in the cardigan the whole time. 'My great-grandmother died in 1953 and it was given to my grandmother. She kept it in her jewellery box but never wore it because it was too precious to lose. 'My grandmother is still alive but had two sons and so she has given it to me. I am keeping it in a safe but will wear it for very special occasions. Detail: Antiques Roadshow expert John Benjamin believes the number 56 indicated a Russian-made jewel . 'I took it along to the Antiques Roadshow because I wanted to find out a bit more about where it originally came from."" John Benjamin, the expert from the show, believes the brooch to be Russian. He said: 'I don't think we can really appreciate the brutality of those times. The survival is extraordinary. 'It transcends value. It is a piece that connects us with that extraordinary past, and it's a privilege to handle it.' Victoria said she intends to one day pass the brooch on to her daughter Esme, who is aged two. The item will feature on the Antiques Roadshow this Sunday.","Katarzyna Krauze was imprisoned in a Siberian gulag in World War Two .

The ancient practice was found to be more effective at boosting brain power than conventional aerobic exercise. Researchers in America discovered that a single session of Hatha yoga significantly improved a person's speed and accuracy when tested on their working memory and concentration. Relax: The ancient practice of yoga provides almost instant mental benefits. Scientists found that a 20-minute session of Hatha yoga outperformed a run on the treadmill in terms of boosting memory and concentration . Lead author of the study, Neha Gothe, professor of kinesiology (human movement), health and sport studies at Wayne State University in Detroit, explained: 'Yoga is an ancient Indian science and way of life that includes not only physical movements and postures but also regulated breathing and meditation. 'The practice involves an active attentional or mindfulness component but its potential benefits have not been thoroughly explored.' During the experimental yoga sessions participants were asked to assume postures stood up, sat down and laid down, while keeping their breathing steady. The exercises included isometric contractions of different muscles in the body, where the muscles are tensed and relaxed without moving any limbs. The exercises were followed by a mediation session, when participants focussed on posture and deep breathing. Researchers also put the guinea pigs through their paces on a treadmill for the same 20-minute period, keeping their heart rate up between 60 and 70 per cent of the maximum. Working up a sweat is good for heart health but it is not as effective as yoga at calming the mind . They found that people who had been for a 20-minute jog were less able to focus mentally on tasks than they were following a yoga session. Gothe said: 'It appears that following yoga practice, the participants were better able to focus their mental resources, process information quickly, more accurately and also learn, hold and update pieces of information more effectively than after performing an aerobic exercise bout. 'The breathing and meditative exercises aim at calming the mind and body and keeping distracting thoughts away while you focus on your body, posture or breath.''Maybe these processes translate beyond yoga practice when you try to perform mental tasks or day-to-day activities.' Gothe conceded that the team could not pinpoint any specific process that takes place during yoga that boosted the mental state of the participants, suggesting the relaxation from meditation could hold the answer. She said: 'Many factors could explain the results. 'Enhanced self-awareness that comes with meditational exercises is just one of the possible mechanisms.' Hatha yoga is an ancient form of yoga that was first described in 15th century India. It may have existed well before this however. Hatha yoga is sometimes called ‘dual’ yoga because it includes a duality between two opposites: the sun (in Hinda, ‘ha’) and the moon (‘tha’). It uses physical positions to help control breathing, which in turn helps to calm the mind and prepare a person for mediatation. Many modern forms of yoga use Hatha yoga positions as their foundation. 'Besides, meditation and breathing exercises are known to reduce anxiety and stress, which in turn can improve scores on some cognitive tests.' The study, published in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health, involved 30 female students at Illinois University's Exercise Psychology Laboratory. Kinesiology and community health Professor Edward McAuley, who directs the where the study was conducted, said: . 'Yoga is becoming an increasingly popular form of exercise in the U.S. and it is imperative to systematically examine its health benefits, especially the mental health benefits that this unique mind-body form of activity may offer.' But Professor McAuley stressed it is early days for study of yoga and its effects on the body and mind. He said: 'We only examined the effects of a 20-minute bout of yoga and aerobic exercise in this study among female undergraduates. 'However, this study is extremely timely and the results will enable yoga researchers to power and design their interventions in the future. 'We see similar promising findings among older adults as well. 'Yoga research is in its nascent stages and with its increasing popularity across the globe, researchers need to adopt rigorous systematic approaches to examine not only its cognitive but also physical health benefits across the lifespan.'","Experts found a single session of Hatha yoga improved cognitive skills .

Accused: Convicted murderer Mark Shirley, 42, is alleged to have raped and tortured a woman in a 12-hour attack with echoes of his other crimes . A convicted murderer out on licence broke into a woman’s home and subjected her to a horrifying 12-hour rape ordeal - in a chilling copycat of his first attack 18 years earlier, a court heard. Mark Shirley, who is alleged to have targeted the now 39-year-old after she spurned his advances in a bar, was said to have burst into her home wearing a balaclava 'like a scene from a horror film'. He then tied her to her bed before repeatedly raping her at knifepoint and stabbing her in the legs over a 12-hour period, Bristol Crown Court was told. The woman claimed Shirley, 42, even took breaks during the attack to make cups of tea, and sang the nursery rhyme Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary as he busied himself in her kitchen. The jury was told that before Shirley left his victim's home he said: 'If you ever have sex again, you will only think of me.' His alleged victim says she was left so traumatised by the 2005 ordeal she did not report it to police for six years. In the meantime Shirley was convicted of a separate copycat rape - this time of mum-of-five Helen Stockford, at her home in Bristol in 2009. Miss Stockford, then 40, was subjected to a terrifying ordeal lasting three-and-a-half hours in an apparent attempt to recreate the murder he had carried out 22 years earlier. Shirley was convicted of rape and false . imprisonment and was given a second life sentence with a minimum tariff . of nine years, which he is still currently serving. It followed his first conviction as a 17-year-old in 1987 for the sexually violent and ritualistic murder of of Mary Wainwright, 67, at her home in Cardiff. Shirley was given a life sentence but released on licence in 2003. After the second conviction the victim of . the alleged 2005 attack came forward and Shirley is now on trial for 12 . charges of assault by penetration, four charges of rape and one of . unlawful and malicious wounding. The . victim has said she was too frightened to report the attack earlier as . she was 'terrified' Shirley would come back for her, and that she piled . on weight in a deliberate attempt to change her appearance. Victim: Mother-of-five Helen Stockford waived her right to anonymity and spoke out after the earlier conviction of Mark Shirley for her rape in 2009 . William Mousley QC, prosecuting, told the court that Shirley and the victim had met on a night out in Bristol three weeks before the attack. He said that, in passing conversation, the woman told Shirley where she lived and that her flatmate was going away in three weeks' time. The conversation was then said to have turned sour, and the 39-year-old woman swore at Shirley 'to get rid of him'. 'They had not parted on good terms on that occasion,' Mr Mousley said. 'He was a relative stranger to her. When he turned up in her home she was not expecting him.' On the day of the alleged attack in December 2005 the woman was at home when she saw a white van pull up in her driveway, and then a balaclava-clad man burst into her house. She told police: 'For a millisecond I thought it was somebody messing about. He pushed me to the floor - I couldn’t work out who it was. He said, ""You can’t say no now"". 'It was like a horror film. All I could hear was my heart in my head going bang, bang, bang.' The court heard that the attacker took off his balaclava and said: 'You recognise me now, don’t you?' The woman told police in her interview: 'He was almost spitting at me, he was so angry. It was like he was an animal, not a person. He told me if I shut my eyes he’ll slit my throat.' At this point, she added, she noticed he had a knife. Murder scene: This image shows police officers at Cardiff home of widow Mary Wainwright, 67, who was murdered by Mark Shirley in 1987 . First attack: The flat where 67-year-old widow Mary Wainwright was murdered in Cardiff, marked by an arrow . The court heard that the attacker . went outside to get a washing line, which he used to tie the woman to . her bed before raping her. The . jury was told that the attack lasted 12 hours, during which time the . attacker repeatedly raped the woman, tortured her with a knife, gagged . her and stabbed her in the legs. The court heard that at one point the man left the room to make himself a cup of tea. The . victim told police her attacker had said he wanted to put two pence . pieces on the wounds he inflicted - in an echo of Shirley's first attack . where he left two pence pieces on the body of his victim. The jury was told that, since the 2005 attack, the woman's mental health deteriorated and she was subsequently admitted to a psychiatric hospital after being diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and depression. She has drastically changed her appearance because of her fears she would be targeted again by her attacker. When asked by Shirley’s defence barrister, Sally O’Neill QC, why she started self-harming after the incident, the woman said: 'I have tried to make the scars my own so it’s not like he’s made them, because that scares me.

Britain will have the best-performing major economy in the developed world for the rest of the year, an international watchdog said yesterday. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said it expects growth of more than 0.9 per cent in the UK between July and September and around 0.8 per cent in the final quarter of the year, as the recovery gathers pace. The projections are stronger than anything seen in Britain since early 2010 and better than the growth rates expected in the US, Canada, Japan, Germany, France and Italy. On the up: The OECD now predicted the UK economy will grow by 1.5 per cent this year, up from a forecast of 0.8 per cent in May . The Paris-based think-tank pencilled in growth of 1.5 per cent for Britain in 2013 - nearly double the 0.8 per cent previously expected. Downing Street said it was ‘one of a number of indicators that point in a favourable direction’. It came as the boss of Lloyds Banking Group said Government action to boost mortgage lending is already proving a ‘game-changer for the economy’. George Osborne’s Help to Buy scheme has been heavily criticised amid fears it will push up prices rather than boost housebuilding. But Antonio Horta-Osorio played down talk of a new housing bubble. 'This is a temporary scheme to correct a market anomaly,’ he said. And figures published yesterday showed the construction industry grew at its fastest pace for six years last month. Boost: The forecast is the latest positive economic news for Chancellor George Osborne . The flurry of positive news has fuelled hopes that Britain is finally on the road to recovery, five long years after the financial crisis struck. David Cameron’s official spokesman said: ‘We would continue to say that the Government’s priority is to secure the recovery and keep going with the measures we are taking to deal with the deficit and implement economic reforms.’ The British economy grew by 0.7 per cent between April and June – more than double the 0.3 per cent expansion seen in the first three months of the year. In its Interim Economic Assessment published yesterday, the OECD said: ‘The pace of recovery in the major advanced economies improved in the second quarter and growth is expected to be maintained at a similar rate in the second half of the year. ‘Activity is expanding at encouraging rates in North America, Japan and the UK, while the euro area as a whole is no longer in recession.’ But it warned that growth has slowed in several major emerging economies such as China and India, adding: ‘A sustainable recovery is not yet firmly established and important risks remain.’ The latest construction figures in the UK, however, suggest that the outlook in Britain is still improving. An index of activity in the construction sector, where scores above 50 represent growth, jumped from 57 in July to a six-year high of 59.1 in August. But Rachel Reeves, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, will today claim ‘things are getting harder not easier’ for millions of families as the cost of living rises. * The cost of shopping on the High Street has fallen for the fourth month in a row on the back of long-running summer sales, according to retailers.

With his tartan trews, piercing blue eyes and neatly trimmed moustache, this dashing young war hero was a young girl’s dream. And that young girl just happened to be the 19-year-old Princess Elizabeth. Infantry officer Roddy Macleod was the ‘devastatingly attractive’ chap who set the future Queen’s heart a-flutter back in 1945. Escort duty: Roddy Macleod leaves a theatre with a young Elizabeth - the picture is believed to have been taken in 1945 in Aberdeen . Dashing: Macleod takes Elizabeth, left, and Margaret, right, by the hand to dance . He is pictured escorting her from a theatre shortly after the Second World War and dancing the Dashing White Sergeant with Elizabeth and her sister Princess Margaret. The Daily Mail tracked down the previously unseen photographs after a letter written by the Queen in November 1945 came to light last week, revealing that she had something of a crush on Macleod. In girlishly gossipy prose, the young unmarried Elizabeth wrote to her cousin how she and Margaret had met ‘a devastatingly attractive young giant (with fair hair and blue eyes of course) from Skye called Roddy Macleod! He caused my Margaret’s heart to flutter a bit, I think (mine too, a bit) and he was great fun!’ Macleod’s fascinating story can now be told after his sons, Jamie and Simon Robertson-Macleod, recognised the description of their father, who died in 1989 aged 69, in the Queen’s letter, which was up for sale as part of a collection of royal memorabilia. Simon has since bought the royal letter and will keep it as a treasured family heirloom. In 1945, when he was 26, 6ft 4in Eton-educated Army captain Roderick Cameron Robertson-Macleod had just spent nearly five years as a Nazi prisoner of war. Gossipy: The letter Elizabeth write to her cousin Diana Bowes-Lyon . Gushing: This letter written by the Queen came to light last week which includes the passage about Roddy Macleod . A Cameron Highlander, he was captured in June 1940 at St Valery-en-Caux in northern France. He and his comrades were made to march all the way to Poland, and spent the rest of the war in camps across Poland and Germany. On return to Britain, he was assigned to the Royal Guard at Balmoral. As well as guarding the vivacious young princesses, he taught them Highland dancing and there is no doubt he caught the eye of both the future Queen – who two years later would marry Prince Philip – and her younger sister. After his royal posting, Macleod studied zoology at Cambridge and in 1950 married Daphne, and they had two sons. Aged 93, Daphne now lives in a care home. Macleod earned the Distinguished Service Order for ‘magnificent leadership’ in the Korean War and retired from the Army at 45 as a Lieutenant Colonel. He became commandant of the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan Castle in Fife – where  Princess Margaret paid a royal visit in 1966. ‘The authorities disapproved of him inviting her directly, rather than approaching her through protocol, but of course he did know her,’ said his son Jamie, 62, who lives in Sussex. Distinguished: Macleod was educated at Eton, left, before joining the Army where he was captured and spent five years as a Nazi prisoner of war (right, in his late twenties) ‘Princess Margaret kept in touch with my father, and wrote him a nice letter when he was ill with throat and lung cancer. ‘My father was very good looking, very relaxed, calm under pressure and possessed of a lovely warm and charming character.’ Jamie Robertson-Macleod’s own career has been peppered with royal links. After leaving the Army at 30, he was aide-de-camp to Princess Grace of Monaco. He went on to become chief executive of adventure specialists Raleigh International and was in charge of Prince William’s gap-year trip to Chile in 2000. He joked: ‘We never looked back until this letter came to light. ‘But I could have been the Prince of Wales, Jack [his son] would have been the Duke of Cambridge and we would have been able to live in Buckingham Palace and hand out honours to all our friends.’ Wedding day: Macleod wand Daphne when they tied the knot in 1950.

Council planners have banned a grandfather from selling his flowers outside his village home in aid of a children’s charity - in case the colourful displays distract passing driver. Award-winning gardener Joe Poultney, 69, donates hundreds of pounds made from the sale of his flowers to a local children’s hospice and his village church every year. But he was stunned when bureaucrats from Stafford Borough Council ordered him to stop selling the plants - claiming the vibrant display distracted motorists. Colourful display: Pensioner Joe Poultney, has been ordered to stop selling flowers outside his home in Barlaston, Staffordshire, in case it distracts passing drivers . Congestion: Stafford Borough Council said it received the complaints that the selling of plants from the house on Tittensor Road in Barlaston was causing traffic problems . The pensioner has now been told he must spend £385 to register a planning application for permission to continue selling the blooms outside his home in Barlaston, Staffordshire. Mr Poultney originally started giving away his plants for free but now charges just £1 for a tray of six. Despite donating all the money to charity, he was told he needs to register as a business because he has altered the use of his property. He said: 'This whole episode makes me feel quite sad because I won’t be able to give as much money to the children’s charity and the church as I did last year. Dedication: Mr Poultney spends three hours every single day just watering his prize-winning plants . 'I have always been interested in gardening and I grow a lot plants in my garden as a hobby now I have retired. 'At first I gave any excess plants I had to other residents in the village and then more people asked me whether I could sell some to them. 'If there were any left, I usually sold them for about £1 for a tray of six. It was never intended to be a business. 'I . know the council is worried it might cause problems with congestion on . the road, they even told me the colourful displays could distract . drivers which could cause accidents. 'I have always asked people to park around the corner where Barlaston Methodist Chapel is and I walk to give them their plants. 'I also donate some money to the church for them letting me use the car park. 'It’s ridiculous, I don’t run a garden centre, it is just killjoy council officials.' Mr .

U.S. soldier Bradley Manning was a traitor with one mission as an intelligence analyst in Iraq: to find and reveal government secrets to a group of anarchists and bask in the glory as a whistleblower, a prosecutor said yesterday during closing arguments. Major Ashden Fein said Manning betrayed his country's trust and gave classified information to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, knowing the material would be seen by Al-Qaeda . Even Osama bin Laden had some of the digital files at his compound in Pakistan when he was killed, the prosecutor said. Arrival: Army Pfc.

Closing remarks: Lawyers for the U.S. soldier accused of the biggest leak of classified information in the nation's history are due to make their closing remarks in his court-martial today . 'WikiLeaks was merely the platform . which Pfc. Manning used to ensure all the information was available for . the world, including enemies of the United States,' Fein said. Manning . is charged with 21 offenses, but the most serious is aiding the enemy, . which carries a possible sentence of up to life in prison. Defense attorneys will present their closing arguments today. Under scrutiny: Army Pfc. Bradley Manning is escorted out of a courthouse at Fort Mead, Md, Thursday, July 25, 2013. Manning is charged with indirectly aiding the enemy by sending troves of classified material to WikiLeaks . Betrayed: Maj. Ashden Fein said Manning betrayed his country's trust and gave classified information to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, knowing the material would be seen by Al-Qaeda . Accusations: Manning is charged with providing the WikiLeaks website with more than 700,000 classified files, combat videos and diplomatic cables while serving as a junior intelligence analyst in Iraq in 2009 and 2010 . Defence: David Coombs, center, civilian attorney for Army Pfc. Bradley Manning. Coombs said supporters on Friday would hear what truth sounds like . Manning, 25, was not the troubled, naive soldier defense attorneys have made him out to be, Fein said. He displayed a smiling photo of Manning from 2010 when he was visiting relatives while on leave. Fein said: 'This is a gleeful, grinning Pfc. Manning' who sent battlefield reports to WikiLeaks, accompanied by the message: 'Have a good day.' Manning has acknowledged giving WikiLeaks hundreds of thousands of battlefield reports, diplomatic cables and videos in late 2009 and early 2010. Even Osama bin Laden had some of the digital files at his compound (pictured) in Pakistan when he was killed in 2011, the prosecutor said. But he says he didn't believe the information would harm troops in Afghanistan and Iraq or threaten national security. Claims: Fein said Manning relied on WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange for guidance on what to leak, starting within two weeks of his arrival in Iraq in November 2009 . Prosecutors must prove Manning knew Al-Qaeda would see the material to get a conviction on the most serious charge of aiding the enemy. They presented evidence Manning knew 'the enemy' in general used the Internet, and that leakers with evil intent might use WikiLeaks to spill secrets. Fein's closing remarks, including calling Manning a traitor, struck a chord with his supporters. As court recessed for the day, a man said, 'You're a hero, Bradley, as far as I'm concerned.' Several others murmured support for Manning in what became a loud buzz. The judge angrily shouted, 'Gallery, that's enough!' Defense attorney David Coombs said supporters on Friday would hear what truth sounds like. Fein said Manning relied on WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange for guidance on what to leak, starting within two weeks of his arrival in Iraq in November 2009. Referring to a 'Most Wanted Leaks' list the organization published, Fein said WikiLeaks sought almost exclusively information about the U.S. Federal authorities also are looking into whether Assange can be prosecuted. He has been holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid extradition to Sweden on sex crimes allegations. Manning pleaded guilty earlier this year to reduced versions of some charges. He faces up to 20 years in prison for those offenses, but prosecutors pressed ahead with the original charges.","Bradley Manning, 25 is charged with indirectly aiding the enemy by sending troves of classified material to WikiLeaks .

Researchers found that those closed as 'vulnerable' - excessive drinkers, young and less well off smokers - consume less alcohol if the price of tobacco is increased. In the first study of its kind, experts at Yale University found a 'modest to moderate' reduction in alcohol intake when smoking becomes more expensive. Link: When taxes on cigarettes are increased, vulnerable groups, including younger smokers and heavy drinkers, consume less alcohol, according to a new study (pictures posed by models) Professor Sherry McKee said: 'Smoking and heavy drinking co-occur at alarmingly high rates. 'Tobacco can enhance the subjective effects of alcohol and has been shown to increase the risk for heavy and problematic drinking. 'Smokers drink more frequently and more heavily than non-smokers, and are substantially more likely than non-smokers to meet criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence.' The results of the study, published in the journal Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research, added that the health risks are greatly increased when alcohol and tobacco are consumed together. It also found that an increase in tax on cigarettes leads to less people taking up smoking, more people quitting and a decrease in the number of smoking related deaths. Professor McKee added: 'Cigarette taxes have broad population reach and have been recognized as one of the most significant policy instruments to reduce smoking. Dangerous: The study found that the risk to health is far greater when alcohol and cigarettes are consumed together (pictured posed by model) 'By increasing the price of cigarettes, taxes are thought to encourage smokers to reduce their use of cigarettes or quit altogether, and discourage non-smokers from starting to smoke.' The study looked at interviews with more than 21,000 drinkers as part of a large scale U.S study. While the results suggest that an increase in taxes on cigarrettes stopped male drinkers consuming as much alcohol, that effect was increased among heavy male drinkers, young adults and those with the lowest income. Dr Christopher Kahler, of Brown University, said: 'These findings suggest that if states increase taxes on cigarettes, they are not only likely to reduce smoking - based on a large body of literature - but they also may have a modest impact on heavy drinking rates among men, those with lower income, and those who drink most heavily.'","A Yale study found the link between taxes and alcohol consumption .

Residents in Switzerland are going to extreme lengths every summer to try to protect an ancient glacier in The Alps. Protective blankets have been laid over the undulating mounds and folds of part of the ice in an effort to ebb the annual melt as average temperatures gradually climb. The Rhone Glacier, the source of the Rhone River in the centre of the Swiss Alps, has retreated dramatically over the past 150 years, according to research. Optical illusion: From afar it looks as if nothing has changed, but look a little closer and ti becomes clear this glacier has been coated in a hundreds of white blankets. Researchers go to great lengths every summer to cover the ice in an effort to slow the melting process caused by global warming . The innovative method of trying to minimise the ice-melt has also been designed to allow visitors to witness the incredible ancient ice from an entirely unique perspective, for as long as possible. The landowners have carved a tunnel inside the glacier, large enough to walk through, allowing people to almost step back in time into a world which has not been exposed for many thousands of years. Samples of ice had previously pre-dated the glacier to at least the 17th century. But new technological advances, coupled with access to recently-exposed rock, have now allowed them to date the ancient structure to at least 11,500 years old. The annual covering of this section of . the glacier is an attempt by the family who own the land to preserve . their ice tunnel which brings in an income. Unique: Scientists have also carved a long tunnel into the ice for their own research purposes, and giving visitors a completely unique insight into an ancient world under the glacier . As recent ice melts have exposed rocks . and soil for the first time in thousands of years, they have revealed interesting . clues from remnants of organic material and artifacts of human . settlements. A team of scientists from Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory have found that the Alps' great glacier has also been shrinking and growing over time, in response to changes in the climate. Using isotope measurements from rock newly exposed by the melting glacier, the scientists found that for most of the Holocene Epoch period, dating from the end of the last Ice Age about, 11,500 years ago, the Rhone was in fact smaller than it is today. Using this dating technique, the researchers believe they may be able to apply their model to other glaciers worldwide and use the data to piece together a global picture of the Halocene period. Eerie: Stepping into the glacial tunnel truly is like stepping back in time, walking through a passage of ice that has been hidden from view for thousands of years . The data could also be used to predict the rate at which, given current trends in climate change, these giant formations will recede over time. The scientists also warn that the revelation that the Rhone Glacier was once smaller than it is today, could be used as an example by climate change-skeptics, that there is no harm in things changing. However, quoted in an article published by Columbia University's Earth Institute, Joerg Schaefer, a geochemist and Lamont associate research professor, said this is 'simply wrong'. He said the findings show that even though the climate shifts were relatively mild during the Holocene period, 'we find that the glaciers really reacted strongly … telling us they are very, very sensitive to even very small (changes). 'With the addition of man-made warming, the glaciers will react catastrophically to what we are doing to the climate.' The Rhone Glacier in Switzerland has been retreating for 150 years, but new research shows that it was smaller than it is toady 11,500 years ago. Scientists warn however that these fluctuations were without man's influence showing how sensitive glaciers are to small climate changes .","Every summer researchers cover the Rhone Glacier in the Swiss Alps in giant white blankets to try to minimise melting .

The family of Robert F Kennedy Jr’s late wife has hired a high-powered investigation firm to look into ‘unanswered questions’ about her death, according to reports. Mary Richardson’s relatives have asked Washington-based Investigative Group International to see if the suicide on May 16 was actually a ‘wrongful death’. The company - which was hired by Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal -  is said to have assigned a former homicide prosecutor to the case which will also examine Mr Kennedy’s movements in the days before. Tragic: The family of Mary Richardson Kennedy, who was married to Robert F Kennedy Jr, has hired a powerful law firm to investigate her death . The explosive development opens the . door to the Richardson family bringing an unlawful death lawsuit against . Mr Kennedy because they believe he is in part responsible for her . demise. The reports suggest Miss Richardson’s . family are not convinced by the official account of what happened on . the day of her death, which a coroner ruled was suicide by hanging. They had already gone to court in a . bitter row with the Kennedys over what would happen to Miss Richardson’s . body after her death. Both families claimed ownership but a . judge ruled for the Kennedys and she was buried in the family plot in . Cape Cod, Massachusetts. There is no suggestion whatsoever that Mr Kennedy has been accused of any wrongdoing in relation to his wife’s death. Her family have also not filed a wrongful death lawsuit against him - so far. But according to the New York Post, . Investigative Group International has already begun looking at details . of the hanging itself, which took place at Miss Richardson’s $3.5million . mansion in upstate New York. Investigation: The family of Mary Richardson Kennedy wants her death looked into after she killed herself at the family home in Mount Kisco, NewYork . A key issue is said to be whether or . not Miss Richardson could have tied the complicated knot that was used . on the noose she was found hanging from. The firm hired by the Richardson family to investigate RFK Jr has close ties to the Democrat party and once worked for the late Ted Kennedy. Investigative Group International was also hired by former president Bill Clinton to dig up dirt on the prosecutors who tried to impeach him during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. At the time the company was dubbed ‘Bill Clinton’s private CIA’. Ted Kennedy hired the firm when he was a Senator for Massachusetts - but it will now investigate another leading member of Kennedy clan. IGI was founded in 1984 by longtime Washington operator Terry Lenzner and has amassed a long list of corporate, political and celebrity clients who have asked it to undertake ‘opposition research’, or what critics say is digging up dirt on people. Mike Tyson hired the firm to look into whether or not jurors who convicted him of rape had acted inappropriately. Ivanka Trump used its services to look into her love rival Marla Maples, who was married to real estate mogul Donald Trump before she was. In the early 1990s, Lenzner also investigated the Paula Jones case for the Clinton camp. The firm however has seen controversy and in 2000 it was caught going through the trash of think tanks that had backed Microsoft. At the time IGI had been employed by Microsoft rival Oracle - it reportedly paid janitors $1,200 to hand over the rubbish. Lenzner is a former federal prosecutor who became known on Capitol Hill as co-chief counsel to the Senate Watergate Committee in 1972. His powerful friends from the time include author and journalist Cokie Roberts and former Senator Tim Worth. New York City Police Commissioner Ray Kelly once worked for the firm which on its website claims it merely engages in ‘conducts confidential fact-finding investigations with the utmost discretion’. Lenzner himself has said there is ‘nothing nefarious’ about his work but neighbours have said he has a ‘dark side that’s pretty scary’.

Romantic: The crowd saw David drop to one knee to propose . The couple were on the field answering questions when the announcer passed the microphone to David, who one commenter claims worked for the team. 'Will you marry me Jessica?' he asked. Stepping back with her hands over her mouth, Jessica stammered: 'David, I'm sorry, I can't.' She then sprinted out of the stadium as the announcer laughed. 'Sorry, I don't mean to laugh David, I don't think we've ever had this happen before,' he said. The rejected suitor turned as red as his T-shirt as he ran out away, with the mascot still dancing around the field. The Big Lead speculates the proposal could simply be a hoax, but the Huffington Post reckons . the 'woman's off-microphone reaction seems pretty real'.

Patients who undergo planned operations at the weekend rather than a Monday are 82 per cent more likely to die. Shocking findings show that death rates for elective procedures increase throughout the working week. This will add to mounting concern about NHS patients receiving poor care during ‘antisocial’ hours when consultants are off duty. The study has led to calls for a rethink on whether elective surgery should take place at the weekend . The study suggests for the first time that some weekdays are safer than others, with Friday and the weekend being most hazardous for planned surgery. Researchers from Imperial College London looked at four million elective operations in NHS hospitals in England between 2008 and 2011 with at least one night spent in hospital. Elective surgery normally involves procedures such as heart bypass, hip and knee replacements, gastric operations and hysterectomies. Altogether 27,500 patients died within 30 days of surgery, with the risk lowest for those having it on Monday and rising on each subsequent day of the week. The extra risk on Tuesday was minimal, but went up to 15 per cent on Wednesday, 21 per cent for Thursday patients and 44 per cent on Friday (all compared with Monday). Almost one in 20 operations was performed at a weekend, when the increased risk reached 82 per cent, said the study published online at bmj.com. The study found that the risk from elective operations in the NHS increased throughout the week . Lead researcher Dr Paul Aylin said: ‘The . first 48 hours after an operation are often the most critical period of . care for surgery patients. A failure to rescue the patient could be due . to well-known issues relating to reduced and/or locum staffing and . poorer availability of staff over a weekend.’ Frailer patients were at even higher risk at weekends. Dr Aylin said: ‘Unlike previous studies, we included both deaths in hospital and deaths after discharge, so this eliminates a potential bias of counting only in-hospital deaths. 'We tried to account for the possibility that different types of patients might have operations at the end of the week, but our adjustment made little difference. ‘This leaves us with the possibility . that the differences in mortality rates are due to poorer quality of . care at the weekend, perhaps because of less availability of staff, . resources and diagnostic services.’ The Imperial College London study found frailer patients were even more at risk at weekends . Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt last week condemned the scandal of out-of-hours care . Health . Secretary Jeremy Hunt last week condemned the scandal of out-of-hours . care, with patients seldom able to see their own GP as opposed to locum . doctors ‘who don’t know you from Adam’. Canadian doctors writing a commentary on the study said there should be a rethink on whether any elective surgery should take place at the weekend. They wrote: ‘Although emergency procedures such as the repair of ruptured aortic aneurysms cannot be controlled, the scheduling of elective procedures, such as knee replacements, is wholly within our control. ‘If weekend care proves to deliver poorer outcomes than its weekday counterpart, it might be argued that elective procedures should not be scheduled at weekends at all.’ Previous research found that hundreds of deaths could be avoided every year by putting consultants in charge of care, regardless of the day of the week. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: ‘We know  of cases where patients get admitted  on a Friday night and, if there’s a bank  holiday, they don’t get any proper  care until Tuesday morning because of the lack of experienced staff and  diagnostic facilities. ‘Quite apart from the human cost, this costs the NHS because they may need more treatment as a result.’","Study found death rates for elective procedures increase through the week .

A gay couple are thought to have become the first in the UK to hold a civil partnership ceremony in a church building. Kieran Bohan and Warren Hartley made a commitment to each other at the Ullet Road Unitarian Church, in Liverpool, last month and are currently enjoying their honeymoon. The couple, who described the event as a 'milestone for equality', only received council approval that the church could register civil partnerships a week before their big day. Plans to allow religious buildings to host civil ceremonies were announced last February but the legislation was only implemented in December after public consultation. Kieran, 41, who runs a youth group, said: 'The pace of change is extraordinarily remarkable, but there is still work to be done. Life partners: Kieran Bohan and Warren Hartley have become the first gay couple to hold a civil ceremony in a religious building, but do other want the same? 'There has been a lot of controversy over the government’s consultation over the equality of marriage and civil partnerships. 'When we booked our blessing over a year ago we had no idea this would be possible. We are delighted to have achieved this milestone on the road to equality.' The couple, from Toxteth, Liverpool, have been together for four-and-a-half years and met through their involvement in groups for gay people of faith. Warren, 36, an administrator originally from Sydney, said: 'Bringing the two elements together means we are able to integrate our sexuality and our spirituality, to celebrate our love for each other and our love of God.' Around 150 people attended the service at the Grade I-listed building, where Angela Howard, the lay minister, of the Ullet Road Unitarian Church led the blessing service and the couple made a commitment to each other. Angela Howard, said: 'Many of our Unitarian churches have conducted blessings for same sex couples, either to complement a legal civil union or simply to affirm a relationship, for many years. 'We are so pleased to have the first civil partnership on religious premises, but we will continue striving for all couples to have equal access to civil marriages, religious marriages and civil partnerships.' The Unitarian Church is traditionally a far more liberal Christian tradition than the Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church. They proclaim to be an open community celebrating diverse beliefs that does not discriminate 'on grounds of gender, age, race, religion or sexual orientation'. Last month’s ceremony is understood to have contained elements of both the Roman Catholic and Anglican traditions. Kieran said there was a 'lot of . ignorance and fear' around the issues of same-sex marriages but the . Unitarian Church had been very welcoming. Registrar Janet Taubman said: 'I am delighted that the couple got what they wanted - a religious celebration and legal recognition.' The Chief Executive of lesbian, gay and bisexual charity Stonewall, Ben Summerskill said: ‘This is an important matter of religious freedom and tolerance. 'Faiths like the Unitarians, the Quakers and Liberal and Reform Judaism are committed to celebrating unions between loving and committed same-sex couples, which is why Stonewall lobbied hard to make sure religious groups can celebrate civil partnerships if they wish. 'Kieran and Warren are pioneers, and we send them our very best wishes. We hope to see many more registrations take place in tolerant places of worship in the years ahead.' Pioneers: Kieran Bohan and Warren Hartley held their blessing service in a church . Legislation allowing such same-sex ceremonies in churches was brought in as part of Equalities Act. But the Church of England, the country’s largest denomination, has refused to allow civil partnerships, while the Roman Catholics Church’s views on homosexuality has stood in the way of same-sex ceremonies in its churches. The Government has begun a . consultation on allowing gay couples in England and Wales to marry. But the . proposal is fiercely opposed by some senior church figures, as well as a . number of Conservative MPs. Civil partnerships, introduced in 2005, give gay couples similar legal . rights to married couples. But the Government wants them to be legally . allowed to make vows and declare they are married before the next . General Election, due in 2015. David Cameron threw his weight behind the proposals in a speech to last . year’s Tory party conference. The Prime Minister’s parliamentary . secretary Desmond Swayne has also backed the plans. He said marriage was a blessing he wants extended to everyone and added: . ‘I have come at this issue of equal marriage principally because I’m a . Christian.’ But a number of Tory MPs have voiced their opposition to the measures and a poll by ComRes found that 70 per cent of the public want to keep the current definition of marriage. Alistair Thompson from The Coalition For Marriage said: 'We are happy that this wedding has taken place as long as the church has not been in anyway coerced into performing the ceremony. 'We accept that some churches will choose to hold them as they already do in America. But we are strongly opposed to anyone forcing churches to perform same sex marriages against their will.' The proposed reform of the marriage laws, on which consultation will finish this month, would cover only civil marriages for gay and lesbian couples and would not affect religious marriages or offer heterosexual couples the option of civil partnerships. The reform would have the force of law in England and Wales, but not Scotland or Northern Ireland. Under the plans, lesbian and gay couples who are already in civil partnerships will be offered the option of an 'upgrade' to civil marriage status. Launching the proposals, the equalities minister, Lynne Featherstone, described marriage as a celebration of love that should be available to everyone. 'I believe that if a couple love each other and want to commit to a life together, they should have the option of a civil marriage, whatever their gender,' she said. *In a previous version of this article words normally reserved for traditional marriage and not civil partnerships were used.

Christi and Dave, 45, a telecoms engineer, went through 20 months of heartache, including suffering two miscarriages, before falling pregnant in February with the help of the fertility drug Clomid. Christi, who is a master at stretching Dave's $80,000 (£50,000) a year income, decided she wanted a 17th baby just five months after youngest Nathaniel, two, was born. But sadly, despite falling pregnant within three months, Christi lost the baby just before her 12 week scan. Pregnant again: Dave Cason said he is 'so excited' at the prospect of becoming a father for the seventeenth time . The couple tried again for a year without success, then, in September 2012, Christi's GP suggested she take Clomid, which stimulates the hormones necessary for ovulation. 'We were desperate,' said Christi. 'We really wanted another baby and had never had any problems conceiving in the past. 'The biggest age gap between any of our other children is only 22 months.' Just three months later, in November 2012, Christi was overjoyed when she fell pregnant. But tragically, just three days before Christmas, she miscarried again at nine weeks. Although devastated, Christi and Dave were determined to try again, and are thrilled she is now 16 weeks pregnant. Christi also believes her health has improved in recent months, meaning she may have ovulated this time, even without help. 'I feel really positive for the future,' she added. 'I think if we try for an 18th baby I might not need any medication. 'Labours are always pretty easy and I never get morning sickness. I love seeing the bump grow and feeling the first kick.'

The skin and bones of a male polar bear, that is believed to have starved to death, has been discovered washed up in Svalbard, in the Arctic Ocean. Experts claim low sea ice levels caused by climate change meant the bear couldn't hunt seals and this caused the bear to unsuccessfully search more than 150 miles for food. Climate change is said to have reduced sea ice in the Arctic region to record lows and is 'absolutely, categorically and without question' the reason why polar bears are dying out, according to one wildlife expert. The 'skin and bones' of a male polar bear, pictured, said to have starved to death have been discovered washed up in Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean. Experts claim low sea ice levels caused by climate change meant the bear couldn't hunt seals and caused the bear to unsuccessfully search further afield for food . Australian scientists have warned that seaweed could smother small creatures living on the sea floor on the coast of the Arctic and Antarctic if melting ice exposes their environment. Animals including sponges that live in near perpetual darkness, protected by sea ice that blocks the sun's powerful rays in spring and summer but if the sea ice melts as the Earth's temperature warms up, they could be smothered by seaweed. Biologists are worried that if the sea ice melts earlier on in the year, shallow-water ecosystems will soak up more sunlight and algae will spread across the sea floor, changing the habitat of sponges, tunicates and worms that anchor to rocks dramatically. Dr Ian Stirling from Polar Bears International has studied polar bears in the region for the past 40 years. He told The Guardian that the way the bear was found, lying on its stomach, suggests that it starved to death and just dropped to the ground when it died. There was no remaining fat on the bear either, and it had been reduced to little more than 'skin and bone'. Stirling claims that the lack of sea ice, which bears use to hunt seals, would have forced the bear to search further afield for food. The bear's search was unsuccessful and he starved to death while searching. In April, researchers from the Norwegian Polar Institute were said to have captured and examined the bear in the south of Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean north of Norway. At the time, the bear 'appeared healthy'. The bear carcass, pictured, was found on an Arctic cruise by Polar Bear scientist, Dr Ian Stirling. The winter of 2012 was one of the worst on record for sea ice levels and this caused the bear to travel more than 150 miles from home to find food . In July scientists discovered the bear's carcass in the northern part of the archipelago, around 150 miles from where it has been spotted and captured in previous years. This means the bear had travelled a significant distance from its home in search of food. Research published in May found that the size and breeding success of polar bears was being directly affected by the fact the sea was taking longer to freeze and the animals had to spend more time on land. This increase in temperature was attributed to climate change. Only 20,000 to 25,000 bears are thought to remain and eight out of the known 19 species of the bear are said to be in decline. Douglas Richardson from the Highland Wildlife Park believes ice loss due to climate change is 'absolutely, categorically and without question the cause of falling polar bear populations. While Jeff Flocken from the International Fund for Animal Welfare also blames commercial trade of polar bear parts in Canada . Polar bears almost exclusively eat seals and they need sea ice to hunt and capture these seals. In 2012 sea ice levels in the Arctic dropped to their lowest ever and the sea ice break around Svalbard earlier this year happened quicker and faster than in previous years. Although climate change and its effect on sea ice levels is disputed, Douglas Richardson from the Highland Wildlife Park near Kingussie told The Guardian that: 'This particular polar bear is the latest bit of evidence of the impact of climate change' and ice loss due to climate change is 'absolutely, categorically and without question' the cause of falling polar bear populations. Jeff Flocken from the International Fund for Animal Welfare is reluctant to attribute it completely to climate change, though, and also blames the commercial trade of polar bear parts in Canada as being a factor, too.","Experts found the carcass of a polar bear in Svalbard in the Arctic Ocean .

The website reported that Vodafone moved senior marketing managers to Dublin to protect global royalty revenues from UK taxation, and trigger a lower Irish corporation tax bill from 25 per cent to 12.5 per cent of profits. This was significantly lower than the UK rate, which was 28 per cent of profits between 2008 and 2010. A series of lively hearings of the Public Accounts Committee saw MPs savage companies such as Google for aggressively avoiding tax by exploiting legal loopholes. Recently released figures show Google paid a paltry £10.6million in tax between 2006 and 2011 on revenue of £12 billion in the UK. The firm's boss Eric Schmidt appeared before the Committee in May, where chairman Margaret Hodge branded Google ‘devious’, ‘unethical’ and ‘evil’. And Starbucks was revealed to have paid nothing in corporation tax in the last three years despite sales of £400million in 2011 and had only paid £8.6million since it began trading in the UK 14 years ago. In June the coffee chain paid £5million of a £10million tax bill agreed with the Government for this year. It will pay a further £10million in tax next year. Accounts filed in Dublin show that in 2009, the British taxman settled a dispute with Vodafone over its Irish tax returns, the website reported yesterday. The overall size of the settlement has not been revealed, but it involved Vodafone reclaiming £57million from the Irish Government in tax that should have been paid in the UK, it reports. Vodafone, the world’s second largest mobile phone company by revenue, has paid no corporation tax in Britain for two successive years, despite paying £2.6billion in international taxes in 2012. The company confirmed to the Guardian that its settlement had never been separately disclosed in its annual reports, and was not connected to a £1.25billion payment to the British revenue in 2010, to settle a much-publicised dispute over the use of a Luxembourg subsidiary. A spokesman for HMRC refused to confirm whether any settlement over Vodafone’s Irish tax affairs had been made, saying it was prevented by law from discussing the affairs of individual taxpayers. Vodafone strongly rejected any suggestion of tax avoidance and said there have been no allegations of wrongdoing. The company said its disputes with the UK taxman over its tax arrangements in Ireland and Luxembourg would not block it from government contracts under current rules. A spokesman for Vodafone Ireland last night told the Irish Daily Mail she had ‘no comment to make’. The matter concerns the tax issue of the Vodafone Group, which is a separate company for revenue and reporting structures. Vodafone Group issued the following statement in response . to the story: . 'Vodafone conducts itself in full compliance with the law and . always operates under a policy of full transparency with the tax authorities in . all countries in which we operate. 'Vodafone's relationship with tax authorities is based on . complete disclosure and a rigorous adherence to due process at all times. 'Vodafone's Group brand and marketing function was . established during a period of significant international expansion and as a . global business it is feasible to locate centralised Group functions in a . number of different locations depending on a range of factors. 'In 2001, Dublin was identified as a location for this . activity on a number of grounds including the commercial, regulatory and tax . environment in Ireland at that time and Vodafone began to use a Dublin-based . subsidiary to collect royalties and brand management fees from operating . companies and partners to fund the development of the Vodafone brand around the . world. 'Vodafone's relationship with tax authorities is based on . complete disclosure and a rigorous adherence to due process at all times' 'The royalty payments that were made were done so under . domestic and international transfer pricing rules which are set up by . governments to allocate appropriate taxable profits from one country to . another. 'The company’s local UK and Italy operating companies . continued to pay fees to Vodafone Group in the UK and no royalties have ever . been paid from the UK to Ireland or elsewhere. 'The settlement with HMRC related to a number of technical . factors regarding inter-Group transfer pricing arrangements. Notably, . throughout the period covered by the settlement, the profits of VIML had been . taxed by the Irish authorities at the rate of 25 per cent. 'In accordance with the Treaty between the UK and Ireland . which prevents double taxation on the same income, the Irish government . credited taxes previously paid by Vodafone and these were then paid to the UK . Treasury as part of the overall settlement. 'This was disclosed in Vodafone's annual report and accounts.

Couple: Errol Damelin, 43, lives with his wife Julie, 45, and their three children aged four, 12 and 14 . The founder of Wonga is splitting from his wife after 15 years of marriage, it has been revealed. Errol Damelin, 43, who lives with his wife Julie, 45, and their children aged four, 12 and 14, in a six-bedroom house in Hampstead, north-west London, founded the payday lender in 2007. The couple’s lawyer said last night that their split was ‘with sadness’ but added that they were separating ‘amicably’ and ‘remain fully committed to the welfare and happiness of their children’. An expensive legal battle is therefore unlikely, which should ensure South Africa-born Mr Damelin can hold onto his £30million stake of the company, which is based in Camden, north-west London, reported The Sun. A statement from their legal firm Lewis Silkin sent to MailOnline said: 'It is with sadness that Errol and Julie Damelin announce that they are to separate amicably. They remain fully committed to the welfare and happiness of their children.' Mr Damelin - educated at Boston University in Massachusetts and Cape Town University in South Africa - is a keen skier, cyclist and runner, and founded his first company in Israel. He set up Wonga with business partner Jonty Hurwitz - and it now employs 500 people, making 3.5million loans last year totalling £1billion, which was a 40 per cent rise on the previous year. But it has attracted criticism for having a representative APR of 5,853 per cent - although a typical advance of £200 for 14 days would incur fees and interest of around £34. Wonga has come under strong attack this year from the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who has promised to compete it out of existence by setting up a Church of England credit union.

But Dr Welby later admitted that the rival will not be ready to do business for more than ten years - because setting up credit unions to compete with Wonga will take ‘major skills and much time’. It was a second climbdown after his criticism of the company last month was rapidly followed by the disclosure that the Church’s pension fund had invested money in one of Wonga’s financial backers. Wonga has also come under attack since it was announced as Newcastle United FC’s main kit sponsor last October, prompting a Senegalese player at the club to refuse to wear the branded shirt. Muslim striker Papiss Cisse had originally done this on religious grounds, but following talks with the club, his family and Islamic teachers, the £40,000-a-week player said last month he would wear it.","Errol Damelin, 43, is married to Julie, 45, with children aged 4, 12 and 14 .

The fugitive businessman whose evidence could see media tycoon Alexander Lebedev jailed for up to five years has been filmed in Israel, it was claimed today. Property mogul Sergei Polonsky, 40, was caught on camera alongside a woman on a balcony in a prestigious Tel Aviv district, according to a Russian TV channel. Polonsky, who is himself wanted in Russia over allegations of a massive property fraud, was also filmed entering an apartment block, said reports. Scroll down for video .

Aviv, Israel . And a fugitive: Polonsky is wanted in Russia for . an alleged $121million mortgage fraud and in Cambodia over the alleged . kidnapping of a group of sailors he is said to have threatened with a . knife . The sighting could have a dramatic impact on Mr Lebedev's ongoing trial in Moscow. Polonsky's lawyers had told the judge that he cannot give evidence in person because he is on bail in Cambodia and unable to leave the country. Lebedev - whose son Evgeny owns the Evening Standard and the Independent titles - denies a charge of 'hooliganism motivated by political hatred' over a fracas during a TV talk show when he appeared to twice punch Mr Polonsky. Lebedev, 53, strongly disputes any political motive, arguing that he was defending himself. The trial resumes on Friday in Moscow but the sighting of Polonsky in Israel gives it a sensational new twist, especially if the judge accepts calls by Lebedev's legal team that the star witness should now travel to the Russian capital and give evidence in person. Fast one pulled? Lawyers for Polonksy, . purportedly shown again here, had told the judge in Alexander Lebedev's . trial he cannot give evidence in person as he is on bail in .

Polonsky is also on Russia's federal wanted list over a £121million fraud case in which he and others are accused of embezzling money belonging to investors in a planned elite residential complex in Moscow. The TV footage apparently obtained by Israeli channel 9 was also screened on several Russian channels. If confirmed, it is also likely to anger the Cambodian authorities.

Polonsky is under investigation in the country over allegations he kidnapped a group of sailors and threatened them with a knife. Keo Vanthan, director of Interpol at Cambodia's Ministry of Interior, said Polonsky's criminal trial in the country must take precedence over any other legal action. He was freed on bail in April on the understanding he did not leave Cambodia. 'He has to face legal action in Cambodia,' he said. There have been persistent reports suggesting Polonsky had left the country, possibly on a diplomatic plane, and travelled to Switzerland and Luxembourg before going to Israel.

They endure the highest fares in Europe while being squeezed into old and overcrowded carriages. Meanwhile train company profits soar thanks to huge taxpayer subsidies. The Manchester University report says privatisation has ‘failed to deliver’ for either passengers or taxpayers. Britain's rail passengers are the victims of a 'great train robbery', a damning study concludes today . It says private train firms are heavily dependent on the public purse to enable them to run services, and re-invest little of their profits back into the railways. According to the study for the Trades Union Congress, the train companies receiving the largest state subsidies spent, on average, more than 90 per cent of their profits on shareholder dividends. It revealed that despite a 60 per cent increase in passengers since 1994-1995, there has only been a 3 per cent increase in the number of new carriages. Report came as rail watchdogs revealed that Network Rail is on track for a £75million fine for failing to meet punctuality targets . Ministers hit back, insisting privatisation had ‘transformed’ an industry in decline while increased investment meant more than 2,000 new carriages were on order. The report came as rail watchdogs revealed that Network Rail is on track for a £75million fine for failing to meet punctuality targets that will put it in breach of its licence. Today’s highly critical 166-page report says report says train companies receiving the largest state subsidies spent, on average, over 90per cent of their profits on shareholder dividends. They made operating profits between 2007 and 2011 of £504million, most of which was paid to shareholders, said the report. Meanwhile passengers have endured higher fares and more overcrowding on older trains, says the study carried out for the Trades Union Congress (TUC) by the Centre for Research on Social-Cultural Change (CRESC) at the University of Manchester. Long distance, day return and season tickets are all around twice the price of similar tickets in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, which have publicly-run rail systems, while average train fares in the UK increased at three times the rate of average wages between 2008 and 2012. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘This study explodes the myth that rail firms are bringing added value to our railways. In reality they rely upon taxpayers to turn a profit, virtually all of which ends up in shareholders’ pockets, rather than being used to improve services. ‘Rail privatisation has not brought the improvements its cheerleaders promised - the average age of trains has increased and most new investment is funded by the state.’ She added: ‘The claim that private train operators are responsible for more people using the railways must also be taken with a huge pinch of salt.’ ‘The Government must accept that the current model is broken. ‘ . Long distance, day return and season tickets are all around twice the price of similar tickets in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, which have publicly-run rail systems, while average train fares in the UK increased at three times the rate of average wages between 2008 and 2012 . Professor Karel Williams who headed the research said: 'The privately-owned train operating companies have hijacked the government’s rail reform agenda which is all about ‘getting franchising back on track’. But the Government rejected the report. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘We do not accept the TUC’s analysis of the rail industry. The fact is privatisation works. It has transformed an industry that was in decline into one that is providing record numbers of journeys for record numbers of passengers and is one of the safest in Europe.’ He added ministers were embarking on ‘the biggest programmes of rail investment ever’ including widespread electrification, more than over 2,000 new carriages and statin upgrades made possible only by Governments working closely with ‘an innovative private sector.’ Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: ‘Britain’s railway has been transformed in the last 15 years, thanks to the public and private sectors working successfully together to deliver for passengers and taxpayers.’","Britain's rail passengers endure the highest fares in Europe, report says .

The single mother accusing Herman Cain of flying her across the U.S. so they could have a 13-year affair once sued a former employer for sexual harassment, it was revealed today. Ginger White, from Atlanta, Georgia, says the Republican presidential candidate wined and dined her at the Four Seasons and other fine restaurants and hotels throughout their relationship, which ended only eight months ago. But Ms White is an unemployed single mother-of-two with numerous evictions on her record - including one just this month. In 2001 she filed a sexual harassment claim against her former employer, which was later settled. She also had a protection order sought against her by an ex-business partner, reported WAGA. The partner, Kimberly Vay, also reportedly filed a successful libel suit against Ms White. Mr Cain denied the affair, but a statement from his attorney side-steps the question entirely by claiming the allegations are not a matter open for public scrutiny. But they represent the most serious claims yet against Mr Cain, who has been accused of sexual harassment against four other women. And Mr Cain began defending himself . before the allegations even surfaced. He broke the news himself on CNN . that Ms White would make claims against him. 'This appears to be an accusation of . private, alleged consensual conduct between adults - a subject matter . which is not a proper subject of inquiry by the media or the public,' said a statement from Mr Cain's lawyer. The statement, however, does not explicitly deny the affair. In an interview with Fox 5 in Atlanta yesterday, Ms White said she was only coming forward because she was afraid . someone would tell her story before she herself could. 'I'm not proud,' she said. 'I did not want to do this. I did not.' Mr Cain has been accused of sexual . harassment by four other women, two of whom have come forward publicly . with their allegations. However, to this point, the only . accusations were about inappropriate advances or comments. Ms White is . saying he cheated on his wife for more than a decade . Scroll down for video . 'Here we go again': Herman Cain had already denied the allegations that he had an affair... before the accusations fully emerged . 'It was pretty simple. It wasn't complicated,' she told the local TV station. 'I was aware that he was married. And I was also aware I was involved in a very inappropriate situation, relationship.' As well as an alleged relationship with Ginger White, Mr Cain has been accused of sexual misconduct by four other women: . Mr Cain has been married to his wife Gloria since 1968. Both have vehemently denied allegations of sexual harassment. And Mr Cain's denial of the new allegations were similarly complete. 'I just wanted to give you a heads up and your audience a heads up, ""Here we go again,""' he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN's Situation Room. The Georgia native said he knew the woman as an 'acquaintance who I thought . was a friend.' He denied having an affair, instead saying he tried to help her with financial problems. Mr Cain said he would not drop out of the race and said he wasn't concerned that the allegations would hurt his candidacy. 'I'm more concerned what this will do to my family,' he told the CNN host. Instead, Mr Cain deflected the criticism . and said the allegations were part of an extended conspiracy to keep him . out of office. As proof of the lengthy relationship, Ms White offered her mobile phone, which has Mr Cain's private number. Coming forward: Ms White, an Atlanta businesswoman, she was only coming forward because she was afraid someone would tell her story first . Standing by her man: Gloria Cain has been consistent in her support for her husband . Ms White also showed mobile phone . records dating back four months that have 61 phone calls and text . messages to or from Mr Cain as early as 4.26am and as late as 7.52pm. 'He made it very intriguing,' Ms White . told FOX 5. 'It was fun. It was something that took me away from my . humdrum life at the time. And it was exciting.' Ms White said the two met in . Louisville, Kentucky, in the late 1990s when Mr Cain was the president . of the National Restaurant Association. That night, she says, Mr Cain took her out for drinks and then invited her up to his hotel room. 'I'd . like to see you again. You are beautiful to me, and I would love for us . to continue this friendship,' Ms White claims Mr Cain told her. Going on: Mr Cain said he knew the woman as a friend but did not have an inappropriate relationship with her . From then, he paid for her to fly to his speaking engagements across the country, where he put her up in fancy hotels and restaurants like the Ritz Carlton and the Four Seasons. Ms White has a checkered background, Fox 5 reports. She's an unemployed single mother of two children with numerous evictions on her record in Georgia - including one just this month. She is currently unemployed and was sued by her former business partner. But she says her story is still credible.

Barraza tweeted an image of a sign in a local Hooters with the caption ‘My local hooters won't serve Bob Filner.’ A Hooters spokesperson told Slate that all San Diego Hooters have banded together to ban their depraved mayor. ‘The signs went up at our four locations in San Diego this morning,’ Melissa Fry, director of marketing for HootWinc, the west coast Hooters franchise, told the site. ‘It's not a political move for us in any way, shape, or form. We're strictly taking a stand for the fair treatment of women. At our franchise alone, we employ 1100 beautiful, talented women.’ Off limits: San Diego Hooters restaurants have banned the city's mayor from all locations . A sick man: Mayor Bob Filner of San Diego speaks at a press conference announcing his intention to seek professional help for sexual harassent issues July 26 . Slate also noted that Hooters appears to have taken the signs straight from Glenn Beck. Filner rose to the national consciousness after a series of city staffers accused him of sexual harassment, spelling out lurid details to local media. One woman even accused the disgraced politician of putting her in a head lock, dragging her around the office ‘like a rag doll’ and asking when they could have sex after telling her on multiple occasions to ‘come to work without panties,’ she accused in a lawsuit. At a press conference announcing the suit, the accuser called for Filner to resign and said that ‘A man who lacks character makes a mockery of his ideas.’ Gloria Allred, the woman’s lawyer, added that the degenerate mayor needs to stop ‘treating women as pieces of meat.’ Looks familiar: Hooters apparently took the sign idea from former Fox News host Glenn Beck . A total of 14 women have accused Filner of sexual harassment, according to the Los Angeles Times. The accusations have caused the city government to distance themselves from the dishonorable Filner, even suing him for any liabilities incurred as a result of his allegedly awful behavior. A rising tide of public sentiment against the randy Democrat has even led to several city councilmen calling for a public recall of Filner and for prominent state politicians, including Senator Barbara Boxer, to publicly ask him to resign, according to reports. Despite a two week absence, Filner is taking yet another leave from his post, according to the Times, which reported the mayor will take ‘personal time’ this week. Charges have not yet been filed against Filner, but investigators are talking to many of the women who have accused him of lewd behavior.","Bob Filner has been accused of sexual harassment by 14 city staffers .

Councils across the UK are spending millions and employing hundreds of ‘low carbon’ officers to fight global warming – which now appears not to pose an imminent threat – at the same time as making sweeping cuts to children’s  services, the arts and the elderly. The councils have increased their spending on salaries of climate change staff by 34 per cent since the 2008 crash, almost three times the rate of inflation, while grants from central government were slashed by 12 per cent. wind farm . Our investigation comes from data sought under the Freedom of Information (FoI) Act. It shows: . Big spenders: As budgets are cut councils are still ploughing money into their green policies . Our FoI requests asked for details of jobs primarily related to climate change, sustainable development and cutting emissions. The roles are variously described as ‘undertaking climate change awareness projects’, ‘collecting climate change data for national records’ and ‘conducting research on climate change issues’. Middlesbrough’s ‘sustainable communities project officer’ offers a salary worth more than £21,000. It grandiosely claims the council has adopted the ‘One Planet model’ for its operations. Some climate change officers are working closely with other parts of the ‘green economy’. In Stoke, a spokesman said that when the energy company E.on fitted 567 homes with solar panels, this ‘did not cost the council anything’. Despite this boast, the cost to the public was significant, as the scheme is subsidised by taxes and levies on consumers’ energy bills. 'Green economy': Some councils have become preoccupied with spending on climate change prevention and cutting carbon footprints . Stoke City Council’s ‘green enterprise’ cabinet member, Andy Platt, said the authority had been ‘hailed as a pioneer in the sustainable energy field’ and added: ‘Our climate change strategy is not just about getting people to cut down on energy use, it is about creating our own renewable energy and is producing great returns on investment.’ But in 2011, a plan in Brighton to spend £2.6 million on solar panels and recoup the cost from subsidies was thrown into doubt when handouts were reduced. Other massive solar panel schemes have been launched in Bradford and Oxford. Some green activities appear oddly personal. In Peterborough, a video called Gillian’s Footprint explains how council chief executive Gillian Beasley is reducing her carbon footprint with measures such as switching off her computer. ...

Since the Kyoto Treaty in 1997, Britain has been impoverishing itself in a lonely quest to cut its CO2 emissions – even though the world’s powerhouse economies, such as China and America, have refused to set any limits. It is clear that the science, supposedly ‘settled’, is deeply uncertain, while growing numbers of experts now say that the effects of greenhouse gases are much less bad than they feared: any warming is going to happen much more slowly than they thought a few years ago. It is time to join the dots.  The way is open to solving  this country’s most serious problems, all at once. The Chancellor, pondering next week’s Budget, knows the US is not only avoiding a triple-dip recession but is also expecting more than three per growth this year. This is thanks mainly to ‘fracking’ for the natural shale gas beneath its soil, which produces 37 per cent of the CO2 emitted by coal when generating cheap, clean electricity. In the US, once-moribund industries are being reborn, with jobs lost to China now returning home, while CO2 emissions are back to 1990 levels. Britain can follow this lead. We too have vast reserves of shale gas, as yet untapped. The time has come to scrap the Energy Bill, together with existing ‘renewable’ energy subsidies. It is now clear that we have decades to come up with the really serious low- carbon energy sources which may one day be needed. By abandoning wind, nuclear and other failed, risky or dubious ‘renewables’, and exploiting the benefits of shale gas, we can simultaneously boost our economy and shrink our national carbon footprint. It would be irresponsible to ignore such an opportunity.","Councils spend on a huge range of green jobs from Carbon Officers to Climate Change Managers while their grants are being cut .
Green staff spending has increased at three times rate of inflation .
Green salaries totalled £8.7 million in 2011 to 2012 at 65 councils, representing 17 million people – about one third of all councils. This sum does NOT include the cost of publicity materials urging people to cut their carbon footprints.
Spending on green salaries rose by  137 per cent in Stoke. In 2010, the council spent £137,000 on solar panels for its civic centre roof. It is now set to close it and build a new centre for more than £50m.
The highest-spending councils face deep cuts to core provisions. In Glasgow, where the green jobs spend of £390,000 is up 43 per cent on 2008 to 2009, the council is to cut £54 million from schools, social services and help for the disabled. In Birmingham, green salaries of £338,000 have risen 62 per cent, but £102 million is to be axed and 1,000 jobs lost.
In Bradford (where green salaries are up from zero to £289,000), the council has issued a 25-page booklet claiming locals face an influx of foreign migrants displaced by sea level rises and drought.
Not all councils are burning money on climate change. In 17 areas, green salaries have been reduced. The biggest cut was in Colchester which will now do without any climate change officers, having spent £23,000 in 2008 to 2009.
The hiring binge was sparked by the 2008 Climate Change Act. It demands a cut in CO2 emissions in the UK by 80 per cent by 2050. It was followed by the Low Carbon Industrial Strategy, putting the onus on councils."

A former TV weatherman has been found guilty of sending hundreds of sexually explicit texts to a teenage boy. Rob Lopicola, 43, was found guilty yesterday on one count of using text messages to solicit sex and another count of computer pornography and child exploitation, and could now face up to 20 years in jail. Lopicola, who worked at WPTV-Ch. 5 in West Palm Beach until his unexplained exit in 2006, was acquitted of another charge of having oral sex with the then-15-year-old in October 2010. Rob Lopicola, seen here in the dock before a day of his trial, has been convicted on one count of sending sexual text messages to a child and another of computer pornography and child exploitation . Fall from grace: the former WPTV weatherman could now face up to 20 years in jail when he is sentenced . During his trial Lopicola dismissed the messages he sent in the months after the alleged meeting as 'fantasy fun', claiming they were part of a harmless 'fetish'. But state prosecutor Michael Kugler heavily criticised his two-hour appearance on the stand, telling jurors Lopicola had used his on-camera skills to 'schmooze' them. Lopicola said he had met the boy through a classified advert on Craigslist, and believed he was over 18 when he started messaging. The presenter, who also spoke about his battle with alcohol addiction, said he thought the boy was pretending to be young for the sake of the fantasy. Lopicola is also facing a separate charge of unlawful sexual activity with a 17-year old . Lopicola was acquitted of performing oral sex on the 15-year-old after arguing that he contacted him through a Craigslist advert and had never met the boy . However Ms Kugler pointed out that, whether Lopicola knew the boy was underage or not, he had still committed a crime. Kristy Militello, defending Lopicola, said that the boy had encouraged him by sending flirtatious text messages back, and criticised the teenager for deleting the messages from his phone. The boy, now 18 and attending a school in Georgia, said he sent the messages out of loneliness and denied suggestions he was trying to set Lopicola up. Lopicola, who remains in custody in Palm Beach County Jail, is also charged with unlawful sexual activity with a 17-year-old in a separate case which will be heard on Monday. A weekend forecaster for nearly eight years, Lopicola covered some of the biggest weather events in the past decade, including hurricanes Frances, Jeanne, and Wilma in 2004 and 2005. 'I have spoken in front of a lot of people when I was a weatherman,' Lopicola told the jury. 'I'd get a little nervous — but this is a terrible feeling.' Sentencing has been adjourned until December 6 when Lopicola faces between 34 months and 20 years in jail.","Rob Lopicola, 43, guilty of sending sexual messages to 15-year-old boy .

Iran may have used a secret cable published by whistleblower website WikiLeaks to target and hang an alleged Israeli spy. The disturbing development emerged after the alleged spy, kickboxer Majid Jamali Fashi, was executed in Tehran on Tuesday for assassinating an Iranian nuclear scientist in 2010. Although WikiLeaks redacted the name of the intelligence source on a leaked US diplomatic cable, it published a description of him as 'a licensed martial arts coach and trainer', writing from Azerbaijan. Scroll down for video... Majid Jamali Fashi, 24, was hanged at Tehran's Evin Prison after being sentenced to death in August last year . Killed: Nuclear scientist Masoud Ali-Mohammadi was assassinated in January 2010 . According to a report yesterday, Fashi, 24, had visited Azerbaijan for a kickboxing tournament just days before the cable was sent. Experts said they believe the US Embassy document could have raised Iranian suspicions. The file detailed a US diplomat’s debriefing of the source, who told how the Iranian regime put pressure on martial arts clubs to train members of the Revolutionary Guards and used them to put down the popular uprising three years ago. The damage caused by the blast that killed Iranian scientist Massoud Ali-Mohammadi in Tehran . A remote-controlled bomb attached to a motorcycle outside the scientist's home in Tehran. Iran blamed it on Mossad . It did not refer to the Israelis or any plot to kill a nuclear scientist. But Fashi was arrested and charged days after the cable was published in December 2010. Tehran said the kickboxer confessed to murdering Massoud Ali-Mohammadi on behalf of Mossad, Israel's secret service, in January 2010 using a remote-control bomb put on the scientist's motorcycle. Last month, Iranian intelligence officials said they had arrested 15 people they called a 'major terror and sabotage network with links to the Zionist regime'.The group had plotted to assassinate an Iranian scientist in February, the authorities said.Iranian officials have also accused Israel of infiltrating neighbouring Azerbaijan to organise attacks against the Islamic Republic.Unsubstantiated reports in the Iranian media earlier this month said Israel has pushed for the transfer of 1,200 members of the exiled Iranian rebel group Mujahideen Khalq Organisation from their base in Iraq to Azerbaijan.Late last year Israel distanced itself from the MKO's efforts to be removed from the U.S. terrorism blacklist, saying it did not consider the group to be 'an asset'.Iran denies Western accusations it is seeking to develop a nuclear weapons capability, but major powers are pushing Tehran to become more transparent and cooperative ahead of talks later this month.Israel says it could attack Iran if it thinks that is the only way to stop it from getting nuclear arms.        British Foreign Secretary William Hague warned yesterday the European Union would impose tougher sanctions on Iran if it failed to take concrete steps to allay international concerns over its nuclear programme. Birmingham University professor Scott Lucas, an authority on Iran, said yesterday that Tehran could have become suspicious about Fashi because of the cable. He added: 'Alternatively it could have been used as a pretext against him; to set him up as a person who could take the fall for the assassination.' Ali Ansari, head of the Institute for Iranian Studies at the University of St Andrews, said: 'I have always considered the release of the WikiLeaks files, without consideration for those consciously or unconsciously named in them, to be grotesquely irresponsible.' WikiLeaks had no comment on the report yesterday. Israel has always denied any role in the scientist’s killing. Isreal is believed to be keeping a close eye on Iran's nuclear capacity.

And it wasn't until the very end of . her first hour that the 57-year-old appeared with the precious tot only . to hand the infant over to its mother... her stylist Monica. The . ruse finally uncovered, Kris said she wouldn't 'kidnap' Kim's baby and . insisted her daughter would be revealing the month-old in due time.

'We get to the hotel, and we're so smooth but when Kim pops up, I see Steve Wozniak and his wife Janet standing in the foyer!' Rubbing down Antonio: Kris continues its six-week trial run Tuesday afternoon on Fox stations in New York, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Phoenix, Charlotte, and Dallas . 'Kim . then heads over like nothing's wrong to chat to Steve and Janet, she's . acting like she's at a cocktail party and I'm panicking.'

'Then . at the hospital, we hit the secret carpark, we head in through the . secret elevator and through the kitchen and then we have a baby.' 'I went back on Father's Day and guess who was in the room? Steve Wozniak.' Getting things cooking: Kris will reportedly feature a celebrity co-host each week including P. Diddy, Maria Menounos, and Nene Leakes . Kris didn't go into detail about baby North and after disappointing her audience with the baby double, told America that she wouldn't be bringing her granddaughter onto the show. ""That would be kidnapping, I wouldn't do it to Kim, just give her some time and peace and she'll be out showing her off herself,' she continued. Today's show was the beginning of six-week test run on America's right-wing station, she was offered support from celebrity friends including Simon Cowell and chat show stalwart Regis Philbin in a series of short films throughout the hour.","Momager reveals Kim isn't in hiding to raise price for first picture: 'She isn't locked in a closet!'

Sore: Mr Hao has been diagnosed with heatstroke after temperatures in China reached an astonishing 41C . Much of China is in the grip of a summer heatwave with temperatures reaching 42C in some parts of the country. It has been so hot that people have been seen grilling shrimp on manhole covers while there have been reports of eggs hatching without incubators and a highway billboard has mysteriously caught fire by itself. The heat wave - the worst in at least 140 years in some parts - has left dozens of people dead and pushed thermometers above 40C (104F) in at least 40 cities and counties, mostly in the south and east of the country. Authorities have declared the heat a . 'level 2' weather emergency for the first time. The category is usually . reserved for typhoons and flooding.

Her friend He Jiali, also 17, complained that her mobile phone had turned into a 'grenade'. 'I'm so worried that the phone will explode while I'm using it,' she said. Extreme heat began hitting Shanghai and several eastern and southern provinces in early July and is expected to grip much of China until mid-August.

Wu Guiyun, 50, who has a part-time job making food deliveries in Shanghai, said she has been trying to linger inside air-conditioned offices for as long as possible whenever she brings in a takeout order. She said: 'It's so hot that I can hardly breathe.' The highest temperature overall was recorded in the eastern city of Fenghua, which recorded its historic high of 42.7C (108.9F) on July 24. On Tuesday, the director of the China Meteorological Administration activated a 'level 2' emergency response to the persistent heat wave.

In one photo displayed prominently in the China Daily newspaper, a boy tended to shrimps and an egg in a pan over a manhole cover in eastern Chinese city of Jinan. In the port city of Ningbo in Zhejiang province, glass has cracked in the heat, vehicles have self-combusted, and a highway billboard caught fire by itself, sending up black smoke in the air, according to China Central Television.

Police said Hunt placed her son face down on a pillow and locked him in a closet to die. The baby only survived because his father, Nathan Hunt, heard muffled cries coming from a bedroom when he returned to the family home after popping out for 15 minutes. Fearing his newborn son had rolled on his front, he rushed up to the bedroom but was unable to find the baby in his crib. His wife followed him into the room and allegedly told him to stop. He heard sounds from a closet in his one-year-old daughter's room and found the infant inside face down on the floor, wrapped in a blue blanket with his arms wrapped next to his body.

Anger: When Timothy Sawyer was handed a penalty notice by a PCSO he screwed it up and then threw it at the officer . An angry motorist who screwed up a £30 parking ticket and threw it at a police community support officer has been fined £850 - for littering. Timothy Sawyer, 64, was slapped with the penalty notice by a PCSO when he parked his Ford Fiesta on a single yellow line in the market town of Horncastle, Lincolnshire, in July last year. A court heard Sawyer screwed the ticket up into a ball and threw it at the officer telling him: 'I will f****** well park here.' He then drove off down the high street, leaving the £30 fine lying in the road. Sawyer refused to pay the charge within seven days and turned down several requests from East Lindsey District Council (ELDC) for the money. He was charged with a littering offence but failed to appear at Skegness Magistrates Court last Thursday. The case proceeded in his absence and found him guilty of littering after hearing evidence from Police Community Support Officer Keith Briggs and a council enforcement officer. Sawyer, who had indicated a not guilty plea in a letter presented to the court, was fined £200, ordered to pay costs of £637.61 as well as a £15 victim surcharge. Prosecutor Beverley Dawes described Sawyer as aggressive and belligerent when he was approached by PCSO Briggs at the time of the offence. She said the officer asked Sawyer whether he owned a disability permit, which would have allowed him to park on the yellow line, but was told: 'I haven't got a f****** badge.' PCSO Briggs also told the court Sawyer had parked in a dangerous place, between a pedestrian crossing and a bus stop. He added: 'I believe he would have driven off before I could write the ticket so I approached the driver's side of his vehicle. Horncastle High Street, where Sawyer was charged with a littering offence but failed to appear at Skegness Magistrates Court . 'The window was open and I said to him ""this is your ticket sir"". He screwed it up into a ball, threw it out of the vehicle and drove off.' Magistrates also heard Sawyer was abusive when council enforcement officers tracked him down and spoke to him on the telephone in August. Kristina West, an ELDC enforcement officer, told the court: 'He made it clear he was not going to pay because of what he called ""issues"". 'He said it was stupid and silly. He was very rude so I told him I was not prepared to discuss the matter on the phone and I terminated the call.' Miss West also said Sawyer had written abusive letters to the council, including the authority's chief executive. Speaking today, Sawyer refused to comment about the incident but said he was launching a counter claim against Lincolnshire Police. He said: 'I tell you what, they are going to have the shock of their lives - I'm not saying much more than that. 'But it has got to be the most expensive parking ticket ever.' One of his neighbours added: 'He can be a grumpy old boy. He is very stubborn indeed.' The smoker was originally fined £75 but it was upped to £560 after he did not pay (file picture) A smoker caught throwing away a cigarette butt in the street will have to cough up £560 after failing to pay a much smaller fine. Gethin Richards, 30, discarded the remains of a cigarette as he approached a street ATM to get out some money in the Welsh town of Pontyclun. He was spotted by a Rhondda Cyon Taf County Borough Council enforcement officer and given a £75 fine in October last year. However, Richards, of Clydach Vale, Tonypandy, failed to pay the fine within a fortnight and the case was referred to Pontypridd Magistrates' Court. He also failed to attend and was found guilty in his absence. As a result he was fined £400 and ordered to pay both £120 costs and a £40 victim surcharge. He was prosecuted under the Environmental Protection Act, Section 87, for discarding a cigarette butt onto the public highway. After the case a council spokesman warned there will be no let up in its on-going crackdown on what it describes as 'eco-crime'. The council has recovered £43,950 since April 2012 from enforcing 586 fixed penalty notices. All cash recovered - for everything from dog fouling to fly tipping and littering - is ploughed back into frontline services. 'Littering of any kind is illegal and is a common problem throughout the area of Rhondda Cynon Taf,' said Nigel Wheeler, council streetcare service director. 'This can have a detrimental impact on the environment and residents overall wellbeing. 'We all have a right to live in a clean, green environment and the council is committed to ensuring that those who jeopardise this with thoughtless acts will face the consequences. 'As well as creating unsightly environmental conditions, the clean up costs leave a financial burden on the local authority and the taxpayer.'","Timothy Sawyer crumpled ticket and threw it from car in Horncastle, Lincs .

A 39-year-old police officer accused of forcing a woman to strip before pleasuring himself and throwing money at her has been indicted more than a year after the case was dismissed by a state court. Former Philadelphia police officer Joseph Harvey has been charged with depriving the 21-year-old woman, high on heroin and about to have sex with a friend, of her civil rights during a drug raid in 2009. Federal prosecutors have also charged serving police officer Sean Cahill, 34, with falsely claiming he was with Harvey and that Harvey was never alone with the victim when the alleged sexual assault occurred. Charged: The FBI arrested ex-officer Joseph Harvey, left, and serving officer Sean Cahill, right, on Wednesday over a 21-year-old woman's claims Harvey forced her to strip before pleasuring himself near her . FBI agents arrested Harvey on Wednesday morning - more than a year after a judge threw out state charges of official oppression and indecent exposure and ripped into the District Attorney's Office for taking too long to bring the case to trial. During the 2011 court case, a woman identified only as 'M.C.' testified she was in the second-floor bedroom of an abandoned home in the Kensington neighborhood, . high on heroin and about to get intimate with a friend on a mattress on the floor, when Harvey . charged into the room during a raid with other officers. She said she got dressed and some of the officers took her friend away, but Harvey remained alone with her. She claimed he told her to strip and spread her legs before he began pleasuring himself near her. He then allegedly threw $6 at her and told her to use the money to buy cigarettes. The victim contacted police the day of the incident, and . again the following day. Police Internal Affairs investigated, and . Harvey was arrested on April 21, 2010. Harvey, a seven-year veteran of the police force, was charged with indecent exposure and fired from the Philadelphia Police Department that year. Colleagues: Joseph Harvey, 39, and Sean Cahill, 34, used to work together in the Philadelphia police force (Philadelphia police headquarters pictured) Investigators linked semen found on the woman's sweatpants to Harvey through DNA testing, according to Philly.com. Despite the strong physical evidence, Philly.com reported a judge declared a mistrial in the earlier  case after an assistant district attorney improperly referenced the pants, which had not been introduced into evidence. He later reversed his decision. Then, state prosecutors missed their seven-month window to bring their case against Harvey. In an opinion dismissing the charges . last year, Common Pleas Court Judge Barbara A. McDermott accused . prosecutors of dragging their feet following 'an extensive investigation . resulting in solid physical evidence.' Action: Philadelphia Police Department Commissioner Charles Ramsey said corrupt officers would be weeded out . 'There is simply no excuse for the Commonwealth's failure to resolve this matter before now,' she wrote. The District Attorney's Office has appealed that decision, most recently to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. In a new development, federal prosecutors also arrested and charged Cahill, a 10-year-veteran of the force. They . accused him of lying to investigators claiming he was with Harvey at the . time of the alleged incident, and that Harvey was never alone with the . alleged victim. Harvey and Cahill have denied the charges through their lawyers. Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said Cahill will be suspended for 30 days pending dismissal from the department. 'I . think it's always a good day whenever we rid our ranks of people who . don't live up to value of this department. We're going to continue to be . aggressive to root out corruption of any kind,' he said, according to myfoxphilly.com. If . convicted, Harvey faces up to one year in prison and a fine of . $100,000.

Coca-Cola has launched an advertisement campaign to defend the use of sweeteners in their diet soda. The advertisement is the next phase of a campaign to push back at critics who blame Coca-Cola’s products for the U.S’s ever-rising obesity rates. The Diet Coke ad, which features two smiling women drinking the soda, comes shortly after Coca-Cola reported a drop in sales. In this year’s second quarter, Coca-Cola Co. reported a four per cent loss in the amount of soda sold in North America, with Diet Coke taking the worst hit. In 2012 sales volume for Coke fell one per cent, while Diet Coke fell 3 per cent. Rivalling cola brand Pepsi fell 3.4 per cent, while Diet Pepsi fell 6.2 per cent. The decline in sales of fizzy drinks has been a long-running trend in the U.S. following reports of negative effects on health and several studies on possible hazards of consuming artificial sweeteners. Coca-Cola’s campaign kicks off in the Atlanta area with print ads in USA Today, Atlanta Journal Constitution and the Chicago Tribune. The advertisement highlights how diet soda can help people manage their weight and stresses the scientific evidence showing the safety of aspartame. It  features a picture of two women under the heading ‘Quality products you can always feel good about,’ with several paragraphs of text underneath. ‘Time and again, these low- and no-calorie sweeteners have shown to be safe, high-quality alternatives to sugar,’ it states. ‘Coke is trying to get out front and proactively defend these diet sweeteners,’ said John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, which tracks the industry. The declines come even though the Food and Drug Administration says aspartame may be safely used in foods as a sweetener, and the ingredient can be found in a wide array of other type of drinks and foods. Sweet smiles: The advertisement put out in Atlanta by Coca-Cola Co. in defence of the use of Aspartame product NutriSweet in their Diet Coke . Diet decline: Fewer people,turn to mainstream soda companies to quench their thirst with Coca Cola Co reporting a one per cent drop in sales of Coke and three per cent for the diet version in 2012 . The American Cancer Society also notes . that most studies using people have found that aspartame is not linked . to an increased risk of cancer, including the largest study on the . topic. Another explanation to the decline in sales of products with artificial sweeteners is the recent trend of organic and natural ingredients. Aspartame, used in Diet Coke under the brand name NutraSweet, is an artificial product 200 times sweeter than sugar. The safety of the product has been a hot topic since its U.S. approval in 1981, but there is no evidence of any detrimental effects on health if consumed in normal doses. It has been found safe for human consumption in more than 90 countries, with an EU wide approval in 1994. The majority of Aspartame consumption comes in the form of diet soft drinks with a standard can of soda containing 180mg of aspartame. This means that a 165lbs adult would need to drink approximately 21 12oz cans of diet soda to exceed the recommended daily rate. ‘Even if (aspartame is) 100 per cent safe to use, it's still problematic from a nutrition standpoint,’ said Andy Bellatti, a registered dietician based in Las Vegas who is critical of the food industry's marketing practices. Bellatti noted that foods and drinks aren't good for people just because they don't have any calories or have been shown to be safe. He added that ingredients such as aspartame only keep people hooked on sweets over more wholesome choices. This summer, Coca-Cola rolled out a version of its namesake soda sweetened with natural sweetener stevia in Argentina, a smaller market where it can better gauge how the drink performs. Caren Pasquale Seckler, vice president of social commitment at Coca-Cola, said the goal is to clear up the confusion around diet sweeteners. She said the company will gauge the response in Atlanta and Chicago before expanding the push. ‘This is a beginning and it's a learning process, but we do have plans to do more,’ she said.","New campaign defend use of aspartame in Diet coke .

Joining in with the speculation on the half-hour programme, which is hosted by Zoe Ball, will be a panel of past Doctors as well as Smith, 30, who will leave the show at the end of this year’s Christmas special after three years playing the role. Doctor Who is a popular science fiction drama about a time-traveller who moves through the universe in his Tardis time machine with his companion, currently played by Jenna-Louise Coleman. It first aired in 1963, with William Hartnell as the Doctor, but has never featured a woman in the lead role.

Ahead of Sunday’s programme Moffat said: ‘The decision is made and the time has come to reveal who’s taking over the TARDIS. For the last of the Time Lords, the clock is striking twelve.’ BBC drama controller Ben Stephenson added: ‘We can’t wait to unveil the next Doctor with everyone live on BBC1 on Sunday night. 'Amongst all the speculation and betting, there has been lots of fun and intrigue at work as we’ve been using the codename Houdini as a decoy. ‘It’s the biggest secret in showbiz, even those working with the new Doctor on other projects at the moment have no idea they are in the presence of the 12th incarnation.’ The magazine is a stalwart at news stands, and has long been the bible for any television addict.Now the history of Radio Times will be covered in an event by the Museum of London.

The friends say they were sent an eight-seater minibus with only two seatbelts after ordering a taxi for 10 people - but were forced to take the transfer in order to catch their flight home to Manchester. After boarding the bus many of the group became concerned about the driver who they claim stopped twice in two hours for coffee and appeared to be playing loud music to prevent himself from nodding off. Mr Cheema said: 'Some of us were saying: ""I think this guy's going to fall asleep"" but you don't believe it's actually going to happen. 'We were asleep at the moment of impact but a couple of us that were awake said at the last second they noticed he seemed to have his eyes closed. Safety concerns: The British tourists claim they ordered a taxi for ten people but were forced to get in the eight-seater minibus with just two seatbelts, pictured after the crash, or they would have missed their flight . Injured: Dom Visser, 19, pictured left, was left with a fractured back in two places after the crash while Aron Cheema, 20, pictured right suffered just cuts and bruises . 'I don't remember much about the crash but we noticed some flames and we all managed to help each other out of the windows and away from the bus pretty quickly.' Miss Tratalos added: 'We just want everyone back home and back together now, then we can start to put it behind us.' Of the six still left in Croatia - four are suffering from broken bones in their backs, one from a broken sternum and ribcage, and one from a broken ankle. One of the injured passengers Colette Alderson, 20, from Vicarage Lane, Bowdon, is in a wheelchair with back injuries. She also needed stitches to a head injury. Collette's mother Catherine, 49, flew out over the weekend to be with her daughter. Her father Martin Alderson, also 49, said: 'We're hoping she'll be back in the next week and the Foreign Office are currently helping us with the arrangements to bring her home. 'She's bearing up very well but I think it's shaken them all up a bit and she just wants to get home now. Thankfully they're all ok because it sounds like it was a serious accident.' The other injured friends include Dominic Visser, 19, who has a fractured back in two places and glass in his eye and will be in a back brace for 12 weeks. Imogen Farell, 20, who has a broken sternum and broken ribs, Rosie Smith, 20, who has a fractured back in two places and Sophie Gallimore, 20, who has a fractured back, broken ankle and cuts to her face.
