"(CNN) -- ISIS has released a new video of British hostage John Cantlie, this time showing him in the Syrian border city of Kobani. In a segment that lasts for more than five minutes, Cantlie argues that -- unlike Western media accounts of recent days -- Kobani is mostly under control of the terror group, which calls itself the Islamic state. He claims that ISIS fighters are mopping up, and that the all-out battle for the city is over. Kurdish forces in Syria have said the fight is far from finished, and that Iraqi Kurdish forces will soon be joining them. Kurdish forces and ISIS militants have been clashing in the key border city for more than a month. On Sunday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 800 people have been killed there since the fighting started. The video posted online Monday is the latest ISIS has released of Cantlie, who's been held hostage for nearly two years. The British photojournalist, who also wrote several articles for major British newspapers, was kidnapped in November 2012 along with American journalist James Foley. In the first video of him released by the group last month, Cantlie made clear that he was forced to share a message from ISIS. The video released Monday portrays Cantlie as a reporter in the field describing Kobani. The hostage, dressed in black, appears close enough to the border to see Turkish flags in the background. ""It seemed almost like a standup that a CNN correspondent would do in a foreign city,"" Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst, said. ""It was designed to show that he's relaxed, that what he's saying is accurate. But clearly he's under duress."" Philip Mudd, a former CIA counterterrorism official, described the video as ""purely a propaganda play."" Even though it purports to show the strength of ISIS, Mudd said the video actually reveals weakness. ""They're watching the same media we watch and seeing that their push for Kobani is not going very well. This is a message to respond to what they view as Western media portraying them as losing in Kobani,"" he said. ""They think they need to respond."" The video also includes images of the heavily damaged city, filmed by what a caption says is an ISIS drone. Based on references Cantlie makes in the video, CNN's Nick Paton Walsh says it appears to have been filmed about a week ago. In the video, Cantlie describes weapons from a U.S. airdrop that he says made their way into the hands of ISIS -- a claim the group also made last week. The airdrops were sent to help Kurdish forces fighting to defend the city. A U.S. official said last week that one of 28 bundles dropped in and around Kobani drifted away from its target zone. The U.S. military said it went back and blasted it. CNN's Jennifer Deaton, Ivan Watson, Holly Yan and Wolf Blitzer contributed to this report.","NEW: Analyst: ""It was designed to show that he's relaxed ... but clearly he's under duress""

"Gary, Indiana (CNN) -- The man accused in a string of killings in Indiana appeared in court for the first time Wednesday but was held in contempt after he refused to answer the judge's questions, forcing the hearing to be rescheduled for next week, CNN's Poppy Harlow reported. Darren Deon Vann has been charged in the death of 19-year-old Afrikka Hardy, and authorities say he has confessed to killing six other women and led police to their bodies. On Wednesday afternoon, Lake County prosecutors also charged Vann in the death of a second woman, Anith Jones. Vann faces three counts related to Jones, including murder, murder in the perpetration of a robbery and robbery resulting in serious bodily injury, according to court documents. Jones, 35, had been missing since October. Vann, 43, was expected to have an initial hearing on Wednesday related to Hardy's case but instead Magistrate Judge Kathleen Sullivan postponed the hearing until October 29 after Vann refused to speak. ""You may want to explain to your client he stays in jail for the rest of his life until this hearing takes place,"" Sullivan told Vann's defense attorney, Matthew Fech. Vann had initially refused to attend the hearing but Fech, a court appointed public defender, convinced him otherwise, said Lake County Sheriff John Buncich. ""His demeanor has been calm, quiet and collected. This morning was the first indication that he tried to be disruptive,"" said Buncich. ""He mentioned the media. He wanted to know why there was so much media at the hearing."" Vann is being held in isolation under 24-hour monitoring, said Buncich. Vann entered the courtroom wearing a striped jumpsuit and handcuffs. He was flanked by two officers. Sullivan granted Fech's request that prosecutors and investigators must request Fech's permission before they interview Vann again. Sullivan also upheld a gag order requested by the defense. The hearing was held at the Lake County jail in Crown Point. Investigators are looking into whether there are any other victims, and they're canvassing abandoned properties in Gary, Indiana. Suspect identified after 7 bodies found . Gary Police Chief Larry McKinley said 35 officers, along with cadaver dogs, spent Tuesday going through about 120 structures, out of an estimated 10,000 vacant properties in the city of 80,000 people. Even without admissions of more killings, authorities are not taking any chances. Asked why Vann chose to cooperate with authorities, Hammond Police Chief John Doughty said he wanted to cut a deal with prosecutors, but didn't provide further details. ""It was just something he wanted to do,"" the chief said. ""That's all I can say."" While taken aback by the horrific story, Gary residents aren't surprised the abandoned properties played into it. There has been a push to tear them down or do something else about them, amid fears that shady characters have used them. One young woman, Tatianna Foster, said she doesn't leave home after 8 p.m. ""because it's so dark out here, they call it 'Scary Gary.'"" Ronnie Williams, who lives half a block from where some bodies were found, said the horrifying ordeal makes him want to leave. ""I've got seven kids, two sets of twins,"" Williams said. ""I can't take that chance."" 'Low-risk' sex offender after aggravated sexual assault . The Indiana-born Vann spent time not only in Gary, about 30 miles southeast of Chicago, but also in Austin, Texas. That's where, in December 2007, he repeatedly struck, choked and raped a 25-year-old Hispanic female, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark. Vann was later convicted of aggravated sexual assault, a first-degree felony. He served five years in prison, from 2008 to July 2013. After registering as a ""low-risk"" sex offender in Texas, Vann told prison officials that he would be moving more than 1,000 miles northeast to Indiana, Clark said. He did register as a sex offender in Lake County. Buncich said his department checked on Vann twice last year. Officers checked in with him there on September 14 to confirm he was at his stated address. That's all that's required, Lake County sheriff's spokeswoman Patti Van Til said. ""If we had gotten an anonymous tip that he had gotten a job or was driving a car that didn't belong to him, that would be different. But we were not required, and there were no anonymous tips."" That 2007 incident wasn't Vann's only brush with the law. Records also show he was arrested on unspecified charges while living in Cherry Point, North Carolina, in 1993. And court records indicate Vann was convicted in Lake County, Indiana, of misdemeanor residential entry in 2004. The affidavit tied to that crime says he put his girlfriend in a headlock while holding a lighter near a gas can -- an apparent threat to burn her -- before police eventually grabbed and arrested him. Vann served 90 days in jail for that crime, a class D felony. Edward Matlock, whose mother married Vann in the 1990s, described him as ""a nutcase who I'd never allow near my kids or in my house."" Matlock said Vann and his mother divorced after 16 years. ""He was just a strange guy,"" said Matlock. Coroner seeks help identifying 2 bodies . Right now, Vann faces charges in two deaths -- that of Hardy, whose body was found in a Motel 6 in Hammond, and Jones, found in an abandoned house. But McKinley, the Gary Police chief, told reporters Tuesday that his department will file charges in ""the next couple of days"" against Vann in the deaths of 28-year-old Teaira Batey and 36-year-old Kristine Williams. ""Murder is our ultimate charge,"" McKinley said. Batey's boyfriend, Marvin Clinton, said her death leaves a big hole. The couple have a 2-year-old son. ""That's going to be the hardest part about it,"" he told WLS. ""Because he loved his mama, and she loved him. It's devastating."" The other three bodies are known only as Jane Doe 3, Jane Doe 5 and Jane Doe 6. The Lake County Coroner asked for the public's help Wednesday in identifying two of the women. Jane Doe 3 was wearing a pair of jeans -- the brand is twentyone black by rue 21, size 3/4 -- and white Nike shoes size 6. She had shoulder length blond and rust-colored hair. ""We may have a possible lead. We will be conducting DNA analysis with her possible family through the Indiana State Police. As well as all the victims that we have identified, to be able to make a positive identification,"" said Lake County Coroner Merrilee D. Frey . Jane Doe 5 was 5 foot 3 inches, African-American, wearing a bracelet that included the words ""Best Aunt,"" as well as a silver, heart-shaped ring. Jane Doe 6 was African-American. Frey said it is possible there are other cold cases tied to Vann. CNN's Poppy Harlow reported from Gary, Indiana, and Greg Botelho reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Eliott C.

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho has rejected reports that he is planning to quit the Spanish champions at the end of this season. The 49-year-old has struggled to regain the heights of last season, with Real 11 points behind Barcelona after only 14 games in La Liga. Los Blancos go into Tuesday's Champions League clash with Ajax already qualified for the last 16 of a competition that Mourinho has won twice before -- but that his club has not triumphed in since its record ninth success in 2002. The former Porto, Chelsea and Inter Milan boss dismissed suggestions he wants to join another top European club at his Monday prematch press conference. ""My future is that tomorrow I'll have my 101st Champions League match, and UEFA will confirm that,"" he said. ""Neither I nor I think the president will say a word about it. I have nothing to say about what we talked about. My relationship with him is very good and I will not be giving any substance to this situation. You have no story."" Mourinho has been linked with a move to big-spending French club Paris Saint-Germain, where one of his Chelsea successors -- Carlo Ancelotti -- is coach. ""About PSG I will say that one of my assistants will go to watch the match tomorrow because they are a potential opponent,"" he said. ""They're playing against Porto and both of them could be drawn against us. That's the only thing that I am bothered about in Paris."" Mourinho was recently praised by his former English Premier League rival Alex Ferguson, who said the Portuguese has the credentials to one day succeed him as Manchester United's manager. ""That is what friends are like, they always speak nicely about each other,"" Mourinho said. ""Some people think that there is room for betrayal in friendship and others have a deep respect. His succession is a long way off and it will be 10 years away because he is stronger every year. What would he want to retire for?"" Mourinho has been booed by his club's own fans this season, and he said that was the reason he went out onto the pitch before Saturday's Madrid derby win at home to second-placed Atletico. ""I was watching Casillas and the other goalkeepers warming up. I went out early because I was expecting lots of whistles and some sort of animosity towards me,"" he said. ""I preferred that it happened before the match and was addressed personally towards me so that during the match they would support the team and have positive feelings and help their players and their team."" Eight teams playing in the Champions League on Tuesday have already qualified for the knockout stage, but first and second places have yet to be decided in two of the four groups in action. Porto and PSG are fighting for top spot in Group A, while Schalke has a one-point lead over Arsenal in Group B. Malaga will go through top of Group C ahead of AC Milan, while Real will finish second behind Borussia Dortmund in Group D. Three places in the last 16 will be decided in Wednesday's matches, in which Barcelona's Lionel Messi has the chance to match Gerd Muller's record of 85 goals in a calendar year. In Monday's La Liga action, Real Valladolid climbed to seventh place with a 2-1 win at 10-man Sevilla. Patrick Ebert and Oscar Gonzalez scored in the first 12 minutes for Valladolid, but Manucho put through his own net soon after halftime before teammate Gary Medel was sent off for a second booking on 63. In England, Newcastle moved up to 14th place in the Premier League with a 3-0 win over struggling Wigan, who had defender Maynor Figueroa sent off after only 12 minutes. Figueroa was red-carded alter fouling Papiss Cisse, and the Senegal international's strike partner Demba Ba scored from the resulting penalty. Ba then took his league tally to 10 this season, matching the leading totals of Michu, Robin van Persie and Luis Suarez, before Gael Bigirimana sealed the result in the second half to end a run of four defeats.","Jose Mourinho says he has a good relationship with Real Madrid's president .

"(CNN) -- ""Where your treasure is, there is your heart also."" So goes one biblical quote that could be applied to the United States' intervention in Syria. In a letter to the U.N. secretary-general presented by U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power, the United States justified airstrikes in Syria as an effort to protect Iraqi citizens from attacks by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and other extremist groups. He did not, however, mention Syrian citizens. It is this omission that goes to the heart of the United States' misplaced priorities. The numbers underscore the administration's focus on degrading and (one day) defeating ISIS, rather than on providing urgently needed humanitarian assistance to the victims of the organization's barbarism. Take, for example, the State Department's recent announcement that it will provide an additional almost $500 million in humanitarian aid to help those affected by the war in Syria. According to the State Department, this brings the total amount of U.S. humanitarian aid to $2.9 billion since March 2011 â€” or about $700 million per year, $60 million a month or $14 million per week. But while this is a substantial amount, it will very quickly be surpassed by the costs of U.S. military operations. Indeed, only last month, Congress approved roughly $500 million to train moderate Syrian rebels, the same amount set aside for additional humanitarian assistance. And this doesn't even take account of airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, which, according to a Pentagon spokesperson, have cost around $52 million a week. Expanding the air war to Syria will substantially increase those expenditures, to as much as $100 million per week, according to some analysts. This would mean the cost of airstrikes would exceed our investment in humanitarian assistance in just five weeks. This is not meant as an argument against military action. But it does suggest that we are forgetting the reason we are undertaking it. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates there are more than 3 million Syrian refugees and projects that number will rise to 4.1 million by the end of 2014. The U.S. State Department suggests the situation is even more dire. More than half of Syria's population has been driven from their homes and nearly 6.5 million have been displaced within Syria. Nearly 11 million are in need of aid within Syria. If our justification for military intervention is to protect innocent Iraqis (and presumably also Syrians), then U.S. humanitarian assistance should be at least equal to the costs of our military response. The UNHCR's regional response plan for 2014 catalogs the range of basic human needs of these millions of displaced persons: protection, including protection from sexual violence, shelter, food, health care, water, sanitation and hygiene. Over the long term, the displaced will have to recover their livelihoods. Children will need to resume their basic education to prevent a ""lost generation"" of Syrian children. If the United States is going eventually to ""put boots on the ground,"" providing these basic needs in both the near and long term should be the primary mission of the courageous Americans who deploy to the region. The suffering ISIS -- and the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- are inflicting on Iraqi and Syrian citizens might persist for years. If we do not get our priorities right now -- and properly make the case for rebalancing military and humanitarian expenditure in Syria -- then there is every reason to believe the much-needed cash for humanitarian assistance will dry up once the United States declares victory over ISIS and turns its attention elsewhere. That would compound an already horrific human tragedy. The United States has been militarily engaged in Iraq almost continually since the first Gulf War in 1991, a span that might surprise many Americans. If there is a lesson to be learned from this experience, therefore, it should be that blunt U.S. military power cannot stabilize the region, never mind secure peace. Humanitarian assistance on a much larger scale, in contrast, could help ease the suffering of millions who are caught in the vortex of this sectarian conflict. That is where our hearts should be -- and our treasure also.","U.S. airstrikes against ISIS costing around $52 million a week, Mark Ensalaco notes .

"(CNN) -- Somalia's capital Mogadishu now has its first-ever ATM bank machine -- and it dispenses U.S. dollars. The machine was installed in late September in the upscale Jazeera Palace Hotel, which is located 300 meters from Aden Adde International Airport in the south-west of the city . Justus Mulinge Kisaulu, the hotel's general manager, said that he had seen people using the new machine but it had not been widely adopted. ""Most of the customers were not aware there is an ATM in Somalia,"" Kisaulu explained. ""Local residents, most of them don't have a debit credit or a credit card to use the ATM."" The U.S. dollar is ""widely accepted"" in Mogadishu and is used in local trading, according to the African Development Bank. The country's official currency, the Somali shilling, has seen a sustained decline in value following decades of conflict in the war-torn nation. Said Moallim Abukar, marketing manager of Salaam Somali Bank, which operates the ATM, said that other currencies would be available from the machine ""in the near future."" But Michael Walls, senior lecturer at the Development Planning Unit at University College London, says that it's unlikely the bank is aiming for local Somali people at this stage. ""Diaspora Somalis will use it for sure,"" he explains, referring to people of Somali origin who will probably have a bank account overseas. ""It is likely to be a bit longer before locally based Somalis start using it."" This is the first ATM in Somalia proper, but cash withdrawal machines already exist in the city of Hargeisa in the breakaway state of Somaliland, according to Salaam Somali Bank's Abukar. Somaliland remains internationally unrecognized despite unilaterally declaring independence in 1991. According to local media outlet Somalilandsun, ATM facilities were available in the city from March. More to come? According to the Africa Research Institute, a British think-tank focused on sub-Saharan Africa, more than $1.2 billion is remitted to Somalia each year. This is more than half of Somalia's gross national income, and also more than the total amount of international aid sent to the region. While the recently-installed ATM could be seen as a sign of progress and stability, Walls says it is also an important development for remittance companies, who are also trying to adapt to mobile money transfers and cashless transactions. Indeed, he described the new ATM as presenting ""some kind of challenge"" to remittance companies. However, Dahabshiil, a remittance company with 286 locations in Somalia, said they are ""in the process of rolling out an ATM project"" in Hargeisa and Mogadishu, but that these facilitates wouldn't ""replace the need for our traditional remittance services."" While a great many obstacles still exist for Somalia, it is projects like this ATM that illustrate how business confidence is slowly returning to the war-ravaged city.

"(CNN) -- Division Street runs across Chicago, separating the city more than just geographically. Teddy Williams knows this well. He grew up in the 1980s in Chicago's infamous Cabrini Green housing project on Division, a street he said stays true to its name. Though the neighborhood was notorious for its gang-infested streets and violence, Williams, now 40, remembers the neighborhood differently. He remembers playing with his childhood friends, running up and down hallways of his apartment building, and listening to Slick Rick on big boom boxes. ""It was a village,"" said Williams. ""We all knew each other, we were all there for each other. There were people who do bad things, but that's everywhere."" Sam Spitz knew a very different side of Division Street. He went to school in the 1990s and 2000s, just a few blocks away, where he attended Near North Montessori School on West Division. He described his childhood as relatively safe and comfortable. He still plays basketball on Mondays with his old classmates and passes Cabrini Green to get there. ""I used to pass by there everyday,"" said Spitz, 23. ""But all I knew about the neighborhood was what I'd seen on TV. It didn't seem like a place I wanted to go."" In 2011, a crane reduced to rubble the building Williams once called home, a high-rise that was part of the Cabrini Green housing project. He watched as the crane's steel teeth ripped into the 15-story building, floor by floor, eventually reaching his own 12th floor unit, crumbling it in a cloud of dust. Just a few months before, Williams and thousands of others had been evicted from the Cabrini Green housing project. ""It was sudden, all of it was sudden,"" he said. ""We got a notice for a few months and out of nowhere, we all had to get out."" He said the empty feeling still remains. ""It's like a part of your body is missing, like a leg or something."" ""I will always know Cabrini as home."" 'A refugee in my own city' Chicago has demolished dozens of public housing high rises -- including those in Cabrini Green -- as part of its ""Plan for Transformation,"" a $1.5 billion project launched in 2000 to renovate or construct 25,000 public housing family units. Chicago once had the second largest stock of public housing in the nation, with 43,000 units housing hundreds of thousands of people. When the units became overrun with gangs and crime, the city embarked on an overhaul. The plan aims ""to build and strengthen communities by integrating public housing and its leaseholders into the larger social, economic and physical fabric of Chicago,"" according to the Chicago Housing Authority. Chicago wanted stop managing public housing and become what the housing authority called ""a facilitator of housing opportunities."" Some residents of housing slated for demolition were given vouchers to rent apartments in the private market or moved into rehabbed public housing on the far south and west sides away from the city center. Teddy Williams had a difficult time finding stable housing after his eviction in 2011. ""I felt something like a refugee in my own city,"" he said. He turned to alcohol to cope with his pain and looked to friends and family to find a place to stay. He finally stopped smoking and drinking ""cold turkey,"" but his living situation became more difficult. For a time, Williams made his home on one of Chicago's ""L"" trains, which run the longest north-south route across the city. He carried clothes and a brick from his old building as he patiently searched for a new chapter in his life. Even today, he has trouble finding words to describe that experience, only saying it was ""rough at times."" 'A different world' As he struggled to find a place to live, Williams found a job as a barber on the city's north side. He had only been in the barber shop for a couple of weeks in the fall of 2012 when college student Sam Spitz walked in, looking for a back-to-school haircut. ""He came in as a walk-in. From there we connected,"" Williams recalled. ""He was reading a book and I was interested in knowing what it was and he told me that it was for a class. From there I started to get nosy in his business and he told me he was in school for film, so I decided to tell him a bit of my story and it went from there."" Spitz remembers the meeting. ""When I told Teddy I was in a film class he said, 'Man, you gotta make a movie about me!'"" Spitz said, laughing. ""At first I thought, 'Damn, I just want a haircut. Now this guy's got me trapped in his chair for 45 minutes and I have to listen to a pitch!'"" As Spitz and Williams talked over that haircut, they realized they had Division Street in common. ""I told him my dad and I used to drive by his building on the way home from school,"" Spitz said. ""He asked if I ever got out of the car and I had to tell him the truth: 'No, I was scared.'"" Williams offered to take Spitz for a walk down his side of Division Street, a journey they documented in their film, ""The Greens."" In the documentary, which took about a year to make, Williams introduces Spitz to Lonza C. Harris Jr., a former Gangster Disciples member known as ""Batman"" whose story complicates the narratives that Spitz saw as a child on TV. ""I'll never forget our first walk down Division,"" Spitz said. He remembers Teddy telling him about the time he chipped his tooth running a race through his buildings with other children. ""Teddy and Batman's stories made me question what I'd seen on TV,"" Spitz said. ""I'd never thought of the high rises as homes."" Spitz hopes that his film, which was completed last fall, will encourage audiences to think critically about the stories they see on TV, especially those concerning Chicago. He and Williams are using the 20-minute film to start conversations on college campuses, an opportunity Williams said he could have never imagined. ""We hope others will take the time to learn from each other no matter how different we seem,"" Williams said. Williams now lives in a suburb on the city's west side in his own apartment. Despite the lack of a police presence and the frequent sound of gunshots, Williams said he sees it as a symbol of his own progress. Yet, he still longs for his home in Cabrini Green. ""It was a village. We were a community,"" he said. Today, Cabrini Green is infused with chic dining spots, expensive town homes and a growing shopping district. Just blocks away from the city's Magnificent Mile, some are calling it Chicago's ""neighborhood of the future."" Williams said he would love to help instill that sense of community back into his old neighborhood. ""I want to recreate a place that I knew once, and provide that for someone else,"" he said. ""I can help because I know what it needs.""","Teddy Williams and Sam Spitz spent their lives a few blocks from each other in Chicago .

"(CNN) -- When Vanessa Hudgens' naked photos hit the Internet, the ""High School Musical"" star quickly apologized. But sending nude or seminude pictures, a phenomenon known as sexting, is a fast-growing trend among teens. Phillip Alpert is a registered sex offender as a result of sending a nude photograph of his 16-year-old girlfriend. The National Campaign to Prevent Teen & Unplanned Pregnancy, a private nonprofit group whose mission is to protect children, and CosmoGirl.com, surveyed nearly 1,300 teens about sex and technology. The result: 1 in 5 teens say they've sexted even though the majority know it could be a crime. Phillip Alpert found out the hard way. He had just turned 18 when he sent a naked photo of his 16-year-old girlfriend, a photo she had taken and sent him, to dozens of her friends and family after an argument. The high school sweethearts had been dating for almost 2½ years. ""It was a stupid thing I did because I was upset and tired and it was the middle of the night and I was an immature kid,"" says Alpert. Orlando, Florida, police didn't see it that way. Alpert was arrested and charged with sending child pornography, a felony to which he pleaded no contest but was later convicted. He was sentenced to five years probation and required by Florida law to register as a sex offender. ""You will find me on the registered sex offender list next to people who have raped children, molested kids, things like that, because I sent child pornography,"" says Alpert in disbelief, explaining, ""You think child pornography, you think 6-year-old, 3-year-old little kids who can't think for themselves, who are taken advantage of. That really wasn't the case."" Alpert's attorney Larry Walters agrees and he's fighting to get Alpert removed from Florida's sex offender registry. The law lags behind the technology, he says. ""Sexting is treated as child pornography in almost every state and it catches teens completely offguard because this is a fairly natural and normal thing for them to do. It is surprising to us as parents, but for teens it's part of their culture."" In many states, like Florida, if a person is convicted of a crime against children, it automatically triggers registration to the sex offender registry. Thirty-eight states include juvenile sex offenders in their sex offender registries. Alaska, Florida and Maine will register juveniles only if they are tried as adults. Indiana registers juveniles age 14 and older. South Dakota registers juveniles age 15 and older. Most states allow public access to sex offender registries via the Internet and anyone with a computer can locate registered sex offenders in their neighborhoods.  Watch a report on the 'sexting' trend and how police are now getting involved » . A number of states have elected not to provide Internet access to registries; Florida is not one of them. There is no hiding for Alpert, whose neighbors, he says, all know. ""I am a sex offender. If you type my name into the search engine online, you will find me."" As sexting incidents pop up around the country, prosecutors are trying to come to terms with how these cases should be handled. George Skumanick Jr., a district attorney from Wyoming County, Pennsylvania, took a novel approach when 20 students from Tunkhannock High School were caught allegedly sexting.   He gave them a choice: probation and re-education classes or be charged with sexual abuse of a minor. ""An adult would go to prison for this,"" says Skumanick, adding, ""If you take the photo, you've committed a crime. If you send the photo, you've committed a different crime, but essentially the same crime."" Critics, however, say child pornography laws on the possession or dissemination of graphic images were never meant to apply to teen sexting and that these teenagers usually have no criminal intent when they send pictures to each other. amFIX: Should teens be prosecuted for ""sexting""? Fifteen-year-old Marissa Miller of northeastern Pennsylvania was 12 when she and a friend snapped themselves wearing training bras. ""I wasn't trying to be sexual,"" she says, ""I was having fun with my friends at a sleepover, taking pictures, dancing to music."" The picture recently surfaced on a student's cell phone and Marissa's mom, MaryJo Miller, was contacted by Skumanick. ""He told me that he had a full nude photo of my daughter,"" says MaryJo Miller, who calls the picture innocent. Rather than force her daughter to take the classes, which would have required she write a report explaining why what she did was wrong, Miller and two other families ­-- with the help of the ACLU -- are suing the district attorney to stop him from filing charges. ""We believe she was the victim and that she did nothing wrong,"" says  Miller. ""How can I ask her to compromise her values and write this essay, when she didn't do anything?"" Although the district attorney maintains the program is voluntary, the letter he sent to parents notes, ""Charges will be filed against those who do not participate."" Seventeen of the 20 students caught in the sexting incidents have completed the 14 hours of classes. Skumanick won't comment on the Miller case, but says, ""You can't call committing a crime fun or a prank. If you do that, you can rob a bank because you think it's fun."" In the majority of sexting cases, it's usually girls sending pictures to boys, who then send them to their friends. Though teens may think it's funny and a way to flirt or even seek revenge after a breakup, there can be dangerous consequences. Last year, Jessica Logan, a Cincinnati, Ohio, teen, hanged herself after her nude photo, meant for her boyfriend, was sent to teenagers at several high schools. For months after, her father says, she was the subject of ridicule and taunts. ""Everyone knew about that photo,"" Bert Logan says. ""She could not live it down."" On July 3, his wife found her. ""She had been getting dressed to go out. The curling iron was still warm. It was so unexpected,"" Logan says. ""I heard my wife scream, I ran up to Jessie's room, but it was too late."" No charges had been filed against Jessica's 19-year-old boyfriend, who disseminated the photo, nor had the school taken any action, Logan says. He says he and his wife want to warn parents and students of the dangers of sexting. The Logans are fighting to raise awareness nationally and to advocate for laws that address sexting and cyber-bullying. As for Alpert, life is not easy as a registered sex offender, a label he will carry until the age of 43. He's been kicked out of college, he cannot travel out of the county without making prior arrangements with his probation officer, he has lost many friends and is having trouble finding a job because of his status as a convicted felon. He says he feels terrible about sending the photo of his ex-girlfriend, especially since they were once so close. At the same time, Alpert says, ""I'm being punished for the rest of my life for something that took two minutes or less to do."" Says attorney Walters, ""Some judges have the good sense and reasonableness to treat this as a social problem and others are more zealous in their efforts to put everybody away and I think it's time as a society that we step back a little bit and avoid this temptation to lock up our children.""","Phillip Alpert, now a registered sex offender, sent pictures of his 16-year-old girlfriend .

"(CNN) -- ""I got the sailors to lash me to the mast to observe it. I was lashed for four hours and I did not expect to escape, but I felt bound to record it if I did."" Joseph Mallord William Turner had a truly obsessional attention to art, so following in his footsteps is no easy task. British artist Andy Parker admits he will draw the line at being tied to a mast for hours on end, but nonetheless he plans to retrace the movements at sea of arguably the greatest maritime artist of all time. Parker may be relieved to know that the quote attributed to Turner by John Ruskin after his 1842 painting ""Snow Storm -- Steam-Boat off a Harbor's Mouth making Signals in Shallow Water, and going for the Lead"" -- is now thought to have been apocryphal. After all, Ruskin described Turner as ""at once the painter and poet of the day,"" using poetic license in the 24,000 works of art he created, of which more than 60% were water-themed. ""His style of painting, I believe, was not necessarily what's in front of you but what you want to see,"" explains Parker. ""These fabulous sunsets of his were not necessarily what he saw, he could just come up with a good idea. ""That's what makes him such a great artist, while I'm just a painter. So I'm not trying to emulate his style but the position where he was."" Following in Turner's footsteps has been done before -- UK-born American artist Edward Moran's infatuation was such that he traveled from the United States to study his work and retrace some of the spots where he painted. Parker, however, is the first to do so for more than 150 years. The link between Parker and Turner is more than just an admiration of his work -- both were born in London's Covent Garden and were shopkeepers' sons. ""Turner's father was a barber and I'm sure the Parkers and Turners probably knew each other,"" says Parker, whose family ran a saddlery business. Parker's ""big undertaking"" is to visit 12 to 15 locations from Deal in Kent to Poole in Dorset, along Britain's southern coast. The amount of materials and canvases he would have to carry means he may not be able to do the whole trip at once. And while Turner set off to sea to sketch, Parker will travel the 1,000 or so miles to the various ports and harbors. But like Turner, he too plans to take to the waters and is looking for yachting enthusiasts across the country to help him in his quest. ""Chartering boats is so expensive so I've contacted some yachting magazines to see if I can get any helpers,"" he says. ""I don't want to go out for eight hours on some fishing jolly -- no-one wants an artist spoiling the view. I'm just looking for a couple of hours where I can work quickly -- Turner's journeys were usually brief -- and throw down some ideas."" Parker, 56, spent the majority of his life working in the music industry before coming to painting as a profession. While Parker is ""not really a sailor,"" Turner had sea legs. ""Turner was a great traveler,"" says Christine Riding, head of art at London's Royal Museums Greenwich. ""He liked to travel alone or with intimate friends, who paint the picture of a mariner. ""They paint a nice picture of him not being bothered by the stormy weather while everyone was being sick he carried on sketching. ""He was a workaholic that certainly enjoyed the dynamics of the sea, and he had a very good grasp of maritime terminology. The sea was constantly imbibed in his DNA as an artist."" The Greenwich National Maritime Museum recently hosted an exhibition called ""Turner and the Sea,"" the first to solely focus on his apparent obsession. ""Whether the story of him being tied to the mast or not is true, it doesn't really matter, it's just a very romantic idea,"" explains Riding. ""If you take that painting, the title itself is very important. The boat's name is Aerial and there is no evidence of a ship by that name then. ""Turner was known to be a very poetic artist so you think of Ariel in the Tempest, or else Ariel the ship on which Percy Bysshe Shelley died."" At the time, the British Empire ruled the waves with the world's biggest navy. ""That was basically part of the national identity,"" Riding explains. ""He's an artist responding to his history. Landscape artists by their very nature tend to have a maritime period but it was such a key time. ""He was born in 1775 when Captain Cook had just come back from his second voyage of discovery and the nation was a global sea power. It was almost part of his DNA from the outset."" Riding says Parker's expedition has echoes of Moran's journey, which came shortly after Turner's death in 1851 at the age of 76. ""He traveled the south coast to emulate his artistic idol, and you can see a heavy Turner influence in his work,"" Riding says. Moran's subsequent work, paintings such as ""The Shipwreck,"" were very Turner-esque in their use of bold colors and glowing, turbulent skies, as boats were tossed in different directions amid stormy seas. More than a century and a half after Moran's voyage, Parker is following suit. See: The best sailing images of 2013 .","JMW Turner was notorious for his maritime paintings in 19th Century Britain .

"Madrid (CNN) -- Teresa Romero Ramos sought out help three times. Finally, one week after first seeing a doctor, Romero found out why she felt so sick: She had Ebola. Even after her Ebola test came back positive at Madrid's Alcorcon hospital, Romero had to wait. According to a worker at that hospital, Romero lay in the emergency room -- exposed to other patients as well as medical staff, going back and forth -- for eight hours before being transferred to a hospital in the Spanish capital that specializes in infectious diseases. While Romero was ""doing better"" Wednesday, according to a regional health spokesman said Wednesday, parts of Spain's medical establishment is looking worse and worse the more that comes out about what she's gone through from how she contracted Ebola to how her case has been handled. Her plight can also be compared to that of Thomas Eric Duncan, the Liberian citizen who was sent home from a Dallas, Texas, hospital days before eventually being admitted for Ebola. Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States, died on Wednesday. Speaking about what's unfolding in Madrid, Health Minister Ana Mato told Parliament that Spain is going to revise its protocols for handling Ebola. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy also said that his country is ""facing a matter that is of international concern."" But that doesn't mean Spaniards should hunker down or become overly alarmed, urging them to ""keep calm."" ""I would like to ask you to allow the health workers to work,"" he said. ""The Spanish health system is one of the best in the world."" 1st person to contract Ebola outside Africa . The Ebola virus has been voracious, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing at least 3,800, according to the World Health Organization. It's also been largely confined, with every person catching the disease in West Africa. Deadliest Ebola outbreak: What you need to know . Until Romero. She is the first person to contract the deadly virus outside Africa. Dr. German Ramirez, who is among those treating her, said the nurse's assistant at Madrid's Carlos III hospital may have been exposed while removing protective gear she'd donned to treat a Spanish missionary infected with Ebola in West Africa. ""That's what we were working on -- on the errors possibly made while removing the protective suit,"" Ramirez told reporters, saying it's possible the protective suit or gloves may have touched her face. Angry doctors and nurses outside Carlos III Hospital said Tuesday they were outraged that two missionaries -- Miguel Pajares and Manuel Garcia Viejo, were almost dead when they arrived -- had been brought to the hospital. Both priests ended up dying at the Madrid hospital. How did Spanish nurse catch Ebola? That Romero may have gotten Ebola while doing her job is a major cause of concern, especially if she did -- as she told Spanish newspaper El Mundo -- follow the necessary protocols while caring for the missionary. So, too, is how her treatment was handled afterward.","A nurse's assistant got infected while caring for an Ebola patient in Madrid .

"Washington (CNN) -- Days before the one-year anniversary of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, top surrogates for President Barack Obama and presumptive Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney took to the national stage to argue the politics of the attack. Senior Obama campaign adviser Robert Gibbs defended the campaign's use of the event in a recent Web video and in a speech from Vice President Joe Biden. Meanwhile, senior Romney adviser Ed Gillespie characterized the political steps surrounding the death as a ""bridge too far."" Team Obama released a video on Friday, partially narrated by former President Bill Clinton, that praised the president's decision to order the killing of the al Qaeda chief one year from Tuesday and questioned whether Romney would have made the same choice. Biden similarly questioned the former Massachusetts governor in a campaign-style speech on Thursday. Gibbs, the former White House press secretary, said the video was ""not over the line"" and criticized comments Romney made on the issue during his first White House bid as ""foolish."" The video quotes Romney in 2007 during his first White House bid, saying, ""It's not worth moving heaven and earth, spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person."" Days later, he said, ""We'll move everything to get him (bin Laden)."" ""There's a difference in the roles they would play as commander in chief, and I certainly think that's fair game,"" Gibbs said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" During his second White House bid, Romney has repeatedly praised the president for launching the raid on bin Laden. Gillespie, a former aide to former President George W. Bush and former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said utilizing the raid for political purposes is one of the reasons Obama has ""become one of the most divisive presidents in American history."" ""He took something that was a unifying event for all Americans, and he's managed to turn it into a divisive, partisan political attack,"" Gillespie said in a separate interview on the same NBC program. ""I think most Americans will see it as a sign of a desperate campaign."" The day Osama bin Laden died . The campaign video received criticism from Republicans, including from 2008 Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain. On Friday, he called the minute-long spot ""a cheap political attack ad."" White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan avoided the politics of the issue but did praise the president's decision-making skills surrounding bin Laden's death by U.S. Navy SEALs during a raid in Pakistan. ""I don't do politics,"" Brennan said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""I just know that President Obama, when the time came for him to make a momentous decision like that, he took the action that did bring bin Laden to justice."" Biden teed off what will likely remain a talking point from Team Obama through the election in a Thursday address that previewed a potential 2012 slogan. ""If you are looking for a bumper sticker to sum up how President Obama has handled what we inherited, it's pretty simple: Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive,"" Biden said during a speech at New York University, lines Gibbs echoed on Sunday. The president will pick up the message with what the campaign has billed as the president's re-election kick-off on Saturday. Obama is expected to attend campaign rallies in Columbus, Ohio, and Richmond, Virginia, two likely battleground states in the November election. Biden will attend campaign events in Missouri and Indiana on Monday and in Washington on Thursday. Obama rallied young voters on college campuses in North Carolina, Iowa and Colorado last week, calling for Congress to stop an increase in the interest rate for student loans in July. Jim Messina, Obama campaign manager, said that Saturday will mark the end of the Republican ""monologue."" ""Now Romney has to put his record and his agenda up against the president's, and we look forward to that debate,"" Messina said Wednesday on a conference call with reporters. Romney is expected to meet with former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum on Friday, a long-awaited rendezvous given that the former Pennsylvania senator has yet to endorse his party's presumptive nominee. Santorum danced around the issue last week with CNN's Piers Morgan during his first televised interview since he suspended his candidacy on April 10. He acknowledged Romney would be the ""person that's going against Barack Obama,"" but said he was still ""working through it"" and discussing it with this wife, Karen. Newt Gingrich is scheduled to announce the suspension of his campaign on Wednesday, at which point he will back Romney, sources told CNN. Gingrich expected to end his run Wednesday . Romney will spend much of the coming week fundraising, with events in Pennsylvania and Virginia. He will also campaign Monday with Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, the latest potential vice presidential candidate to appear with the GOP frontrunner. The freshman senator was an early backer of Romney and appeared with him repeatedly on the stump ahead of her state's primary. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida got the VP scrutiny treatment last week when he appeared with Romney in Pennsylvania. Many political observers see Rubio as the favorite for Romney's vice presidential pick, given his ties to the swing state of Florida, the Hispanic community (he is the son of Cuban immigrants) and members of the grassroots tea party movement. Rubio was one of three potential candidates mentioned by House Speaker John Boehner in an interview that aired Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Boehner said there is a ""long list"" of qualified candidates for the GOP ticket, including Rubio, Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana, all of whom fit his criteria that the pick be capable of serving as president. ""There are a lot of people that I like. But this is a personal choice for Gov. Romney, and I'm confident that he'll have a running mate that will be helpful to the ticket,"" Boehner told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley. ""I think the number one quality is: Are they capable of being president in the case of an emergency?"" Democratic Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles and Haley Barbour, former Mississippi governor and RNC chairman, on Sunday downplayed the importance of the No. 2 pick. Villaraigosa, a Mexican-American, said he wouldn't expect a Rubio pick to make a large difference with Hispanic voters. ""I don't expect that it's going to win you an election or win you an entire demographic. This is going to be fought on the issues,"" Villaraigosa said on CBS' ""Face the Nation."" ""Can a vice presidential candidate just change the whole deck? No I don't think so,"" Barbour said on the CBS program. ""The idea that you're going to reshuffle the deck would be very unusual in American history.""","GOP says Obama campaign has turned Osama bin Laden's death into a political issue .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian soccer icon Zico has hailed the South American country's World Cup-winning team of 1958 as the best in the sport's history, ahead of the reigning world and European champions Spain. After a thumping 4-0 victory over Italy in the final of Euro 2012 last weekend, Spain became the first team to win three consecutive major tournaments -- following on from triumphs at the 2010 World Cup and the European Championship of 2008. The recent success enjoyed by Vicente del Bosque's team has led some to label them as the finest ever, leading to comparisons with other legendary teams -- such as the Brazil squad which became world champions in 1970. But former ""selecao"" star Zico, currently coach of the Iraq national team, selected the Brazil team which lifted the Jules Rimet trophy in Sweden 54 years ago as the finest in football history. The greatest football team: Spain 2012 vs. Brazil 1970? ""For me the best national team of all time is the Brazilian team from 1958,"" Zico, who was part of the much-heralded Brazil team which reached the second group stage of the 1982 World Cup, exclusively told CNN. Is victorious Spain the best team ever? ""Quite simply because it had, in my opinion, the best players in the world. Pele and Garrincha. They scored a bag full of goals and put in a show in almost every game."" Pele rose to prominence as a 17-year-old at the 1958 tournament, scoring six goals including a brace in Brazil's 5-2 defeat of hosts Sweden in the final. The striker is widely regarded as one of the greatest footballers the sport has ever seen and, after being hampered by injury during his country's 1962 World Cup win, he was a key figure in Brazil's 1970 success. Garrincha was a tricky winger who not only won the World Cup in 1958, but starred as Brazil retained the trophy in Chile four years later. His four goals made him joint top goalscorer alongside teammate Vava. The flamboyant Garrincha, who spent the vast majority of his career with Rio de Janeiro-based Botafogo, died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1983 aged 49. Strutting midfielder Zico is fondly remembered by many football fans for his stylish contribution to the Brazil team which lit up the 1982 competition in Spain, alongside playmaker Socrates.","Football star Zico tells CNN Brazil's 1958 team is the best of all time .

"(CNN) -- Just like any other night in the NBA, the starting lineups of the Boston Celtics and visiting Golden State Warriors were introduced over the public address system. But Wednesday wasn't just any night at Boston's TD Garden. And the loudest ovations were not for members of either team. Louis ""Louie"" Corbett, 12, who is rapidly losing his eyesight due to retinitis pigmentosa, was in the house to fulfill his final seeing wish: watch his beloved Boston Celtics play a game. ""Welcome Louis!"" flashed on all four sides of the Jumbotron to thunderous applause. ""I'm quite excited to be here for the game,"" Louie told CNN affiliate WCVB. While the reason for his long journey from Auckland, New Zealand, was distressing, the circumstances that brought two communities on opposite sides of the planet together were extraordinary. Louie's progressive disorder will eventually deteriorate his vision. Faced with the grim reality that he will soon lose the ability to see the world around him, his parents wanted to give their youngest of five children an international sightseeing tour. ""This year we're going to try and fill his world with as many beautiful images as we can,"" his mother, Catherine Corbett, told CNN. Louie was instructed to make something of an ocular bucket list -- things and places he'd like to see for the first, only and likely last time. He picked places such as the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, the Empire State Building and, in a sign of the times, Google headquarters in California. But the thing he wanted to experience the most wasn't a landmark or a national park. An avid sports fan, Louie wanted to take in a game. And not just any game -- the Boston Celtics. ""For some reason, he really got hooked on American basketball,"" his mom said. ""He cares about nothing else. He is really quite passionate about it."" Making the list was the easy part. Getting there, however, would be trickier. With Louie's eyesight rapidly fading -- by 50% in the past year alone -- the trip was going to have to be soon. Like, matter-of-weeks soon. Warren Casey, the CEO of a Boston-based software firm, stepped in with a hefty donation and the promise to raise even more. The fact that Casey's company is based in Boston -- the very place Louie was headed -- had nothing to do with why he got involved. ""That was a random coincidence,"" he told CNN. ""I did it because the Corbetts are my next-door neighbors."" Casey makes the 24-hour-plus trek from his Auckland home to his office in downtown Boston every six weeks. He got Air New Zealand to pick up Louie's airfare tab and donated his own points as well. Casey and his partners at Ceiba Solutions agreed to pay for the trip no matter how much was raised while friends and strangers from opposite sides of the planet donated about $25,000 in just four weeks. ""It is so touching,"" Catherine Corbett said. ""People are just so supportive."" The fundraising campaign soon picked up steam on social media, reaching strangers far and wide. ""Somebody Tweeted me an article about this boy in New Zealand and told me I should read it,"" said Corinne Grousbeck, who lives outside of Boston. Grousbeck is the incoming chair of the trustees at the Perkins School for the Blind, one of the oldest schools for the visually impaired in the country. Her son, 21-year-old Campbell, was blinded by a condition similar to Louie's. ""I completely understood where the Corbetts were coming from in wanting to build a visual memory bank for (Louie),"" Grousbeck said. ""It's an incredibly difficult thing to have to go through."" But that wasn't the only coincidence; Grousbeck's husband just so happens to own the Boston Celtics. ""Of course when I read about how he was a big Celtics fan, I knew that we had to have him come for a game,"" she said. The coincidences didn't end there. When Grousbeck learned that the Corbetts would be coming to Boston for their game on March 5, she realized she would be unable to give Louie her seats because she had given them away. ""March 5th had coincidentally been scheduled as Perkins School for the Blind Night at the TD Garden (home of the Celtics),"" she said. ""We'd already given away our seats to the school's students, families and donors."" While Grousbeck made sure Louie and his family had great seats -- practically on the Celtics bench -- she says the real show was the Perkins chorus singing the national anthem. ""I think for a 12-year-old like Louie, for him to be able to watch visually-impaired kids perform the national anthem on a national stage, for him to see what blind people can achieve, that's going to give him the lasting memory,"" she said. And his Boston trip was filled with other coincidences as well. He spent the day Tuesday at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, whose cutting-edge ocular research may one day turn Louie's ""farewell to vision"" tour into simply one heck of a trip. Those odds might be long, but smart money wouldn't bet against Louie. He seems to have serendipity on his side.","Louis Corbett, 12, may soon lose his vision due to rare disease .

"(CNN) -- Most beer guts are the result of consuming fermented brew, but a new case study describes a rare syndrome that had one man's gut fermenting brew, not consuming it. It's called gut fermentation syndrome or auto-brewery syndrome, and it's ""a relatively unknown phenomenon in Western medicine"" according to a study published in July's International Journal of Clinical Medicine. ""Only a few cases have been reported in the last three decades"" according to Dr. Barbara Cordell, the dean of nursing at Panola College in Carthage, Texas, and Dr. Justin McCarthy, a Lubbock gastroenterologist, the study's authors. The most current case comes courtesy of an unnamed 61-year-old Texas man who for five years seemed to be drunk -- all of the time. His wife, a nurse, began to give him breathalyzer tests. Even when he hadn't been drinking at all, his blood alcohol content was as high 0.40 -- five times the legal driving limit -- according to the study. But the medical community was largely unaware of Gut Fermentation Syndrome then, so the patient wasn't always believed. In 2009 he was admitted into an emergency room on a day he hadn't had a sip of alcohol and blew a 0.37. ""The physicians were not aware of any way that a person could be intoxicated without ingesting alcohol and therefore believed he must be a ""closet drinker,"" the paper says. Finally, after a 24-hour observation period at a gastroenterology practice in 2010 -- one in which he saw no visitors and underwent a battery of tests -- doctors figured out what was ailing him: His stomach was turning food into booze. ""The underlying mechanism is thought to be an overgrowth of yeast in the gut whereby the yeast ferments carbohydrates into ethanol."" After a regimen of antifungal medication, his yeast was in check, and he was registering zeroes on the breathalyzer. The authors conclude their paper by imploring their colleagues in the field to take gut fermentation syndrome seriously. ""This is a rare syndrome but should be recognized because of the social implications such as loss of job, relationship difficulties, stigma, and even possible arrest and incarceration,"" the authors write.","Texas man was inexplicably drunk without ingesting alcohol, case study says .

"(CNN) -- When it was first invented, soda pop was a treat most people had once in a while for special occasions. Now it's a daily fixture in American life -- in bright containers glowing inside vending machines, chugged from 32-ounce bucket-like containers at self-service stations and served as the default beverage in fast-food meals. In today's carbonation nation, half of the U.S. population over age 2 consumes sugary drinks daily, according to a report released by National Center for Health Statistics. The sugary drinks include sodas, sweetened waters, and energy, sports and fruit beverages. Not included in the total were diet drinks, 100% fruit juices, sweetened teas and flavored milk. The report states that sugary drinks have been linked to ""poor diet quality, weight gain, obesity, and in adults, type 2 diabetes."" Male teens are the most frequent consumers and guzzle about 252 to 273 calories every day from various drinks, the report says. Their one-day consumption is more than half the weekly intake suggested by the American Heart Association, which recommends no more than three 12-ounce cans of soda in one week (equivalent to 450 calories). The consumption of such sugary drinks has increased over the last 30 years, the report stated. A 2003 study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that soda drinking for youths between the ages of 6 and 17 was at 37% in the 1970s and then 56% in the 1990s. This latest research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that from 2005 to 2008, consumption increased again. ""If you look at male children, 70% consume on a given day,"" said lead author Cynthia Ogden, a CDC epidemiologist who specializes in obesity. The analysis was based on 17,000 participants who were asked to recall what they ate in the last 24 hours in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The American Beverage Association denied that its products fueled obesity: ""Contrary to what may be implied ... sugar-sweetened beverages are not driving health issues like obesity and diabetes."" It pointed to market data indicating that the calories in beverages decreased by 21% from 1998 to 2008, while obesity rates climbed. It also stated that sugar-sweetened beverages account for 7% of calories in the average American diet. ""That means Americans get 93 percent of their calories from other foods and beverages,"" the group stated. The latest CDC research released Wednesday also found similar results: Kids and teens get about 6.7% to 8.2% of their daily caloric intake from the beverages, and adults get about 5% to 8%. But the extra calories from drinks could add several pounds every year, said Marisa Moore, a nutritionist. ""A lot of times, people don't think of beverages as part of their daily total calories,"" she said. ""When I think about soda drinking -- in general, it provides empty calories. It takes the place of more nutritious options."" She suggested alternatives like water, sparkling water, tea and skim milk. The CDC's report found major differences in soda consumption depending on race, sex and income level. In every age category, males consumed more sugary drinks than females. This could be because males consume more calories than females, Ogden said. In terms of race, black children got about 8.5% of their total daily calories from sugary drinks, compared with 8.2% for Mexican-American and 7.7% for white children. Black adults received 8.6% of their daily calories from sugary drinks, and the figure was 8.2% for Mexican-Americans and 5.3% for whites. There was also a direct association between income level and sugary beverage consumption. Adults living in a family of four earning approximately $29,000 per year got 8.8% of their daily calories from sugary drinks, compared with 4.4% for those who earned about $77,000. Last year, New York attempted to end subsidizing the purchase of sodas in the food stamps program, saying the benefits were used to fuel a serious public health problem. But this month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture rejected the city's proposal, citing agency concerns that ""the scale and scope"" of banning soda would be ""too large and complex."" The Big Apple has actively campaigned for soda reduction with a stomach-churning ad that likened drinking soda to chugging dollops of fat. The recent CDC report also found that while half of the population doesn't drink sugary beverages, about 25% consumes amounts of the drinks that total fewer than 200 calories per day. About 5% drink about 567 calories on any given day, which amounts to more than four 12-ounce cans of cola. Sugary drinks became ingrained in American daily life because of effective ad campaigns, fast-food restaurants and increased serving sizes, said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. But the tides are turning, he said. The group announced a campaign Wednesday called Life's Sweeter to nationally organize civic associations, minority groups and religious communities to reduce soda consumption. ""There's pretty much a consensus among health officials that soft drinks are a major cause of obesity,"" Jacobson said. Boston's government buildings have banned soda, several public school systems have kicked them out of their campuses, and the Cleveland Clinic has stopped selling the beverages in its hospitals. ""There's a real movement in that direction, and the soda industry recognizes this and is diversifying away from traditional carbonated drinks to bottled water and noncarbonated things like energy drinks and sports drinks,"" Jacobson said. ""The soft drink industry is very nervous and will diversify to maintain their profits."" While energy drinks and sports drinks may have fewer calories and less sugar, they enjoy health halos that are not warranted, he said. Pediatricians: No energy drinks for kids; greatly limit use of sports drinks . Dr. Sandeep Gupta, director of the Pediatric Overweight Education and Research Program at Indiana University Health, said it's easy to be misled by drink labels. ""Many times, they don't know,"" he said about his pediatric patients who guzzle sugar-sweetened beverages with labels touting vitamins and antioxidants. ""The marketing is so skewed. 'Get your 100% vitamin C, juice.' They don't tell you how much sugar is there. Look at the back, not the front of the package.""","Half of U.S. population over age 2 consumes sugary drinks daily, CDC says .

"(CNN) -- U.N. officials on Tuesday put the number of rapes and other sexual attacks in eastern Congo since late July at more than 500, more than double the previous estimate. In remarks prepared for delivery to the Security Council after returning from a fact-finding trip to the region, U.N. Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Atul Khare cited 267 rapes or other sexual attacks in the town of Uvira -- on the eastern edge of the country -- and other nearby regions of North and South Kivu, in addition to the 242 rapes that had already been reported in and near the village of Luvungi. Among the additional cases was a report of 10 women raped by members of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo on August 17 and 18 in the community of Katalukulu, in Fizi territory, South Kivu, he said. On August 17, at least 40 rapes were committed in the village of Mubi by an alleged coalition of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and Mayi-Mayi, a militia group active in the region, he said. Another 13 rapes occurred in Pinga area in Chuho market, he said. On August 26, Khare received reports of 74 cases of sexual violence -- including 21 directed at girls 7 to 15 years of age -- and six men in the village of Miki in the territory of Mwenga, he said. The incidents occurred in July and August, he said. Five days later, he said, 130 cases of rape were recorded in several villages in the territory of Shabunda. There were reports that in one village, ""all women might have been systematically raped,"" he said. Khare had gone to Congo to find out why peacekeepers said they hadn't learned about the rapes near Luvungi sooner. The United Nations reported last week that some 242 people were raped by armed Congolese and Rwandan rebels in villages in North Kivu province between July 30 and August 3. Attackers blocked roads and prevented villagers from reaching outside communications. Many homes were also looted and burned. Many of the victims were gang-raped by as many as six men at a time, according to the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The rapes were first publicly reported on August 22. The United Nations initially said it did not learn about the attacks until August 12, when it was alerted by International Medical Corps. That group said it first told the United Nations about the rapes on August 6. But on Tuesday, the United Nations acknowledged that it first learned of a report of rape on July 30, nearly two weeks earlier than it had previously said. ""We can confirm that the Daily Field Security Report from North Kivu on 30 July included the following: 'Today 30 July 2010 during morning hours, the locality of Mpofi (52 Km E of Walikale) passed under control of FDLR [Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda] combatants. One woman was reportedly raped and locals fled towards Walikale and Kibua. More information to be ascertained.' ""We can also confirm that, on the basis of this information, an e-mail was sent by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs transmitting information of the FDLR movement,"" it said. The July 30 internal U.N. email was relayed to relief agencies working in the area and warned that the rebels had taken over the villages, and had already committed one instance of rape. U.N. officials have said they will toughen efforts to stop rapes in the region. ""The women of eastern DRC deserve better,"" said Margot Wallstrom, a U.N. special representative for sexual violence in conflict who sent a senior member of her staff with Khare on his fact-finding mission to the region. ""For them, there is no safe place. They are raped when harvesting crops; when going to market; when fetching water and firewood; when carrying their babies; when in their homes at night, among their loved ones."" She added that the rape is becoming a weapon of choice in eastern DRC. ""The sad reality is that incidents of rape have become so commonplace that they do not trigger our most urgent interventions,"" she said. Noting that the information about the rapes ""was slow to surface,"" she called for the United Nations to focus on how to improve its response to such reports. ""We should examine the U.N.'s response, including that of our peacekeepers on the ground, not in a spirit of self-recrimination but with a determination and resolve to do better to protect civilians in what is undoubtedly one of the most complex, vast and volatile conflict zones in the world."" She noted that some rebel leaders have been identified as having been present during the attacks and called for them to be used ""as a starting point"" to bring the attackers to justice. ""Our policies of 'zero tolerance' cannot be backed by a reality of 'zero consequences,'"" she said.","The figure is more than double the previous number .

"(CNN) -- The new ""leaks"" from the grand jury on the Michael Brown shooting have once again stoked the imagination of the American public and the world. The implication of these leaks is that Officer Darren Wilson won't be indicted, so everyone wants to know how Ferguson will react. Will there be riots? More violence? Nationwide protests? There's almost a morbid NASCAR crash type curiosity about what comes next in a small Midwest town wracked by naked racism and police incompetence. But most of this curiosity is stoked by fear and ignorance about what Ferguson, Missouri, is actually like. If you know the real Ferguson, you already know why the riots happened, and you can predict what will happen once the grand jury makes its decision. A little background: I went to elementary school about 40 minutes south of Ferguson, in the St. Louis military suburb of O'Fallon. I'm pretty familiar with the area, a frothy mix of the South, the Midwest and the Rust Belt. While the black population in the St. Louis metro area has grown and moved out of the city, teachers, firefighters, hospital employees and most importantly cops in the suburbs are largely white. My school district didn't hire its first African American teacher until 1986, and my elementary school has never had a black teacher despite having a sizable number of African American students. This is the St. Louis area in a nutshell, black suburban expansion, slow white acceptance and a dull Midwestern peace as the first integrated generations live together. Unfortunately the image you get of Ferguson is perfectly encapsulated by this opening I saw from a national television reporter commenting on the fact that the median income is ""only"" about $37,000 and apartments rent for as little as $450 a month. National news reporters mostly from New York descended upon this town and when audiences in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Washington, Los Angeles or any of the other major cities in America hear $37K a year, it sounds like poverty wages and rents that resemble public housing fees. But that's where context comes in: $37,000 year is pretty good for the Midwest. Ask anybody in the suburbs of Cleveland, Indianapolis or Omaha, Nebraska, or any other part of ""flyover county."" You can get a two bedroom apartment across the street from Starbucks for $450 a month just north of St. Louis. While that won't get you a monthly parking space in Los Angeles, it doesn't mean the people of Ferguson are in the ghettos of America's declining Rust Belt. Far from it, most national reporting would lead you to believe Ferguson, and especially the Third Ward where Michael Brown was killed, is like the set of ""The Wire"" when it's really a lot more like ""Black-ish."" I don't think the media misunderstanding is intentional, but there's been an inherent bias in the way the city and the conflict have been covered. Ferguson, O'Fallon, Florissant -- all of the small suburbs outside of St. Louis proper are where black folks moved to in the 1990s and 2000s to get away from violence and poverty in the city. As I walked along the very street where Michael Brown was shot, I looked around wondering where the ""bad"" neighborhood would actually start? Better yet, where did the ""poor"" neighborhood start? I saw townhouses and apartments. I saw wooden decks and lawnmowers. This looked like Everytown U.S.A. -- not a car on blocks or a busted window pane in sight. If you have any doubt, just ask the residents. The infamous ""QuikTrip"" gas and snack station that was burned down is a prime example. If you talk to locals, they'll tell you that QuikTrips are generally located in nicer neighborhoods, just like there are high-end grocery stores and low-end grocery stores. Brown's neighborhood wasn't spotted with off-brand products and second-tier stores to serve a poor and crime-ridden community. The only thing that distinguished this part of Ferguson from any other was that it was mostly black. The narrative that has been presented about Ferguson -- that it's about poor black folks rising up against the evil white oppressor -- may be sexy and make for good TV, but that's not the reality on the ground. As one exasperated resident told me ""We moved up here to get away from this type of [expletive]! I'm not putting up with it here -- from the cops."" It's really the story of regular, taxpaying, law-abiding, lawn-mowing, pumpkin-carving, churchgoing Midwestern folks where the only gunshots you hear are from kids playing Xbox. And they're wondering why the first killing in town all year was a cop firing 11 shots in a residential neighborhood into a kid with no record of serious crimes. While the new leaks reveal Wilson's claims that he was ""defending himself,"" this doesn't add up for residents. The fact that the Ferguson Police didn't release a police report until weeks after the incident, which was full of redactions, and under pressure from the Department of Justice leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouth. This is not a rabble-rousing community. There's no history of mass civil action, as a journalist friend of mine from nearby Florissant told me, ""the civil rights movement skipped St. Louis."" Had the police been forthcoming from day one, everyone would have been back to their regular lives within a week. However, when you ignore people, even regular folks, and treat them like collective criminals in their own community, that's when people get angry. As we hear more and more ""leaks"" being conveniently released ahead of what will most likely be a grand jury decision to not indict Wilson, understand who is hearing them. Then, to quote Matthew McConaughey's character from ""A Time To Kill"": Imagine they were white. I'm pretty sure our national understanding, and sympathy for Ferguson, would be very different.

"(CNN) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday made his second public speech, signaling a departure in leadership style from his late father. Speaking to tens of thousands of children in Pyongyang on the 66th anniversary of the Korean Children's Union, Kim said the country has a good future. ""Korea's future depends on you,"" he said. ""The Korea you are in charge of will be a country full of laughter and happiness, and also the strongest country in the world."" Kim said the country has the latest rocket technology and called on the children to study hard, saying they cannot contribute to the nation if their grades are bad. In April, North Korea carried out a failed rocket launch that it said was to put a satellite into orbit. Other countries, including South Korea and the United States, assumed it was a coverup for testing its ballistic missile technology. About 20,000 children were transported to Pyongyang from around the country for the occasion , state-run KCNA reported. North Korean television showed footage of many children sobbing with emotion as their leader spoke. Kim Jong Un also spoke at the 100th anniversary of the birth of North Korean founder, Kim Il Sung. His father, Kim Jong Il, is believed to have made only one brief broadcast throughout his reign, showing his son is creating his own individual persona. The speech is also considered a way for Kim Jong Un to try to win over a new generation as he continues to shore up support for his hereditary succession. A North Korean expert says the speech shows Kim Jong Un is more similar to his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, than his father, which is what the nation's propaganda machine has emphasized. ""His grandfather, unlike his father, was a reasonably good speaker, not charismatic, but he could talk for hours if necessary and was clearly not shy when it came to talking in public, it was part of the image,"" said Professor Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University.","His speech signals a departure in leadership style from his late father .

"(CNN) -- When actress Emma Thompson went to the Arctic with Greenpeace, Hugh Grant teased her fashion sense via Twitter. The actress, posing in a puffy green jacket for photos, admitted in her reply that she looked ""like a sofa."" But the two were pushing a much more serious message: Save the Arctic. Thompson -- known for her roles in Howards End, The Remains of the Day and Harry Potter -- joined Greenpeace crew in August aboard the activist ship Esperanza. The trip, which took in polar bear habitats and scientific research stations, reignited Thompson's decades-long interest in climate and conservation. Thompson, who traveled to the Arctic with her 15-year-old daughter Gaia Wise, told CNN she had been shocked by what she'd seen. ""Our economic systems at the moment are very short sighted, they don't take any notice really of what's going to happen in future generations,"" she said. Thompson said seeing the evidence of disappearing sea ice was devastating. ""You can see how the glaciers have reduced in size and shrunk because there's 50 to 80 meters of watermark on the valley walls,"" she said. Speaking for the Save Arctic campaign, Thompson challenged governments to stop drilling and industrial fishing in the Arctic. ""If we destroy [the Arctic], we are going to end up with a planet that is no longer liveable on, and we will have nothing, we won't have any economies to sustain."" Arctic sea ice keeps the polar regions cool and helps moderate the global climate. The Arctic sea ice reflects around 80% of sunlight that strikes it back to space, keeping the planet cool. If the ice melts, most of the sunlight gets absorbed in the ocean and temperatures rise. The size of the Arctic sea ice has decreased between 3.5% to 4.1% per decade between 1979 and 2012, according to World Wildlife Fund statistics. But the Arctic also holds the world's largest untapped oil and gas reserves, making drilling and exploration a lucrative prospect. Rosneft and Exxon Mobil last week announced a discovery of a new oil field in the Arctic, while Royal Dutch Shell submitted plans to restart exploration in Alaskan Arctic. Environmental activists like Thompson are campaigning against the drilling, saying any spills or accidents would have disastrous impact on the planet. Thompson said her daughter's response to seeing the destruction was ""like we're being attacked by Martians, only we're the Martians."" The thought encapsulated what was wrong with the world's response to climate change, Thompson noted. ""I thought it was so brilliant because if we were attacked by Martians, things would happen very, very fast. ""We would all get together, governments would get together and we would say 'what are we going to do,'"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Which television series is so good it's worth binge-watching from beginning to end? This question was posed over the weekend on the social networking website Reddit, where community members can solicit feedback from others on topics of their choosing. Judging from the responses, it seems that a variety of factors make a show binge-worthy, making different shows worth binging on for different reasons. Some of the most popular selections -- like ""Deadwood,"" ""Orphan Black"" and ""Stargate: SG1"" -- had ongoing narratives and gripping cliffhangers at the end of each episode that left viewers anxious to find out what's next. Watching densely layered shows like those on a compressed cycle also minimizes the risk of forgetting key details or plot points that comes with waiting a week in between episodes. On the other end of the spectrum, viewers recommended fun and breezy comedies like ""Peep Show"" and ""Silicon Valley,"" which require little investment of time or attention but deliver big on laughs and entertainment. Popular shows that had short runs, like ""Firefly"" or ""Freaks and Geeks,"" also make compelling candidates if you can avoid getting emotionally attached.

"(Health.com) -- Overweight and obese adults who followed the Weight Watchers program lost more than twice as much weight as those who received weight-loss advice from a doctor or nurse, according to a new yearlong study funded by the company. The study, which was published Wednesday in the Lancet, included 772 men and women in Australia, Germany, and the United Kingdom who were recruited during ordinary doctor's appointments. The researchers randomly selected about half of the participants to receive a free 12-month Weight Watchers membership (including access to weekly meetings), and encouraged the other half to attend monthly one-on-one weight-management sessions at their doctor's office. The 61% of Weight Watchers users who stuck with the program for a full year lost 15 pounds, on average, compared with 7 pounds among the 54% of people in the other group who continued to visit their doctors each month. When the researchers included the people who dropped out of either program before the year was up, the average weight loss was lower but followed the same pattern: 11 pounds in the Weight Watchers group and 5 pounds in the other group. Health.com: 25 ways to cut 500 calories a day . Michael Jensen, M.D., an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota, says it's only natural that the weekly weigh-ins and ""group spirit"" of programs such as Weight Watchers would prove more effective than occasional guidance from a doctor or nurse, since research has shown that dieters are more likely to stick with weight-loss programs that stress accountability. ""It's not terribly surprising that a group whose whole career is basically helping people with weight management would do a better job than a primary-care group that has a lot more responsibilities on top of that,"" says Jensen, who was not involved in the study. Similar studies of other commercial weight-loss systems, such as Jenny Craig and prepackaged food programs, have produced comparable results in the past. In a 2010 study funded by Jenny Craig and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, for instance, women who completed one year of the program lost about 20 pounds, three or four times more than women who received occasional advice from a nutritionist. Health.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat . Still, the authors of the new study say they were surprised by how dedicated the Weight Watchers participants were—they attended three meetings a month, on average—and by how much weight they actually lost. ""I don't think we could have predicted that people randomly allocated to Weight Watchers by their doctor—rather than choosing to attend of their own accord, which would give a selected group of probably more motivated people—would lose significantly more weight,"" says lead author Susan Jebb, Ph.D., a diet and population health researcher at the UK Medical Research Council, in Cambridge. People may be more likely to stick with a program like Weight Watchers when they're participating free of charge, however. The cost of Weight Watchers can run as high as $500 per year, a price tag that could sap the motivation of real-world dieters who are paying out of pocket. At the same time, Jensen says, it's possible that some people paying out pocket might be less likely to drop the program because they'd feel obligated to get their money's worth. Health.com: Best superfoods for weight loss . The study participants had a body mass index (BMI) between 27 and 35 and at least one additional risk factor for obesity-related disease, such as excess belly fat or a family history of diabetes. (People with a BMI over 25 and 30 are considered overweight and obese, respectively. A 5-foot, 6-inch woman with a BMI of 27 weighs 167 pounds.) People in the Weight Watchers group were three times more likely than the other participants to lose 10% or more of their initial body weight. And nearly two-thirds of the Weight Watchers users lost 5% or more of their body weight, versus one-third in the other group. ""Those really are medically very significant numbers,"" Jensen says. ""For overweight or obese people, that kind of loss results in pretty substantial improvements in health and disease risk—to the point where, if you're on medication for blood pressure or cholesterol or diabetes and you can [lose] 10% of your weight, you've got at least a reasonable chance of decreasing or discontinuing that medication."" Health.com: The 10 best foods for your heart . Jebb and her colleagues say that partnerships between primary care physicians and commercial weight-loss programs like Weight Watchers could be an effective and inexpensive way to treat certain people who struggle to maintain a healthy weight. A cost-benefit analysis will be needed to determine whether doctors should recommend such programs to their patients more often, and which patients might benefit the most, Jebb says. But, she adds, the programs appear to be promising and may be more cost-effective than one-on-one doctor's appointments, not to mention untreated obesity complications. Although Weight Watchers sponsored the study, Jebb stresses that the company had no control over the design or results.

"(CNN) -- Researchers in Tanzania have chemically reproduced the stench of smelly feet in an innovative new approach to combat the spread of malaria in the country. The scientific team at Tanzania's Ifakara Health Institute has developed a potent serum -- similar to that of human foot odor -- to lure and kill mosquitoes, which can carry malaria and other diseases. Four times more powerful in attracting mosquitoes than natural human odor, the synthetic smell is now being used in a pioneering research program aimed at killing mosquitoes outdoors using a ""mosquito landing box."" ""The goal is to eliminate malaria,"" said scientific researcher, Fredros Okumu, who is developing the technology. ""We are going to do this by tackling the transmission of disease outside the house."" Mosquitoes are lured inside the boxes by the synthetic odor, which is dispersed by a solar-powered fan. Once inside, the insects are either trapped or poisoned and left to die. ""We know mosquitoes don't see people, they smell them."" Okumu said. ""Substances we emit when we sweat, such as lactic acid, act as a signal to mosquitoes ... The aim here was to produce a mixture that would mimic a human being."" The result, said Okumu, was a chemical blend that ""smelt just like dirty socks."" ""If you came to our lab when the research was being done, you would have thought that someone had just come off a soccer field,"" he admitted. Okumu, who is currently completing a PhD from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in England, plans to develop the mosquito landing boxes over the next two years, thanks to a $775,000 joint grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the not-for profit organization Grand Challenges Canada. ""This is a great example of an African innovator, with an African innovation, tackling an African problem,"" said Dr Peter Singer, CEO of Grand Challenges Canada. ""Malaria kills about 800,000 people a year, mostly children, in Africa. At the moment existing technologies, such as bed nets and sprays, tend to repel mosquitoes inside the home. ""This technology attracts mosquitoes outside the home to kill them, and could be complimentary to what is there now,"" Singer continued. Working closely with villagers in remote communities where malaria is endemic, Okumu is aiming to produce a practical and sustainable technology that will be easy to run and operate.  Okumu is keen to explore further cost-saving measures in order cement the mosquito boxes as part of everyday Tanzanian life. Ideas include using the boxes' solar-panel technology to supply energy to people's homes and substituting the costly chemical mosquito lure with actual foot odor collected from specially designed cotton pads placed in people's socks. ""We hope at the end of the two years we will be able to tell the world this is a good strategy to use and start involving industry and more communities and villages,"" said Okumu. The prevalence of malaria in Tanzania has decreased in the last 10 years and Okumu has seen rates in his region dramatically decline from 40% in 1997 to around 7% today. ""We are sure that the reduced rates are due to the improved delivery of bed nets, drugs, insecticides and living standards,"" said Okumu. ""But malaria is not going to disappear using these existing methods."" Okumu says he hopes to see his boxes used across the region before existing methods become less effective. ""Mosquitoes can modify their behavior quite rapidly to deal with the added deterrents of sprays and bed nets,"" he said. ""For example, instead of going into houses to bite people, mosquitoes are now starting to wait to bite people outside,"" he said. For Okumu, this is a personal as well as a scientific venture. Born in western Kenya, malaria has been apart of Okumu's life for as long as he can remember. ""All the places I have lived have been malaria zones. When I was growing up I had malaria at least twice every year,"" he said. He continued: ""Malaria has claimed so many lives and diseases like this are one of the biggest blocks to our social and economic development.""","Scientists have chemically reproduced the pungent smell of foot odor .

Cell phones are great for quick information retrieval, Pew found. But not having fast mobile access to info can cause problems. ""Half of all adult cell owners (51%) had used their phone at least once to get information they needed right away,"" the report said. ""One quarter (27%) said that they experienced a situation in the previous month in which they had trouble doing something because they did not have their phone at hand."" Among cell phone users ages 18-29, 42% reported experiencing trouble doing something because their phone wasn't nearby. It's no surprise that the survey found cell phones prove handy in emergencies. It said that 40% of cell owners ""said they found themselves in an emergency situation in which having their phone with them helped."" And smartphones' growing rep as a tool for killing time? More than 40% of all cell owners entertain themselves with their phone when bored. (For users 18-29, that's 70%.) At the same time, the report found that cell phones can frustrate users. According to Pew, 20% of cell owners ""experienced frustration because their phone was taking too long to download something; 16% had difficulty reading something on their phone because the screen was too small; and 10% had difficulty entering a lot of text on their phone."" Despite the vast amount of media attention given to on-the-go social media, Pew found that more cell phone owners use mobile e-mail (38%) than mobile social media (29%). This echoes earlier findings from Nielsen and from comScore, which found this year that mobile e-mail use has been growing. Pew's survey of nearly 2,800 U.S. adults also highlighted some differences in how people use smartphones vs. simpler feature phones. Some context: Earlier Pew found that 35% of all adult U.S. cell-phone users own smartphones, so less-smart ""feature phones"" remain the largest part of the mobile market by far. How many cell phones are we talking about? According to comScore, as of June there were 234 million U.S. cell-phone subscribers 13 and older, and about 33% of these were smartphone owners. This slight discrepancy with Pew's estimate of smartphone ownership might be attributable to teens, who have less disposable income and thus may be more likely to use inexpensive feature phones. Pew's earlier study also acknowledged the difficulty in distinguishing between smartphones and feature phones in a user survey since this technological line is blurring and since users often incorrectly identify which type of phone they have. According to the latest Pew report, 92% of smartphone owners (but only 59% of feature phone owners) said they send or receive text messages and use their phones to take photos. Sharing images is less popular -- 80% of smartphone users and 36% of feature phone users have used their phones to send photos or videos to others. Also, 84% of smartphone users report using their phone to access the Internet, compared with just 15% of feature phone users. Apps are interesting: Why get a smartphone if you're not going to use apps? However, Pew found that 30% of smartphone owners have not downloaded apps. It's likely that many of these are BlackBerry users, a still-popular smartphone platform with a comparatively sparse app ecosystem. However, I've personally been surprised to encounter several iPhone users who never download apps -- and who rarely use stock iPhone apps aside from Safari and iTunes. Meanwhile, 4% of feature phone users have downloaded apps. That may sound paltry, but that's about 6 million people. (Yes, most feature phones can run simple apps based on the Javascript programming language.) As the line between feature phones and smartphones continues to blur, apps and the mobile web on feature phones may become a more important part of the mobile landscape. Since feature phones tend to cost much less than smartphones, and since in the U.S., it's harder to get smartphones that don't require a pricey two-year carrier contract, it's unlikely that feature phones will vanish entirely anytime soon.","New Pew survey explores cell phone usage and the pros and cons of having a phone .

"Washington (CNN)  -- The nation's capital city took a major step Friday toward legalizing same-sex marriage. District of Columbia Mayor Adrian Fenty signed a measure recognizing such marriages as legal. The district council overwhelming passed the bill Tuesday, following a similar vote December 1. Fenty signed the measure at All Souls Church, a Unitarian Universalist house of worship in the northwest part of the district that is known for its diversity and for the welcoming of same-sex couples. The measure now goes to Congress for a 30-day review period, but it's considered unlikely that the Democratic majority on Capitol Hill would block the bill. By law, Congress has the right to review and overturn laws created by the District of Columbia's council. If the measure becomes law, the district will join Massachusetts, Connecticut, Vermont and Iowa in legalizing same-sex marriages. A law legalizing such marriages in New Hampshire takes effect January 1. Earlier this year, lawmakers in Maine approved a measure legalizing same-sex marriages, but voters in the state last month passed a referendum to overturn the new law. Last week, New York's state Senate defeated a bill that would legalize such marriages. A similar bill stalled last week in New Jersey's state Senate. Friday's signing ceremony prompted approval from gay rights groups. The Human Rights Campaign called it ""an important and historic step towards equal dignity, equal respect and equal rights for same-sex couples."" The measure ""reinforces the legal equality and religious freedoms to which all D.C. residents are entitled,"" the organization's president, Joe Solmonese, said in a written statement. The National Organization for Marriage, which opposes same-sex marriage, promised earlier in the week that ""the fight is not over."" ""Politicians on the city council are acting as if they have the right through legislation to deprive citizens of D.C. of their core civil right to vote, but we will not let them get away with it,"" said Brian Brown, the organization's executive director. ""We will go to Congress, we will go to the courts, we will fight for the people's right to vote,"" he said. Opposition to the legislation also came from the Catholic Church's Archdiocese of Washington, which has said that the measure could restrict the church's ability to provide charity services, apparently because the church might cut back on services rather than comply with the measure's requirements. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","Measure now goes to Congress for a 30-day review period .

"(CNN) -- Arrest warrants were issued Wednesday for nine Muslim Brotherhood officials, including leader Mohammed Badea, according to Egypt's official news agency. General prosecutor Hisham Barakat ordered the leaders' arrests for ""ordering armed groups to cut off highways and threaten violence in the city of Qalyub, spreading violence and damaging public interest,"" the MENA report said. Earlier, Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the head of Egypt's military, called for mass demonstrations Friday to support the country's armed forces. This comes amid Muslim Brotherhood calls for mass protests of its own and lingering tensions nationwide spurred by the July 3 military coup that deposed the democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsy. Al-Sisi, speaking Wednesday at a military graduation ceremony carried live on state TV, exhorted Egyptian citizens ""to go down to the streets to give the army the referendum to take firm action against violence and terrorism."" ""The army and the police will secure the protests all over Egypt,"" said al-Sisi, who is also the interim defense minister. ""We will never retreat when it comes to the proposed road map of the political transition."" The official Facebook page of Tamarod, the anti-Morsy protest movement, called on its supporters to heed the armed forces' call for protests. ""We call on all the Egyptian people to gather in all the squares next Friday to call for the trial of Mohamed Morsy, support the Egyptian armed forces in the coming war against terrorism and cleansing the land of Egypt. The army and the people will fight terrorism,"" the statement said. In a statement posted to Facebook, a pro-Morsy group called for counter-protests Friday even while saying they fear the military leaders will use the demonstrations to incite violence against Egyptians who support the deposed president. ""The coalition is asking the international community and its institutions, including the U.N. and human rights organizations, to reject the plot for bloodshed that will inflame the region and being executed by leader of the coup, Abdul Fatah Al-Sisi,"" the National Alliance to Support Legitimacy said in its statement. The group also asked the International Criminal Court to try Al-Sisi for crimes against humanity. Dozens of people have reportedly been killed and thousands injured since Morsy's ouster, some of them in confrontations with authorities and others in clashes with those on the other side of the political spectrum. Official: 11 police, 1 civilian wounded in Egypt bombing . Fighting on Monday and Tuesday between Morsy supporters and opponents left 14 people dead and dozens injured, state media said, citing the Health Ministry. A bombing in the Nile delta city of Mansoura overnight Tuesday left one person dead and 28 hurt, Health Ministry spokesman Dr. Khaled El-Khatib said. A number of the casualties were police officers. The situation has been calm in Cairo on Wednesday, El-Khatib said, although three people were killed by a car bomb explosion in the Egyptian city of El-Arish on the Sinai Peninsula, according to Egypt's state-run news agency MENA. Al-Sisi had pointed words for the Muslim Brotherhood. It and its political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party, backed Morsy. Long before the election that led to Morsy's victory last year, he said, he advised them not to nominate a candidate. ""I told them they need more knowledge, more efforts and the upcoming phase is very critical, so I advised them not to nominate anyone and they thanked me and left but they didn't listen,"" he said, referring to the period after the toppling of former President Hosni Mubarak. The military was concerned about the activities of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Freedom and Justice Party up to the time Morsy was removed from power. Opinion: Why the Muslim Brotherhood can't back down . ""We advised them over and over, and we warned them not to turn Egypt into a confrontation battlefield between a movement that claims to be fighting and working in the name of God against others who, according to them, are standing against God's religion. And that is wrong, because other movements have the right to have their own political visions of how the country should be governed."" Essam El Arian, a senior Muslim Brotherhood official, said opponents of the coup will protest Friday. ""Calling upon people for support will not help your cause, and if you ever had supporters before, they would have gone down to the streets,"" he said. ""Your threats will not prevent the millions to constantly protest against the coup. And as a leader to a coup that caused the killing of women and children and those who were praying in the mosques, you need to remember that our people had their say against the coup and they are standing with the constitutional legitimacy and democracy,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Pentagon announced Wednesday that U.S. President Barack Obama would delay delivery of four F-16 fighter jets to Egypt in response to Morsy's removal from power. It's not clear what conditions will be imposed before the aircraft would be cleared for shipment. The Pentagon said, however, that it was not suspending overall arms sales to Egypt at this time.

"(Health.com) -- Gradual hearing loss is a common symptom of aging, but in some people it may also be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease or other types of dementia, a new study suggests. The risk of dementia appears to rise as hearing declines. Older people with mild hearing impairment -- those who have difficulty following a conversation in a crowded restaurant, say -- were nearly twice as likely as those with normal hearing to develop dementia, the study found. Severe hearing loss nearly quintupled the risk of dementia. Health.com: 25 signs and symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease . It's unclear why the loss of hearing and mental function might go hand in hand. Brain abnormalities may contribute independently to both conditions, but it's also possible that hearing problems can help bring on dementia, the researchers say. Hearing loss may lead to social isolation (which itself has been linked to dementia), for instance, or it may interfere with the brain's division of labor. ""The brain might have to reallocate resources to help with hearing at the expense of cognition,"" says the lead researcher, Frank R. Lin, M.D., an ear surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. That may explain in part why straining to hear conversations over background noise in a loud restaurant can be mentally exhausting for anyone, hard of hearing or not, he adds. The findings suggest that poor hearing is a ""harbinger of impending dementia,"" says George Gates, M.D., a hearing expert at the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the new study but whose own research has demonstrated a link between the two conditions. ""We listen with our ears but hear with our brains,"" Gates says. ""It is simply not possible to separate audition and cognition."" Health.com: 9 foods that may help save your memory . In the study, which appears in the Archives of Neurology, Lin and his colleagues followed more than 600 dementia-free adults between the ages of 36 and 90 for an average of 12 years. A little less than 30 percent of the study participants had some hearing loss at the start of the study. Overall, 9 percent of the participants went on to develop Alzheimer's disease or another form of dementia. Mild, moderate, and severe hearing loss were associated with a two-fold, three-fold, and five-fold higher risk of later dementia, respectively, in comparison to normal hearing. People with moderate hearing loss generally struggle to communicate even in quiet settings, and those with severe hearing loss are near deaf. Lin says that hearing loss has an enormous impact on the lives of his patients and their family members. ""Yet because it is such a slow and insidious process, it is often left ignored and untreated."" Whether hearing aids or other treatments (such as cochlear implants) can help stave off dementia is the ""50 billion dollar question,"" Lin adds. Thirty million Americans currently have impaired hearing and 1 in 30 are predicted to suffer from dementia by 2050, so if those treatments prove to be helpful, their impact would be felt widely. Health.com: Aging workforce means dementia on the job could rise . There is no cure for dementia, and there are no surefire ways of preventing it. Gates isn't optimistic that restoring hearing can affect the course of dementia. However, if treatments and prevention strategies for dementia do become available in the future, he says, hearing loss could play an important role in early detection. Lin and his colleagues have begun researching the effect of hearing aids on the risk of dementia. ""Whether or not it can help dementia, we don't know yet,"" he says. ""But in the meantime, there's no reason not to take your hearing loss seriously and pursue some type of treatment.""

"(CNN) -- Troops closed in on one of Mexico's most wanted drug lords Wednesday, nabbing him at a seafood restaurant in a popular tourist destination. Members of the Mexican Army didn't fire a single shot when they captured Hector Beltran Leyva in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, officials said. His arrest came after 11 months of investigation as intelligence officials traced his path, Tomas Zeron de Lucio, the director of criminal investigation for Mexico's Attorney General's Office, told reporters. Mexican authorities were offering a reward of more than $2 million for information leading to his capture. And the U.S. State Department's Narcotics Rewards Program had been offering a reward of up to $5 million. Beltran Leyva, who led a cartel by the same name, had been living a discreet, low-profile life in Mexico's Queretaro state, ditching fancy cars and other trappings of luxury to appear as a simple businessman, Zeron said. But in reality, Zeron said, Beltran Leyva was ""one of the main leaders of drug trafficking in Mexico"" and headed ""a large network of corruption and money laundering."" He rose to power after Mexican marines killed his brother in a 2009 raid that the head of the DEA described as a ""crippling blow to one of the most violent cartels in the world."" More on the Mexican drug war . Nicknames for the kingpin included ""The Engineer"" and ""The H."" According to security experts, the cartel had regrouped after the dramatic 2009 operation and developed alliances with the Zetas and the Juarez Cartel. The State Department has said the cartel was responsible for transporting weapons and ammunition to Mexico from the United States, and trafficking in cocaine, marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.

"(CNN) -- Many of us find money in our couch. A few quarters here and a few dimes there. If we're lucky, maybe enough to buy a drink. Imagine finding enough to buy a small coffee stand. Three New York roommates, investigating the cause of their thrift-store couch's lumpiness, discovered $41,000 hidden in envelopes tucked in the old sofa. Lara Russo said she and roommate Reese Werkhoven were sitting on the couch, watching a Harry Potter movie, when he unzipped one of the cushions to see what was making it uncomfortable and found a small package. ""It was just in a bubble-wrap container,"" Werkhoven told ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""We were like, 'Oh, my God. This might be drugs, it might be money; we're getting scared about it."" It was money, a stack of $100 bills an inch and a half high. The two started ""freaking out"" and went into a bedroom to show Cally Guasti. Her first impulse was to lock the doors in case it was drug money and the owner wanted it back. The roommates found more envelopes in the couch, which they had bought at the Salvation Army for $20. One of the envelopes had a name on it. Like many a wise man, Werkhoven turned to his mother for advice. She investigated the name and texted her son a phone number to call. He said he hung up the first time when an older woman answered. He called back, according to CNN affiliate WCBS, and told the woman he had ""found something that I think is yours."" What is it? she asked. A couch. ""Oh my God, I left a lot of money in that couch,"" the woman told Werkhoven. The woman told the roommates that family members had mistakenly donated the couch, where she had been stashing the loot. ""This was her life savings, and she actually said something really beautiful like, 'This is my husband looking down on me, and this was supposed to happen,'"" Guasti told WCBS. Russo said at first they played around with the idea of what to do with the money, but the thought of buying new stuff gave way to doing the right thing. ""I think all of us were under the understanding that even if we spent it, we wouldn't feel good about it,"" she told CNN. ""We would have felt we took something that was not ours. It didn't make sense -- it was her money, she deserved it."" According to WCBS, the woman, who wants to remain anonymous, gave the roommates a reward of $1,000. They didn't rush out and get a new couch. After all, this one might smell, but it is pretty lucky. Watch Erin Burnett weekdays 7pm ET.

"(Health.com) -- New parents, particularly mothers, devote so much time and energy to their children that they often fail to adequately look after their own health, a new study in the journal Pediatrics suggests. The study, which followed about 1,500 high school students into their mid-20s, found that those who became parents got far less exercise than their childless peers. For moms, the news gets worse: Unlike fathers, mothers tended to have a higher body mass index (BMI) and less healthy diets than women of the same age without kids. The mothers in the study averaged about 400 calories more per day than other women. They also consumed more saturated fat, ate fewer green vegetables like broccoli and spinach, and drank nearly twice the amount of soda, sports drinks, and other sugary beverages. The researchers found no such differences among men. Health.com: 25 ways to cut 500 calories a day . Mothers, who are usually the primary caregivers in a household, may have little time to prepare healthy meals for themselves in addition to what they fix for their children, and so they may be apt to fall back on quick-and-easy processed foods such as macaroni and cheese, says Jerica Berge, Ph.D., the lead author of the study and an assistant professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Minnesota, in Minneapolis. ""Moms might be having multiple time demands and have to sacrifice making healthier meals,"" she says. ""They cook high-fat, more palatable foods because they don't have time to do otherwise."" That's not to say they're dining only on junk food, Berge adds. Mothers ate just as much fruit, whole grains, calcium, and fiber as their childless counterparts. ""We found that they are trying [to eat healthy],"" Berge says, ""but they are not able to do it all the time."" Health.com: Easy meals for families . The study participants were an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse group who were 25 years old, on average. (To further limit the influence of economic and cultural factors, the researchers controlled for income and race.) Roughly 10 percent were parents, most with just one child who was a year old or younger. ""It's a wide enough population to represent what is really happening,"" says Fran Biagioli, M.D., a family physician at Oregon Health and Science University, in Portland. When it comes to exercise, raising kids appears to cut into workout time for both parents. Each week, moms and dads lost about 60 and 90 minutes of physical activity, respectively, compared to other young adults. For the mothers, less exercise and less-healthy diets added up to a higher BMI, a ratio of height to weight used to estimate body fat. The average BMI was one point higher among moms than among childless women, whereas fatherhood appeared to have no association with BMI. Health.com: 7 steps to instant calm . Biagioli, who was not involved with the research, says the findings reinforce what she tells the many young parents and parents-to-be whom she sees in her practice. ""I talk to them about cleaning up their act,"" she says. ""It's a conversation that I have early and often."" Getting through to them before the baby arrives is especially important, Biagioli says, because after that they'll need all the stamina that a good diet and lots of exercise can give them. ""When they have a newborn, they are sleep deprived and no message will get through,"" she says. The months after becoming a parent are indeed a ""high-risk time"" for young adults, Berge adds. ""It's a new phase of life, they're learning to be parents, and there's a trade-off between parenting and taking care of themselves that they need to be able to balance.""

"Chicago (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton may be creating a problem for herself. In over a year on the paid speaking circuit, Clinton has addressed recyclers, bankers, doctors, environmentalists, a fair share of Canadians and a number of other diverse groups. Her paid speeches have one thing in common: They are regularly to corporate or trade groups that disagree with Clinton -- or her former colleagues in the Obama administration -- on key issues such as health care, environmental policy or taxes. While it would be impossible for Clinton to only speak to groups that agree with her on everything, speaking to organizations that openly disagree with Democrats on certain issues has proven problematic for Clinton. The appearances open the former secretary of state up to attacks from Republicans and create situations where she appears evasive. That was the case again Wednesday when Clinton gave the keynote luncheon talk at AdvaMed 2014, the annual conference run by the medical device industry. One of the group's top issues is getting rid of Obamacare's medical device tax, a cause Wanda Moebius, the group's spokeswoman, called their ""premier issue."" Clinton, the prohibitive favorite for her Democrats' presidential nomination in 2016, was less than committal about the issue on Wednesday, though. She didn't mention the tax by name during her prepared remarks and offered little indication one way or another what she would do about the issue when Stephen Ubl, the association's president, asked her about it during a question and answer session. ""I don't know what the right answer about the tax is,"" Clinton said, ""but I think we could, taking a look at everything and not standing there with out arms folding staring at each other across the partisan divide, begin to sort it out."" Clinton seemed to play both sides of the issue, acknowledging the United States needs to look at ""the pluses and the minuses"" of the law, but also stating that she thinks medical device companies ""have an argument to make"" against the tax. The medical device tax is a 2.3% excise tax created in part to fund Obamacare; it went into effect at the beginning of 2013. The tax, which is a large component in funding Obamacare, is unpopular with Democrats and Republicans alike, especially those with ties to the medical devices industry. Sizing up a Clinton-Romney race . Clinton heralded a number of Obamacare accomplishments during her speech -- something she regularly does -- but acknowledged that the law is adversely impacting some groups and needs to be altered. ""I am well aware there are still a lot of questions that need to be answered and changes that are going to be proposed and evaluated because clearly there is more work to be done,"" Clinton said. ""And your industry is bearing some of the burden alongside other stake holders."" She later added, though, ""But you are also, in my view, positioned to reap the benefits of those millions of newly insured consumers using... medical devices."" Warren Buffett will bet you that Hillary Clinton wins in 2016 . The response to Clinton's speech was polite, but far from excited. There were no applause lines during the speech and some attendees left the room before she was finished. Republicans quickly jumped on Clinton for her answer on Wednesday. They blasted the video out to reporters shortly after the event and issued a statement earlier in the day that questioned whether Clinton's speaking at the conference puts her at odds with the Obama administration. Hillary Clinton's midterm campaign schedule . This is not the first time, either, Clinton has put herself in this position. Clinton appeared before a group opposed to Obamacare in 2013 and has regularly appeared before Canadian audiences that very much support the Keystone XL pipeline. During a handful of visits to Canada this year, the former secretary of state has refused to definitively answer questions about the 1,179-mile-long project that would move oil from Canada to refineries in the United States. ""Well, you know, I cant really talk about it because I was in the office that has primary responsibility for making the decision,"" Clinton said earlier in the week during an appearance in Ottawa. ""I don't want to inject myself into what is a continuing process."" This answer is similar to what she said during a June even in Toronto, when Clinton planted herself squarely in the middle of the issue, telling an audience that ""these are people making arguments in good faith,"" despite the fact that both sides ""may have some facts and not others.""","Clinton speaks to medical device industry leaders .

""It's ironic, because David (Fincher, the director) said to me from the beginning, 'This is a warts and all movie. It can have no vanity,'"" Affleck said. ""You have to see the naked underbelly of this character."" The highly anticipated film is based on the best-selling novel by Gillian Flynn about a man whose wife goes missing.

""Look for 'Gone Girl' to maintain a slight edge over the competition with a debut of $25 million from roughly 3,013 locations, while 'Annabelle' should bow to $23 million from 3,155 venues,"" writes Brent Lang for Variety. ""The studios behind the two films are being more conservative and predicting premieres in the $20 million range, while analysts are more bullish on 'Gone Girl's' prospects, projecting a debut of $30 million."" Those numbers are sure to be helped by Affleck's proclamation that ""There's some brief, very brief nudity, I think, in there."" And potentially in 3-D. ""It's IMAX penis,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- There's one solution out of 43 quintillion possible combinations, and even the man who invented it spent a month of solid research trying to figure it out. But that hasn't stopped the Rubik's Cube from becoming the most popular toy in history. The colorful puzzle, consisting of small blocks rotating on a central axis, has sold an estimated 350 million units since its conception nearly 40 years ago. And yet the man whose name it bears -- Erno Rubik -- only ever intended it to be a teaching aid for his small class of design students. The son of a poet mother and a father who manufactured glider planes, Rubik grew up in Soviet-era Hungary, studying both sculpture and architecture. Read: Rubik's Cube in numbers . His life-changing idea arrived when he was in his late 20s, a young professor still living at home with his parents. Starting off with just chunks of wood and rubber bands, Rubik set about trying to create a structure that would permit individual blocks to move independently of one another without the whole thing falling apart. It took six years to go from prototype to market, but when it finally hit the shelves at the start of the 1980s, it became the fastest selling puzzle of all time. It stills retains its appeal to this day. Last year alone it sold seven million units and so-called ""speed cubing"" competitions -- where contestants attempt to solve the puzzle against the clock -- are as popular as ever. In a rare interview, the publicity-shy Rubik retraces the journey of his iconic toy. CNN: What do you think it is about the cube that continues to capture the public imagination? Erno Rubik: I believe probably the most characteristic part of the cube is the contradiction between simplicity and complexity. I love the simplicity of the cube because it's a very clear geometrical shape, and I love geometry because it's the study of how the whole universe is structured. I think probably that's part of the key to the success of the cube -- you are able to have a connection with this order and chaos. CNN: You had the idea in 1974 and at the time you were a lecturer in interior design, what set you off on this invention? ER: I was searching to find a good task for my students. When you are studying from a book, lots of people go straight to the end to look for the answers. But that's not my style. For me, the most enjoyable part is the puzzle, the process of solving, not the solution itself. Also, we were playing with geometry, which is not a static subject. It's a very mobile thing, it's changeable. So, I was looking for a mobile structure and I found the geometry of a cube very exciting because of the high level of symmetries it has and the fact that you can do a lot of things with it. CNN: What was the puzzle you were trying to pose? ER: Usually structures are pieces that are connected in some way or another, and usually these connections are stable things. So all the time ""A"" is connected to ""B."" But with the structure of the Rubik's Cube, you realize these elements are moving very freely, but you don't understand what keeps the whole thing together, so that was a very interesting part of it. CNN: How did you go about building the prototype? ER: Nowadays you've got three-dimensional printing and CAD [computer-aided design] programs on computers, but I was working at a very different time. There was a workshop in the school, and I just used wood as a material because it is very simple to use and you don't need any sophisticated machines. So I made it just by using my hands -- cutting the wood, drilling holes, using elastic bands and those kind of very simple things. CNN: How does the internal mechanism actually work? ER: Usually people are surprised by how simple it is, but it is also very difficult to explain. So the best way to discover it is to take it apart! CNN: How long did it take you to solve the cube once you'd created the prototype? ER: It took more than a month of research, facing the problem, trying to understand it, building up theories, testing them, thinking to myself things like: ""I have one side and one turn is 90 degrees and if you turn it four times I'll be back where I was,"" and so on. You have to find rules and then you find the law of symmetry, the law of movements. CNN: Do you remember the moment when you solved it? ER: I remember it was very emotional, but I don't remember what time it was exactly. I don't make notes on that, and I have no diary about it, but I remember it was a very emotional feeling. Read: 'Li-Fi' provides a light bulb moment for wireless web . But then it's not something like a jigsaw puzzle where you start to work on it, spend some time on it, and in the end it's solved, it's finished. If you find a solution with the cube, it doesn't mean you find everything. It's only a starting point. You can work on and find something else, you can improve your solution, you can make it shorter, you can go deeper and deeper and collect knowledge and many other things. CNN: What did you do next? ER: I showed it to the people in the school and my students liked it very much. And I had the feeling that because it has very simple structure, it can be manufactured easily and it can be a product that is available for others. And so I applied for a patent because I had some experience of my father's work and he has got several patents. After that I was searching to find a manufacturer here in Hungary. But the country was a very different place from how it is today. We were behind the Iron Curtain, we had different social circumstances -- so it was not an easy task. Read: DIY inventors flock to Maker Faire . But I found a small company who was working with plastic - their main line was manufacturing chess sets -- and we started to negotiate. CNN: Did you make any mistakes with the patent application, would you do it differently given what you know now? ER: You know, there is a Hungarian saying that it's easy to be clever after the event. One problem was the speed of the process because from the beginning to the real marketing [point] was six years. Six years is too long because there is a rule on how you can patent: When you start the process, you need to make the next step within a year, because otherwise you lose the patent. But in the end we partly solved the problem because we used my name as a trademark, and this too is a good tool for protection. I was lucky because in the New York phone book there is less than five people who have the same name! CNN: What would you advise an inventor now to do to protect themselves? ER: That's a very difficult question. There are many more protection possibilities than in that time. One thing is, you need to find partners, you can't do it alone. You need professionals; you need advisers and you need partners who are capable of helping you both on the legal part and also the financial part as well. And naturally it is very important to realise you product. You can protect your patent but if you don't develop the product it's meaningless. CNN: In a couple of years, it'll be 40 years old, how do you feel about it? Are you still discovering things about it? ER: Yeah, nowadays my discoveries come from watching the impact of the cube. I'm wondering how people are so creative, and how many things were born out of and inspired by the cube. That's a very interesting thing. CNN: The final question: Are you a good Rubik's Cube player? ER: I am really not a speedcuber. My best time when I was practicing was about a minute. Usually people say if you can create a piano, you must be a good piano player, but it is not true. They are different type of human activities and need different capabilities.","Rubik invented cube that bears his name as teaching aid for his class of students .

"(CNN) -- A World War II German U-boat, sunk during the Battle of the Atlantic more than 72 years ago, has been discovered off the coast of North Carolina, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Tuesday. The German sub, the U-576, was found at the bottom of the Atlantic 30 miles off Cape Hatteras and just 240 yards from an American merchant ship, the merchant tanker Bluefields, which was part of a 24-ship U.S. convoy heading from Virginia to Key West, Florida, on July 14, 1942. ""This is not just the discovery of a single shipwreck,"" said Joe Hoyt, chief scientist of NOAA's Office of Marine Sanctuaries expedition, which found the vessels. ""We have discovered an important battle site that is part of the Battle of the Atlantic. These two ships rest only a few hundred yards apart and together help us interpret and share their forgotten stories."" The story of U-576 is the more tragic of the two wrecks. Bluefields did not sustain any casualties during the sinking, but all 45 crew of the U-boat were lost. Commanding U-576 that July day was Kapitanleutnant Hans-Dieter Heinicke. According to documents from the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, where the wrecks rest, Heinicke had radioed back to commanders in occupied France on July 13 to say the U-boat was damaged and heading back to Germany after a month-long patrol without success against Allied shipping. A U-boat and its American prey haunt Gulf of Mexico . As U-576 began that journey home, it ran across convoy KS-520, with 19 merchant vessels and five escorts, on the afternoon of July 14, according to the documents. Heinicke, who was on his fifth U-boat patrol with relatively little success against Allied shipping, saw a chance for redemption. ""In spite of his damaged ship, Heinicke decided to attack at all costs,"" a history from the sanctuary reads. ""However, at 4:00 pm just before he could fire his torpedoes, one of the Coast Guard cutters picked up a sonar contact. The Coast Guard crew dropped three depth charges, followed by five more 10 minutes later."" But Heinicke pressed his attack, firing off four torpedoes about 4:15 p.m. ""The U-576 sank the Nicaraguan-flagged freighter Bluefields and severely damaged two other ships. In response, U.S. Navy Kingfisher aircraft, which provided the convoy's air cover, bombed U-576 while the merchant ship Unicoi attacked it with its deck gun,"" the NOAA release reads. The sub sank in minutes. Two NOAA research vessels, the Okeanos Explorer and SRVX Sand Tiger, participated in the search for the wrecks, which were found and verified in August, NOAA said. The wreck site is considered a war grave and protected by international law. ""Few people realize how close the war actually came to America's shores,"" David Alberg, superintendent of NOAA's Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, said in a statement. ""As we learn more about the underwater battlefield, Bluefields and U-576 will provide additional insight into a relatively little-known chapter in American history.""

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Robbers broke into the basement of a French bank over the weekend and made off with an unknown amount of money from the vault, a spokesman for the bank said Tuesday. The theft happened late Saturday night at a branch of Credit Lyonnais (LCL) in central Paris. The bank was informed Sunday morning about a fire at the bank and only learned of the robbery the next day, when police said the fire followed a burglary, LCL spokesman Olivier Tassain said. The burglars broke into the bank through the basement and entered the vault through a hole in the wall, Tassain said. He could not confirm reports in the French media that the burglars drilled a hole in the wall. French radio network RTL reported the wall has a thickness of 80 centimeters -- more than two and a half feet. It wasn't clear Tuesday how many safes were broken into, in part because some safes were damaged by the fire but not by the burglary, Tassain said. Tassain also couldn't say how many burglars there were. French media reports said the burglars tied up the night guard during the break-in, and then set fire to the vault in an effort to hide their tracks. ""(The guard) is in good health,"" Tassain told CNN. ""We obviously asked for him to receive medical and psychological counseling. The guard is employed by a security firm."" CNN's Alix Bayle contributed to this report.","Burglars enter French bank by basement and steal unknown amount of money .

"Amman, Jordan (CNN) -- They arrived at the church with only what they could carry: clothes, pictures and a few family heirlooms. It's all that is left of a life before the Islamic State terror group swept into northern Iraq, giving the Christians of Qaraqosh and Mosul an ultimatum: Convert, leave or die. Most, like Ammar Zaki and his family, fled first to the relative safety of Iraq's Kurdish capital of Irbil and then made their way to Amman, Jordan, where they found sanctuary in a church. Roughly 100 Iraqi Christians are being sheltered at St. Mary's Church in the Marka neighborhood of Amman. Their sanctuary offers little more than floor mats and a roof, but it's a welcome haven after fleeing ISIS persecution. ""Jesus Christ told people, 'leave everything and follow me,' "" Zaki said, cradling his 9-month-old daughter, Athena. ""So we did."" The stress and strain of the journey show in Zaki's tired eyes. ""We had to leave everything and go ... to be Christian, to stay in my religion,"" he said. Safe haven . Jordan's capital of Amman has become a magnet for many refugees in recent years trying to escape war or persecution. More than 1 million Syrians fleeing a civil war have poured into the tiny desert kingdom, and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis -- many of them Christian -- have sought haven from the sectarian fighting and later ISIS. The country's population has swelled, with the U.N. Refugee Agency estimating more than 645,000 refugees have made their way to Amman, according to 2014 figures. That number does not include the refugee camps that have been set up near its border crossings with Syria and the West Bank, home to a large number of Palestinians. Families flee Mosul . The influx of refugees has put a strain on the country, and nowhere is that more evident than at St. Mary's Church, where about 500 refugees, including some Muslims, have walked through the doors, Father Khalil Jaar said. Many are children who arrived sick ""because of the trauma of the incidents they suffered in Iraq: fear, insecure, no food,"" Jaar said. ""They left their homes in a few hours ... leaving everything behind them. It's a very big shock. That's why I do my best to help these people to overcome this situation and to (help them) look for a better life."" The church helps the refugees as much as it can, with charity from nonprofits, but mostly private donations. Some of the Christian refugees live in the church, on the floor. Others live in nearby apartments rented by the church until they are granted asylum, a process that can drag on for years. ISIS overtakes Iraq's largest Christian city . ""We don't know how many days or months they stay with us; that's why I think any kind of help is welcome,"" Jaar said. Jaar rests little these days, spending his time welcoming visitors, helping new arrivals and, sometimes, taking the children on excursions to help them forget. He does it all with a big, wide smile. Still, he knows it will be difficult for the refugees, who after months on the move need rest and time to apply for visas to relocate to Europe, the United States or Australia. ""I learned so much from them, their patience and solidarity. I am very happy to be with them, to be serving these people,"" he says, just minutes before he comforts a woman -- a refugee -- in tears over the frustrating process of applying for asylum. ""When someone knocks on my door, I cannot say no. I have to say yes and give any kind of help,"" Jaar said. ""My church, my school, my heart is open for every single one who comes to ask for help,"" he said. Christian faith . The Iraqi families at the church have built their own small community, with the women take turns cooking and children sharing toys. Zaki lives with his wife and two children in a room crowded with at least three other families. Their suitcases are piled along the entrance, and their laundry hangs from the windows. Zaki's children, Athena and toddler Ethan, may never see Iraq again -- a price their father says he is willing to pay to keep his faith. Before the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Iraq's Christian population was estimated at more than 1 million. By the time the war was over, it dwindled to less than a third of that. Christians flee Iraq ahead of ISIS . Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, and its surrounds were home to an estimated 60,000 Christians prior to ISIS sweeping in. Since ISIS fighters took control of the city, all have left, according to Caritas International, a nonprofit aid group working to resettle refugees. ""Maybe in two years or three years, you will not see any Christians in Iraq. All of them they will leave,"" Zaki said. Picking up the pieces . There is nothing to go back to, says Nadira Haddou, a 57-year-old mother of five who fled Mosul. ""I don't want to go back. They took our homes. They took our belongings. They took our belongings,"" she said. ""I have nothing to go back to. I want to go to America."" The refugees all tell similar tales of the night of June 10, when ISIS fighters seized control of Mosul. For Ann Danyal, there is life before ISIS and life after. ""It's very hard to describe. (Life) changed 180 degrees. It felt like a dream. The first few days, we were wishing to sleep and wake up and it would all turn out to be a dream,"" she said, shaking her head. With her 7-year-old daughter lying across her lap, Danyal recalled how she and her family worked for years to build their lives ""in the home of our ancestors"" and then how it just ended. ""All of a sudden, they threaten you. They uprooted us,"" she said, fighting back tears. Danyal's daughter is struggling to cope, recalling the belongings she left behind in Mosul. "" 'If only we'd brought that pillow' or 'if only we'd brought that toy,' "" Danyal said her daughters tells her. ""I left without saying goodbye to my parents -- their graves. I still see them,"" she said, her voice trailing off as she remembered. ""My childhood home ... I wake up and wish I could go back,"" she said, looking at her hands, tears rolling down her cheeks. Long wait for peace . Sitting on a plastic chair in his living room across the street from the church, sipping hot Turkish coffee under a poster of Pope Francis, 60-year-old Basem Peter Rafael takes a drag from his cigarette. He points to 1991 as the start of Iraq's problems: the Persian Gulf War. Back then, he says, he named his son Salam -- Arabic for peace -- ""because we were waiting for peace."" ""Now he is 23, and still we are waiting,"" he said. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and Samira Said reported and wrote from Amman, Jordan, and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta.","About 100 Iraqi Christians are being sheltered at St. Mary's Church in Amman, Jordan .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- When Atlanta police officers Bryan Ernest and Bernatt Collins get a burglary call, they know that the house they walk into will probably be stripped, right down to the materials inside the walls. Calls to Atlanta, Georgia, police are increasing for vacant homes ransacked by burglars. They are part of a special burglary detail formed to watch the increasing number of vacant houses resulting from unpaid mortgages. Drawing their guns, the officers approach an empty house and shout ""Atlanta police!"" before entering. It's a burglary call, and they have to expect the worst. But the officers usually get to a home long after the thief has gone, leaving Sheetrock hanging from the walls like shredded cardboard, giant holes in the ceilings and exposed wiring minus its valuable copper parts.  Watch foreclosed homes gutted by thieves » . ""This is all copper that they are taking out down the walls,"" Ernest said. ""You can see where the outlets were, any bit of copper they take."" The Atlanta Police Department doesn't know how many homes have been hit. The police are not keeping records that differentiate between thieves who steal from occupied homes and those who rip out copper and appliances from vacant houses, many of them the result of the nation's foreclosure crisis.  See foreclosures across the country » . Across the country, law enforcement officials report that more empty houses are being burglarized. Developers are unable to sell newly built homes, and landlords have trouble renting properties. Atlanta is one of the few police departments that has formed a special vacant home burglary team. Rising copper prices are driving some of the thievery, but that's not all the burglars are taking. Wanda Vaughn and her mother, Vera, operate a contracting service. Banks and homeowners hire them to fix what's been broken and/or replace stolen items after a thief strikes. Sometimes they replace everything in a home and board it up to prevent more burglaries. Wanda Vaughn has seen water heaters ripped out and dumped on hardwood floors and carpet. ""This has to be torn out and replaced,"" she said while walking through a burglarized house in Atlanta. ""The baseboards have to be torn out because of mold on all the carpet padding and subflooring."" Estimated damage: between $15,000 and $20,000 for only about $40 worth of copper. ""They took the stove, the refrigerator, the cabinets, everything, including the kitchen sink!"" Vaughn said. Although some areas Ernest and Collins have patrolled over the past year are areas typically targeted by criminals, the burglaries are becoming more prevalent in affluent neighborhoods. ""The neighbors have been calling and saying they are hearing banging or seeing a vehicle that's parked at a house that's supposed to be vacant,"" Ernest said. Some thieves carry book bags full of copper. Others push baby carriages and shopping carts full of stripped building materials. ""Whatever they can push or pull to get this stuff out, they use,"" Collins said. County and city code enforcement departments often have difficulty locating homeowners. Some live out of town, and others have abandoned the houses after being unable to make mortgage payments, police said. House investor Bob Forbes said it's a constant battle when a home he owns is burglarized. Forbes usually installs steel cages around the air conditioning units outside the houses, but thieves take the air conditioner apart and pull the smaller pieces through the cage, leaving an empty concrete slab and padlock dangling off the bars of the cage. ""In one house, I betcha I replaced the air conditioning condensers three times, and they kept coming back,"" he said. ""If you don't have somebody in the house, it's going to happen. In one house that was about to close escrow, the plumbing was perfect. I came in the next day, and the plumbing, including the toilets, was gone!""","Vacant homes across the country are being burglarized at a high rate .

"(CNN) -- Two island paradises may be spared heavy damage this weekend, as hurricanes roar through the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The worst was over early Saturday for the British territory of Bermuda in the North Atlantic Ocean, after Hurricane Gonzalo passed over. And in the South Pacific, forecasters say the center of Hurricane Ana will slink by about 150 miles southwest of Hawaii. Over 80% of households in Bermuda were without power, according to a local newspaper, the Royal Gazette, which has reported no deaths, injuries or major damage due to the storm. A tropical storm a week earlier had knocked out power to nearly as many customers, the Gazette reported. Gonzalo weakened from a powerful Category 3 storm Friday evening to a Category 2 storm, according to the National Hurricane Center in Miami. It battered the island with wind gusts that topped 115 mph at one point, the agency said, as the storm moved in a northeasterly direction at 16 mph. Ahead of the storm, Bermuda closed schools, shut down bus and ferry service, and opened up shelters. Forecasters predicted Gonzalo will weaken to as it moves past Bermuda and pushes into the North Atlantic. 2014 Atlantic Hurricane Season facts . Hawaii prepares . Hurricane Ana strengthened into a Category 1 storm Friday afternoon with maximum sustained winds of 75 miles per hour, according to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu. But the hurricane is far enough away that forecasters predict its effects will amount to tropical storm conditions in parts of the islands over the weekend. But Gov. Neil Abercrombie isn't taking any chances. Abercrombie declared a state of emergency earlier this week in advance of Ana's arrival. The emergency proclamation ""allows us to respond quickly to any potential impacts,"" he said. Ana could cause dangerous surf conditions, coastal flooding and mudslides as it moves through the region. Some areas could see up to the 8 inches of rain with as much as 12 inches in isolated areas. Hurricanes are a rare occurrence in Hawaii. Only three storms have made a direct landfall on the islands in the past 55 years, according to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. But it's already been an unusual year for Hawaiians, weatherwise. The island chain has already been hit by two damaging tropical storms so far this season.

"London (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama failed to keep his 2008 election promise to close the Guantanamo Bay prison camp at a U.S. naval base in Cuba because the world had stopped watching. Europeans, delighted at his election and pledge to abandon Bush-era torture practices that had sullied the U.S. reputation worldwide, assumed that he would do what he said was going to do. It has taken three years to realise that he missed his self-imposed deadline. For many that realization has been brought about by the Guantanamo detainees themselves, who unable to voice their despair in any other way are now on hunger strike in large numbers. Even the U.S. military now admits that more than 50 of the 166 detainees in the camp are now involved. In reality, the number is much higher: Reprieve understands, through unclassified phone calls with our clients, that more than 130 are now on hunger strike. These include men with close ties to Europe: Shaker Aamer is a Londoner, a UK resident with a British wife and four British kids living in the capital. He has been cleared for release twice -- by both the Bush and Obama administrations. Successive British governments have called for him to be returned home. Yet he is still in Guantanamo, more than a decade on from being taken into U.S. custody. A fortnight ago, he told his lawyer, Reprieve's Clive Stafford Smith, that he had joined the hunger strike and had already lost over 30 pounds in weight. ""I can't read. I am dizzy and I fall down all the time,"" he said, adding ""My back and my neck are getting worse day by day. I don't want the end of this torture here to be paralyzed. I want to carry my kids when I get home."" Nabil Hadjarab's father and grandfather both fought for the French army. He longs to return to his family in France -- his uncle, Ahmad Hadjarab, has said: ""I am asking America for humanity, and asking France for gratitude."" But so far Nabil has had neither -- he has now lost so much weight that he is being force-fed by Guantanamo personnel, strapped to a chair while a tube is pushed up his nose and down his throat -- an intensely painful process that has been described by the World Medical Association as inhuman and degrading treatment. Nabil has been cleared for release since 2007 -- yet over five years on from U.S. authorities deciding that he is no threat to anyone, he still languishes in Guantanamo. On Wednesday night on an unclassified call with his lawyer he told her he had ""lost all hope of ever being released."" Another detainee, Younus Chekkouri hopes one day to be reunited with his family in Germany. He too has joined the hunger strike. On a recent unclassified call, he told Reprieve: ""The nightmare has started again. For some time, things had got a bit better here ...but now it has changed again ... really, now it is just pain everywhere. I don't want to die in Guantanamo."" Like Shaker and Nabil, Younus has never been given a trial or charged with any crime, and has been cleared for release by the U.S. authorities. There are many more in Guantanamo like these men -- stuck in a limbo with no apparent end, adrift from even the most basic principles of the rule of law. The hope which rose on the election of President Obama, who promised to close Guantanamo, now seems like a cruel joke. It is easy to understand the desperation they must feel: as Shaker himself put it recently, ""a little over 50% of the prisoners have been told they can go home -- or go somewhere -- but [they] are still here."" On Thursday the European Parliament tabled an urgent hearing on the hunger strike in Guantanamo. The debate is welcome. It is crucial that Europe realises that this is not just a U.S. issue -- it is our problem as well. European intelligence services worked closely with the U.S. in implementing the misguided policies of the so-called ""War on Terror"" that saw so many innocent men swept up, ""rendered"" and tortured, simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Europe has tolerated for too long the U.S. departure from the rule of law with regard to people who deserve the support of European governments. It must be hoped that this debate is a first step towards remedying this. There is much to welcome in the motion: a call for Europe to re-engage, to demand the closure of Guantanamo, and, crucially, to offer to resettle the dozen or so prisoners who have been cleared for release but cannot go home because of the risk of torture. If Europe follows through on this, there will still be hope that one day soon, men like Shaker, Nabil and Younous will be reunited with their families. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Polly Rossdale.","U.S. President Barack Obama promised in 2008 to close Guantanamo Bay .

"(CNN) -- It has been eight years since people in my state of Virginia got a chance to debate the meaning of the Civil War in front of the nation, and the comments posted on CNN and other news Web sites suggest our passion over the topic has not dimmed. If Governor Bob McDonnell wants his fellow Virginians to think deeply about ""how our history has led to our present,"" then his declaration of April as Confederate History Month has accomplished this goal, if not exactly in the manner he intended. The problem with the celebration of Confederate History Month, however, goes far beyond McDonnell's ""mistake"" in not discussing the centrality of slavery in the Civil War in his original proclamation. Confederate ""history"" means more than the four years during which Virginia and other states fought a war to form a separate country called the Confederate States of America. It refers to the many uses of Confederate symbols and evocations of Confederate history in the almost century-and-a-half since Appomattox as well. This long history offers nothing to memorialize. Former Confederate soldiers quickly formed the Ku Klux Klan after the war to attack Reconstruction officials and the black and white Republicans who were trying to run the state, and they sometimes displayed Confederate symbols as part of their work. After congressional hearings shut down the Klan, copycat organizations continued to make use of Confederate symbols as they engaged in acts of political terrorism. Former Confederates openly supported and participated in what many white Southerners called the ""redemption"" of the region, the reassertion of their control over state and local governments as Reconstruction ended. In the 1870s and 1880s, the decoration of Confederate graves with flowers and flags and celebratory speeches and parades increasingly signaled a commitment to what came to be called the ""Lost Cause,"" a decidedly partisan and self-consciously politicized account of the Civil War. Though many supporters of secession believed during the Civil War that they were fighting against other Americans over the issue of slavery, amateur and professional historians, many with ties to the Confederacy worked to rewrite this history as a noble fight for states rights and a celebration of the sacrifice of Confederate soldiers. What members of the Sons of the Confederacy offer today as the ""true"" history of the region has its roots in this effort. By the end of the 19th century, organizations like the Confederate Veterans and the Daughters of the Confederacy organized public acts of commemoration and the celebration of the ""honor"" of former Confederates. Members of these organizations actively used their version of history to support the disfranchisement of African-Americans and the expansion of a white supremacist social order grounded in segregation. Across the region, Jim Crow segregation and Confederate commemoration expanded hand in hand, as the Lost Cause version of the Southern past justified the contemporary elimination of black rights. iReporter: Gov. McDonnell ""wrong and right"" on the issue . When more subtle displays of Confederate symbols and history were not enough, white Southerners violently attacked and murdered African-Americans, sometimes publicly before large crowds. Lynchers sometimes brandished Confederate symbols. In the early 20th century, monuments to Confederate soldiers appeared on courthouse lawns across the South and on the grounds of southern state capitols, marking these public spaces as the property of the white people who celebrated this ""Confederate"" version of the past. By the 1920s, a revived Klan made the Confederate battle flag their second-most important symbol, after the fiery cross, as they once again used violence and threats of violence to uphold white supremacy. With the NAACP's victory in Brown v. Board of Education and the success of the Montgomery bus boycott, some white Southerners revived the use of Confederate versions of the past and Confederate symbols in their fight against the civil rights movement and integration. Crowds who attacked civil rights activists sometimes carried Confederate flags as civil rights supporters carried American flags and sang ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" to counter these Confederate symbols. Called the ""country club Klan"" because of its public condemnation of violence, the White Citizens Council also used Confederate versions of the past in its opposition to African-American equality. Today, Confederate history is as much about 1965 and the Voting Rights Act as it is about 1865 and Lee's surrender. The long history of the ways Confederate symbols have been used and Confederate history has been evoked to support racist violence and African- American oppression haunts Gov. McDonnell's declaration of Confederate History Month. Confederate history cannot be separated from the issue at the center of the Civil War, slavery. But it also cannot be separated from the history of segregation, massive resistance, and the fight against the civil rights movement. Historically, Confederate versions of the past and Confederate symbols have meant opposition to equal rights for all Americans. In officially recognizing Confederate History Month, Gov. McDonnell is asking Virginians to join together in celebration of this history of white supremacy.

"(CNN) -- An Illinois man was arrested in connection with the discovery of two hidden cameras found in a gym's tanning salon. The cameras were found in two separate tanning rooms at Planet Fitness in Moline and reported to police on November 5th and 6th, Sgt. Sgt Kevin Cox told CNN. A police investigation led to the Friday arrest of 27-year-old Trent Hamer on charges of unauthorized videotaping. Hamer was released on $2,500 bond the following day, Cox said. Hamer was a member of the gym, not an employee, Planet Fitness spokeswoman McCall Gosselin said in an email. ""His membership has been terminated,"" she said. ""At Planet Fitness, the safety and privacy of our members is extremely important to us. As such, the franchise owner is working very closely with the local authorities on this matter, and we appreciate their swift action in this case."" .","Hidden cameras found in two tanning rooms in Illinois gym .

"(CNN) -- ""Sometimes when I go I feel ashamed and go back without defecating. Sometimes I wait until dark to go there so no one can see me. I will be very concerned about Diani, my daughter, going to the bush because it is so far from here. At night it is very dangerous. People get killed. A woman and a boy were killed with knives. One woman I know of has been raped."" These are the words of Sandimhia Renato, a young mother from Mozambique. She has to walk 15 minutes every day to find somewhere to go to the toilet. Sandimhia and 1.25 billion other women around the world, find themselves in similar situations every day, where they have no choice but to put themselves at risk of disease, harassment or even violence because they lack access to something as simple as a safe and clean toilet. Today, 19 November, is the first U.N. recognized World Toilet Day. It's easy to dismiss such days, but recognition of the need to address this issue is vital. Read this: Happy World Toilet Day . Access to a safe toilet is one of the most effective ways of reducing death and disease and improving life for millions. Every hour 70 women and girls will needlessly die from diseases directly linked to a lack of an adequate toilet and safe drinking water. In total one and a quarter million men, women and children will die this year from preventable diseases brought about by a lack of access to these basic services. To die for want of a toilet is an outrage that we should not be tolerating. That is why WaterAid, Unilever and the UN partnership organisation, the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council have produced a new report, We Can't Wait, demonstrating the scale and consequences of this problem. Writing in the foreword to the report, UN Deputy Secretary-General, Jan Eliasson, and Unilever chief executive officer, Paul Polman, state: . ""One person in three lacks access to adequate sanitation. The result is widespread death and disease -- especially among children -- and social marginalization. Women are particularly vulnerable. Poor sanitation exposes females to the risk of assault, and when schools cannot provide clean, safe toilets girls' attendance drops."" Such words from leaders in diplomacy and in business are hugely welcome. WaterAid has been providing access to sanitation alongside clean drinking water and hygiene promotion since the early 1980s. We have also been banging on the door of governments in both the western and developing world for well over two decades, highlighting the practical steps that could be taken to end this tragedy. Progress has been made. Almost two billion people have gained access to sanitation since 1990. Many governments have made progress towards meeting the Millennium Development Goals that were set in 2000 and are due to achieve many of them by the end of 2015. One of those targets is a commitment to halve the proportion of people lacking access to what is called ""improved sanitation."" At the current rate of progress, this promise is way off track. In fact, if we carry on as we are, it will take another 12 years to get the job done. Even when this goal is finally reached, one in four people will still not have access to safe sanitation. Universal access is still over 50 years away. Such a delay is not acceptable. What is needed is political will and financing. The business case for doing so is extremely strong. The World Health Organization estimates that every $1 invested in sanitation services returns $5.50. If we halve the proportion of people without access to sanitation, the economic return would be over $54 billion per year. Getting everyone, everywhere access to a toilet would generate over $220 billion a year. World Toilet Day is an opportunity to celebrate the progress that has been made and recognizes how much more needs to be done. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of Barbara Frost.","November 19 is the first U.N. recognized World Toilet Day .

"Washington (CNN) -- Rep. Paul Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, regularly gets asked about his political ambitions, and he made one part of his future clear Thursday: In 10 years, he won't be in Congress. After already serving 16 years in Congress, the 44-year-old policy wonk told National Journal he wants to head the House's top tax and entitlement committee, have an impact and then get out. ""I've already been there 16 years. I don't want to be a career guy. Even though I've been there a long time, where you could already say that,"" Ryan said in the National Journal profile published Thursday, adding ""It's just, I don't want to spend my adult life in Congress."" Instead Ryan says he wants to serve a six-year term as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and leave to pursue another career. ""I want to be an impactful member of Congress. I want to make a big difference. But then I want to leave and go do something else,"" he said. Despite efforts to recruit him for a 2016 bid, Ryan doesn't seem prepared to pursue a presidential campaign either, though he wouldn't rule out a bid altogether. ""The president thing, it doesn't have to be me,"" Ryan says with a shrug. ""I just want us to win. I just want to get these policies passed."" But he's not excited about the current crop of likely GOP presidential contenders -- a field that includes New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz among others. Ryan said he would support another run by the man who picked him as his 2012 running mate, Mitt Romney, but Ryan said the former 2012 nominee ""has zero plans of doing that."" And he would also support a bid from former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, whom Ryan strongly lobbied to run in 2012. ""But other than Mitt and Mitch, there's not aâ€”,"" Ryan said, stopping himself. The reporter notes that he was about to say he's not excited about the current crop. ""That's why I stopped myself,"" Ryan replied. That lack of excitement might be what is keeping Ryan from silencing 2016 speculators once and for all, though Ryan said he doesn't see himself as a ""savior"" in the way that some politicians with presidential ambitions view themselves.

"Washington (CNN) -- The sea of red that overtook Virginia on Tuesday night didn't just jeopardize Sen. Mark Warner's re-election bid — it exploded his entire worldview. Thirteen years after he famously employed a ""Bubba strategy"" in culturally conservative regions of Virginia — courting NASCAR fans and commissioning a bluegrass theme song for his campaign on his way to the governor's mansion in 2001 — Warner was clobbered in the commonwealth's southern and southwest counties. The results were a shock to a senator who put in heavy time there. The margins made for a too-close-for-comfort Election Night against Republican nominee Ed Gillespie, who conceded the race on Friday. Even so, it was a reckoning that cut to the heart of Warner's public identity as a self-proclaimed ""radical centrist"" and ratified the urban-rural divide that characterizes the re-aligned politics of Virginia -- and the South. Why, some flabbergasted Virginia Democrats are asking, did Warner spend so much time campaigning in rural Virginia in the first place? ""He was running a campaign that was designed to win in the late 90's,"" said one Democrat with Virginia experience who did not want to talk on the record criticizing one of the state's most prominent party leaders. Coal country, and pretty much everything south and west of Richmond, drifted firmly into Republican hands in 2010, two years after President Barack Obama took office. Since then, Democrats running statewide — Sen. Tim Kaine in 2012 and Gov. Terry McAuliffe in 2013 — paid only modest attention to rural Virginia, focusing instead on turning out the Democratic base in populous northern Virginia and other strongly African-American jurisdictions around Richmond and Hampton Roads. But even in 2014, Warner was still enamored with the mythology of his first statewide victory so many years ago. He spent considerable time visiting rural parts of the state, even teaming up with former GOP Sen. John Warner — no relation — for a last minute push before Election Day. ""My path has been very different from Terry's or Tim's or others',"" Warner told The Washington Post before the election. ""To the annoyance of some of my so-called staff, I'm going to Abingdon and Russell County now because southwest Virginia gave me a start, and I'm not going to cede one part."" The comments look like a misstep in hindsight: In 2001, Warner won Russell County by 21 points. In his 2008 Senate race, he won it by 33. But on Tuesday, he lost Russell by 23 points. The Post reported that even his own advisers were urging Warner to layer more direct appeals to unmarried women and African-Americans on top of his usual bipartisan rhetoric and conservative outreach. It might have made Tuesday's margin, around 17,000 votes for now, more comfortable. Certainly the 2014 midterms were a bloodbath for Democrats everywhere, and swing-y Virginia was hardly immune. ""In a wave, even Jesus will have problems, and Mark Warner is as close as you get to Jesus in Virginia politics,"" said another Democrat who has labored on several Virginia statewide campaigns. ""No one is immune to national waves, especially purple states like this."" Looking at it another way, Warner was the only statewide Democrat on a ballot in the South to win an election on Tuesday. Or as one strategist close to the Warner campaign put it: ""Who else but Mark Warner could have survived a Republican tidal wave?"" ""Performing well in southwest Virginia has been a mark of pride for Warner in the past, and a proven strategy for him in two elections,"" said Andrew Bleeker, a Democratic digital strategist who has worked for Kaine and McAuliffe. ""No one expected the Republican wave to be as large. If the media narrative had anticipated a closer race we would have seen even higher turnout in northern Virginia and Norfolk."" Still, after the results starting coming in, Virginia Democrats who have worked on other statewide campaigns said they were mystified at Warner's approach. ""This is a base turnout state now,"" said one strategist who wondered why Warner was spending time on the trail with a white, 87-year old Republican ex-Senator instead of bringing in African-American surrogates for the final push. ""Why was he spending so much time in southwest Virginia? He should have been focusing on black parts of Richmond, northern Virginia, Hampton Roads,"" the source said. Loudoun, one of three vote-rich northern Virginia counties, is a happy hunting ground for statewide Democrats. In last year's governor's race -- another off-year election -- McAuliffe made his campaign almost entirely about base turnout, focusing heavily on places like Loudoun in the Washington, D.C. suburbs and the African-American vote in Richmond and Hampton Roads. To be safe, he brought in President Barack Obama and former President Bill Clinton for closing campaign rallies. The result: McAuliffe 2013 outran Warner 2014 in every big northern Virginia county — Loudoun, Fairfax and Prince William — as well as in Democratic strongholds like Hampton, Newport News and Norfolk. In Fairfax alone, McAuliffe banked almost 70,000 votes with a 22-point rout of his GOP opponent in the state's biggest county. Warner won Fairfax, but by less — a 17-point margin, or 54,000 votes. Of the biggest Democratic counties in the state, Warner only outperformed McAuliffe in Henrico. The comparison is imperfect. Last November was a better environment for Democrats, and McAuliffe was less well-known and viewed less favorably than Warner. But McAuliffe still only won the state by 2.5 points, validating his strategy of targeting the base with direct appeals to women and African-Americans. Warner, it should be said, held onto a shred of dignity in rural Virginia this year, outpacing McAuliffe in the region but still losing badly everywhere except for Montgomery County, home to Virginia Tech, and the city of Danville. And yet, the few thousand votes he picked up here and there added little to his total margin. If he invested similar energy farther north, his vote lead would have been larger. But Warner allies insist that in a surprisingly too-close-for-comfort race, every little bit helped. And if there's truth to the whispers of a rivalry between Warner and McAuliffe — the Senator escaped this year's midterms with a nice talking point. McAuliffe, after all, won 1,069,789 total votes last year. Warner's total? 1,071,049 and counting.","Mark Warner's re-election in Virginia was surprisingly close .
He's being criticized for not focusing on heavily African-American parts of the state ."
"(CNN) -- As someone who studies the morality of babies, I am sometimes asked ""Are we naturally good or naturally evil?"" My answer is yes. Most adults have a sense of right and wrong. With the intriguing exception of some psychopaths, people are appalled by acts of cruelty, such as the rape of a child, and uplifted by acts of kindness, such as those heroes who jump onto subways tracks to rescue fallen strangers from oncoming trains. There is a universal urge to help those in need and to punish wrongdoers and there are universal emotional responses that revolve around morality—anger when we are wronged, pride when we do the right thing and guilt when we transgress. In ""Just Babies,"" I argue that much of this is the product of biological evolution. Humans are born with a hard-wired morality, a sense of good and evil is bred in the bone. I know this claim might sound outlandish, but it's supported now by research in several laboratories. Babies and toddlers can judge the goodness and badness of others' actions; they want to reward the good and punish the bad; they act to help those in distress; they feel compassion, guilt and righteous anger. In my own research at Yale, done in collaboration with my colleague (and wife), Karen Wynn, we show babies one-act plays—puppets shows in which one puppet acts kindly toward a character (helping it up a hill, or opening a box for it, or passing it a ball) and the other puppet acts in a cruel way (pushing it down a hill, or slamming the box shut, or stealing the ball). Babies can't speak, but we can learn about their judgments and preferences from their behavior—where they look, what they reach for, and, for older babies, who they will give a treat to and who they will take a treat from. We find that even 3-month-olds prefer the good guy to the bad guy, and that older babies and toddlers will reward the good guy and punish the bad guy. Babies also prefer other characters that do the same; they prefer a just puppet who rewards the good and punishes the bad over an unjust puppet who does the opposite. The existence of a universal moral sense is the good news. But we are, as the anthropologist Robert Ardrey put it, risen apes, not fallen angels. Our brains are the products of natural selection and so one would expect our innate morality to have certain limits. Indeed, studies find that babies start off as little bigots, eagerly dividing the world into us versus them and strongly favoring their own group over everyone else. Although the baby's capacity for moral judgment applies broadly, when it comes to kindness and compassion, we start off indifferent—or worse—toward strangers. The biologist Richard Dawkins was right, then, when he said at the start of ""The Selfish Gene,"" ""Be warned that if you wish, as I do, to build a society in which individuals cooperate generously and unselfishly toward a common good, you can expect little help from biological nature."" Or, as a character in a Kingsley Amis novel put it: ""It was no wonder that people were so horrible when they started life as children."" Fortunately, we can transcend our limited biological natures. Modern humans possess abstract moral notions of equality and freedom for all; we see racism and sexism as evil; we reject slavery and genocide; we try to love our enemies. Of course, our actions typically fall short, often way short, of our moral principles, but these principles do shape, in a substantial way, the world that we live in. And being exposed as a child to these moral ideals—and interacting with people who exemplify these ideals—is an essential part of growing up to be a good person. Why does this research matter? For one thing, these findings can change the way parents think of their own babies and children. Many people believe we are born selfish and amoral—that we start off as pint-sized psychopaths. Others think that genes are destiny, and that some babies are bad seeds, unredeemable souls from the very start. Both these cynical views are mistaken. We are naturally moral beings, but our environments can enhance—or, sadly, degrade—this innate moral sense. Finally, an understanding of moral psychology can help us make the world a better place. If you're interested in reducing racism and bigotry, for instance, it is critical to understand the inborn proclivity to favor one's own group over others; if you want to create a just society, you'll want to learn about how we naturally think about fairness and equity. Good social policy is informed by an understanding of human nature at its best and its worst, and this is what the science of baby morality is all about.

"(CNN) -- Scientists have captured antimatter atoms for the first time, a breakthrough that could eventually help us to understand the nature and origins of the universe. Researchers at CERN, the Geneva-based particle physics laboratory, have managed to confine single antihydrogen atoms in a magnetic trap. This will allow them to conduct a more detailed study of antihydrogen, which will in turn allow scientists to compare matter and antimatter. Understanding antimatter is one of the biggest challenges facing science -- most theoretical physicists and cosmologists believe that at the Big Bang, when the universe was created, matter and antimatter were produced in equal amounts. However, as our world is made up of matter, antimatter seems to have disappeared. Understanding antimatter could shed light on why almost everything in the known universe consists of matter. Antimatter has been very difficult to handle because matter and antimatter don't get on, destroying each other instantly on contact in a violent flash of energy. In a precursor to today's experiment, in 2002 scientists at CERN produced antihydrogen atoms in large quantities, but they had an incredibly short lifespan -- just several milliseconds -- because the antihydrogen came into contact with the walls of their containers and the two annihilated each other. In this latest experiment the lifespan of the antihydrogen atoms was extended by using magnetic fields to trap them and thus prevent them from coming into contact with matter. The researchers created 38 antihydrogen atoms and held on to them for about a tenth of a second, which is long enough to study them says Professor Jeffrey Hangst, one of the team of CERN scientists who worked on the program. Hangst and his colleagues produced a magnet field which was strongest near the walls of the trap, falling to a minimum at the center, causing the atoms to collect there in a vacuum. ""We could have held them for much longer... I am just full of joy and relief, it's taken us five years to get here, this is a big milestone,"" Hangst told CNN. To trap just 38 atoms, they had to run the experiment 335 times, says Nature which published the report findings. Hangst added: ""This was ten thousand times more difficult than creating untrapped antihydrogen atoms. ""This will help us understand the structure of space and time. For reasons that no one yet understands, nature ruled out antimatter... this inspires us to work that much harder to see if antimatter holds some secret."" Malcolm Longair, professor of natural philosophy at Cambridge University, told CNN that CERN's results were a considerable achievement. ""At the Big Bang we believe the temperatures were very very high and we understand in theory why antimatter disappeared but there is no physical theory to back it up."" Antimatter was first predicted in 1931 by the British physicist Paul Dirac, who theorized that antimatter is ordinary matter in reverse. CERN's next ambition is to create a beam of antimatter which they hope will allow them to unpeel more of the mysteries surrounding it.","Antihydrogen atoms were trapped in a magnetic field .

"(CNN) -- Congress has moved to prevent money from the proposed $825 billion stimulus package from being used for zoos, aquariums, golf courses, swimming pools and casinos, an effort to ensure the bill funds only what it calls the ""highest quality"" infrastructure projects. Restrictions added to the stimulus proposal would keep the money from zoo projects, among other things. ""The purpose of this bill is to direct funding at projects that are primarily and clearly aimed at benefiting the economic conditions of communities and the public at large,"" the bill states. ""The federal government and all other levels of government are directed to look with a skeptical eye at projects that don't meet that test."" CNN revealed last month that a list of ""ready to go"" stimulus projects endorsed by the U.S. Conference of Mayors included museum and zoo renovations, aquatic centers, skateboard parks and bike and horse paths. One of the zoo projects in the report is a $4.8 million polar bear exhibit at the Providence, Rhode Island, zoo. The House Appropriations Committee added those restrictions last week after criticism from watchdog groups like the National Taxpayers Union, which monitors government spending. ""To the people supporting them, these proposals aren't a joke,"" said Pete Sepp, the group's vice president. ""But to the taxpayers funding them, yes this will be a joke for them, only they won't be laughing."" The restrictions in the bill appear meant to address reports about some of the projects endorsed by the U.S. mayors, Sepp said. The stimulus bill, known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, has been placed on the congressional fast-track. It could come to a vote in the full House of Representatives as soon as Wednesday, and Democratic leaders have said they aim to get the package to President Obama's desk for enactment by Presidents Day.  Watch Obama say he's optimistic after discussing the bill with GOP leaders » . ""A historical level of transparency, oversight and accountability will help guarantee taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and Americans can see results for their investment,"" Rep. Dave Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who leads the Appropriations Committee, said in a statement. The committee also added language that would prevent any money given to the state of Illinois from being handled by the state's impeached governor, Rod Blagojevich. Blagojevich faces federal charges accusing him of attempting to trade or sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by Obama after his November election, and the state Senate began his trial Monday. The governor denies any wrongdoing and has skipped his impeachment trial to proclaim his innocence on the talk-show circuit. The measure sets up project monitoring, including a government-wide recovery program Web site, where all announcements for grant competitions, formula grant allocations and competitive grant awards must be listed. In addition, government agencies must publish on the site, ""a description of all infrastructure projects, and the total cost and the justification for using stimulus money."" The strict rules require that the notification include ""the name of a person to contact at the entity if there are concerns with the investment and an e-mail address for the federal official in each agency whom the public can contact,"" the bill states. ""Also included within the notification must be a certification from the mayor or governor or other chief executive, as appropriate, that the investment has received the full review and vetting required by law and that they accept responsibility that this investment is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars."" A Recovery Act Accountability and Transparency Board will be created ""to review management of recovery dollars and provide early earning of problems,"" according to a summary of the bill provided by the appropriations committee. The board will include inspectors general and deputy cabinet secretaries. The stimulus package is already being taken up by key committees in the Senate, where Majority Leader Harry Reid -- from casino-heavy Nevada -- said he is not concerned about the House restrictions on money going to casinos. ""Casinos are a huge part of Nevada's economy and create a lot of jobs,"" Reid told CNN on Tuesday. ""But none of the spending in this bill is earmarked for any casino, so this provision is largely symbolic.""","House panel adds restrictions to stimulus bill after criticism from watchdog groups .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Democratic candidate running for Senate in Kansas took his case to the state Supreme Court this week to get his name off the ballot. And he won. By pulling their candidate, Democrats are hoping independent candidate Greg Orman will unseat Republican Sen. Pat Roberts and join the Democratic caucus in the Senate. Despite that support, Orman hasn't yet said who he'll caucus with if he wins. But one thing is clear: the Kansas Senate election that was supposed to be over after the Republican primary is now a serious threat to Republicans, who have held onto Kansas' Senate seats for the last 80 years. It could also tip the balance of the Senate in a year when Republicans are hoping to take control of the chamber for the first time since 2006, meaning they'll get to chair committees, decide what bills get a vote and overall set the political agenda. Orman: Independent or Democrat-in-disguise? Orman hasn't said which party he would caucus with in the Senate, but he's indicated that his success can get Kansas a sweet deal, whichever side he decides to bat for. This is not an entirely novel strategy. Sen. Angus King won election in Maine as an independent candidate in 2012 and went on to vote mostly with Democrats. By putting a solidly Republican state into contention, Republicans will have to work harder if they hope to wrest control of the Senate from Democratic hands -- which is a serious possibility this cycle -- and Orman's betting he can leverage his independence to help his would-be constituents. ""There's a reasonable chance that neither party will have a majority. And if that happens that's a great thing for Kansas. It gives Kansans the opportunity to define the agenda,"" Orman says in a sleek campaign video as inspirational music plays in the background. Orman has been registered with both parties in the past, most recently running for the Senate in 2008 as a Democrat, and his campaign insists he's spent more time as an independent than as a member of either party. Orman has said he will ""caucus with whichever party is willing to solve our country's problems, whichever party is willing to put forward a real, true problem-solving agenda,"" but indicated that he could make a switch if partisan moves persist. ""We'll also be in a position to hold that party accountable,"" Orman says in the video. But Roberts' campaign is doing its best to paint Orman as a Democrat trying to win election in a red state by taking off his blue label. The incumbent's campaign website points out Orman's donations to Democratic groups -- including donations to Majority Leader Harry Reid, then-Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Hillary Clinton in 2007, all of which are listed in the Federal Elections Committee database. But Orman's political donations have spanned the political map, and his campaign pointed out donations to Republican Scott Brown's 2010 bid for Senate in Massachusetts as well as donations to the National Republican Congressional Committee. His campaign also highlighted contributions to coalition-building and problem-solving groups like Americans Elect -- for whom Orman cut a $25,000 check. Winning the moderates . And while Orman seems to have gained covert support from Democratic leadership, he's also picked up support from a group of moderate Kansas Republicans that includes former Kansas Republican Party chairs and top state legislators who say Roberts and Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback have moved too far to the right. The group, Traditional Republicans for Common Sense, was attracted to Orman's problem-solving mentality and dissatisfaction with Washington gridlock, Rochelle Chronister, the group's spokeswoman, said. In a meeting before the group endorsed him, Orman said he was unhappy with both parties and hoped to become a go-between for the two parties. And even if Orman decides to caucus with the Democrats on legislative business, Chronister, who spent 17 years in the state legislature and chaired the Kansas Republican Party in the late '80s, said her group wouldn't feel slighted. ""If he can figure out a way to make things work, I don't think we care,"" Chronister said. ""We're just sick to death of what's going on."" Orman's success with moderate Republicans can be tied to dissatisfaction in Kansas with a governor and state legislature that has moved too far to the right, said Nathaniel Birkhead, a political science professor at Kansas State University. And Birkhead cited Roberts' anti-regulation, anti-spending vote against the farm bill as a mistake in an agricultural state like Kansas. Republican Sen. Jerry Moran, the state's second senator, voted for the bill. ""It's a very solidly Republican state, but we're seeing the voters try and turn the thermostat down a bit,"" Birkhead, who focuses on state and legislative politics, said. Birkhead summed up Orman's appeal: ""He's not a Democrat and he's not Pat Roberts."" But if Orman chooses to caucus with Democrats in the Senate, Birkhead said he likely wouldn't get reelected. Republican strategist Matt Keelen said the Republican establishment has no doubt Orman will caucus with Democrats if elected. ""He's trying to play it as close to the vest as possible in the hopes that people believe that he is not sure of where he is going to caucus,"" Keelen said. ""Based on all their experience with him in the state, they don't believe he's going to caucus with [Republicans]."" Keelen agreed that if Orman decides to bat for Democrats in the Senate, Orman would become the ""number-one Republican target in six years,"" when he would be up for re-election. ""He'd be a one-term senator if he were to caucus with the Democrats,"" Keelen said. What can Democrats do? Democratic strategist Steve Murphy said Democrats have already done all they can do to help Orman take the Kansas seat -- they've cleared the field. And while Democrats do need to submit a nominee for the ballot, it's unlikely that candidate would pull as much support away from Orman as former nominee Chad Taylor would have. Now, Murphy said Democrats just need to let Orman win the election as an independent without any overt Democratic support. ""There's a perfect way for Democrats to buoy his candidacy and that's to stay out of the way,"" Murphy said. And while Orman seems fine caucusing with either party when he gets to the Senate, voters could also be attracted to a candidate who wants to stay away from both parties. ""He might be able to get a sweeter deal by not caucusing with anybody,"" Murphy said.","Dems pulled their candidate from the ballot to help Orman unseat the sitting Republican .
Orman hasn't said which party he would caucus with in the Senate .
He's told supporters he wants to be a mediator between the two parties .
Many believe he'd caucus with Democrats, but he'll face slim re-election chances if he does ."
"(CNN) -- The fiscal cliff is hours away. And Americans are angry. Across the country, millions are fed up with a Congress that seems unable to get some important things done. ""We need Congress to represent the people, not two arrogant parties that can't see middle ground,"" Garry Benner says. ""Nowhere else in this country can you get paid for ... years and not do your job,"" Tom Jeffries says. By posting their views on Facebook, Benner and Jeffries joined a growing chorus of millions who are venting through social media. Forget 2013; nation is counting down to fiscal cliff . The messages, which include videos sent to CNN iReport, are ""so useful, because the people in Washington need to hear from the everyday American,"" says Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor. Some are furious with Republicans for fighting against allowing tax breaks for the nation's wealthiest to expire, despite an election that made clear that a majority of Americans support the idea. ""Asking Republicans to give up money is like asking the sun for water in the desert,"" Thomas Hannsz complains. Others say Democrats and President Obama aren't doing enough to cut spending. ""We need to cut entitlements & spending & get people off"" government reliance, Candria Crisp writes. One of the most striking, and disheartening, iReports comes from Shannen Bazzi, an 18-year-old student of international affairs at George Washington University. Latest updates: Final fiscal cliff scramble . ""My New Year's message to Washington is that this entire fiscal cliff problem isn't just an isolated incident. It's representative of how partisanship and polarization have taken over Congress,"" she says. ""i used to be excited for the future, but I don't want to live in a country that doesn't have a successful working (legislature). Congress, it's time for you to remember what your purpose really is and get back to doing your job."" What she's seeing from Washington ""has almost turned me off from that field of work,"" Bazzi says. ""Congress is not only jeopardizing our economy, it's also jeopardizing faith in our government in general."" Fellow iReporter Vernon Hill is among the many not mincing words. ""My new year's message to Washington is to grow up, act like adults, do your jobs or resign immediately. We are tired of your being useless and refusing to do your jobs."" Valerie Stayskal called on Washington to put ""partisanship aside"" in the new year and work on behalf of the country, ""fixing this mess that you have gotten us into. And bring a balanced budget to the table to grow this economy for the long term and not the short term."" Read more: Sticking points in fiscal cliff talks . But some people think the cliff isn't something to be avoided at all. ""Let's go over it,"" Adam Chance Campbell argued on Facebook. ""It's long overdue and we need several more just like it.

"Detroit, Michigan (CNN) -- The federal judge in the Christmas Day bombing attempt case has granted the defendant's backup attorney access to case documents. U.S. District Court Judge Nancy Edmunds scheduled another pretrial conference hearing for January 12, 2011, enough time for Anthony Chambers, the standby counsel for Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, to examine the documents. She also set a 120-day window for motions to be entered. AbdulMutallab, the British-educated son of a Nigerian bank executive, is accused of trying to set off a bomb hidden in his underwear aboard a plane from Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Detroit on December 25. The pretrial hearing Thursday came after a federal judge delayed court proceedings for about a month to give . AbdulMutallab time to prepare his legal defense. In September, AbdulMutallab decided that he no longer wanted to be represented by federal defenders and would act as his own attorney. Edmunds granted his request and appointed Chambers to be his standby counsel in case he needs help at any point in the proceedings. Speaking to reporters outside the courtroom, Chambers said the case will be treated like any other. ""We're going to review it and make the decisions as we go along,"" he said, noting it is unusual for him to be appointed standby counsel. He wouldn't discuss anything regarding meetings, but he said the discovery access is important ""so we can review the case to determine what should happen and how things should transpire."" AbdulMutallab faces six federal charges, including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and willful attempt to destroy an aircraft. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of trying to blow up the Northwest Airlines plane. Chambers said AbdulMutallab's family is ""very supportive"" of him. AbdulMutallab is not the first high-profile terror suspect who has requested to represent himself in a U.S. court. Zacarias Moussaoui, the first man charged in connection with the September 11, 2001, attacks, similarly asked and was allowed to act as his own counsel. A judge later stripped him of that right after warning Moussaoui to stop filing what she called frivolous and disrespectful motions.

"(Mental Floss) -- Through the years, there have been many unforgettable and sometimes unfortunate hairstyles. Recording artist Travis Barker of Blink 182 was topped by a mohawk at an event in 2005. (1) MOHAWKS . The Style: Originally sported by warriors of various Native American tribes, the hairstyle was adopted by a squad of the U.S. Army's bad-to-the-bone 101st Airborne Division during World War II, before being commandeered by punk rockers in the 1970s. The Story: Up until a few years ago, no one would have questioned the mohawk's roots. However, in 2003, an Irish peat harvester made a discovery that would change the hairstyle's history forever -- a 2,300-year-old corpse, remarkably well preserved by the unique chemistry of a peat bog, sporting a bonafide 'hawk. The Shocker: The ancient Irish punker, dubbed Clonycavan Man, had gel in his hair, which archaeologists determined was made from vegetable oil mixed with a resin from southwestern France or Spain. Imported hair product? Today, scientists are still working hard to determine whether Clony was a prehistoric punker or just an Iron Age metrosexual. (2) POMPADOURS . The Style: If the word brings to mind images of pink Cadillacs and bouffant 'dos, you're on the right track. But in the same way America borrowed rock 'n' roll from the blues and method acting from the Russians, the key to those 1950s locks lies in 18th-century France. The Story: The Marquise de Pompadour was King Louis XV's über-fashionable mistress, and her elaborately teased, upswept hair was imitated by high-society women throughout the country. While 20th-century pompadours were considerably tinier than those of its namesake's, the modern version claims one definitive advantage: technology. Where today's science has yielded hair wax, putty, glue, and paste to cement them into place, pomps of yore depended on beef tallow, bear grease, and other artery-cloggers. The Shocker: Not surprisingly, slathering one's hair with animal remains tended to attract animals (insects and other nasties), which occasionally turned the original pompadour into, quite literally, a rats' nest. (3) BEEHIVES . The Style: Speaking of rats' nests (and the Marquise de Pompadour, for that matter), the beehive of the 1960s is itself a 200-year throwback to the 1760s Big Hair Days. The Story: There's more to those 18th-century bouffant styles than meets the eye. Whereas the modern beehive is nicknamed ""the B-52"" for its uncanny resemblance to the B-52 bomber's distinctive nose, Marie Antoinette and her gal pals stowed actual warships in their hair -- or at least miniature replicas of them. The Shocker: Like precursors to the Cracker Jack box, these 18th-century 'dos served as treasure troves, housing exotic prizes like tiny caged birds, cupid dolls, and other bulky curios. Of course, not every hairdo was a winner. When millions of hungry peasants revolutionized France, the over-the-top hairstyle quickly fell out of fashion -- landing in that little basket just below the guillotine. (4) QUEUES . The Style: When the Manchu invaded China in the 17th century, they brought over a killer fashion trend killer as in, adopt it or else. The Story: The Manchu sported the queue, a shaved-in-front, ponytail-in-the-back haircut, and forced the Han Chinese to do the same. The effect? Quite a lot of protest. The Shocker: While much of China eventually submitted to the do-or-die trend, many thousands bravely chose to keep their hair -- and lose their heads. So what was the big deal with getting a little shave? Aside from the queue not being such a flattering cut (even compared to, say, the mullet), it also happened to be against the religion of millions of long-haired Confucian Chinese, who believe that one's skin and hair are sacred. (5) MULLETS . The Style: A fad gone bad or the most reviled haircut in history? Popularized by David Bowie and others during the glam 'ol days of the 1970s, the mullet was adopted (and expanded voluminously upon) in the 1980s by hard rockers and their headbanging army of fans. As hair metal gave way to grunge and alternative music in the early 1990s, a term was coined to describe those who still clung to the headbangers' signature cut -- ""mullet heads."" The Story: According to the Oxford English Dictionary, which inducted ""mullet"" into its venerable lexicon in 2001, the word (as it refers to a hairstyle) was ""apparently coined, and certainly popularized, by U.S. hip-hop group the Beastie Boys"" in their 1995 song ""Mullet Head."" The Shocker: Since making it into the OED, ridicule of the bemulleted has grown increasingly vocal and, judging from a random sampling of anti-mullet Web sites, rather virulent. The mullet is the one haircut Americans love to hate -- and give funny names to. To list a few: The Tennessee Top Hat, The Kentucky Waterfall, and The Camaro Crash Helmet. Our personal favorite, however, is The Missouri Compromise, which manages to reference both the haircut's ""business in the front, party in the back"" policy, as well as the shameful Compromise of 1820, which regulated slavery in developing U.S. territories.

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff won a hotly contested runoff election on Sunday. With more than 99% of votes counted, the incumbent Rousseff had 51.59% of the vote, according to official results. Opposition candidate Aecio Neves garnered 48.41%. Neves said he called to congratulate Rousseff, who thanked voters on Twitter late Sunday for their support. The election was one of the tightest competitions in recent years. Before becoming the country's first female president in 2011, Rousseff, from the Workers' Party, was chief of staff to former President Lula da Silva. She claims that under the presidencies of her predecessor and herself, masses of Brazilians have risen out of poverty. Rousseff, 66, presided over the soccer World Cup in Brazil. She took a lot of political flack over how public money was spent. The President defeated Neves, a 54-year-old economist, who is a well-known name and a career politician. His campaign slogan promised reforms to lower inflation and encourage more investment in the country: ""The sure path for Brazil to really change."" The pro-business candidate belongs to the Brazilian Social Democratic Party, one of the country's strongest. Shasta Darlington reported from Sao Paulo. Dana Ford reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet also contributed to this report.","With more than 99% of votes counted, Dilma Rousseff had 51.59% of the vote .

"(CNN) -- Take two video-game console cameras and one pair of horn-rimmed glasses and for around $30 you have a device that will allow you to control a computer or, potentially, even a wheelchair with your eyes. Previously, if you wanted to buy similar eye-tracking equipment it would have cost you upwards of $8,000. Now, scientists in London have pioneered a device, the GT3D, using components anyone of us can buy from the shopping mall. Watch Make Create Innovate on Quest Means Business . The breakthrough could help millions of people suffering from Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's, muscular dystrophy and, potentially, opens the door to a new era of hands-free computers, allowing us to use them without a mouse, keyboard or touch screen. For the lead researcher Dr Aldo Faisal, a neuroscientist at Imperial College in London, the new device only came about because of his obsession with disassembling gadgets. ""I like to play with gadgets and was playing with a popular video-game console,"" he said. ""I hacked it and discovered it was very fast and better than any webcam for movement. Actually, it was so fast that I found we could record eye movement with it."" Tracking eye movement is no mean feat. Our eyes moves 10 to 20 times a second, so a standard webcam or even film camera will miss most eye movements and where we are looking. As such, it is perhaps no surprise commercial eye-tracking devices are so expensive. Watch a demonstration of the technology . Luckily for Faisal and his team of researchers, video game console makers have been willing to bulk buy the technology needed to make good enough cameras. They make a loss on the console cameras in the expectation of making it back on accompanying video game sales. ""We originally created the device for £39.80 ($64) but recent falls in the price of video game console cameras mean we could now actually make the same device for about £20 ($32),"" says Faisal. The eye-tracking device works by first establishing where the eyes are looking, through a relatively straight-forward calibration process. The user puts on the glasses, with the two attached cameras, and stares at a computer screen full of dots. They are then told to look at different dots, with software developed by the researchers working out how the eye looks at each dot. Opinion: 'Teach young people to be more innovative' Once calibrated, the device can be used to control a mouse on the screen and is so accurate that if you were in a normal-sized room and wearing the device it would be able to locate where you were looking to within the size of a grapefruit, say its developers. Existing commercially available devices such as the Tobii PCEye and the EyeTech TM3 also allow users to control a computer with their eye instead of a mouse. Like the GT3D, they use two cameras and say they can be used to surf the web, send emails and do anything a handheld mouse can do -- but they are priced between around $5,000 and $7,000. And if you search online, you will find many amateur attempts to create eye-tracking devices just like the GT3D. But Faisal says the difference with his is that it has been properly tested and proven to work -- a demonstration of his device has been published in the peer-reviewed journal BMC Neuroscience. Unsurprisingly, the interest in his technology has been huge, he says. Several companies have already approached him to develop and mass-produce the device. However, Faisal says, none have so far embraced his ambition for making it available at a low cost to millions. Instead, they all preferred to undercut existing eye-tracking devices by 10%. ""My mission is that we forge technology with neurological science to find ways to help millions of people with disabilities, such as loss of limbs or muscular disorders, use technology in a cheap way,"" said Faisal. ""We want to make sure people can buy the device for no more than £80 ($125)."" Quiz: Accidental inventions . If no commercial partner comes forward within the next year or two, Faisal says they will publish all the information about their device and software online and make it freely available for anyone to replicate. For many disability campaigners, such a device cannot come soon enough. ""Those with extreme muscle-wastage in their arms often rely on carers to work on a computer, cannot position themselves comfortably at a keyboard and quickly suffer fatigue from typing,"" says Dr Marita Pohlschmidt, director of research at the UK-based Muscular Dystrophy Campaign, who calls it a ""potentially life-changing innovation."" ""It also offers us an exciting glimpse of future possibilities -- optical control of hoists, beds, blinds, kitchen and entertainment equipment. The impact of recovering the independence to do such things for disabled people, their carers -- and for family life -- would be vast,' she adds. Faisal says it would already be possible to control a wheelchair with their device. The main obstacle is how to differentiate between where someone is looking at where they actually want to move to in the wheelchair. He says this has been overcome by his researchers through the use of a wink as a command trigger. ""We use a wink rather than a blink because you never wink by accident,"" explained Faisal. However, while he can see its popularity for disabled or elderly people, Faisal remains uncertain about whether cheap eye-tracking devices are ready to take over from the mouse and touch-screen computers. ""Perhaps it will bring in a new era of hands-free computers. But there is a problem in that the computer industry is moving towards touch systems with the iPad, so I'm not sure the mass-market is going to embrace eye-movement just yet. Also, I am not sure it is ready for use with complicated applications like, for example, Photoshop.""","UK scientist pioneers cost-effective headset that enables a wearer's eyes to control a computer .

"(CNN) -- More than 115,000 volunteers have joined the crowdsourcing search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane by going to their computers and reviewing satellite photos of the open ocean to find signs of the aircraft, a sponsor said Wednesday. In all, these humanitarian-minded volunteers have posted 100 million page views in the first 34 hours since the crowdsourcing campaign began this week. The public was viewing 2 million pages of satellite imagery every 10 minutes on Wednesday, said a senior director of a Longmont, Colorado, the firm that is leading the Internet effort. The volunteers are assisting the experts now in Malaysia and its surrounding ocean by looking for any sign of the commercial airliner. But as of Wednesday, the amateurs online hadn't had any luck. ""Up until now, there hasn't been the smoking gun, the final clue, that leads to the location of the wreckage of the missing aircraft,"" said Shay Har-Noy, founder of DigitalGlobe's tomnod.com, where the online searches are being conducted. It wasn't immediately clear whether authorities in Malaysia were aware of the crowdsourcing effort or chasing any leads identified by volunteers. However, search experts were examining Wednesday the findings of a Chinese satellite that ""observed a suspected crash area at sea,"" a Chinese government agency said. The Chinese imagery marked a potential big break in the frustrating search for the Boeing 777. The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has become such an international mystery that Internet do-gooders have mobilized a ""crowdsourcing campaign"" poring over DigitalGlobe's satellite photos -- all in the effort to find any trace of a plane floating in the Gulf of Thailand. The task, however, is like the cliched search for a needle in a haystack. ""We have found a lot of really interesting pieces of debris, lots of ships,"" which are involved in the search, Har-Noy told CNN on Wednesday. ""We can see from space all the boats and the infrastructure that's in place"" for the open sea hunt, said Har-Noy, also a senior director for geospatial big data for DigitalGlobe, which acquired tomnod.com last year. So many people are tantalized by the mystery and want to help in the search -- online, at least -- that they have crashed the website several times in the past couple of days. ""Yes, yesterday we had a quite a bit of trouble keeping up with the volume,"" Har-Noy said. ""The response has been extraordinary."" In fact, scores of volunteers have posted their findings from tomnod.com on their CNN iReport pages, which is CNN's own version of crowdsourcing, sometimes used in the news outlet's coverage of world events. One CNN iReporter, Mike Seberger, early in the crowdsourcing campaign spotted an image in one satellite photograph that appears to be a commercial airliner floating in the ocean -- though Seberger concedes the silhouette also resembles a boat. His discovery, however, has apparently turned out to be a false alarm -- especially in the wake of Har-Noy's declaration Wednesday that none of the online tips has yet yielded a major clue. Seberger's flagging of the interesting image, however, went viral, and in the span of a couple of days, his iReport page is now ranked the eighth most popular of all-time, between a Hurricane Sandy posting and a Super Typhoon Haiyan photo.

"(CNN) -- The Ottawa gunman had ""connections"" to jihadists in Canada who shared a radical Islamist ideology, including at least one who went overseas to fight in Syria, multiple U.S. sources told CNN on Thursday. However, Canadian Foreign Minister John Baird told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that there is ""no evidence at this stage"" that Michael Zehaf-Bibeau was linked to a wider group, or network, of jihadists. ""There's no evidence at this stage for us to know that. Obviously there's an investigation going on, and we hope to learn more in the ... coming days. It was clear that, police authorities now have announced, that he was acting alone yesterday,"" he said. According to two U.S. counterterrorism officials, Zehaf-Bibeau was connected to Hasibullah Yusufzai through social media. Yusufzai is wanted by Canadian authorities for traveling overseas to fight alongside Islamist fighters in Syria, The Globe and Mail, a Canadian newspaper, reported. The sources said the two communicated via social media and the Internet, but it does not appear they were close. Early indications are that Zehaf-Bibeau's connections to other extremists were ""interactions"" online, including extremist sites, a different U.S. source said. The activity was ""attenuated,"" or limited, the source said, noting it appears, so far, that Zehaf-Bibeau had a low profile. There is no evidence so far that he had any ""operational links"" to other jihadists, according to the source, who drew a distinction between interacting online and plotting an attack. American officials are reportedly scouring databases and communications for possible links to American-based jihadists. Other radicalized people connected to Zehaf-Bibeau are still believed to be living in Canada, U.S. law enforcement officials said. ""The investigation is ongoing and will rapidly determine if Zehaf-Bibeau received any support in the planning of his attack,"" Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner Bob Paulson told reporters Thursday. Officials now have ""information that suggests an association with some individuals who may have shared his radical views,"" he said. Paulson didn't say who these people are or how Zehaf-Bibeau may have interacted with them. The gunman . Authorities are still in the early stages of their investigation, but they are beginning to piece together the puzzle. They released surveillance video Thursday that shows events on Wednesday. In the footage, a vehicle pulls up near Parliament, and a man exits, running with a large gun as people run from him. In other footage, this same man then gets into another vehicle, drives to a nearby building, gets out and runs armed into the building pursued by law enforcement. Baird, in a Thursday night interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN, described the chaos inside the building, saying Zehaf-Bibeau ""ran right by the room where the entire government caucus was. We could hear the ringing out of rifle fire and then the huge amount of semiautomatic noise. ""We didn't know if the door would be banged open and that we'd all be sprayed,"" he said. Baird said the sergeant-at-arms of the House of Commons shot and killed Zehaf-Bibeau at the door to the library, which contained a tourist group as well as employees. ""You could have seen more than a dozen killed if he (the sergeant-at-arms) hadn't taken such quick action,"" Baird said. Zehaf-Bibeau was a Canadian citizen who may have had dual Libyan-Canadian citizenship, said Paulson. The police commissioner said Zehaf-Bibeau was born in Montreal and lived in Calgary and most recently Vancouver. Zehaf-Bibeau had been in the Canadian capital since at least October 2 ""to deal with a passport issue and ... he was also hoping to leave for Syria,"" Paulson said. Paulson also said of Zehaf-Bibeau: ""According to some accounts, he was an individual who may have held extremist beliefs."" Zehaf-Bibeau was applying for a passport -- an application that was under investigation -- at the time of the attack, but had not had his passport revoked, as has been previously reported, Paulson said. ""I think the passport figured prominently in his motives,"" said the police commissioner. ""However, we have not come to ground completely on his motivations for this attack. But clearly, it's linked to his radicalization. Clearly, it's linked to his difficult circumstances."" According to Paulson, investigators thus far have not found any connection between Zehaf-Bibeau and Martin Rouleau Couture -- who authorities say ran down and killed a Canadian soldier in Quebec on Monday. Police later killed Couture. Who was Ottawa shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau? Zehaf-Bibeau was born as Michael Joseph Hall in 1982. He had criminal records indicating infractions related to drugs and violence and other criminal activities, Paulson said. In a pre-trial psychiatric evaluation performed in 2011, a doctor noted Zehaf-Bibeau at that time had been ""a devoted Muslim for seven years."" The gunman's mother, Susan Bibeau, spoke to The Associated Press by phone. She struggled to hold back tears and said she didn't know what to say to those hurt in the attack. ""If I'm crying, it's for the people,"" Bibeau reportedly said. ""Not for my son."" ""I'm mad at my son,"" she said in a separate email to the AP. Harper: ""We will not run scared' Canadian lawmakers returned to work Thursday, giving a standing ovation to the ceremonial Parliament official credited with taking down the gunman who killed a soldier and shook the Parliament area. ""We'll be vigilant, but we will not run scared. We will be prudent, but we will not panic. And as for the business of government, well, here we are -- in our seats, in our chamber, in the very heart of our democracy,"" Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper told the House of Commons in Ottawa. Lawmakers stood and cheered Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers, who officials say took down the suspect in the halls of Parliament minutes after the killing of Canadian army reservist Cpl. Nathan Cirillo at a war memorial nearby. Vickers, who regularly leads a procession into the House as sessions begin, stood with his ceremonial mace and appeared to be emotional during the ovation. He later released a statement saying he is touched by the attention. ""However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,"" Vickers said. It was a step toward normalcy for a government district that was widely locked down for hours after the shootings at Canada's National War Memorial and Parliament Hill. Authorities say Zehaf-Bibeau shot and killed Cirillo, who was standing guard at the war memorial on Wednesday morning. The gunman then entered the nearby main Parliament building in downtown Ottawa, where witnesses say shots were fired -- many by security officers -- before he was shot dead. A plainclothes constable who was working security at Parliament was shot in the leg, according to a House of Commons official briefed on the investigation. The injury is not life-threatening, and the constable was treated at a hospital and released, the official said on condition of anonymity. The shootings left government workers and others locked inside offices for a large portion of the day while police searched buildings to ensure that no other culprit was loose. Wednesday's deadly attack was the second on Canadian soldiers this week. On Monday, Couture, a convert to Islam who Canadian authorities said was ""radicalized"" hit two soldiers with a car in Quebec, killing one of them, before he was killed. Lawmakers pay respects to soldier . There was an incident Thursday morning as the Prime Minister and his wife were laying a wreath, in memory of Cirillo. An eyewitness said a man began yelling. He reached into his jacket, then pulled out a white scarf, and wrapped it around his face. About a dozen police ran towards him, the eyewitness said. The Prime Minister and his wife had intended to stay longer, but his security team surrounded them and quickly ushered them out. ""He's lucky he wasn't shot,"" the eyewitness said of the man. The man was apprehended at the scene. Jim Cirillo, Nathan Cirillo's uncle, told CBC News that Cirillo's father is in Costa Rica and might not yet know about his son's death. ""I don't know if life is fair,"" Jim Cirillo, said his voice breaking with emotion. ""He didn't deserve that. I don't know how someone could have picked him out and just did that."" Before Parliament reopened, lawmakers gathered outside the memorial -- some holding flowers -- for a moment of silence for Cirillo. ""This was very off the cuff,"" lawmaker Charlie Angus told CNN on Thursday morning. ""I think parliamentarians really just felt that before we walked into the Parliament buildings, we had to pay respect to a young man who gave his life for his country."" Angus said the soldiers' killings this week left the government with plenty of questions. ""The questions we need to ask ourselves (include), 'How are these people getting this crazy ideology that's inspiring them to do these copycat killings?' "" he said. Another question, he said: What can society do to deal with people who find themselves on the fringes? Issues of mental health, he said, need to be addressed. ""We cannot let people like this fall through the cracks and end up doing deranged killings,"" Angus said. CNN's Ashley Fantz, Josh Levs, Catherine E. Shoichet, John Newsome, Pamela Brown, Greg Botelho, Elise Labott, Jim Sciutto, Pam Brown, Andrea Lewis, Ana Cabrera and Deb Feyerick contributed to this report.","Michael Zehaf-Bibeau had not had his passport revoked, as previously reported .

Hidden in the humid green forests of Iran's northern Gilan province is Rudkhan Castle, a medieval military fortress whose origins predate the rise of Islam in Iran. Few foreign tourists have visited the site, which is a popular attraction among Iranians. Work started on the castle during the Persian Sassanid era, between A.D. 224 and 651. Followers of the Ismaili sect (the infamous ""Assassins"" or ""Hashashin"") are believed to have renovated and completed the fortress during the late 11th to 12th centuries. The hike up to the castle, which is situated along two peaks of a verdant mountain, takes more than an hour, prompting many locals to call Rudkhan the ""Castle of a Thousand Steps."" After you've made the trek back down, it's worth stopping off for food on the drive back on the main highway toward Rasht, the capital of Gilan province. Try a northern Iranian lunch at the exquisite Pich restaurant (Pich Restaurant, Rasht to Anzali Highway, Khomam Beltway; +98 132 422 7554; Pichrestaurant@yahoo.com.) The ""Torsh"" kabob -- tenderloin marinated in pomegranate paste, walnuts and garlic -- is a particularly appetizing regional specialty. Bekhradi Historical House . This 400-year-old inn built in Persia's Safavid era features four tastefully decorated multiroomed guest suites and is the oldest house to be restored in Iran. Its renovation and artistic restoration took local interior designer and restoration specialist Morteza Bekhradi five years to engineer and complete. Peppered with stained-glass windows and original artwork from the Safavid and subsequent Qajar eras, the house sits between two gardens replete with fruits and wildflowers. The house's furniture was designed by Bekhradi using wood from the chenar (plane) trees that line the streets and historic gardens of Isfahan. The designer says he sought to stay true to the setup of the original home, which he says is believed to have belonged to a Safavid-era aristocrat. Even the traditional heavy Iranian wooden doors lining the entryways of the upstairs suites belonged to the original house and were restored using chenar wood. Doors throughout the rest of the historical residence, which boasts an intricately decorated traditional ""hojreh"" room for cooling and relaxation, are chenar-wood replicas of Safavid originals. To date, most guests have discovered the inn only by word of mouth, and even local Isfahanis are only just beginning to learn about this hidden gem. Bekhradi Historical House, 56, Sonbolestan Alley, Ebn-e-Sina St, Shohada Sq, Isfahan; +98 31 34482072 . Soltaniyeh Dome . A UNESCO World Heritage site in the northwestern province of Zanjan, the mausoleum of Oljaytu at Soltaniyeh is topped by one of the world's largest domes. Built between 1302 and 1312 in Soltaniyeh, the capital city of the Mongols' Ilkhanid Dynasty, the monument is a mausoleum for Il-khan Oljeitu, the Ilkhanid's eighth ruler. Though much of the structure's exterior coloring and tiles have faded through the centuries, the intricate brickwork, tilework and vibrant designs inside the mausoleum have remained largely unscathed. The unique double-shelled structure of the Soltaniyeh Dome is also believed to have influenced the design of India's Taj Mahal mausoleum. Interesting factoid: Oljeitu was born to a Christian mother and baptized as Nicholas. He later became Buddhist and then converted to Islam. He intended for the Soltaniyeh Dome to house religious artifacts, but after clerics banned him from doing so, he decided to make the monument his own tomb. Visits to the dome are worth sidetracking to Zanjan for a lunch of classic Iranian dizi, or lamb and chickpea soup, at Carvansarai Sangi (Zanjan, Iran; +98 241 326 1266), an ancient pit stop that's been converted into a popular local restaurant. Laleh Kandovan Rocky Hotel . About 30 miles outside the northwestern city of Tabriz lies the troglodyte village of Kandovan. People here live in cone-shaped caves cut out of volcanic rock at the foot of Mount Sahand, a dormant volcano. Nestled within the 800-year-old village, the Laleh Kandovan Rocky Hotel has been literally hand-carved into the rocky landscape, with each of the luxury hotel's 16 modernized rooms encompassing a cave, or ""karaan."" According to local lore, mineral water sourced from Mount Sahand, long valued throughout Iran for its medicinal properties, originated in the biblical Garden of Eden. Guests of the hotel can take a relaxing soak in this precious liquid. If there's a spa tub in the room, the mineral water gets pumped in directly. Laleh Kandovan Rocky Hotel, Kandovan Rd, Kandovan; + 98 412 323 0191 . Toghrol Tower . Toghrol Tower is a Seljuk-era monument situated in the city of Rey, on the southern outskirts of Iran's capital city, Tehran. Often overlooked by visitors who tend to stick to the higher-income northern and central areas of the Iranian capital, Rey is the oldest county in Tehran province and is speckled with historical monuments, including a 500-year-old Safavid-era bazaar. The tower is said to serve as the mausoleum for Seljuk king Toghrol Beg, who established Rey as a major administrative center of the Seljuk Dynasty until its destruction by Mongol armies in the early 13th century. From the tower, it's a quick ride into the heart of Tehran's Armenian quarter to round off the trip with a cup of coffee and Armenian pastries at the historic Cafe Naderi (Hotel Naderi and Cafe, Jomhuri Eslami Avenue, Tehran; +98 21 66 701 872), a haunt frequented for decades by Iran's greatest writers and intellectuals.

"(CNN)  -- A prosecutor is dropping a charge against prominent Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. after Cambridge, Massachusetts, and the city's police department recommended that the matter not be pursued. Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested last week on a charge of disorderly conduct. In a joint statement, Cambridge and the police department said they made the recommendation to the Middlesex County district attorney and the district attorney's office ""has agreed to enter a nolle prosequi in this matter,"" meaning that it will not be pursued. Gates was arrested last week on a charge of disorderly conduct after a confrontation with an officer at his home, according to a Cambridge police report. Charles Ogletree, a professor at Harvard Law School who is Gates' lawyer in this case, told CNN on Tuesday that Gates -- the director of Harvard's W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African American Research -- had returned from China on Thursday to his Cambridge home and discovered his front door jammed. He opened his back door with his key and tried unsuccessfully from inside his home to open the front door. Eventually, Gates and his driver forced the door open from the outside, Ogletree said. The professor was inside for several minutes when a police officer, Sgt. James Crowley, appeared at his steps and asked him to step outside, the lawyer said. According to his lawyer, Gates told the officer he lived there and showed him his Massachusetts driver's license and Harvard University identification card. The officer followed him into his house and said he had received a report of a possible break-in, the lawyer said. Gates grew frustrated that the officer was continuing to question him in his home and asked for the officer's name and badge number, Ogletree said. The police report offers a different account of the incident. Gates refused to step outside to speak with the officer, the police report said, and when Crowley told Gates that he was investigating a possible break-in, Gates opened the front door and exclaimed, ""Why, because I'm a black man in America?"" the report said. ""While I was led to believe that Gates was lawfully in the residence, I was quite surprised and confused with the behavior he exhibited toward me,"" he said, according to the report. The report said Gates initially refused to show the officer identification, but eventually produced a Harvard identification card, prompting Crowley to radio for Harvard University Police. Gates followed the officer outside and continued to accuse him of racial bias, the report said. After Crowley warned the professor twice that he was becoming disorderly, the officer wrote he arrested Gates for ""loud and tumultuous behavior in a public space."" Ogletree said the professor was ""very frustrated"" but never touched or pointed at the officer. He was released from police custody Thursday evening after spending four hours at the police station, Ogletree said.","NEW: Police ask for disorderly conduct charged to be dropped .

"(CNN) -- Atlanta Hawks majority owner Bruce Levenson just figured out how to get rid of a product that no one wants to purchase by throwing himself on the confessional table of bigotry -- which will probably make him more wealthy than he could have ever imagined. Sure, the publicity isn't flattering, and Levenson's hand may have been forced by the Hawks' internal investigation. But this is not about racism, this is about business. What we know . I've lived in Atlanta for close to 20 years -- the Hawks games are boring! I can't name the players. I don't know who they are married to or what they do in the community. They are not a fabric of my interest. I wish they had a star player whose jersey I wanted to buy so I could finally hang my Dominique Wilkins jersey up as memorabilia. This is not about racism, this is about business. So, like all other non-Atlanta natives living in Atlanta long term, when the Hawks play the New York Knicks, this native New Yorker whips out her Carmelo Anthony jersey and heads to Phillips Arena. The reason Bruce Levenson could not make the Hawks profitable is not because black people don't buy season tickets, or arrive at games late, or spend all their time at the bar, or black fathers don't bring black sons to the games. It's because the Hawks suck. They have no marquee players and they don't win games! (Yes, they've made the playoffs in the past seven years, but haven't gotten as far as the conference finals.) This is not about racism, this is about business. The few years that the Hawks have made it to the playoffs, you can hardly make it down Centennial Olympic Drive in time for tip-off because the traffic is so thick. Fans, white and black, show up when their hometown team is winning. Period. This is not about racism, this is about business. Opinion: Atlanta Hawks owner is a hypocrite . Are there unique factors to every city that accounts for distinctions between fan bases? Sure. New Orleans, Memphis, New York and Boston fans show up -- even when their teams are not having a winning season. Those cities are not as transient as Atlanta. That's something Bruce Levenson fails to realize is unique to Atlanta. This is not about racism, this is about business. Bruce Levenson's 2012 email, in which he shared his ideas about why his franchise was not as profitable as he hoped, as unscientific as it was, can hardly be called shocking or rise to the level of racially polarizing. It was another wealthy white man sharing his commonly thought views on the spending habits or lack thereof of black consumers and how that affects white consumers, who white business executives consider the most valued consumer in America. This is not about racism, this is about business. I was slightly annoyed with NBA Commissioner Adam Silver commending Mr. Levenson for coming forward and self-reporting. Levenson revealed his email of August 2012 to Silver in July 2014, after the Hawks found it in an internal investigation and precisely the time that investigators for Donald Sterling were looking to expose other NBA owners for any possible racial missteps. It's no coincidence that an NBA investigation on this Levenson matter was kept secret and remained pending until the Sterling deal became final. Why are we just now hearing about it? Silver knew, yet he didn't reveal it to the public. Racism has never been as profitable in the NBA as it is right now in the wake of the historic $2 billion sale of the Clippers, the almost doubling of national television deals that are sure to bring record profits to the league, and the identification of interested purchasers lined up and ready to close the deals. Bruce Levenson is a businessman following the business model: Strike while the iron is hot. Buy low. Sell high. This is not about racism, this is about business.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Muslim and Jewish groups on Monday sharply criticized Sen. John McCain's comments that he would prefer a Christian president to lead the United States. The Arizona Republican's remarks came in an interview with Beliefnet, a Web site that covers religious issues and affairs. ""I just have to say in all candor that since this nation was founded primarily on Christian principles, personally, I prefer someone who has a grounding in my faith,"" the GOP presidential hopeful told the Web site in an interview published Saturday. McCain also said he agreed with a recent poll that 55 percent of Americans believe the U.S. Constitution establishes a Christian nation. ""I would probably have to say yes, that the Constitution established the United States of America as a Christian nation,"" he said. On Sunday night, McCain sought to clarify his remarks while campaigning in Hollis, New Hampshire. ""What I do mean to say is the United States of America was founded on the values of Judeo-Christian values, which were translated by our founding fathers which is basically the rights of human dignity and human rights,"" he said. ""I believe that anyone can be president of the United States of any faith,"" McCain said, saying he was angry his remarks were misinterpreted but ""there's nothing I can do about it."" Ibrahim Hooper, spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said McCain's comments failed to recognize that Christianity is not the only faith with beliefs that support the concept of human rights. ""Sorry, Islam and other faiths have their basis in human dignity,"" Hooper said. McCain's remarks also ""go against the traditions of American pluralism and religious pluralism and inclusion,"" Hooper said. Hooper's organization, a Washington-based Islamic civil rights and advocacy group, said it's trying to organize a group of Muslim leaders to meet with McCain. The National Jewish Democratic Council, an advocacy group representing Jewish Democrats, also called on the Republican Party to denounce the remarks formally. ""Former maverick John McCain's statements were repugnant,"" the group's executive director, Ira N. Forman, said in a statement.  ""It's been sad watching him transform from political maverick to religious right mouthpiece."" Forman added, ""Someone running for president ought to understand the Constitution a little better. Nowhere does it say the United States is a 'Christian' nation. How can we trust someone to uphold the Constitution who doesn't even know what is in it?"" McCain's communication director, Jill Hazelbaker, issued a statement Sunday defending her candidate's comments: ""Read in context, his interview with Beliefnet makes clear that people of all faiths are entitled to all the rights protected by the Constitution, including the right to practice their religion freely. ""In the interview he also observed that the values protected by the Constitution, by which he meant values such as respect for human life and dignity, are rooted in the Judeo-Christian tradition. That is all he intended to say to the question, America is a Christian nation, and it is hardly a controversial claim."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- It was the perfect summer day for a wedding. The bride was glowing. The groom was handsome. For nine hours, Tiffany Burke photographed the memorable moments. ""I took one break for 15 minutes, to eat really quickly,"" Burke recalled. ""You don't want to miss the shots; that's what you are paid for."" Later that night, she pulled into the driveway of her Bellingham, Washington, home. She walked inside, put down her gear and ran to the bathroom. ""I just started puking and puking and puking,"" she said. ""I was just grateful that I hadn't puked at the wedding or on the bride."" Burke is six months pregnant. She's already had two children. But this time, she's carrying a baby for someone else. Surrogate sisters: The ultimate gift . Her past pregnancies were relatively easy. She did have morning sickness with both her sons: Holland, 7, and Blake, 3. This time, it's more severe. She is sick most days, all day. Anti-nausea medicine helps, but only to a point. Sleep is the only thing that makes her feel better. There are many days the 31-year-old stays in bed until 2 p.m. ""I have my off days, where I am crying a lot. In fact, I may start crying again right now,"" she said. ""But I would totally do it again."" Family ties . About two hours south of Bellingham, Natalie Lucich lives with her husband, James. James is Tiffany Burke's brother. Natalie and James met on a blind date, fell in love and got married in 2008. Lucich got pregnant within the first month of trying. She had an easy pregnancy, and she was thrilled when her son Hunter was born in 2010. ""He was the perfect mix of both of us,"" she recalls on her family's blog, which they've been using to share their journey. ""Those huge eyes melted my heart."" After nurses whisked Hunter away to clean him up and check his vitals, a doctor began stitching Natalie up. But an hour and three packs of thread later, she was still bleeding. Concerned, the doctor pushed on Lucich's uterus. It wouldn't contract. The pain was unbearable. She blacked out. She was losing blood quickly. Lucich needed emergency surgery. The highs and lows of foreign surrogacy . ""I prayed two things before they began,"" she wrote. ""I prayed that I would make it through safely for my husband and my son and that they would put me under because the pain was so horrible I didn't think I could handle any more."" James and her dad were by Lucich's side when she woke up after surgery. Unable to talk because she still had a breathing tube, she scribbled a note. ""Were you scared?"" she asked. ""Did they take my uterus?"" James told her the bad news. To save her life, doctors removed it. Lucich wrote another note. ""It's OK. We can adopt."" It took a week for the news to set in. Lucich could have no more children naturally. Her dream had always been to have three. She was crushed. A few days later, Burke headed over to the Luciches' house to take pictures of the new family. Lucich confided how conflicted she felt: She was grateful for Hunter but also mourning the loss of the children she would never have. Lucich mentioned to Burke that she still had her eggs. She and James were considering using a gestational surrogate. An embryo, created in a Petri dish from Natalie's egg and James' sperm, would be implanted in the surrogate mother. None of the surrogate's DNA is involved. ""I was pissed!"" Burke recalled. She was worried: What if the surrogate drank or smoked or did something to harm herself? She didn't want the Luciches to take that chance. Suddenly, Burke blurted out, ""I'll do it!"" Embarrassed, she immediately covered her mouth and apologized. Lucich looked at her. ""I thought you didn't want any more children, you were done being pregnant."" ""Yes,"" Burke responded, ""we don't want any more natural children of our own ... but I have this perfectly good uterus!"" They hugged and cried and cracked jokes about Burke carrying her brother's baby. But by the end of the visit, the sisters-in-law decided to talk with their husbands. What did they think about Burke helping Lucich become a mom again? For weeks, both couples weighed the pros and the cons. Could Natalie and James afford it? It would cost them about $35,000. Were there any health risks to Burke? After all, as they knew from Lucich's experience, pregnancy isn't without risk. Finally, what about the emotional toll? ""I remember thinking, what if I didn't want to give up the baby?"" Burke said. Four months later, all of them were ready to move forward. Burke would help James and Natalie expand their family. Overheard: Surrogacy is not the same as incest . Taking the next step . Experts say gestational surrogacy is growing slowly and steadily. According to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technologies, 1,448 babies were reported conceived via gestational surrogacy in 2010 and carried to full term.   There are no statistics on relationships between carriers and the intended parents. Burke and Lucich contacted Seattle Reproductive Medicine, a medical practice that specializes in fertility issues. Even though they were family, both couples had to hire attorneys and negotiate a contract that address a wide range of questions, from who would pay for Burke's doctors visits (the Luciches) to the legal process for James and Natalie to take custody of the child. In Washington state, it is illegal to pay for a surrogate's services. Both couples also had to undergo a psychological evaluation to make sure they were prepared emotionally to go through the process. It took eight months from the time they decided to do it until the first embryos were implanted. Finally, in January, Natalie's eggs were mixed with James' sperm. Then two embryos were implanted in Burke. That round didn't take. The next one did. Both couples were elated. ""I could not be more honored or more excited to be able to carry their child,"" Burke wrote in the family's blog. ""I have also found new strength and support from my amazing husband, Sean. I know I could not do this without him. My love for him grows more and more each day."" Burke and James Lucich were both adopted at birth, and are not related by blood to each other. Burke wrote on her website that she would have served as a surrogate for a biological brother too. Surrogate mom strives for organic living . Then in April, a surprise. ""When the nurse first started the scan, she knew right away there were two sacs. We were able to see the little heart beats of each one and we were all instantly crying,"" Burke wrote on the blog. An ultrasound showed that she was carrying two boys. ""They always say God has a greater plan than you could ever imagine ... well, He has far surpassed that. James and I couldn't be happier,"" Lucich added. It was around the same time that some unexpected realities set in. Burke started getting sick and was exhausted all the time. That made it hard for her to work. It also meant the majority of the housework, cooking and child care ended up falling to Sean, an aspiring filmmaker. Sean Burke is quick to point out that the Luciches and others help as they can but admits it's still difficult. ""It's been hard; I've been quite stressed out through this process,"" Sean Burke said. It's also been a strain on his budding career. ""My career is just starting to kick off, and I've had to slow down a bit on that, and that's been tough."" Burke also feels guilty that she's missing this time with her boys. Her 7-year-old son, Holland, has especially been affected. ""I think sometimes that I want to help her a little bit. ... I just don't want her to be sick, really,"" he said. Recently, things have been turning around. Burke has begun feeling better. She isn't getting sick as much. ""I feel like a human about two to four hours a day,"" she said. On a recent afternoon, Burke felt well enough to take her sons clothes shopping and, as a special treat, to Toys R Us to pick out a toy and then out to dinner. The babies are due in December. ""I'm excited for the boys to be here, to see what they're like and for them to be with James and Natalie ... but in a selfish way, I am also looking forward to being done,"" she said. Still, she has no regrets. ""These babies wouldn't exist if it weren't for this tough decision. There are a lot of new challenges I wasn't aware of, but I kind of think that's life, too. You kind of sign up for some things, and you hope you're strong enough to handle it, and hopefully you are. And hopefully, I am."" Best friend becomes surrogate mother .

"(CNN) -- The generation of gays and lesbians that literally created the modern LGBT movement -- from the heroes of the 1969 Stonewall riots to their slightly younger friends -- is at, or nearing, retirement age. That used to mean the beginning of an extremely difficult time in an LGBT person's life. But as gay baby boomers find more acceptance in mainstream society and continue to do what they've always done -- push to make a better world for the LGBT community -- their retirement options are slowly improving. That is, if they decide to retire at all. ""The notion of retirement has never been a part of my vocabulary,"" said Bob Witeck, CEO and co-founder of Witeck Communications. Nearly 61, Witeck has put some thought into what he should do with his strategic public relations and marketing firm as he gets older. Like many friends his age who are also entrepreneurs, he plans to keep working. ""Because I run a business, as I get older I can change the intensity of my engagement in the kinds of work I take on,"" Witeck said. ""I know I'm lucky that way, and I'm lucky in my personal life as well. My husband is 50, so I have a younger man to help me if I need it,"" he said, laughing. For decades, according to published studies and reports, many LGBT seniors entered into a kind of dangerous isolation, because the majority did not have children or spouses to help care for them. Even if they did have the benefit of a partner to help as their health declined, they faced extra burdens their straight counterparts did not have. Without federal marriage equality, gay couples -- no matter how long they've been together -- cannot inherit each other's Social Security benefits, even if they were legally married in the handful of states that allow it. They can be designated as the beneficiaries of each other's retirement savings, but must pay inheritance taxes that straight widows and widowers do not. In order to make health care decisions on behalf of an incapacitated partner, gay couples must pay additional legal fees to be granted medical power of attorney. Historically, nothing could stop a hospital or nursing home from forbidding a gay person from visiting their partner, and openly gay people often faced discrimination from health care providers, according to the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force report, ""Outing Age 2010."" Consequently, many LGBT seniors ended up going back into the closet as their declining health and mobility left them dependent on strangers for help, according to a study conducted by the National Senior Citizens Law Center, Lambda Legal and others. Or they were slow to ask for help -- even if they badly needed it. ""When you put that together -- the absence of adult children and a partner to help, and add barriers to accessing services, and limit the financial means others have -- then this very thin network of support breaks at exactly the wrong time, right when there is an increasing need for services,"" said Michael Adams, executive director of the group Services & Advocacy for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual & Transgender Elders, known as SAGE. Read more: Growing old openly gay . Roll of the dice . Witeck said his retirement plans and those of his friends are nothing like those of their fathers' generation. ""My father was of the generation that thought you put in your time and then you just take off the rest, and many could afford to do it,"" Witeck said. ""He had absolutely no plans and had a generous pension."" His father worked on Capitol Hill for a couple of decades, Witeck said, and was able to retire at 60. He lived another 27 years. ""Over time he did get a little discouraged because he felt like he didn't have a purpose, but that's what the people he knew did,"" Witeck said. ""They just abruptly stopped working. I can tell you, that won't be me."" He has, however, seen some friends whose plans to continue working have been derailed by health problems. ""I do know, as we age, our health can fail, and I've seen it with some friends who aren't as sharp as they once were. So I know it's a roll of the dice on how long we can keep working,"" he said. ""Hopefully I can stay healthy and won't need the help."" But often retirement-age people do need help, and that has not always been easy for the LGBT community. ""There is no question we are making a lot of progress in this area, and we've absolutely been helped along by the emergence of boomers into retirement years, but by the very nature of the enormity of this work, true change will take years,"" Adams said. His organization, SAGE, has been working to change the situation for older LGBT people since 1978. Much has changed for the community since then, he said. ""Especially since the Obama administration took office,"" Adams said. ""The federal approach to aging issues has improved."" While there still isn't federal recognition of marriage for gay couples, the federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 allowed a rollover option to nonspousal beneficiaries. That meant people could leave their pensions to anyone without a tax penalty. In the past, only married spouses were eligible for that benefit. In 2010, Obama issued a memorandum requiring all hospitals receiving Medicare or Medicaid funds -- nearly every hospital in the United States -- to respect the right of all patients to choose who may visit them during a hospital stay, including a same-sex domestic partner. The president also directed the Department of Health and Human Services to help ensure that medical decision-making rights of LGBT patients are respected. This year the Administration on Aging -- the federal agency responsible for funding programs that help the elderly -- finally issued guidance saying agencies and programs it funds should recognize the LGBT population among those with ""the greatest social need."" That designation means that there should be more financial backing and programs to help elderly gay people. The Administration on Aging spends more than $2.3 billion annually on nutrition and social services for the aging, according to Adams, but the LGBT community only sees $2 million of that. Finally, Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colorado, introduced the LGBT Elder Americans Act this year. If enacted, it would further boost support for the community. As it is written now, the Older Americans Act, which goes up for reauthorization every five years, does not specifically mention LGBT older adults. Among the LGBT Elder Americans Act's proposals is an amendment that would permanently establish the National Resource Center on LGBT Aging, which would provide training to providers of services to the elderly around the country. It would also require long-term care ombudsmen to collect data relating to discrimination against LGBT older adults. Creating gay-friendly facilities . On the local level, however, everything may not be as rosy. ""While the laws have become more accepting of marriage equality of the LGBT community and nondiscrimination policies in a broader sense are more inclusive, that doesn't mean people who work with the elderly automatically become more accepting,"" said Laurie Young, director of aging and economic security with the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. ""There is often high turnover in nursing home staff and a lack of professionalism,"" she said. ""Sometimes even the leadership will get it (being inclusive of LGBT people), but it doesn't get passed on to the people working with the LGBT community."" Several organizations, such as the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and SAGE, have made training the staffs of senior centers, nursing homes and assisted living facilities a priority. They want those workers to become more sensitive in their work with gay people, particularly because members of the baby boomer generation are more likely to be open about their sexuality than previous generations. ""LGBT people want to experience the services and programs that exist for all older people,"" Adams said. ""So our work has shifted to try and bring along aging and health service organizations so they're as accessible as possible to the LGBT community."" SAGE, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force and other groups also train ombudsmen to intervene if an LGBT person comes forward with a complaint. They encourage facilities to create more gay-friendly paperwork, so instead of requesting the name of a husband or wife, the forms include space for a spouse or partner. Even changing the decorations can help. ""These changes don't have to cost a lot,"" Young said. ""We've talked about something as simple as having photos in the lobby of the senior center or nursing home that are more reflective of a broader population -- anything to signal that the space is more welcoming."" Even in the short time that SAGE has been conducting its training, it has seen a difference, Adams said. ""In the past few years we started to notice a real change in the reception of our calls,"" he said. ""We used to reach out to these organizations and hear, 'Oh, we don't have any gay people using our services,' and occasionally we'd have even hostile responses. Now our offers to help have been increasingly met with a desire on the part of these service providers to do a better job working with LGBT folks."" Witeck said he hopes he will never need those support services, but if he does, he's confident his generation will continue to make them more accessible to the LGBT community.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Hi, I'm Carl Azuz. In today's edition of CNN Student News, we're breaking down a debate over part of the Bill of Rights. First, though, a White House welcome. First Up: Presidential Visit . AZUZ: That's first lady Michelle Obama and President Barack Obama officially welcoming Chinese President Hu Jintao to the White House. This ceremony happened yesterday morning. President Hu was met by several top U.S. officials as well as a military honor guard. Kicked off a day of meetings between the two leaders. During a news conference later in the day, the Chinese president said his country and the U.S. ""share broad common interests and important common responsibilities."" One of those common interests: the global economy. We want you to have a look at this online interactive from CNN Money. This is a list of the largest economies in 2010. When you rank them by size, like they are here, you can see that the U.S. is number one, more than twice the size of China, which is number two. But when you rank these world economies by how much they grew in 2010, watch what happens. China moves to number one; it grew more than 10 percent last year. And the U.S. isn't even on that list. With China's economy getting bigger, some people think it's important for other countries -- like the U.S. -- to learn more about Chinese culture. There are some school programs doing exactly that. But as Chris Welch explains, there's some concern about who's paying for these programs. (BEGIN VIDEO) CHRIS WELCH, CNN ALL-PLATFORM JOURNALIST: In this class, it's easy to forget you're in suburban Ohio. Teachers are prepping kids for an increasingly global economy, one that will inevitably involve China, the world's second largest economy. ANDREW ALDIS, CHINESE LANGUAGE STUDENT: I think it's very valuable to learn a language that a lot of people in the U.S. will speak in the future and certainly is huge in business. WELCH: The school hosts visiting teachers from China, and they're planning a student trip to the nation this summer. It's funded in part by the Chinese government. This school will get $30,000. By and large, the school's endeavor is being received with open arms. But that said, not everyone's ready to embrace a warm and fuzzy relationship with China. The Hacienda Le Puente School District outside Los Angeles was poised to receive similar funds from the Chinese government, but community members weren't comfortable with what they call ""communist propaganda"" in the hands of elementary students. Back in Ohio, administrators say the Chinese government has no say in what the school teaches. But students and faculty say anti-Chinese sentiment still shows up. As a teacher, do you ever hear people say, ""I don't want my kids learning Chinese because that's a communist country""? CHIWEI LIN, CHINESE TEACHER: Yes. I do. WELCH: Ohio State Professor Oded Shenkar specializes in China. ODED SHENKAR, OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY: I don't think they're going to go on record, or going to go through the school and, you know, let's teach you how to form a communist cell. You know, that's not going to happen. But there are subtle things. WELCH: Subtle things, he says, like a visiting teacher from China potentially overstepping bounds. This school says, bottom line, opening a dialogue between the two nations is a good place to start. Chris Welch, CNN, Gahanna, Ohio. (END VIDEO) Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What U.S. constitutional amendment addresses the right to bear arms? If you think you know it, then shout it out! Is it the: A) 2nd Amendment, B) 5th Amendment, C) 16th Amendment or D) 23rd Amendment? You've got three seconds -- GO! That right is covered in the Second Amendment, and it's led to a lot of debate. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! The Second Amendment . AZUZ: Okay, as promised, we're turning our attention to the Bill of Rights and specifically the Second Amendment. This is an amendment that has been debated for decades, and that debate gets a lot of attention after an event like the shooting in Tucson, Arizona. But to understand what the disagreement is over, you've gotta first understand exactly what the amendment says: ""A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."" So, does this mean that a militia or the people should have guns? Ah, there's the rub. Many supporters of gun control look to the first part of the amendment for their argument. Their view: this amendment protects the right of a militia, like the National Guard, to have guns, but not necessarily everyone else. So, this is an interpretation that effectively limits who can carry a firearm. People who support gun rights generally look to the second part of the Second Amendment, the part that says ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms."" Their view: This amendment protects individuals' rights to have guns. So, this interpretation suggests non-military citizens should be free to have firearms. Now, here's where the legislative and judicial systems come in. Congress has passed laws that limit who can get or transport guns. But the Supreme Court has mostly left the issue of gun control for states to decide. I say ""mostly"" because it did make a decision last year that basically said this: The Second Amendment guarantees that individuals may have guns, and that guarantee must factor in to state laws. Is This Legit? JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Bats are the only animals that use echolocation, a process of using sound to locate objects. Not legit! Some birds, whales and dolphins use this process, as well. Dolphin Echolocation . AZUZ: I always remember studying echolocation in association with dolphins. You might be familiar with echolocation by another name, though: sonar. It's pretty much the same thing. You send out these sound waves, and when they bounce off of objects, the reflection of the waves tells you -- or in this case, the animal -- where the objects are. We're gonna take it to John Zarrella, now, who takes us to the Florida Keys, where researchers are putting some dolphins' echolocation skills to the test. (BEGIN VIDEO) JOHN ZARRELLA, CNN MIAMI BUREAU CHIEF AND CORRESPONDENT: Say hello to Tanner. EMILY GUARINO, TANNER'S TRAINER: Hi, buddy. Look who's here. Good morning. Hi, handsome. ZARRELLA: The 8-year-old bottlenose dolphin is not only a good-looking dude, he's also really smart. GUARINO: All right, Tanner. Let's show them what echolocation looks like. ZARRELLA: Trainer Emily Guarino throws a ring out in the water with cups over his eyes so he can't see. Tanner, using his echolocation, his underwater sonar, finds and retrieves the ring. That's pretty cool, right? Well, at the Dolphin Research Center in the Florida Keys, scientists have found dolphins' smarts... GUARINO: Really blew us away. ZARRELLA: ...Go way beyond ring retrieval. GUARINO: Monkey see, monkey do; that's a myth. It turns out that the animal best able to imitate other than humans is the dolphin. ZARRELLA: For their study, Tanner was paired with another dolphin. Here, it's Kibby. The trainer gives Tanner the hand gesture that means imitate and then covers both Tanner's eyes. Kibby is signaled to do a specific behavior. Kibby waves his tail, Tanner imitates him perfectly. GUARINO: Wow! You got it! That was it. Give me 10. All right. ZARRELLA: The behaviors are all pre-taught, like splashing the water or running the lagoon. GUARINO: Beautiful. ZARRELLA: But with his blindfold, Tanner has no idea which behavior Kibby is doing. How does Tanner do it? Maybe his sonar, or he's picking the characteristic sound made by the behavior. Researchers and trainers specifically chose behaviors that were safe for Tanner. For instance, they didn't want him jumping out of the water while he was wearing the eye cups. Researchers say the dolphins' cognitive ability to understand what it means to imitate and then carry it out is amazing. KELLY JAAKKOLA, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, DOLPHIN RESEARCH CENTER: That shows a kind of problem-solving flexibility that we haven't seen anywhere else. ZARRELLA: During the actual research project, Tanner imitated the behaviors successfully more than 58 percent of the time, ruling out luck or chance. GUARINO: Kibby brought a rock. Oh, so did Tanner! ZARRELLA: John Zarrella, CNN, Grassy Key in the Florida Keys. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: It's always amazing to consider how intelligent dolphins are. Now usually, our Before We Go is about animals in some way. Now, that last story was about animals, so today, we are going from the Florida heat to the Colorado cold to show you what some people are doing: extreme mountain biking. Or really lazy skiing, depending on how you look at this. It does kinda look like fun. The idea seems to be trading in tires for skis, swapping out poles for handlebars, and then just ripping your way or, as might be in my case, crashing your way down the mountain. It might seem a bit daunting, but if you can make it out of the starting gates... Goodbye . AZUZ: ...chances are, it's all downhill from there. You might've seen that one coming. We'll try again! You know some thrill seeker probably came up with this ski-eme just for fun. But I'm guessing halfway down the slope, he realized it was snow laughing matter. All right! For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz. That wraps up our show today, but we are coming back tomorrow, where Fridays are always awesome on our show. Look forward to seeing you then.

"(CNN) -- Charges against a man accused of killing an alleged Whitey Bulger extortion victim have been upgraded to murder, according to a press release from the Middlesex, Massachusetts, District Attorney's Office. A grand jury indicted William Camuti, 69, in the death of Stephen Rakes, 59, on Friday, according to the press release. The Massachusetts Medical Examiner's Office determined in October the cause of Rakes' death was acute cyanide poisoning, according to MaryBeth Long, a spokeswoman for the Middlesex District Attorney's Office. Camuti previously confessed to putting potassium cyanide in an iced coffee that he provided to Rakes, according to testimony by Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Banks at a hearing in Concord District Court on September 10. In a phone call on July 16, Camuti asked Rakes to meet him about a potential investment property in Wilmington, officials said. ""The defendant lured the victim to a meeting at which they were to discuss a business deal,"" Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said in a press release. ""Instead the defendant used the meeting as an occasion to serve the victim a poisoned iced coffee."" Rakes took a sip and decided the coffee tasted too bitter. Camuti then drove him around the cities of Waltham, Woburn, Burlington and Lincoln for several hours until he ""succumbed to ... ingesting"" the cyanide, Banks testified. Rakes reportedly had been an extortion victim of Bulger's and learned shortly before his death that prosecutors no longer planned to call him to testify, a friend said. The day Rakes met with Camuti, surveillance video showed Rakes leaving the federal courthouse where he regularly attended Bulger's murder trial. Rakes appeared to be wearing the same clothing in which his body was found, according to authorities. The two men met that afternoon in a McDonald's in Waltham, where officials say Camuti bought two iced coffees, laced one with two teaspoons of potassium cyanide and gave it to Rakes. Potassium cyanide interferes with the body's ability to use oxygen, and exposure to it can be rapidly fatal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Investigators said Camuti dumped Rakes' body in a wooded area, where it was found the next day. CNN's requests for comment from Camuti's attorney were not immediately returned. In August, Camuti pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder, misleading police and unlawful disposition of human remains. He is being held without bail. Bulger, an Irish mob boss in Boston, was found guilty in August on 31 of 32 counts, including extortion, money laundering, drug dealing and weapons possession. A federal jury held Bulger responsible for the murders of 11 people. CNN's Lawrence Crook III and Laura Ly contributed to this report.","William Camuti is indicted in the death of Stephen Rakes .

"(CNN) -- Todd Zeile still can remember the smell. It was an awful, metallic stench, the odor of burning steel, that filled the Mets team bus as it pulled across the George Washington Bridge on September 12, 2001. The players, returning from a trip to Pittsburgh in the only way they could after a nationwide air traffic shutdown, crowded to the right side of the bus. They saw that black cloud over lower Manhattan where the World Trade Center had stood, and in an instant understood the pain and fear that had gripped their city. ""I remember wondering, 'What do we do with the group?'"" said Bobby Valentine, their manager at the time. ""If we were going to just be a Band-Aid over this gaping wound or were we going to actually make a difference?"" The answer, in so many ways, was the latter. The immediate reaction after the 9/11 attacks was to dismiss sports as unimportant, to postpone the games as the nation came to grips with what happened. Everyone agreed that was the right decision. But soon after, the games people love became an integral part of the healing process for the New York region. The athletes, some with absolutely no ties to the city but a uniform, became a source of inspiration. They went to ground zero to meet with the men and women working night and day to clean up. They lifted boxes of relief supplies off trucks, many times in stadium parking lots that had become staging areas. They wore caps and uniform patches to honor the firefighters and police officers who lost their lives trying to save others as the World Trade Center fell. Former Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde remembers going to ground zero a few days after the towers fell, passing the soldiers with machine guns at their sides to shake hands with the rescue workers. ""It was a little frightening to be down there, walking around, not knowing what was going to happen,"" Testaverde said this week, ""and not knowing what you were going to see."" Then, at a time when many wondered if it was right -- or even safe -- to gather and cheer for something as trivial as a baseball game, they helped everyone realize it was OK to be normal again. ""It almost felt defiant,"" said Zeile, then an infielder for the Mets. ""It was like New York saying to the world, 'We're going to be OK. You can hit us, but you can't keep us down.'"" It is only fitting, then, that the biggest ceremonies commemorating the 9/11 attacks will take place in NFL stadiums. It will begin in Landover, Maryland, where fans of the two cities most affected by the attacks -- New York and Washington -- will gather to watch the Giants play the Redskins. It will continue Sunday night at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, where 80,000 fans will receive a small American flag upon entering the stadium for the Jets-Cowboys game. Bagpipers from New York police and fire departments will perform ""Amazing Grace"" and Lady Antebellum will sing the national anthem. Then, the focus will shift to the games, which is what happened in a cathartic way after 9/11. ""I felt like, if anything, we gave people a break from what was going on,"" said Kerry Collins, the Giants quarterback at the time. Collins would give $275,000 to 9/11 charities in the weeks that followed and develop a bond with a firehouse in Greenwich Village. ""It was, 'Hey, we can watch the Giants. The Giants are on,'"" he said. ""I felt pressure to win in Kansas City that next weekend, but more important was playing in a way that would make people proud. That we won the game was an added bonus. It was nice to know that, on some level, we had a positive influence on the events that were going on. Nowhere was the influence greater than with the Mets, who played the first major sporting event in the city after the attacks on September 21, 2001. John Franco, a relief pitcher with the team and a New York native, remembers how different things felt when he arrived at Shea Stadium that day. The debate about whether  the games should resume had raged in the city for four days. ""Just coming to the ballpark that day, you weren't sure if it was the right thing to do,"" Franco said. ""Soon as you pulled into the players' lot you had the bomb squad out there with the dogs and the mirrors looking under the car."" The Atlanta Braves were in town, and for one night, the bitter NL East rivals became willing participants in something bigger than a pennant race. Marc Anthony sang the national anthem. Then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a lifelong Yankees fan, was honored before the game and received a standing ovation. Chipper Jones, the Braves star, admitted he was ""scared to death."" If the terrorists wanted to strike again, was there a better target than a major-league ballpark filled with people? The early innings were a blur, Zeile said, a somber night until the seventh inning stretch. Liza Minnelli performed ""New York, New York,"" and while there was some uncertainty in the crowd about how to respond to such a celebratory song, that changed when firefighters and cops joined her in a high-stepping dance like burly Rockettes. The Braves took the lead in the top of the eighth. Mike Piazza, the Mets star catcher, came to the plate in the bottom of the inning, and on an 0-1 count, hit a towering home run to center field to give the Mets a 3-2 lead they never relinquished. The crowd responded with cheers, some tears, and then this: . ""USA! USA! USA!"" Watch Piazza's dramatic home run . When Shea Stadium closed seven years later, it had seen 5,791 home runs. None was bigger. ""It was almost like a blur to me, it was almost like a dream, sort of surreal,"" Piazza said at the time. ""I'm just so happy I gave the people something to cheer. There was a lot of emotion. It was just a surreal sort of energy out there. I'm just so proud to be a part of it tonight."" Later that fall the New York Yankees would make provide more dramatic relief to the city in their run to the World Series, where they lost game 7 in the ninth inning to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Piazza will be part of the remembrance events at before the Mets-Cubs game at the Mets new stadium, Citi Field on Sunday night, catching a ceremonial first pitch from John Franco before the Mets take the field. Everyone in the stadium will pause to remember. Then, just as they did 10 years ago, they'll play ball.","The Mets first post-9/11 home game was on September 21, 2001 .

"(CNN) -- After he announced the resignations of four top officials in his administration in 1973, Richard Nixon swore he was done with talking about Watergate, according to the last batch of tapes released by the National Archives. Gone were his chief of staff, H.R. ""Bob"" Haldeman; his domestic affairs adviser, John Ehrlichman; White House lawyer John Dean; and Attorney General Richard Kleindeinst, a longtime friend. Nixon broke the news in his first public address about the scandal that would eventually bring down his presidency -- and as he tried to console the jettisoned Haldeman, he insisted it was his last. ""Well, its a tough thing, Bob, for you, for John, the rest,"" he said after the April 30, 1973, speech. ""But goddammit, I'm never gonna discuss this son of a bitch Watergate thing again. Never, never, never, never."" Of course, like much of what he had just told Americans, it didn't turn out to be true. Nixon would be forced to deal with Watergate over and over again in the next year or so, culminating with his own resignation in August 1974 -- a development forced by the discovery of conversations like those released Wednesday by the National Archives. The 340 hours of recordings are the last installment of a record that has kept historians busy for four decades. They run from April 1973 through that July, when the microphones were turned off after a probing Congress learned of the tapes. The new batch includes calls of support from two future presidents following the April 30 speech: Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. ""We're still behind you out here, and I wanted you to know that you're in our prayers,"" said Reagan, then governor of California and a rising conservative star. Story behind 'Our Nixon's' unique home movies . ""How nice of you to say that,"" Nixon replied. ""Well, let me tell you this. That we can be -- all each of us has a different religion, you know? But goddammit, Ron, we have got to build peace in the world, and that's what I'm working on."" Bush, then the Republican Party's chairman, told Nixon, ""I was really proud of you, and my golly, I know it was tough, and I just wanted to tell you that."" Nixon replied, ""Well, good for you, George."" The Watergate scandal began to unravel with the June 1972 break-in at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee. Five operatives of the Nixon re-election campaign were arrested in the attempt to illegally wiretap phones at the offices, located in the Watergate office building in Washington. The inner demons that drove Nixon . The subsequent investigations revealed that within days of the arrests, Nixon had discussed warning FBI agents away from the burglary probe by having the CIA claim the break-in was part of a national security operation. Nixon resigned shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered him to turn over a recording of that conversation to investigators. Other tapes out Wednesday include Nixon discussing China with National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger and meeting with evangelist Billy Graham, the widow of baseball star Roberto Clemente and the Brazilian soccer legend Pele, who spoke of wanting to spread his sport to the United States. He's heard speaking with a variety of world leaders, including West German Chancellor Willy Bradt and Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. The tapes captured a June 1973 summit meeting between Nixon and Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev, in which Brezhnev bemoaned complaints about the world's two superpowers. Four lessons from Nixon's failed presidency . ""There are some people who keep throwing in this idea of there being two superpowers in the world who are out to dictate their, as they say, dictate their will, to foist their will upon others, and so forth,"" Brezhnev said. ""Now, but, are we to blame for being big? Are we to blame for being strong? What can we do about it? That is the way it is."" And Nixon talks of winding down the war in Vietnam and the return of American prisoners of war, justifying the December 1972 bombing raids on Hanoi that he credited with their release. ""The North Vietnamese had reneged on the agreement, they had attached conditions with regard to return of POWs, they had attached conditions on the return of civilians themselves,"" he told Roger Shields, a Pentagon official working with the former prisoners. ""We said no conditions. That's why we had to bomb. One of the major reasons we had to bomb. And it worked."" CNN's Athena Jones and Brian Rokus contributed to this report.","Last round of Watergate tapes include Nixon's talks with aides, Brezhnev, Kissinger .
After aides resigned, Nixon said he was done with Watergate .
Nixon said he would ""never, never, never, never"" talk about it again .

"(CNN) -- As the World Health Organization (WHO) warned of the potential increase of dengue fever and other climate-sensitive illnesses, Japan saw an almost-seven decade streak of being dengue fever-free end. In the past week, at least 55 people have become ill with dengue fever, confirming fears that the fever, last seen in 1945, is back. The cases have one thing in common -- those affected all appear to have visited Yoyogi Park, one of Tokyo's largest outdoor spaces, and all have complained of mosquito bites. Following fumigation last week, the health ministry and Tokyo metropolitan government trapped and analyzed about 100 mosquitoes from the park and, found strains of the virus, prompting authorities to close large parts of the park as of Thursday afternoon. This week, two models, Saaya, 20, and Eri Aoki, 25, who were filming for ""King's Brunch,"" a variety show, in the park, were struck down with the virus, the Nikkan Sports newspaper reported. The dengue outbreak in Japan has seen victims from the age of 10 to those in their 70's. While most people recover within a week, the disease can create discomfort and and can, in rare cases, cause death. The disease, which is mainly transmitted by a type of mosquito (Aedes aegypti), is found in tropical and subtropical climates worldwide. Symptoms include fever, severe headache, rashes and pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain. Harrowing experience . By all accounts, contracting dengue fever is a harrowing experience. Chris Dwyer, formerly of CNN and now a Hong Kong-based communications consultant, contracted dengue while on vacation in Malaysia in July. Back in Hong Kong after a few days, Dwyer found himself unusually lethargic in the afternoon. The following day he had a fever and a temperature, which got progressively worse. ""By the onset of that evening I had appalling pain in my joints, really achy, weak limbs and just a sense that I wasn't well at all,"" he said. ""This was unlike anything else, it was so debilitating."" Eventually, he was admitted into hospital and eventually recovered. where he was put on a drip while doctors monitored his liver and white blood cell count. ""As far as I understand it I was lucky... there are other symptoms that I've heard are pretty gruesome,"" he said. Worldwide problem . While dengue fever is not transmitted human to human, the Japanese health ministry said that domestic mosquitoes could have picked it up from people infected abroad. Almost half the world's population lives in high-risk countries, the WHO says. Last year, Singapore suffered a sweeping epidemic, which saw four die of the disease and over 12,000 become infected. Takeshi Kurosu, an assistant professor at Osaka University's Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, said that the Tokyo outbreak was most likely imported into the country by an infected individual, who then transmitted it to domestic mosquitoes. ""Probably one person who was infected outside Japan went to (Yoyogi) park,"" he said. ""It's possible that there was an infected mosquito (transported to Japan) in a bag, but the patient numbers indicate that it was likely an infected person."" He says that it is likely that there have been previous, small and undiagnosed outbreaks in Japan before, but this one was flagged by a doctor who had experience spotting the symptoms of the virus. To date there have been no fatalities in the Japanese outbreak, and Kurosu is confident that the virus can be contained. ""It will (most likely) be controlled. It will be autumn soon and this type of mosquito can't survive the cold weather."" Climate-linked spread . The disease is on the rise, and over half of the world's population live in dengue endemic areas. The Japanese outbreak comes as a WHO conference examining the links between health and climate change warned of the risks of infectious diseases like malaria and dengue which are strongly influenced by climate. Higher humidity and temperatures mean mosquitoes can survive longer, increasing the likelihood for transmitting diseases and being able to travel to a wider geographic range. ""Vulnerable populations, the poor, the disadvantaged and children are among those suffering the greatest burden of climate-related impacts and consequent diseases, such as malaria, diarrhea and malnutrition, which already kill millions every year,"" said Dr. Flavia Bustreo, WHO Assistant Director-General, Family, Women's and Children's Health in a press release. ""Without effective action to mitigate and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change on health, society will face one of its most serious health challenges."" Kurosu agrees that climate change is a factor, giving rise to longer periods that infected mosquitoes can survive. Adverse conditions, such as drought, however, can also impede the spread of the disease. Drought in parts of India this summer has denied the mosquitoes the water that their larvae need to develop, leading to ""extremely low"" numbers of dengue cases this year, the Times of India reported. Urban centers affected worst . Kurosu says, the primary cause of the spread of dengue fever is linked to population movement and the rapid urbanization of developing countries, the majority of which are in the tropical zone most often affected by dengue fever . There is no cure for, and no vaccination against, dengue fever, The disease can develop into a ""potentially lethal complication"" called severe dengue, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever. The WHO estimates that there are over 50-100 million cases of dengue worldwide each year, although a new study says the true number may be four times as high as that appraisal. Study suggests new approach to dengue fever . 5 myths about mosquito bites .","Japan facing first outbreak of dengue fever in almost 70 years .

"(CNN) -- Eleven years ago, Danae Mines ignored her family's objections and became one of the few female firefighters with the New York City Fire Department, better known as the FDNY. And this week, with her trademark determination, she broke through a different traditionally all-male barrier: the FDNY Calendar of Heroes. Mines is the first woman to be featured as eye candy in the calendar's 11-year history, something that typifies her grit and will. ""I wasn't going to let anyone tell me I couldn't do what I wanted to do,"" she said told the New York Daily News. ""I wanted my picture in the calendar so that young girls and young women can see me and know that they can do this job."" Mines is a 14-year veteran of the FDNY and a member of Engine Co. 60 in the South Bronx, the department told CNN. She joins 12 male colleagues on the calendar's steamy pages and will be featured in March. There are about 10,300 firefighters in all ranks of the FDNY and 46 of those are women, according to the department. That equals less than half of one percent. ""When I step foot into the firehouse, I have to be able to tell myself that I'm willing to risk my life to save someone else,"" Mines told the Daily News. ""I always go above and beyond, because that's my job."" A positive reaction . From the FDNY Facebook page to the International Association of Women in Fire and Emergency Services, the reaction to Mines' calendar inclusion has been overwhelmingly positive. The consensus: Even a calendar with a reputation for showcasing traditional masculinity must catch up with the times. ""I think it is SO SO cool that you have a lady in the calendar this year,"" one Facebook user said. ""I am glad that a sexy woman of color is representing not just the FDNY but FD Ladies all over the country."" Another commenter was equally inspired. ""Can I just say how freakin' awesome it is to see a woman in the FDNY? I know there are female fire fighters but they are so far & few between & even better that she made the calendar!!! Keep saving lives girl!!! You are an inspiration to women everywhere!"" This type of reaction is exactly what Angela Hughes wants to hear. As a fire lieutenant in Baltimore County, Maryland, and a trustee at the IAWFES, she knows how difficult it can be for women to assimilate in a fire department. ""It's not easy to fit in,"" she told CNN. ""The stereotype is that you're a fireman. But we're firefighters and we're trained to do the job. Not everyone needs to be a muscle-bound giant to do the job. It is about technique."" Hughes has been in the fire service for 21 years. Like Mines, she joined after being an emergency medical technician. ""I was very fortunate that I worked for a metro department with 18% female firefighters, when nationwide it's about 4%,"" she said. ""I was well accepted. ... In other departments it can be very difficult."" She listed several issues the IAWFES seeks to address for female firefighters, including the need for personal bathrooms, sleeping quarters and freedom from workplace harassment.

"(CNN) -- The North Pole may be briefly ice-free by September as global warming melts away Arctic sea ice, according to scientists from the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado. ""We kind of have an informal betting pool going around in our center and that betting pool is 'does the North Pole melt out this summer?' and it may well,"" said the center's senior research scientist, Mark Serreze. It's a 50-50 bet that the thin Arctic sea ice, which was frozen in autumn, will completely melt away at the geographic North Pole, Serreze said. The ice retreated to a record level in September when the Northwest Passage, the sea route through the Arctic Ocean, opened briefly for the first time in recorded history. ""What we've seen through the past few decades is the Arctic sea ice cover is becoming thinner and thinner as the system warms up,"" Serreze said. Specific weather patterns will determine whether the North Pole's ice cover melts completely this summer, he said. ""Last year, we had sort of a perfect weather pattern to get rid of ice to open up that Northwest Passage,"" Serreze said. ""This year, a different pattern can set up. so maybe we'll preserve some ice there. We're in a wait-and-see mode right now. We'll see what happens."" The brief lack of ice at the top of the globe will not bring any immediate consequences, he said. ""From the viewpoint of the science, the North Pole is just another point in the globe, but it does have this symbolic meaning,"" Serreze said. ""There's supposed to be ice at the North Pole. The fact that we may not have any by the end of this summer could be quite a symbolic change."" Serreze said it's ""just another indicator of the disappearing Arctic sea ice cover"" but that it is happening so soon is ""just astounding to me."" ""Five years ago, to think that we'd even be talking about the possibility of the North Pole melting out in the summer, I would have never thought it,"" he said. The melting, however, has been long seen as inevitable, he said. ""If you talked to me or other scientists just a few years ago, we were saying that we might lose all or most of the summer sea ice cover by anywhere from 2050 to 2100,"" Serreze said. ""Then, recently, we kind of revised those estimates, maybe as early as 2030. Now, there's people out there saying it might be even before that. So, things are happening pretty quick up there."" Serreze said those who suggest that the Arctic meltdown is just part of a historic cycle are wrong. ""It's not cyclical at this point. I think we understand the physics behind this pretty well,"" he said. ""We've known for at least 30 years, from our earliest climate models, that it's the Arctic where we'd see the first signs of global warming. ""It's a situation where we hate to say we told you so, but we told you so,"" he said. Serreze said the Arctic sea ice will not be the same for decades. ""If we had a few cold years in a row, we could put sort of a temporary damper on it, but I think at this point going to an ice-free Arctic Ocean is inevitable,"" he said. ""I don't think we can stop that now."" Reduced greenhouse gas emissions could ""cool things down a bit,"" he said. ""It would recover fairly quickly, but it's just not going to happen for a while,"" he said. ""I think we're committed at this point."" There are some positive aspects to the ice melting, he said. Ships could use the Northwest Passage to save time and energy by no longer having to travel through the Panama Canal or around Cape Horn. ""There's also, or course, oil at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean,"" he said. ""Now, the irony of that is kind of clear, but the fact that we are opening up the Arctic Ocean does make it more accessible.""

"Editor's note: Lindsay Branham is communications coordinator for Food for the Hungry, an international Christian relief and development organization. She has lived in the region for more than a year. The names of the children in this article have been changed to protect them. Lindsay Branham says armed groups are conscripting children as soliders in the Congo. (CNN) -- The border was hauntingly empty. No military, drenched in green, patrolling. No AKs slung over shoulders. No Swahili floating through the air. Just the pitter-patter of rain falling to the ground and turning the dirt road into a river. To the right some secondary school students huddled beneath an overhang. From a village close to Rutshuru in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they had fled an attack by a rebel group. The men with guns marched the boys outside and ordered them to file into a line. ""We were so scared,"" said Jean, ""we ran into the bush."" Adamant that they did not want to fight, that they did not want to become soldiers, Jean explained how they had to hide themselves in the forest to escape being abducted. Many of their friends, though, were taken.  See Branham's view of the turmoil » . Melchisedek is a secondary school teacher in a village close to Rutshuru, an area heavily dominated by clashes between the Congolese government forces and the CNDP. He said that twice armed groups came to his school to abduct children. ""They look through the windows and count the boys,"" he said. Boys. Abducted to be soldiers. The current war in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo is marked by the use of child soldiers. These young boys are abducted from their schools and homes and forced to hold a weapon and use it against their own government. In Nakivale, a sprawling refugee settlement holding more than 30,000 people in Uganda, up to 600 new Congolese refugees are arriving daily. Bombarded with hunger, disease and lack of basic essentials, people are suffering. One man, Bahati, his frame thinned, stood weakly. He said he is throwing up and having diarrhea nearly every five minutes. He says sometimes there is blood in his excrement. His face pale, he asked for medicine.  Watch Branham discuss child soldiers » . I asked a group of men if they had anything to do in the camp -- no, they said. Then I asked what they did in Congo for a living. ""Cultivator,"" ""mason,"" ""teacher."" One by one they listed their roles as father, provider and protector with pride. Today they have been stripped of their livelihoods, of their way to take care of their families. Today they fear they may never get to go back home to the lives they once led. Melchisedek's face was set passionately against the backdrop of U.N. relief agency-tarped tents as he told me more about how children are used as weapons in Congo. He said the rebels give the boys three days of training, which includes an ideological indoctrination. The boys are then thrown onto the front lines. If they turn back in fear, they are shot from behind. I asked if the boys are scared. ""Of course,"" Melchisedek said. In a place so rife with conflict -- more than a decade of war has blanketed the eastern part of the country, surging on and off in intensity -- the toll has multiplied. At least 250,000 people have been displaced in the last few weeks, adding to the almost 1 million already displaced Congolese. Jean and his friends pleaded with me for help. They are in their last year of secondary school and want to complete the year to receive their diplomas. They've worked their entire lives for this. And in the span of a few days, it has been destroyed. Jean said they haven't eaten in days. While hiding in the forest from the rebels, they survived off fruit they could pick from trees. Now in Busanza, Uganda, just feet from the Congo border at Kitagoma, they depend on the kindness of their Ugandan neighbors. But Jean still gripped his stomach with his hands and clenched his face in pain to convey the urgency of his hunger. Melchisedek said that as he fled with his wife and four children, the Congolese army fled with them. Who is left to protect now? Melchisedek explained that as fighting became worse, gunshots flying through the air, bombs exploding, he got separated from his two youngest children -- 2 and 4 years old. As he had to decide whether to continue running with the rest of his family and maybe live, or turn back and maybe die, he made an excruciatingly difficult choice. He kept running. At the Ishasha border crossing, Melchisedek said they had to swim through a river to cross over into Uganda since it was impossible to use the guarded border. He described how they had to hold their children above their heads as they pushed through the quickly moving water. They made it into Uganda. But his two youngest are still somewhere in Congo. He cast his eyes down, whispering, ""I don't know where they are."" I saw pain in the eyes of the Congolese who were gracious enough to share their stories with me. I also saw enormous courage. Thrown into circumstances I can barely fathom, their dignity remains. I am overcome by humanity. The best and the worst. I am horrified children are still being abducted to fight -- their childhoods stripped from them and a life of violence forced upon them. I am humbled by the mothers I met, who continue to give their lives for the sake of their children. One Congolese refugee woman, Espe, who fled the war last week while nine months' pregnant, gave birth this week. Espe named her daughter Tantine, which she says means ""can't fear the war."" Those words: can't fear the war. An indescribable resolve has named that child. Today I hear the voices of the refugees -- their stories wrapped like falling rain around me. And I see the empty border again. How many more Jeans, Melchisedeks and Espes are still behind the borders? How many will survive? I ask these questions not really wanting answers. The relief and development organization I work with, Food for the Hungry, conducted an assessment this week with these very refugees to determine a way to respond. I am convinced: The Congolese are waiting for peace. But they shouldn't have to wait for assistance.

"(CNN) -- Facebook is giving its users more control over the posts and people they see most in their news feeds. On Friday, the company announced new filters in Settings that show the people, pages and groups you follow that posted the most in the past week, along with a summary. If you ""unfollow"" someone in the heat of the moment and decide you miss their cat photos, bring up the list of recently un-followed people and add them back into your feed. There are also new controls so users can opt to see fewer posts from a person or a page (instead of just un-following them outright). Giving more power to its users is a smart move for the social network. Facebook has taken a lot of heat for controlling what people see and when they see it. Facebook wants to bring back the anonymous chatroom . Instead of a straight chronological list of posts from friends and family, the company uses algorithms to show an edited feed. Posts it deems more important, like major life events, are bumped to the top. Sometimes day-old stories are resurfaced. It also looks at your behavior, what posts you like and pages you follow to decide what content to show you. With an average of 864 million people looking at their news feed every day, that's a lot of power. The company was accused of unethically experimenting on almost 690,000 users' news feeds in 2012 (the news broke in June). It tinkered with the content of feeds, showing some people more positive content and others more negative posts, and studied how that impacted the emotions and posts of those users. Facebook's $19 billion move you might not notice . One of the most frustrating parts of the company's controlling approach to the news feed is how difficult it is to customize what you do see. There are options for muting individuals or blocking posts from certain sites, but with hundreds of friends, managing what pops up can be a full-time job. These new settings, available on desktop now and coming to the mobile apps over the next few weeks, is an attempt to make surfing your feed less work.","Facebook is adding settings to the most popular pages, people and groups you follow!

"(CNN) -- Patrycja Makowska likes to give enigmatic names to the extraordinarily beautiful photographs she shoots of crumbling palaces. But that's not where the enigma of her work ends. Despite creating alluring images of abandoned buildings, she's determined to keep their locations a mystery. ""Places reflect our soul, tell the forgotten story of love, disaster, war, as well as ordinary life,"" Makowska, a former history teacher from Poland, tells CNN as she tries to explain her shroud of secrecy. ""Everything passes, even the power of past times is often forgotten. And that's why I don't give any addresses, because often these places are destroyed and devastated, it's better for them to have been forgotten."" Not, however, forgotten by Makowska's cameras. She uses old analog Russian photo equipment and lenses, plus some more modern Canon and Nikon equipment to create images that pay homage to the original grandeur of these baroque structures. With otherworldly titles such as ""Ethereal Dreams"" and ""Lost Under the Surface,"" her photographs have an unrealistic quality more closely associated with paintings -- but the incredible detail on display would take more than a lifetime's worth of brushstrokes to recreate. Swirling spiral staircases . The images show vast ornate ballrooms, swirling spiral staircases and elegant chapels strewn with rubble. Sunlight shafts bore in through broken windows or holes in roofs. Sometimes an abandoned toy or chair adds a poignant human touch to the dereliction. Makowska, who lives in Warsaw, took up photography about 12 years ago. Her first subject was a ruined medieval castle in the southern Polish town of Muszyna. During stays in the UK and Iceland she says she realized there was ""magic"" in forgotten places and began seeking them out in her home country. Finding her subjects takes effort, she says. ""The location of these places is hard work, the research involves maps, historical books and old guides, and talking to people who live in the areas of the buildings."" Her refusal to identify where these buildings will at least prevent them from becoming ""ruin porn"" destinations -- a status deplored by some places trying shake off economic decline. Makowska, who now works in IT, says she has been inspired by people's reactions to her work into pursuing further projects. On her list is nature photography -- ""mountains, meadows and sea"" -- and documenting ""URBEX,"" the sometimes risky global trend of urban exploration that occasionally involves trespassing on dangerous structures. She also wants to tackle human subjects.

"(CNN) -- Growing up in the Jim Crow-era South, we saw firsthand the great disparities in health care suffered by African-Americans. The lack of access to basic services, the dearth of black physicians and the often overtly racist attitudes of white health care providers contributed to higher rates of infant mortality, chronic illnesses and shorter life expectancy. The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., said that ""of all forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane."" But hasn't the prejudice that prevailed in those far off times been eliminated in today's more equitable society? Or do health disparities persist in less obvious but no less worrying ways -- and not just for African-Americans? Studies emphatically conclude that such disparities do persist. U.S. News and World Report released its latest issue announcing the best hospitals in the nation on Tuesday. People put a lot of stock in these rankings, and equality of treatment should be considered as a factor in what makes a hospital excellent. ""Unequal Treatment,"" published by the Institute of Medicine in 2002, spelled out exactly how Latinos, African-Americans, Native-Americans, Asian-Americans, and Pacific Islanders receive care that's inferior to that enjoyed by mainstream Americans. The IOM report triggered other studies that demonstrated the (often unconscious) prejudice that prevails in treating women, the elderly, the LGBT community, the obese --13 groups in all -- a large percentage of the health care consuming public. Here are a few shocking examples: Women with symptoms of heart disease often are not transported by emergency medical services to health facilities as rapidly as men. Women and blacks with heart attack symptoms are not given cardiac catheterizations and other appropriate clinical tests at the same rate as white men. Latinos and African-Americans do not receive the same pain medication for long bone fractures as do their fellow citizens. Attacking health disparities head-on can make a big difference. A program in Alaska designed to train dental health care therapists -- the rough equivalent of physician's assistants -- celebrated its 10th anniversary this month. The Native Tribal Council initiated the program, Dentex, because the state had few dentists and most wouldn't accept Medicaid. Many native children lost all of their teeth by age 18, affecting their health, social lives, school attendance, and employment possibilities. The dental health aide therapists have improved oral health in Alaska dramatically. Now, despite the fierce opposition of the American Dental Association, Maine and Minnesota have approved the training and deployment of similar mid-level dental providers, and other states are considering it. It is widely accepted that African-Americans and Hispanics are underserved. Shortening the waiting times at Grady Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia -- which primarily serves African-American, Hispanic and other minority populations -- allowed greater access to mental health services because the population is admitted more quickly and provided with care. Hospitals would be encouraged to join the fight if equality were included as a metric in the U.S. News and World Report rankings. These rankings are popular and closely watched. They bestow bragging rights on hospitals, but most important, provide guidance for people deeply interested in where they might go to receive the best care in the specialties that concern them most. U.S. News and World Report has a tremendous opportunity to facilitate significant changes in health care delivery by rating hospitals for their care of the underserved. Its annual hospital rankings tell consumers nothing on this vital subject. Where do hospitals rank in their understanding of the problem of unequal care? What measures do they take to counteract the effects of prejudice in the treatment they provide? We encourage the publication to maximize this opportunity before next year's ""Best Hospitals"" issue. That would enable women and minorities to advocate for health care equality more successfully. It would help U.S. health professionals understand health disparities and more effectively treat underserved and minority populations. Most important, it would help all patients and their families, not just those who need not worry about disparities in care, to know better where to go for the care they need.","U.S. News and World Report releases respected list of best hospitals in the U.S.

"(CNN) -- Trees once looked like green panels for Bruce Bridgeman. He'd have to move his head to gauge the relative closeness of objects. For most of his life, he had poor depth perception. His eyes pointed outward and did not allow him to see, in stereo, a single image with both eyes. But in February 2012, something changed when he went to a movie theater with his wife. He put on a pair of 3-D glasses to watch the film ""Hugo"" and, to his amazement, the characters and scenery in this film jumped out at him in greater stereo vision than he had experienced before. What's more, after returning the glasses and leaving the theater, Bridgeman's perception of the real world was enhanced as well. A lamppost jumped out from the background, and the trees, cars and people looked somehow more vivid. This was the world with depth. Bridgeman was ""euphoric."" ""Suddenly, things began to jump out at me,"" said Bridgeman, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The effect has stuck around since he saw the movie 16 months ago. It's impossible to prove scientifically that the film itself altered his visual system, but his hope is that his story could help others with similar eye conditions who struggle through months of training to attempt to see more vividly. Other experts say the vivid 3-D movie could have indeed jolted Bridgeman's visual system in this way, but that it wouldn't work as a quick fix for most people with eye alignment problems. It's possible with Bridgeman's unique set of circumstances, it was exactly what he needed, but it would probably help few people. ""Certainly immersion in a 3-D movie could, if somebody had a marginal vision system, could absolutely improve it,"" said Paul Harris, associate professor at the Southern College of Optometry in Memphis, Tennessee, who has not evaluated Bridgeman. But, he adds, ""I wouldn't prescribe (a movie)."" A flat world . For Bridgeman, the world used to be a much flatter place -- like a two-dimensional movie on a flat screen, he said. He often looked through only one eye or the other. He used other cues to help him figure out relative distances. For instance, parallax is a phenomenon in which, when you move your head, objects that are closer appear to move faster than objects that are farther away. Objects also generally appear smaller when they are farther away. ""You still see the world as kind of, in theory, three-dimensional, but the experience is more flat,"" he said. ""I didn't realize that until I began to see in proper stereo."" Bridgeman recalls having his eyes examined at age 8 at a hospital in Philadelphia. Doctors recommended against surgery, although he doubts his family could have afforded it anyway. Because his eyes aren't completely well aligned, there's a small eye movement that occurs when he shifts from looking through one eye to the other. ""That had always been a social disadvantage, because people were never quite sure what I was looking at,"" he said. He remembers in junior high school, his social studies teacher scolded him for giving him what the teacher thought was a disrespectful look. Bridgeman had no idea what he was talking about and denied it, but still remembers this experience with anger and regret. In his early 20s, when he drove, he noticed that he couldn't read signs on freeways until he had passed the exits. He went to a clinic where he found out he had myopia and other deviations of the eye. In 1983, at the University of California, Berkeley, he collaborated with two colleagues on a study of his own vision. Through such testing, it was obvious that his stereo vision wasn't great, and that he had exotropic vision, meaning his eyes pointed in different directions. But he didn't know what perceptual difference it would make to view the world more in stereo, until he saw ""Hugo."" Now, objects that appeared to be on top of each other seem more separate, and 2-D movies are recognizably flat -- before, they were perhaps ""just as real as the real world,"" he said. Stereo Sue . It is estimated that between 3% and 5% of people are stereo-blind or have large deficits in stereo vision. Bridgeman's case reminds experts of Susan Barry, neurobiologist at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, who wrote a book called ""Fixing My Gaze: A Scientist's Journey Into Seeing in Three Dimensions"" about how she gained stereo vision. Neurologist Oliver Sacks wrote about her as ""Stereo Sue"" in a 2006 article in the New Yorker. Barry was cross-eyed from the first few months of life, and never learned how to point her eyes in the same direction, until she used a set of procedures to reposition her eyes over a period of a year. She believes this tapped into the circuitry in her brain specialized for binocular vision that hadn't been active before. ""People like me or like Bruce who are cross-eyed, have strabismus, probably have the capacity to see in stereo if you can change your visual habits so as to point the two eyes at the same place at the same time, and bring in correlated input into the brain,"" said Barry, who has corresponded with Bridgeman but not studied him directly. Several scientific studies have shown that, with training, people can recover stereo vision even if they've never had it, said Suzanne McKee, senior scientist at the The Smith-Kettlewell Eye Research Institute in San Francisco. This is a recent shift in thinking. For decades, scientists believed that stereo vision could not be recovered, once lost. ""It turns out that, in fact, with a lot of practice, like many other things you can recover capabilities, which is exciting,"" McKee said. Similarly, scientists once thought that there was a ""critical period"" of the first few years of life, during which one would either be able to see in three dimensions or not. Barry was 48 when she started to perceive three dimensions, and at first kept her awareness secret from other scientists out of concern that ""they would think I'm hysterical."" So what about that movie? In his academic life, Bridgeman's specialty is -- guess what! -- the visual system. He's working on such projects as eliminating sickness in driving simulators and exploring illusions such as why people overestimate the slopes of hills. After viewing ""Hugo,"" Bridgeman read up on research on the neuroscience of vision to come up with a possible explanation of what happened. David H. Hubel and Torsten N. Wiesel, who shared the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, had done research on kittens that gave Bridgeman ideas about what could be going on in his own brain. The researchers studied the eyes and visual systems of young cats with misaligned eyes, showing that most cells in the brain's visual cortex would be activated by one eye or the other. But a small group of these cells also responded to both eyes. Bridgeman's hypothesis is that the analogous cells in himself got awakened during the movie, becoming newly connected to allow stereoscopic vision. ""It was sort of serendipitous that I had spent my lifetime studying vision, and then this experience happened, so I could talk about it and maybe understand it in ways that most people wouldn't be able to,"" he said. The act of watching a movie isn't going to fix someone who has an eye turned abnormally, but if someone was already at the cusp of this happening, it's possible, Harris said. In Harris' practice, patients with intermittent exotropia -- eyes that point outward much of the time -- typically go through a six-month process of training, involving exercises to help them focus both eyes together. Harris has seen patients have overpowering emotional experiences after therapy sessions, saying, ""it's the first time I've seen the space between things."" It makes sense to Harris that a 3-D movie could have had this effect on Bridgeman. Ordinary movies do not reward the brain for bringing an outward-deviating eye in, but a 3-D movie does. ""The moment he brought his eye in subconsciously, he was like, 'Oh wow, this looks cool,' and then probably maintained the effort,"" Harris said. The movie probably had the effect of training not the muscles of Bridgeman's eyes per se, Harris said, but rather ""the software he used in terms of how he looked at the world."" Researchers have suggested that creating video games with three-dimensional information could be used to help children and adults with eye misalignment problems achieve improved stereo vision, McKee said. Looking for more insights . Bridgeman's vision still isn't perfect. A few months after viewing ""Hugo,"" he went to an optometrist in Santa Cruz who administered a test for stereo threshold, the same one Bridgeman had taken at Berkeley in the 1980s. The test showed his stereo vision had improved dramatically since his earlier test, but still wasn't within normal range. There still remain many unanswered questions. Just how common is it for an adult to acquire stereo vision? Which specific visual anomalies might respond best to watching a 3-D movie? Bridgeman wants to know. He's in touch with Dennis Levi at the University of California, Berkeley, who led a study of five adults who went from being stereo-blind to seeing depth again through training. Since a BBC article appeared about Bridgeman last year, he's gotten numerous e-mails from others with stereo vision problems. One man told him he had an experience similar to Bridgeman's. ""When it happens, it's very sudden and pleasant, to see things in 3-D that have been flat for all your life,"" Bridgeman said.

"Washington (CNN) -- Hillary Clinton has spent the final moments of the midterm campaign season publicly deflecting the flurry of questions about her likely run for president. But behind the scenes, her campaign machine is quietly whirring to life. Clinton insiders have begun to approach Washington-based Democratic operatives who may play a role in a potential campaign and are soliciting their recommendations on other possible staffers, according to Democrats familiar with the conversations. A number Clinton associates are compiling staffing lists, according to multiple Democratic sources. Michael Whouley and Minyon Moore of the Democratic communications and consulting firm Dewey Square Group are one conduit to Clinton's inner circle and among the primary compilers of the campaign universe that will surround Clinton, should she run. The firm is led by veteran players in Clinton world. Whouley was an adviser to Vice President Al Gore and a Clinton campaign aide while Moore is a longtime Clinton confidante. Ginny Terzano, head of communications for Dewey Square, said the characterization is ""incorrect."" ""DSG officials have no role"" in a potential Clinton campaign, she said. Operatives at the firm are reviewing possible Clinton staffers ""under the guise of spitballing ideas,"" as one Democratic source put it. With a trio of pro-Hillary superPACs -- Ready for Hillary, Priorities USA Action and Correct the Record -- months into shoring up support, a Clinton campaign is already well underway outside of her inner circle. Clinton's midterm campaign schedule . ""The reality is that if you have a message and you're larger than life, the organization can come together pretty quickly,"" said Tom McMahon, who served as deputy campaign director for Howard Dean's 2004 campaign. ""It can be a turnkey operation."" As the Clinton campaign apparatus is constructed, those close to her are trying to shroud it from view, wary of the glaring political spotlight that amplifies every move the former secretary of state makes. ""There are no formal talks, no one is being offered jobs,"" one source told CNN, dismissing the signs of campaign life as ""a lot of jockeying"" from Democrats who want to work on a Clinton campaign. In September, Clinton and her inner circle were dismayed by a leak to Politico that revealed the presence of John Podesta -- former Chief of Staff to President Bill Clinton, current top aide to President Barack Obama and the person favored to serve as chairman of a Hillary Clinton campaign -- at meetings with pro-Clinton super PACs this summer. Huma Abedin, one of Clinton's closest aides, has told multiple Democrats to rein in chatter about 2016, saying Clinton wants to keep attention on the midterm elections and minimize attention on a presidential run, according to a Democratic source who spoke to Abedin. Clinton and the small team she employs are trying to keep her out of the tarnishing political spotlight until she is ready to make a run official, something Clinton will likely do by the end of winter, though she would like to put it off as late as possible. ""If there's not a competitive primary, the general election starts as soon as she declares,"" said Katie Packer Gage, former deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential run, who says the challenge of a Clinton campaign will be more of what her current team is already struggling with -- ''how do they keep her fresh for the American people?"" Recent campaigns for viable Democratic or Republican presidential candidates were well into the preliminary phase of staffing up at this point in time, with top aides already getting in line ahead of an official announcement. In 2012, Matt Rhoades, at the time the executive director of Mitt Romney's Political Action Committee and later Romney's campaign manager, was already in early discussions with all of those who would become senior staff. Well before the 2006 midterms, then-Sen. Barack Obama had conducted preliminary discussions with and identified a number of top aides. His campaign effectively went into high gear after the elections, though he launched his exploratory committee in January 2007 and declared his candidacy in February. But some political operatives warn not to read too much into the beginning phase of a Clinton campaign currently underway. ""Of course the preliminary conversations should be going on,"" said Steve Elmendorf, Deputy Campaign Manager for John Kerry's 2004 campaign. ""But there are a lot of people who have had those conversations - who thought about running for office, made plans to run for office, and didn't."" Among those believed to be part of a potential Clinton campaign, Guy Cecil, the current executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, appears to be one of Clinton's most likely choices for campaign manager, according to interviews with more than two dozen Democrats. ""Even if Democrats don't hang onto the Senate, people respect the job that he's done,"" said one. Cecil's role is expected to fall under the oversight of Podesta, seen as a calming force who could squash much of the internal drama that plagued Clinton's 2008 campaign. Podesta is expected to stay at the White House through the State of the Union, according to two sources familiar with his current plans, despite his initial commitment of one year service when Obama named him to his post in the West Wing last December. By last Spring, Robby Mook, who managed the campaign that propelled Clinton fundraising guru, Terry McAuliffe, into the Virginia governor's mansion, has ""been on ice"" - as one Democrat put it - since as early as the spring, according to two Democrats familiar with the discussion. He was told not to make long term plans by those close to Clinton, the sources say, and is widely expected to play a major role in running the campaign. Dennis Cheng, who manages fundraising for the Clinton Foundation and served as Hillary Clinton's deputy chief of protocol at the State Department, is the frontrunner for finance director, according to multiple Democrats. Huma Abedin, as well as longtime Clinton aide Philippe Reines and Nick Merrill, Clinton's current spokesperson, are expected to serve in influential roles in and around the campaign.","Hillary Clinton isn't saying whether she'll run for president .

"(CNN) -- Jena Johnson's profession is not one that people go to college for. It's also not work that gets easier with time. Her job is to help you die a ""good death."" Her definition of ""good"" goes like this: a death in which a person's wishes for the end of his or her life are respected and carriecd out. No matter what those wishes are. She found herself in this role because of what she perceives as a great need in America to make discussions about death more a part of life. Because no one likes to talk about this stuff. More than a quarter of Americans said they have given no thought or not very much thought to their wishes for dying, a 2013 Pew Research Center survey found. Only a third said they have put their wishes in writing, something that Johnson knows to be vital in the middle of the most excruciating circumstances. From 9 to 5, in the Portland, Oregon, offices of the end-of-life advocacy group Compassion & Choices, Johnson and her staff field up to 100 calls a day. The number of those calls has swollen after the death last week of Brittany Maynard, who had terminal brain cancer and chose to end her life with a fatal dose of barbiturates at age 29. Maynard was very public about why she chose to end her life. ""Because the rest of my body is young and healthy, I am likely to physically hang on for a long time even though cancer is eating my mind,"" she wrote in a CNN Opinion piece. ""I probably would have suffered in hospice care for weeks or even months. And my family would have had to watch that. ""I did not want this nightmare scenario for my family, so I started researching death with dignity."" Compassion & Choices partnered with Maynard and issued a statement saying that she ""died as she intended -- peacefully in her bedroom, in the arms of her loved ones."" Others choose not to die like that. And that's OK with Johnson. She's had people tell her that they have the best benefits in the world, and they want to keep trying everything medically possible until the very end. Johnson, 58, previously was a mental health counselor and educator and has been an end-of-life consultant for the last seven years. Her goal is to make people aware of their options. She became more keenly aware of how tough things can get when her mother was dying of lung cancer in 1990. ""We took our cue from her,"" Johnson says. ""She had very pronounced ideas of how she wanted to go."" Much of it was generational. Johnson's mother was from an era when people rarely listened to anything but doctor's orders. She entered a hospice and in the end, she suffered a great deal. Johnson says that had she known then what she knows now, she might have brought up other options for her mother. ""Most people say, 'I'm not afraid to die. I am afraid to suffer,' "" she says. ""Or they say, 'I've had a good life but I don't want my illness to compromise my loved one's memories.' It's very well thought out for these people."" Johnson has a list of questions she asks her clients, which she prefers to call them rather than patients. Do you have an advance directive? That's a legal document that outlines a person's wishes at the end of life. One of her clients told her that she wanted very much to discuss her choices with her children but they refused to talk about their mom's death. So her client invited the whole family for Thanksgiving and when they sat down to dinner, each one found her advanced directive sitting on their plates. ""No one eats,"" said the client, ""until you've read this."" Johnson first assesses a client's situation -- mobility, support system, treatment -- and then continues with tough questions. Do you want to have a feeding tube? Do you want to be kept on a ventilator? Do you want chemotherapy? Do you want to be put into a medical coma if no amount of medication can relieve your pain? Do you realize that one outcome of a medical coma could be your death? Are your family members supportive of your wishes? Sometimes a client will say that one of her children opposes her wish to die on religious or moral grounds. Johnson lets those clients know that they can specify which relatives will have the right to carry out end-of-life decisions. One of her colleagues currently is counseling a client with Lou Gehrig's disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, which affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The client's only way of communication is using one finger to text. His spouse conducts conference calls with their children and with the end-of-life counselor who acts as a subjective third party. Recently, the counselor discovered that the family had put her client on a feeding tube, even though an advanced directive underscored: ""No feeding tube."" ""My colleague asked the very question the family did not want to ask the patient: 'Do you really want this feeding tube? According to everything you have declared up to this point, you don't want this. Have you changed your mind?' "" The client said, ""No."" ""It was a difficult conversation but a necessary one,"" Johnson says. ""They all knew what the answer was but it was so hard in their hearts."" Another time, a client called Johnson to say her doctor had recommended radiation. ""Tell me again how old you are,"" Johnson said. ""97,"" the client replied. ""Wait. You are 97 and the doctor told you to go through this?"" That's when she advised her client of other options, though she never tells anyone what they ought to do. ""My job is to educate, to empower,"" Johnson says. ""I am glad the conversation has been elevated in the public consciousness."" Brittany Maynard moved with her husband to Portland because Oregon is one of five states that recognize aid in dying as lawful medical practice. Among the 40 other states that are addressing ""assisted suicide,"" 38 criminalize it. Johnson takes issue with the term ""assisted suicide."" Many people who commit suicide are physically healthy, she says, while her clients are terminally ill people taking control of their death. Polls show that most Americans support Maynard's decision and favor a full consideration of end-of-life options. About six in 10 Americans believe people suffering a great deal of pain with no hope of getting better have a moral right to end their lives, according to Pew. That's up from 55% in 1990. And most adults in America said there are at least some situations in which they, personally, would want to halt medical treatment and be allowed to die, according to Pew. But about a third responded that they would tell their doctors to do everything possible to keep them alive. Pew found that personal preferences are linked to religious affiliations. Many people believe that no one but God has the right to make a life or death decision. The Catholic Church, for instance, has guidelines on end-of-life decisions and forbids actions that are considered immoral by the church, including euthanasia and doctor-assisted death. Others believe feeling pain can be spiritually cleansing and redemptive, Johnson says. ""I don't get this, but some people think suffering is character building and they really want to suffer,"" she says. And that, too, can be a good death. Follow CNN's Moni Basu on Twitter .

"(CNN) -- One of NASCAR's top drivers, Kurt Busch, is being investigated for domestic assault, Delaware police said Friday. The Dover, Delaware, police department issued a statement indicating its investigators first heard of the allegation at 2 p.m. Wednesday. ""The department is still investigating the victim's claims and will not have any further comment on this matter in order to preserve the integrity of the case,"" police in the Delaware capital said. Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said his client expects to be vindicated. ""This allegation is a complete fabrication by a woman who has refused to accept the end of a relationship, and Mr. Busch vehemently denies her allegations in every respect,"" he said in a written statement. Details of the claim haven't been released. NASCAR races were held in Dover on September 27 and 28. Mike Arning, a spokesman for Busch's Stewart-Haas Racing team, said, ""This is an allegation Stewart-Haas Racing takes very seriously, but we're still gathering all of the facts and are not in a position to comment in greater detail."" NASCAR released a statement of its own, saying its officials are ""aware of the investigation."" ""We recognize the seriousness of this matter and are actively gathering information from all parties, including law enforcement authorities and Stewart-Haas Racing,"" NASCAR said.

"(CNN) -- ""I killed that lady,"" the 10-year-old boy told a Pennsylvania state trooper, after a 90-year-old woman was found dead in the home of the boy's grandfather. Tristen Kurilla, a fifth grader, made the chilling confession Saturday, police said, after his mother brought him to the Pennsylvania State Police Barracks in Honesdale, about 140 miles north of Philadelphia. Now, Kurilla is being held at the Wayne County Correctional Facility and charged as an adult with criminal homicide, the Wayne County district attorney's office said. The boy is separated from adult offenders and is being constantly supervised, CNN affiliate WBRE reported. The boy admitted to grabbing a wooden cane, holding it against 90-year-old Helen Novak's throat for several seconds and punching her in the throat and stomach, according to the police affidavit. Kurilla told police he was angry at Novak because she had yelled at him when he entered her room. He said he wanted to ask her a question. Were you trying to kill her? the trooper asked the boy. ""No, I was only trying to hurt her,"" Kurilla replied, according to the affidavit. The boy was ordered to be held without bail after his arraignment and is set to appear in court October 22. Bernie Brown, his lawyer, said he was petitioning the court to get the fifth-grade Damascus Elementary School student out of jail, WBRE reported. ""Tristen really kind of doesn't have an idea of what is going on,"" Brown told the station. Brown added, ""Jail is still jail, no matter what part of the facility you are in."" Brown also can petition a judge to transfer the case to juvenile court. Janine Edwards, Wayne County district attorney, said Pennsylvania law made it mandatory ""that a criminal homicide charge be first directly filed in adult court by the prosecutor regardless of the age of the perpetrator,"" WBRE reported. ""It is not a choice I made,"" she told the station, adding that a juvenile detention center will not accept a child charged with homicide. ""It's not a choice the warden made. It's not a choice Pennsylvania State Police made."" The age of the defendant was unusual, she told the station. ""That's not something I've seen,"" she said. ""I'm not sure how many times that's been seen in Pennsylvania or not."" Police were initially called to the home of Kurilla's grandfather, Anthony Virbitsky, in Damascus Township on Saturday morning with a report that an elderly woman had died there, the affidavit said. Virbitsky was the woman's caretaker, authorities said. The county coroner responded to the home, found Novak's body and transported it to the morgue, the affidavit stated. A few hours later, the boy's mother, Martha Virbitsky, appeared at the state police post with her son and told Trooper John Decker that the boy had confessed to killing Novak, the affidavit said. The boy's mother told police that she ""has had a lot of trouble with Tristen and that he has some mental difficulties"" and had been violent in the past, the affidavit said. Kurilla had told his grandfather that Novak was bleeding from the mouth, but denied having done anything to her, Decker wrote in the affidavit. Anthony Virbitsky told police he checked on Novak but found no blood, although she was breathing heavily. He asked her if she wanted to go to a hospital, the affidavit said, but she refused. When he went to check on her less than an hour later, she was dead, Virbitsky told police, and then his grandson confessed that he had hit her. An autopsy performed Monday discovered ""blunt force trauma to Novak's neck"" and her death was ruled a homicide, the district attorney's statement said. Some residents in Damascus Township took issue with locking up the boy in the county jail. ""I know they see a lot of things but I don't think that they understand what they're doing,"" Kristy Tirney told WBRE. ""I don't know.""","NEW: Boy's lawyer says his client ""really kind of doesn't have an idea of what is going on""

"(CNN) -- The use of mobile phones to transfer money, make payments and access financial services has revolutionized the lives of millions of people who have never had access to traditional banking services. Particularly in emerging markets, ""mobile money"" means so much more than just a digital way to transact financial services. In some countries, the majority of the population lives outside of urban centers without easy access to infrastructure like transport, electricity and even roads, let alone banking. For these communities, where literacy levels tend to be lower and incomes sporadic, mobile money is truly transforming the socio-economic landscape . Latest statistics demonstrate the tremendous growth we've seen over the past few years -- as of October 2014, there are a total of 251 live mobile money services across 88 countries. In Sub-Saharan Africa, one of the pioneering regions for mobile money, services are available in 38 out of 47 countries. And nine of these markets -- Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Kenya, Madagascar, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe -- have more mobile money accounts than bank accounts, a fact that underscores the pent-up demand. Widening the mobile money market . This huge uptake in mobile money is connecting millions of people but there is still much work to be done to bring these services to all who are unbanked or underbanked. For instance, in markets like Central Asia, mobile money is still in its infancy and with only 5% of the adult population in countries such as in Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan holding an account at a formal financial institution, clearly the opportunity to effect change is enormous. My job affords the privilege of witnessing first-hand how the mobile and financial industries are working together to overcome barriers to the adoption of financial services. Take Ivory Coast, for example, where three years after the launch of the country's first mobile money service, there were just over two million registered accounts and only 22% were active. It was a slow start. However, positive changes in market conditions, combined with activities by mobile operators including Orange, MTN and Etisalat, have stimulated a dramatic uptake in adoption. By mid-2013, the country had close to five million mobile money accounts and active accounts climbed to 35%. Changes in social norms are a major factor driving the adoption of financial services. For example, many people travel away from home to work and send cash back home to family. Often this might involve paying for an expensive postal service, incurring high wire money transfer fees or entrusting their cash to a third party to transport it. Mobile transactions are not free, but they're less expensive and far more secure than the alternative. We are also seeing acceleration in the development of other types of mobile financial services, beyond payments, such as savings, credit and insurance, among others. Empowering women . Our research has shown that women are active household financial managers and tend to reinvest up to 90% of their earnings in their families, compared to 30-40% for men, so mobile money can also be a route to female empowerment within communities. Particularly in markets where social or cultural barriers prevent women from traveling long distances or interacting with men, mobile money offers an important tool for financial independence and household security. Operators are responding to address the needs of women; in Somaliland, mobile operator Telesom made adjustments in existing processes -- such as hiring female staff to assist with customer registrations -- and saw the percentage of women customers grow from 17% to 24% in just a few months. Despite the great progress we are making in driving financial inclusion, the reality is that we have only scratched the surface in terms of what mobile money can do and who it can help. To extend these benefits to as much of the community as possible, there are a number of key elements that need to be in place. Supportive and effective regulation is critical in enabling providers to effectively reach scale in serving unbanked customers around the world. Regulators can help expedite efficient mobile money distribution networks that allow customer registration, cash collection and disbursement activities to be outsourced to third parties to lower the cost of financial services and expand their reach. And perhaps the most important factor in the long-term success of mobile money is an open and level playing field that allows non-bank mobile money providers -- including mobile operators -- to enter the market. The mobile and financial industries need to work collaboratively with each other and with regulators to unlock the transformative social impact of mobile money. Only then can we truly deliver life-changing mobile financial services to the hundreds of millions of people across the world that still have no access to traditional banking.

"Seoul (CNN) -- New images of North Korea's main satellite launch site show that an upgrade allowing for larger rockets has been completed, raising the possibility of a fresh launch within the year, a new report says. Based on satellite images of the Sohae Satellite Launching Station, located on North Korea's west coast close to the Chinese border, the report was posted on the 38 North website, run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University. ""North Korea is now ready to move forward with another rocket launch,"" concluded the report by retired imagery technology expert Nick Hansen, adding that if the political decision were made to proceed, ""a rocket could be launched by the end of 2014."" The satellite pictures appeared to show that a yearlong construction project at the Sohae facility had been completed, including the upgrade of the launch pad and gantry tower to enable the launch of rockets larger than the existing Unha-3 space launch vehicle, said the report. A South Korean Defense Ministry official, who would not be named in accordance with protocol, said Seoul was monitoring developments. ""Our military is observing closely all activities regarding the situation of construction and possibility of a missile launch at the North Korean Sohae Launching Site,"" the official said. Larger rockets? The U.S.-Korea Institute said the development would allow the Sohae facility to launch rockets up to 50 meters in length -- considerably larger than the Unha-3, which is about 30 meters long. North Korea last fired an Unha-3 in December 2012, in a controversial launch that successfully put a satellite in orbit. While Pyongyang insisted the test was for scientific purposes, many nations, including the United States and South Korea, considered it a cover for testing ballistic missile technology. The launch resulted in increased U.N. sanctions on the diplomatically isolated state. The 38 North report stated that the ""most likely candidate"" for any potential launch remained the existing Unha-3, since the ""much larger rocket, reportedly under development, is at least several years from becoming operational."" The satellite images also indicated Pyongyang had conducted engine-tests for a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the KN-08, it said, which had been ongoing at the site for at least two years. ""It remains unclear how successful these tests have been. However, rocket motor tests are typically conducted prior to full-scale test launches of a missile that precede a weapon becoming operational,"" said the report. Any decision to launch a rocket would ultimately hinge on political considerations, it said. Is North Korea still digging tunnels to the South? 'Long-term commitment' Daniel A. Pinkston, North East Asia deputy project director at the International Crisis Group, said the reported activity at Sohae was consistent with Pyongyang's statements regarding space launches. ""The Kim family regime has demonstrated the long-term commitment -- over 30 years -- to develop long-range missiles,"" he said. ""It is important to recognize the relative scale of the investment for an economy the size of the DPRK's. State media and other institutions extol the space program and asserts it is absolutely necessary for the country's economic development."" While any decision by Pyongyang to proceed with a launch would take into account domestic and international factors, he said, ""In my view, the DPRK government is fully committed to conducting additional satellite launches, and cannot be dissuaded by the international community."" The Unha-3 did not have military applications, but North Korean scientists and engineers were able to ""apply the know-how they've acquired from the Unha-3 to other missiles,"" he said. ""The DPRK has continued to develop missiles with the intention of acquiring an ICBM,"" he said.","A new report says North Korea has completed a major upgrade of its launch center .
It says the upgrade will allow for larger rockets to be launched .
It says Pyongyang is continuing testing on a road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile .

"(CNN) -- Walmart's response Monday to a lawsuit filed by Tracy Morgan over the car crash that left him in critical condition elicited a response of its own on Tuesday from the recovering comedian -- and it doesn't sound like he's laughing. ""I can't believe Walmart is blaming me for an accident that they caused,"" the former ""Saturday Night Live"" star said in a statement. Police say that a truck driven by Walmart employee Kevin Roper in the early morning hours of June 7 collided with the rear of a limo bus that was carrying Morgan and four others on the New Jersey Turnpike. A preliminary report by the National Transportation Safety Board said that Roper was traveling 20 mph over the speed limit and that he was almost at his drive time limit. The wreck left Morgan, 45, with broken ribs, a broken nose and a broken leg. Morgan's friend, comedian James McNair, was killed, and two others were injured. Roper pleaded not guilty in June to criminal charges that include vehicular homicide and assault by auto. In July, Morgan filed suit against the big box chain, saying the company was negligent for not knowing that Roper had been awake for more than 24 hours at the time of the accident. On Monday, lawyers for the largest retailer in the world responded by pointing the finger back at Morgan in a court filing in which they said the actor's injuries were ""caused, in whole or in part, by plaintiffs' failure to properly wear an appropriate available seat belt restraint device,"" and that Morgan and company had ""acted unreasonably and in disregard of (their) own best interests."" The chain also noted the possibility that the injuries ""may have been caused by third parties over whom Walmart had no control."" ""My friends and I were doing nothing wrong,"" said Morgan. On Tuesday, Walmart issued a more conciliatory statement that downplayed Monday's filing. ""Walmart is committed to working to resolve all of the remaining issues as a result of the accident. As part of the ordinary course of legal proceedings, Walmart filed an initial response yesterday to the lawsuit that included facts and defenses that may impact the case moving forward. While we were required to respond to the lawsuit, we have also taken steps to encourage settlement discussions. Our thoughts continue to go out to everyone involved, and we remain committed to doing what's right."" Morgan -- who has not specified the amount of damages he's seeking -- also had a message for his fans. ""I want to thank my fans for sticking with me during this difficult time. I love you all. I'm fighting hard every day to get back.""","One died, three injured when Walmart truck hit Tracy Morgan's limo .

"(CNN) -- Right before the midterm elections of 2006, George W. Bush made the pitch to voters that the war in Iraq would be in trouble if the Democrats took over Congress. Apparently that was all the incentive the public needed to turn out in huge numbers and give Democrats control of the House and Senate in a crushing midterm defeat. Did it stop the war? Not at all. In fact, Bush doubled down, pushed through the troop surge and basically made it impossible for the 2008 presidential candidates to steer away from the military policies he set forth. In other words, losing the House and the Senate in the sixth year of your presidency doesn't mean your legacy is done for. Of course, Barack Obama is no George W. Bush, and that might be his undoing after a serious shellacking in this week's midterms. First, let's be honest about what happened Tuesday night. The stock market is way up, unemployment is the lowest in six years and gas prices are way down. So, by most objective measures, the country is doing well. Yet over 60% of Americans say we're on the wrong track, and the Democrats got beat in blue and red states, across the country from Massachusetts to Nevada. Five red states voted to increase the minimum wage, a major Democratic issue since 2012, but at the same time those states voted overwhelmingly for Republican candidates who stand against minimum wage increases. And we can't forget just how much everyone hates Congress. Congressional approval has been less than 15% for the last two years. How bad is that approval number? To put it into perspective, 9% of Americans have a favorable opinion of Vladimir Putin, 11% have a favorable opinion of North Korea and 12% have a favorable opinion of Iran. So the U.S. Congress is just barely more popular than most of the Axis of Evil and a Russian leader who makes vague threats about nuclear war with the United States. This probably explains why President Obama was almost buoyant during his autopsy press conference Wednesday afternoon, much more so than his last midterms in 2010. President Obama doesn't have to ""save"" his presidency, but he does have some serious work to do in the next couple of months to make sure the next several years aren't a repeat of the pointless gridlock that has clogged congress since 2010. Here are the key issues he must focus on: . Immigration: Immigration reform is the holy grail of politics that is supposed to magically tie Hispanic voters to one party or another for the next 20 years. The truth is that immigration policy is both a serious domestic and national security issue that for too long has been obstructed by vehement tea partiers and limited by President Obama's overly cautious nature. The President's plan to do immigration reform by executive order is actually a good idea, not just for his legacy, but also because it will either force the Republicans to offer and pass a cohesive counter-bill, or simply let Obama handle the policy and move on. Minimum wage: One of the great ironies of the midterm elections of 2014 was that Republican candidates generally ran against increasing the minimum wage, but the red states they were elected by voted to increase the minimum wage. Right now, before Republicans take over the Senate, the President should make a push to pass a minimum wage increase once again. He can frame a vote on the minimum wage as a gift to incoming Republicans. If Congress can pass a minimum wage bill before the new Congress starts in January, freshmen Republicans won't be in the unenviable position of fighting against a policy overwhelmingly passed in their home states. Civil rights: President Obama appears poised to pick Brooklyn Prosecutor Loretta Lynch to replace Eric Holder, a nomination that thus far shouldn't cause too much controversy. But he needs to cram through as many judges and appellate appointments as he can in the next several months. The Republican Party has refused to vote on, or just plain old rejected, a historic number of President Obama's judicial appointments. The President is now in a position to trade. Republicans know that President Obama will likely veto the vast majority of the bills the new Senate will send him. Perhaps in exchange for letting more judicial appointments through, and ending the confirmation logjam of appointments he's already made, the President can offer concessions on the number and types of bills from the GOP that he'll veto. Foreign policy: The biggest challenge going forward for President Obama will likely be foreign policy. Nuclear negotiations with Iran, sanctions on Russia and ISIS will all be issues that expected new Senate committee heads like Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, and John McCain, R-Arizona, will be champing at the bit to challenge President Obama on. Of course, most of these issues can be managed tactfully by the President if he decides to act swiftly as opposed to simply bickering with the opposition. A final deal developed with Iran and the U.N. Security Council can be signed, sealed and delivered by the November 24 deadline if the president acts fast enough. Any tougher sanctions bills coming out of Congress in 2015 would look foolish when the President has already negotiated a deal. McCain will be calling for boots on the ground to fight ISIS, and while that is something President Obama has stood against, the reality is that sending ""security"" support to the Middle East could assuage some of McCain's blood lust and curry favor with other hawks over the next two years. The midterm elections were not good for the Democrats, nor were they good for President Obama. But this doesn't mean he can't get any policies passed. It's just a matter of how committed he is to working as quickly as he can with the ""difficult"" Congress he has in this lame duck session before the ""impossible"" Congress of 2015 comes into office. President Obama had one of the most productive periods of his presidency after the midterm elections in 2010, and there's no reason he can't accomplish similar policy goals now, if he's willing to take the initiative, cut some deals and occasionally stand his ground instead of hoping for some mythical bipartisanship. On the actual policies, the President seems to have the support of the people. The question is whether he will take the hint and act on this.

"(CNN) -- Rather than a bagged lunch, a Pennsylvania first-grader brought bags of heroin into school -- giving some to at least one classmate before teachers caught him with a pocket full of drugs, authorities say. Two days later, the boy's 56-year-old grandmother was arrested on charges of endangering the welfare of children and drug offenses for allegedly losing track of the heroin while babysitting, according to a local district attorney's office. Chester County, Pennsylvania, District Attorney Tom Hogan expressed outrage over any child bringing a drug as potent as heroin into an elementary school. He also lashed out at the boy's school district for not doing more to inform parents as well as authorities, including his office. ""Any exposure to heroin for a young child is likely to result in death,"" Hogan said in a statement released Monday. ""The (grandmother) is lucky that she was not responsible for the death of her own grandson or somebody else's child."" According to a criminal complaint detailed by Hogan's office, Pauline Bilinski-Munion was babysitting her grandson and a 1-year-old baby last Thursday at a residence in Modena, Pennsylvania. Bilinski-Munion had ""brought heroin into the house and lost track of it,"" according to the district attorney's office, which referred to her as ""a known heroin user."" The next day, the 7-year-old brought several bags of heroin with him into Caln Elementary School. Teachers overheard the child talking about the bags, and later found nine bags of what proved to be heroin -- with each bag stamped, ""Victoria's Secret"" -- in the boy's pants pocket, the prosecutor's office said. The child initially claimed he found the heroin in the school yard, only to later admit he'd gotten them from home. The drugs were then handed over to the Coatesville Area School District Police. Another child's mother later claimed that she'd found an additional bag of heroin, with the same ""Victoria's Secret"" wording, on her 7-year-old as they were walking late Friday afternoon in a nearby mall, authorities said. What happened next is a matter of dispute. The school district didn't respond to repeated CNN calls for comment. But CNN affiliate KYW reported that, in a statement, the district ""immediately contacted Caln Township, Coatesville city and (the) South Coatesville Police Departments."" Yet Hogan faulted the school system for what he characterized as its ""late and vague notification to parents about a 'dangerous and illegal' substance,"" and failing to alert his office, which didn't start investigating until hearing about the story in the media on Saturday. ""The school district didn't call 911, didn't call the DA's office, did not freeze all the kids in place, they did not call in emergency personnel to check all the kids to make sure they were OK,"" he told KYW. ""They did not check to see if there was heroin anywhere else around."" Following her arrest Sunday, Bilinski-Munion was charged and held with bail set at $25,000. Efforts by CNN to reach her relatives have been unsuccessful, and it wasn't immediately known who is representing her in court. Authorities: Drug ring targeting top suburban Philly schools busted .

"(CNN) -- The best leaders make us feel unsure of ourselves. This may sound counterintuitive. Aren't leaders are supposed to build confidence? At times, encouraging people is effective. Other times, when people are stuck seeing things one way or they are resistant to change, creating a little discomfort in the conversation could help them grow. People need you to help them think through difficult issues even though they don't feel comfortable in the process. It is very difficult for any of us to question our beliefs and behaviors. Our brain's protective instinct keeps us from in-depth self-exploration. We can only see ""outside the box"" when we read or hear something that surprises our brains. The best way to help people see outside the box to objectively consider their circumstances is to listen to how they describe their situation, reflect on what they are saying, and then ask questions that cause them to review their thoughts and behavior. If your words break through their protective barriers, the moment will feel awkward. They might feel a pinch of anger, embarrassment, or sadness when their blind spot is revealed. Then they grow. Generating insights create breakthroughs in thinking. To create these breakthrough moments, try the DREAM model. It is a coaching approach where you encourage the person to talk as you listen for cluesâ€”gaps in logic, faulty assumptions, fears, attachments to the past, and conflicting valuesâ€”that could be blocks to seeing the way forward. You then share what you hear and you sense, allowing the person to accept or reject your comments. The point is to help the person to think, not to change him or her. This coaching approach creates a two-sided conversation where the recipient feels respected. The steps include: . D: Determine what the person wants as a desired outcome of the conversation. Help the person to define what they want, not what you want for them. Do they want to be seen by others as a leader? Do they want more respect from their peers? Do they want to feel less stressed? Determine what is in the conversation for them so you can then move toward achieving this outcome. R: Reflect on the experiences, beliefs and emotions expressed. When you listen and clarify what you hear, people feel heard and understood. Then you can help them sort out truth from speculation, instantly giving them a view of what else might be true. E: Explore possible sources of blind spots and resistance. Ask about the desires, disappointments, and fears you sense they are feeling. Don't worry about long pauses between your questions and their response. It takes a moment for blind spots to come to light. A: Acknowledge the emerging awareness. Have the other person clearly articulate the key takeaways. Many people will stop and say, ""Wow, I had not thought about it that way before,"" or ""Yes, I see what you mean"" and then plunge forward with a solution. Acknowledging their ""aha"" insight reinforces their new perspective. M: Make sure there's a plan or commitment for what's next. Ask the person what they will now do and when they will do it. Even if they say they have to take some time to think about what they discovered, ask how they will do this and what impact their new thinking will have on the desired outcome they defined when you started the conversation. When reflecting, exploring, and acknowledging, quiet your judgmental brain and refrain from jumping in and giving the person advice. The Discomfort Zone is full of tips and examples on how to use the process in your conversations. The best advice: They want you to be present more than they need you to be perfect!

"Washington (CNN) -- Election night was terrible for the Democratic Party, and Hillary Clinton was not spared. Clinton visited 20 states and stumped for 26 candidates ahead of Election Day 2014. Her midterm record was an abysmal 11 wins, 14 losses and one runoff, according to CNN projections. But there is an argument - Clinton advisers will spin it to you - in the context of what appears to be an all-but-certain run in 2016, that her Midterm record is far less important than what she gained while campaigning for Democrats. Re-learning to stump . Going into the Midterms, Clinton's mostly paid speeches were corporate and dull. She addressed audiences that were full of executive types who did not alawys seem excited to see her; many of whom were attending conferences that had no connection to the former secretary of state. That changed during Clinton's time on the campaign trail. The former secretary of state stretched her long-dormant political legs and toyed with what will likely be her presidential message. She honed a new message based on women's rights and opposition to Wall Street and - perhaps most importantly - got some needed practice ahead of a possible presidential run. When the former secretary of state took the stage at September's Tom Harkin Steak Fry in Iowa - her first real political speech of the year - she appeared to reporters on the ground to be flat and out-of-practice. That afternoon, the crowd responded with far more excitement to Tom Harkin, their retiring senator, and Bill Clinton, Hillary's husband and the former president. But over time during the Midterms, Clinton became more comfortable on the stump. ""Elections come down often to who's got more money, who's peddling more fear and who turns out,"" Clinton confidently told an excited audience in North Carolina in October. She didn't she away from hitting her Republican opponents and drawing some contrast between them and the person she was endorsing. Most noticeably, Clinton honed her focus on women. Nearly every event Clinton did was geared towards some combination of mothers and grandmothers. In Pennsylvania she spoke to a ""Women for Wolf"" event, while in Louisiana it was ""Moms and Grams with Mary"" who filled the event space. Clinton seemed to embrace the theme and recognize that fact that if she runs for president, it will be from a historic perch as possibly the nation's first woman president. ""Don't let anyone dismiss what you're doing today as women's work,"" she told an audience in San Francisco. ""Don't let anyone send you back to the sidelines."" As Clinton has grown back into the role of retail politician, though, so have her Republican detractors. Groups like the Republican National Committee and America Rising learned how to prod Clinton and poked her with emails to reporters and tweets about her gaffes. They sometimes drove the media conversation and seized on mistakes she made. Shortly after the Senate officially turned red on Tuesday, Rand Paul's Facebook page uploaded a photo of Clinton and the six losing Senate candidates that she endorsed. ""HillarysLosers,"" read the photos that went gangbusters online. The morning after the country, effectively, turned red, the Republican National Committee blasted an email to reporters: ""Hillary's Policies Were On The Ballot."" 'This is bigger than a single surrogate' Clinton's closest confidants also don't see Tuesday as a repudiation of Clinton. ""This is bigger than a single surrogate,"" said a Clinton source with knowledge of her midterm schedule who requested anonymity to speak candidly. ""No surrogate is that, sort of, silver bullet."" The source added that going into the midterms there was a realization that Clinton ""hasn't given a political speech, certainly on any regular basis, in six years."" Given that, and despite her less than 50 percent batting average with successful candidates, people close to Clinton felt confidant that the midterms were time well spent for the former first lady. ""I think her going back in for Grimes was a good example [of not shying away from tough races], going to Iowa twice, too"" the source said. ""There was no, 'Oh man, we ought to pull out of here because it is going to be a loss."" The source argued that 2016 didn't come up a great deal during the conversations about where to go in 2014. Growing from the book tour . Hillary Clinton's book tour was defined by her gaffes in the interviews trying to sell it. Out of the gate, Clinton slipped up answering questions about her and her husband's wealth - pointing out the now mega-rich couple was ""dead broke"" when they left the White House - and it seemed like she was never fully able to recover. Longtime Clinton confidants were concerned about her book tour performance. ""With the book tour, there were a lot of unforced errors. That was concerning,"" said one longtime Clinton adviser. ""It was an open question whether she was going to fumble about her wealth."" But watching Clinton on the stump, the source said, it seemed that Clinton kicked off the rust. Republicans see it differently. ""She is going to have to meet a reality where talking about only war on women issues and raising the minimum wage is not sufficient to win a national election or elections in these states,"" said Tim Miller, executive director of America Rising, said after Tuesday night. ""I think that is a reality that the whole Democratic Party is going to have to meet but Hillary Clinton was gung ho about that message, too."" The midterms also weren't rhetorically flawless for Clinton. In Boston, the former first lady ""shorthanded"" a line that seemed to hint it wasn't ""corporations and business that create jobs."" Clinton went on to walk back the comment that was, for the most part, her only noticeable gaffe for two months on the stump. That is a departure from her book tour, a two month long affair riddled with slips of the tongue, and confidants were happy to see her gaffe on the populist side of the party. ""Was it completely without these sort of perceived bumps? No,"" said the source with knowledge of Clinton's midterm schedule. ""But, at the end of the day, was it viewed as time well spent? Yes.""","Hillary Clinton helped Democrats campaign during the 2014 Midterm .

"AOKIGAHARA FOREST, Japan (CNN) -- Aokigahara Forest is known for two things in Japan: breathtaking views of Mount Fuji and suicides. Also called the Sea of Trees, this destination for the desperate is a place where the suicidal disappear, often never to be found in the dense forest. Japan's Aokigahara Forest is known as the ""suicide forest"" because people often go there to take their own lives. Taro, a 46-year-old man fired from his job at an iron manufacturing company, hoped to fade into the blackness. ""My will to live disappeared,"" said Taro. ""I'd lost my identity, so I didn't want to live on this earth. That's why I went there."" Taro, who did not want to be identified fully, was swimming in debt and had been evicted from his company apartment. He lost financial control, which he believes to be the foundation of any stable life, he said. ""You need money to survive. If you have a girlfriend, you need money. If you want to get married, you need it for your life. Money is always necessary for your life.""  Watch Taro describe why he wanted to die in ""suicide forest"" » . Taro bought a one-way ticket to the forest, west of Tokyo, Japan. When he got there, he slashed his wrists, though the cut wasn't enough to kill him quickly. He started to wander, he said. He collapsed after days and lay in the bushes, nearly dead from dehydration, starvation and frostbite. He would lose his toes on his right foot from the frostbite. But he didn't lose his life, because a hiker stumbled upon his nearly dead body and raised the alarm. Taro's story is just one of hundreds logged at Aokigahara Forest every year, a place known throughout Japan as the ""suicide forest."" The area is home to the highest number of suicides in the entire country. Japan's suicide rate, already one of the world's highest, has increased with the recent economic downturn. There were 2,645 suicides recorded in January 2009, a 15 percent increase from the 2,305 for January 2008, according to the Japanese government. The Japanese government said suicide rates are a priority and pledged to cut the number of suicides by more than 20 percent by 2016. It plans to improve suicide awareness in schools and workplaces. But officials fear the toll will rise with unemployment and bankruptcies, matching suicide spikes in earlier tough economic times. ""Unemployment is leading to this,"" said Toyoki Yoshida, a suicide and credit counselor. ""Society and the government need to establish immediate countermeasures to prevent suicides. There should be more places where they can come and seek help."" Yoshida and his fellow volunteer, Norio Sawaguchi, posted signs in Aokigahara Forest urging suicidal visitors to call their organization, a credit counseling service. Both men say Japanese society too often turns a cold shoulder to the unemployed and bankrupt, and breeds a culture where suicide is still seen as an honorable option. Local authorities, saying they are the last resort to stop people from killing themselves in the forest, have posted security cameras at the entrances of the forest. The goal, said Imasa Watanabe of the Yamanashi Prefectural Government is to track the people who walk into the forest. Watanabe fears more suicidal visitors will arrive in the coming weeks. ""Especially in March, the end of the fiscal year, more suicidal people will come here because of the bad economy,"" he said. ""It's my dream to stop suicides in this forest, but to be honest, it would be difficult to prevent all the cases here."" One year after his suicide attempt, Taro is volunteering with the credit counseling agency that helped him get back on his feet. He's still living in a shelter and looking for a job. He's ashamed, he said, that he still thinks about suicide. ""I try not to think about it, but I can't say never. For now, the will to live is stronger.""","Forest with stunning views of Mount Fuji is also known as place to die .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Lily Dionne had been in Hollywood a week when she answered an ad on Craigslist looking for actors for an action-adventure film called ""Desert Warrior."" Now, Dionne says she feels betrayed by the California filmmaker who turned the low budget-movie with a threadbare plot into an anti-Islam film that provoked outrage -- with sometimes violent results -- in parts of the Muslim world. When news broke that violent mobs attacked the U.S. consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi, leaving Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans dead, she was overwhelmed. ""I was shaking when I found out. I had no idea,"" Dionne told CNN on Sunday. ""This was a movie that I thought no one would ever see."" Dionne knew the filmmaker as Sam Bacile. But federal officials say his name is Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, a convicted felon with a history of using aliases to hide his actions. Anti-Islam filmmaker meets with probation officer . They consider Nakoula to be the filmmaker behind ""Innocence of Muslims,"" an amateurish film that portrays the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, buffoon, ruthless killer and child molester. Islam categorically forbids any depictions of Mohammed, and blasphemy is an incendiary taboo in the Muslim world. The movie, backed by hardcore anti-Islam groups in the United States, is a low-budget project that was ignored in the United States when trailers were posted on YouTube in July. But after Egyptian television aired certain segments, violent protests erupted in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Palestinian territories. Crew was ""grossly misled"" Dionne was one of about 79 cast and crew who say they were ""grossly misled"" when they answered casting calls on Craigslist, Backstage magazine and other publications in July 2011 for a film that was described as ""an historical Arabian Desert adventure."" But from the beginning, Dionne said the cast and crew had questions, including why the central character in a period piece had a Western name. ""We did wonder what it was about. They kept saying George. And we were like, 'This is the Middle East 2,000 years ago. Who's George?'"" she said. She says never heard any talk of politics or religion from the man she knew as Bacile. After the location shoot wrapped, Dionne said she and others were brought in to dub lines. ""They brought the actors in in post (production) and had them say specific words. Like 'Mohammed,' for example. It was isolated. It wasn't in context,"" she said. ""They'd say 'Say Mohammed,' and they'd (the actors would) say 'Say Mohammed' why?"" When the film was complete, it was no longer a desert adventure about a man named George but rather an anti-Islamic movie about Prophet Mohammed. Opinion: Don't blame the video; defend free speech . ""He knew what he was doing. He was playing us all along,"" Dionne said. Another actress, Cindy Garcia, said last week she spoke with the producer after the unrest began. ""He said he wrote the script because he wants the Muslims to quit killing,"" Garcia said. ""I had no idea he was doing all this."" The 79 cast and crew members released a statement saying they were"" extremely upset and feel taken advantage of by the producer."" They said they were ""shocked by the drastic rewrites of the script and lies that were told to all involved. We are deeply saddened by the tragedies that have occurred."" When news of his movie first broke, the filmmaker, identifiying himself as Bacile, told the Wall Street Journal that he was a 52-year-old Israeli-American real estate developer from California. He said Jewish donors contributed $5 million to finance his film. But Israel's foreign ministry said there was no record of a Sam Bacile with Israeli citizenship. ""This guy is totally anonymous. At this point, no one can confirm he holds Israeli citizenship. And even if he did, we are not involved,"" ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said. A search by CNN of public records related to Bacile came up empty. A search of entertainment records turned up no previous mention of a Sam Bacile, and the directors and writers guilds had no listing for him. In the Journal interview, the filmmaker characterized his movie as ""a political effort to call attention to the hypocrises of Islam."" ""Islam is a cancer,"" he said. ""The movie is a political movie. It's not a religious movie."" Opinion: The reality of Islamaphobia . CNN has not been able to speak with the filmmaker. A production staff member who worked on the film in its initial stages told CNN that an entirely different name was filed on the paperwork for the Screen Actors Guild: Abenob Nakoula Bassely. He believed the filmmaker was a Coptic Christian and when the two spoke on the phone during production, the filmmaker said he was in Alexandria, Egypt, raising money for the film. In Egypt, tension has emerged in recent decades between Muslims and the minority Copts. Another staffer who worked on the film said he also knew the producer as Sam Bassil. That's how he signed a personal check to pay staff. He was married with two children. The daughter helped during production and even brought in lunch on a few occasions, the staffer said. Neither staffer wanted to be identified for security reasons. Opinion: Video does not represent Coptic community . Nakoula's criminal record . In the days that have followed, federal officials have confirmed that the man calling himself Bacile is, in fact, Nakoula, a man with a criminal record and history of using aliases. Nakoula was convicted of bank fraud in 2010 and served one year in federal prison at Lompoc, California, before being released on supervised probation for five years. According to court records, Nakoula used at least 17 false names. Over the weekend, Nakoula was questioned by federal probation authorities who are conducting a review of his case to determine if he violated any of the conditions of his parole. Karen Redmond, a spokeswoman for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, didn't provide details of why or when the probation review was initiated, or how long the process would take. While on probation, Nakoula can't access computers or any device that can access the Internet without approval from his probation officer. The terms of his parole also says he cannot ""use, for any purpose or for any manner, any name other than his/her true legal name or names without prior written approval of the Probation Officer."" Anti-Muslim activist Steve Klein, who said he was a script consultant for the movie, said the filmmaker told him his idea was to make a film that would reveal ""facts, evidence and proof"" about the Prophet Mohammed to people he perceived as radical Muslims. ""Our intent was to reach out to the small minority of very dangerous people in California and try to shock them into understanding how dangerous Islam is,"" Klein said. ""We knew that it was going to cause some friction, if anybody paid attention to it,"" he said. But when Klein went to the film's screening in a Los Angeles theater, no one was there. ""It was a bust, a wash,"" he said. But a while later, the trailers were online. They were segments focusing on the Prophet Mohammed and posted under the title, ""Innocence of Mohammed."" The trailers were translated into Arabic, and Egyptian television aired certain segments. The fury erupted. Since then, Nakoula has been out of public view and ensconced with his family in their home in Cerritos, California, where journalists have been gathered seeking information about his elusive background.

"Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Six members of the Ukrainian armed forces were killed on Tuesday in a ""terrorist attack,"" the Ukrainian Defense Ministry said in a statement on its website. The incident took place in the village of Oktyabrski in the Slovyansk region, about 20 kilometers from Kramatorsk, during ""a unit movement from the military base."" The location is in volatile eastern Ukraine. ""Our soldiers were attacked in an ambush. Terrorists attacked our land troops with grenades. The attackers were more than 30 people and set an ambush near the river,"" the ministry said. ""After a long shootout, six soldiers of The Ukrainian Armed Services were killed,"" the statement said. In another incident in eastern Ukraine, a separatist leader has been injured in a suspected assassination attempt, a spokesman said Tuesday, amid continuing turmoil in the wake of a controversial weekend referendum on independence. A car carrying the ""Luhansk people's governor"" Valeriy Bolotov was fired on Tuesday in the Luhansk region, said Vasiliy Nikitin, a spokesman for the self-declared ""Luhansk People's Republic."" Bolotov suffered a gunshot injury, but Nikitin said it was ""light"" and not life threatening. It is not known who was behind the shooting. The reported attacks comesamid simmering tensions in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, where pro-Russian separatists staged a referendum Sunday asking residents whether they should declare independence from Ukraine. Speaking in Brussels, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk had strong words for Russia, saying it continues to support the separatists behind the unrest. ""Russia will fail to make a failed state,"" he said, as he urged Moscow to condemn the pro-Russian militants. Yatsenyuk said the priority for Ukraine was to hold free and fair national elections on May 25, after which, he said, ""we expect to have a new, legitimate president."" The Prime Minister warned that Ukraine would pursue Russia through the courts over its annexation in March of Ukraine's Crimea territory, including an oil and natural gas company based there. Ukraine will also challenge Russian energy giant Gazprom in court unless it agrees to renegotiate the price it charges Ukraine for natural gas supplies, Yatsenyuk said. Gazprom said the recent sharp increase, from $268.50 to $485 per 1,000 cubic meters, was necessary because Ukraine is billions of dollars in arrears. Yatsenyuk said Ukraine would pay what it owes, but only if Gazprom revises the natural gas deal in line with market rates. ""Russia is to stop using natural gas as another type of Russian weapon,"" he said. 'Decisive role' German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, speaking alongside Yatsenyuk earlier in Kiev, warned that the situation in eastern Ukraine is ""still dangerous and threatening,"" and backed efforts by the interim government to start a national dialogue. Steinmeier said the May 25 presidential elections would play a ""decisive role"" in restoring calm to Ukraine and urged steps to disarm the illegal separatist groups who have seized key buildings in the east. He also praised the interim government for its handling of the crisis. Steinmeier's visit is the latest in a series by foreign diplomats seeking a peaceful resolution to what has become the worst East-West crisis since the end of the Cold War. Their efforts have done little so far to prevent pro-Russian militants from tightening their grip on Ukraine's east and south . Nearly 90% of voters in the Donetsk area favored secession, the head of the central election commission for the self-declared Donetsk People's Republic said Tuesday. He said just over 10% voted against the move. Separatist leader Denis Pushilin said Monday that the Donetsk region was not only independent, but also would ask to join Russia. There was no immediate response from Ukraine's government or the European Union. Pushilin's announcement was reminiscent of separatists' moves in the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which Russia annexed after Crimeans voted to secede from Ukraine and join Russia in a March 16 referendum. Acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov said Monday of the referendum: ""That farce the terrorists call a referendum is nothing else but a propagandist cover for killings, kidnapping, violence and other grave crimes."" EU, Canada impose sanctions . Sunday's referendum was also widely condemned by the international community. In its wake, Western leaders have imposed fresh sanctions in the hopes of pressuring Russia into reining in the pro-Russian militants. The European Union sanctioned 13 people Monday over the Ukraine crisis, bringing the total number subject to EU visa bans and asset freezes to 61, an EU diplomat said. Two Crimean entities are also sanctioned. Those targeted in the latest round, whose names were only released Tuesday, include Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, the self-declared Mayor of Slovyansk, a rebel stronghold in the Donetsk region, and Vladimir Shamanov, commander of the Russian airborne troops. Meanwhile, Canada has imposed sanctions on 12 additional people, six Russians and six Ukrainians, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said in a statement. Canada's expanded sanctions list includes Russian military chief Valery Gerasimov; Russian State Duma vice-speakers Sergei Neverov and Lyudmila Shevtsova; and Igor Girkin, known as ""Strelok,"" who is accused of being a Russian saboteur and militant leader in eastern Ukraine. Also named by Canada are Crimean politicians and five representatives of the self-proclaimed republics and militias in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Canada's government had previously approved sanctions against nine Russian politicians and businessmen, two Russian credit organizations and 16 Russian companies. Russia, which said it respected the will of the people of Luhansk and Donetsk in Sunday's vote, has not so far responded to Pushilin's announcement that he will seek annexation by the Russian Federation. Moscow denies having direct influence over the separatist groups. They went ahead with the referendum despite a call from Russian President Vladimir Putin to delay it. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told reporters Monday that Russia finds the EU sanctions highly regrettable, according to Russian state media. ""It's an absolutely thoughtless and irresponsible policy that doesn't match reality in any way,"" news agency ITAR Tass quoted him as saying. Hague: More sanctions in the pipeline . Addressing Parliament in London on Tuesday, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague urged Russia to use its influence to de-escalate the situation and disarm the militants -- or face more tough measures. Additional sanctions are being prepared, he said, and the European Union is ready to impose them if needed. ""Because we have now widened the criteria substantially there are now many more individuals and entities who could be added,"" he said of the sanctions list. Hague added that planning for a range of wider economic and trade measures is ""at an advanced stage."" EU members accepted that such measures would hurt their own economies as well as Russia's, Hague said, but were united over the ""triggers"" that would mean they were brought into force. On Twitter, Hague said that Britain would back Ukraine's May 25 presidential elections by providing 100 observers for the Organization for Security and Cooperation mission and Â£429,000 ($723,000) in financial aid.

"(CNN) -- There can't be many people who pick an air carrier based solely on the quality of their inflight food, but those who do might want to pay attention to the latest awards from New York food mag Saveur. The magazine's annual dining survey ranks airlines for the quality of their chow while also doling out awards in 20 other categories. Saveur's Culinary Travel Awards polled a panel of 36 experts and, separately, its readers to select winners. When it comes to economy class food, Singapore Airlines was crowned king by both readers and experts. Meanwhile, Australia's Qantas was acknowledged by both as having the best inflight wine program. Readers and experts differed when it came to first and business class dining -- the experts chose Emirates, the readers went for Oman Air. The two groups had different views on the rest of the awards, except for the best city for markets, with Tokyo getting the unanimous nod. Best food and cocktail cities . The experts voted Hong Kong (International) as the best large food destination. In addition to the usual suspects -- Michelin-star restaurants Lung King Heen, Tim Ho Wan and Bo Innovation for Chinese food in Hong Kong -- the experts also recommended eating at local seafood market Lei Yue Mun. New York's Brooklyn borough was named best U.S. large city food destination for its ""close proximity to farms and food producers and a truly collaborative community of food lovers, artisans, and chefs."" The best small culinary destinations are Copenhagen (international) and New Orleans (U.S.). The experts recommended NOMA, Kadeau and Restaurant Schoennemann in Copenhagen and called New Orleans' dining options ""dizzying."" The readers' food destination choices included Paris (large international city), San Sebastian (small international city), San Francisco (large U.S. city) and Portland (small U.S. city).

"PLIMOTH PLANTATION, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Modern-day pilgrims to Plimoth Plantation have much curiosity about life in the re-creation of an English village from the 1600s and a Native American homesite. But some of the thousands of people who visit daily to get a glimpse of how the first colonials existed and created the Thanksgiving tradition bring with them misconceptions about the Native people. Linda Coombs, left, and Paula Peters take a gentle approach to correct visitors to the homesite. Paula Peters, of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, said one of the first things she learned when she started working at Plimoth in Massachusetts 30 years ago was: ""People will say things that will hurt you."" A parent might reprimand their children by saying, ""If you don't behave I am going to leave you with this Indian squaw and she will cook you for dinner,"" Peters said. Officials who run the site say they have tried to educate visitors by putting up signs asking them to avoid stereotypes and showing a short film at the beginning of the tour explaining what really happened when the Pilgrims first arrived in Plymouth. Still, ""People take a lot of liberties with Native people,"" Peters said. Some have even told her: ""I thought we killed all of you."" Linda Coombs has heard that too. She has been an educator and interpreter at Plimoth since the 1970s. She says sometimes the ignorance can be fairly benign, such as when a visitor looks at Native food and asks, ""You're not going to eat that are you?"" But at other times, the misconceptions can be offensive. An adult chaperone recently asked a Cherokee, Tim Turner, ""Where do you get your alcohol?"" Turner told the visitor that his comment was inappropriate and then walked away -- which is what Coombs trains her staff to do. ""We try to help people understand how offensive that statement is, and then replace it with truthful information,"" Coombs said. Peters likes to quote another Native American, Ella Sekatau, a Narragansett, who says ""ignorance is like a stone wall. If you try to fight it, you will end up with bloody fists. Instead you must take down each stone, gently, one at a time."" So when a child is war-whooping and the parent says ""stop acting like a wild Indian,"" Peters said you have to ""carefully dismantle the myth. It's a delicate procedure."" The gentle approach appears to be working. Evelyn Hardin from Shutesbury, Massachusetts, who makes the 100-mile trek to Plimoth every year at Thanksgiving to remind herself and her family where it all started, said her family ""has learned to be more sensitive to the Native culture."" Peters agreed that many visitors do seem to get the message. ""In a great many cases we do take a stone off the wall and sometimes you even see a light on the other side."" The best progress is made with schoolchildren who have not been tainted by inaccurate history lessons or so many old cowboy and Indian movies, Peters said. And Plimoth, with its homesite staffed by Native Americans, is a great place for teaching, Peters said. ""We have a unique opportunity here because of our history to teach them about our culture and dispel the myths.""","Native Americans at famed Pilgrim site work to counter misconceptions .

"Beijing (CNN) -- Vladimir Putin is seeking China's support in Russia's standoff with Western powers over Ukraine. In a rare phone conversation, Putin briefed his counterpart in Beijing, President Xi Jinping, on ""Russia's position on the issue and measures Russia had taken to tackle the crisis,"" the state-controlled Xinhua news agency reported Wednesday. President Xi said the situation in Ukraine is ""highly complicated and sensitive,"" which ""seems to be accidental, (but) has the elements of the inevitable."" He added that China believes Russia can ""push for the political settlement of the issue so as to safeguard regional and world peace and stability"" and he ""supports proposals and mediation efforts of the international community that are conducive to the reduction of tension."" The Chinese leader's comments followed similarly guarded statements by Chinese diplomats earlier this week, which neither criticized nor supported Moscow's actions over Ukraine. Unsurprisingly, Russia has attempted to depict China's position as more supportive than it actually is. In describing an earlier phone call between the foreign ministers of China and Russia, the foreign ministry in Moscow said Monday that there was ""a broad convergence of views between Russia and China in connection to the situation in Ukraine and around it."" READ MORE: Russia threatens Western assets . In fact, China's foreign ministry spokesman provided more nuanced statements. ""It is China's longstanding position not to interfere in others' internal affairs,"" Qin Gang said in a regular press briefing over the weekend. ""We respect the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."" Qin did not criticize Russia for sending troops into Ukrainian territory but he repeated China's call for dialogue to resolve the standoff. Referring to the demonstrations in Ukraine's capital last month that culminated in the removal of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych, he said: ""We condemn the recent extreme and violent acts there and have been urging the relevant parties in Ukraine to resolve their internal disputes peacefully."" OPINION: Why Putin's move is no surprise . Asked if China recognized the new Ukrainian government, he replied: ""This requires a judgment to be made based on the laws of Ukraine."" Spokesman Qin's equivocation shows the delicate balance China is trying to strike to maintain good relations with Russia without alienating itself completely from the United States and Europe. Russian bulwark . To be sure, there is no love lost between China and Russia. At the height of the Cold War in the 1960s, China and the former Soviet Union -- the two largest Communist states in the world -- were bitter ideological enemies. At one point, Moscow reportedly deployed an estimated 500,000 troops along its border with China. As for Washington's strategic partnership with China, it had been rooted largely in a shared enmity toward a common enemy -- the Soviet Union. Relations only started to thaw towards the end of the 1980s when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev visited Beijing. But the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe, which led to the collapse of the Soviet empire itself, turned a new page in Sino-Russia relations with trade quickly replacing rhetoric. For more than two decades, Moscow has been Beijing's major supplier of military equipment, some of which has been instrumental in the modernization of the People's Liberation Army, while China also relies on Russia to satisfy its huge thirst for energy, and has been the main beneficiary of the Russian Eastern Siberia -- Pacific Ocean oil pipeline. READ MORE: Same crisis, different versions . China also considers Russia to be a necessary bulwark against the U.S. and European Union influence around the world, often standing with Moscow on matters at the United Nations. ""In the past, China and Russia have often worked together to block international action (often led by the West) to address global crises, by claiming their respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty,"" said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center of Global Policy in Beijing, noting their recent veto of sanctions against the Syrian regime. ""In practice, this mutual cooperation is more closely related to Moscow and Beijing's interests than their adherence to the principle of non-interference. China has supported Russia in its sphere of influence, such as in the Syrian crisis, expecting that Russia would support China's interests in Asia, on issues such as North Korea. ""The blatant hypocrisies in Russia's policies and actions have been evident this week as Russia invaded Ukraine while continuing to oppose further sanctions or action in Syria out of respect for Syria's territorial integrity and sovereignty."" China's balancing act . Yet China seems likely to remain noncommittal over Ukraine. ""China may think its interests are better served by continuing to avoid taking a clear stance, hoping that it will be well positioned whatever the outcome,"" said Haenle. ""But given China's enhanced influence and power, the international community increasingly looks to China for a more principled approach and to take a leadership role to help resolve international crises, not simply position itself to be in the most advantageous situation when it is all said and done."" Other China watchers believe Beijing's stance may be rooted in issues closer to home, noting that the country does not want to give the appearance of backing a separatist movement, given its own problems with ethnic tensions, primarily in the western regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. READ MORE: China's restive far west . ""China does not want to take a position that will haunt it domestically,"" said a Chinese analyst who declined to be identified because he is not authorized to speak on the record on the topic. ""China has its own challenges concerning ethnic relations and even separatist groups. It has to take a cautious even-handed approach."" Ukraine interests . China will also be considering its considerable interests in Ukraine too -- especially its economic ties with the now deposed government in Kiev. Bilateral trade last year reached $10 billion, making China Ukraine's second largest trade partner, according to Xinhua. ""China has significant interest in Ukraine's future stability,"" added Haenle. ""China is an important trading partner of Ukraine's and last December formed a strategic partnership with Ukraine, committing billions of dollars in investment in Ukraine's infrastructure, aviation, energy, agriculture, and finance industries. China is also Ukraine's military industry's largest customer; China bought its first aircraft carrier from Ukraine."" Shen Dingli, professor of International Relations at Shanghai's Fudan University, believes a pragmatic China would be open to working with the fledgling administration in Kiev. ""If the current Ukraine government can hold on,"" Shen explained, ""then China may work on its relations with the new Kiev government, as it is more important to keep its stakes, including economic and defense links, with the new regime."" Whichever way the Ukraine crisis turns, other analysts believe China could benefit from it. ""Ukraine will need China's economic cooperation, whether it's a friend of the EU and the U.S., or of Russia,"" said Wenfang Tang, of the University of Iowa. ""Meanwhile, facing greater pressure and potential sanctions from the West, Russia will be happy to strengthen its relationship with China.""

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero Wednesday ordered a review of his country's nuclear power plants in light of the crisis unfolding in Japan, where workers are battling to contain radioactive materials at a plant after an massive earthquake and tsunami. Spain is the latest in a number of countries around the world who are giving their nuclear programs a second look as Japan tirelessly works to avoid a nuclear disaster. According to nation's nuclear regulatory body, the Nuclear Safety Council, Spain has eight nuclear reactors in operation at six nuclear power plants. ""We should do this, but there are reasons to remain calm about the safety of our nuclear plants and about the reports the Nuclear Safety Council is preparing,"" Zapatero told reporters of his decision for a review. He added, ""What we are going to do is be even more sure and safer. And if there is a needed improvement at some nuclear plant due to a hypothetical risk, that's the work of the Nuclear Safety Council."" Separately, Zapatero said that Spain is not ordering an evacuation of its nationals in Japan because there's been no such request from the Japanese government. Instead, Spain will follow Japan's lead and will try to assist those Spaniards who wish to leave. There are no Spaniards in the affected zone near the nuclear power plant or in other high-risk areas, the prime minister's office reported. There are about 1,900 Spaniards in Japan, more than half of them in the Tokyo area. In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez said that preliminary plans for a nuclear power plant in his country will be halted. He ordered his energy ministry to look for alternative sources of energy. Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced a three-month moratorium on the extension of the operation periods for German nuclear plants. That move will lead to at least one German nuclear plant shutting down very soon, Germany's environmental minister later said in a statement.","The decision was made in light of the crisis in Japan .

"(CNN) -- Hamas claimed responsibility Thursday for shooting a missile that struck an Israeli bus, critically wounding a teenage boy on his way home from school. After not claiming responsibility for the attack earlier in the day, Hamas on Thursday night sent a message to reporters saying the strike was in retaliation for the killing of three Hamas leaders last weekend. After the attack Thursday, and the firing of numerous mortars into Israel, the Israel Defense Forces ""targeted nine terror-activity sites in the Gaza Strip,"" the IDF said in a news release. A military spokeswoman said later that IDF aircraft targeted three smuggling tunnels in southern Gaza in addition to the nine targets mentioned earlier. The additional strikes hit shortly after a cease-fire, negotiated among Hamas and other Palestinian factions, was scheduled to take effect, according to Hamas' Interior Ministry. Hamas said five people were killed and 45 were wounded in the earlier IDF strikes. One of the dead was Saleh Tarbin, a field commander for Hamas, the group said. The school bus was traveling in southern Israel near the Gaza border when it was hit by a type of anti-tank missile known as a Kornet, said Israeli military spokesman Capt. Barak Raz. The Kornet is a Russian-made anti-tank guided missile system that is thought to have a maximum range of 5 1/2 kilometers (3 1/2 miles). A 13-year-old boy was the only passenger on the bus at the time, said Avital Leibovitch, spokeswoman for the IDF. The boy is in critical condition, and the driver has moderate wounds, the IDF said. An IDF statement later in the day listed the boy's age as 16. It was not immediately known if the bus was targeted, but Leibovitch said it looked like ""a direct hit."" Fifteen rockets and mortars were fired into Israel in one hour alone Thursday, the IDF said. An Israeli military official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the Thursday attack was launched from a location about 3 1/2 kilometers away from the bus. There was an attempt to fire a second missile after emergency personnel had responded to the scene, the official said. For reasons unknown to the IDF, the second launch failed. According to the military source, the use of the Kornet is worrying to the IDF because it is a sophisticated rocket system that requires extensive and hands-on training to master. Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak ""instructed the IDF to quickly take all necessary measures and respond to the terrorist attack,"" a statement from his office said. ""He added that he holds Hamas responsible for all terrorist attacks emanating from the Gaza Strip."" Hamas controls the Palestinian government in Gaza. Listed as a terrorist organization by the United States, Hamas has carried out dozens of terrorist attacks killing Israelis and others. A Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Fauzi Barhum, said, ""The resistance movement's response to the enemy's massacre comes as self-defense, and to protect the citizens. It aims to pressure the occupier to stop committing crimes."" The IDF's Leibovitch said the attack was part of ""ongoing terror directed against innocent Israeli civilians"" emanating from Gaza. The IDF said that in the past Palestinian militants have fired anti-tank weapons only at Israeli military targets. This is the first time Palestinians have been known to fire one at a civilian target, an IDF spokesman said. After the incident, Palestinian security sources reported that a police training base and a factory were hit by Israeli fire. There was also an Israeli airstrike east of Rafah, the sources said. The dead included a member of the Hamas security forces and an 18-year-old civilian, security sources said. In total, 26 people were wounded, medical sources said. Hamas said its forces fired mortars and machine guns in response to the Israel attacks. The IDF, in a news release, said its aircraft and artillery forces ""targeted two terrorist squads who were involved in firing military-use projectiles at the Israeli home front,"" and that ""hits were confirmed."" ""Additionally, artillery forces returned fire at the area in the northern Gaza Strip from which the anti-tank missile that hit a school bus was fired,"" the IDF said. The IDF said this week that it has seen an increase in terrorist strikes into the country, counting 128 in March, compared with 61 in February and 83 in January. The IDF also said its ""Iron Dome"" defense system successfully intercepted a rocket fired from Gaza toward Ashkelon in southern Israel. British Foreign Secretary William Hague condemned the bus attack in a statement released Thursday, as did the United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. ""This is a despicable and cowardly act that stands in stark contrast to people's desire for peaceful reform across the region. Violence will never deliver peace. I reiterate that Hamas must halt these strikes immediately, and rein in other militant factions in Gaza,"" said Hague, adding that he is also concerned about reports of deaths in retaliatory strikes. A spokesperson for Ban said he is concerned about the escalating violence and called for ""maximum restraint.""

"(CNN) -- As investigators are determining whether a skull and bones discovered behind an abandoned Central Virginia home on Saturday are those of Hannah Graham, the lone suspect in her disappearance has been indicted in an assault from almost a decade ago -- a case that police say forensically links him to another female college student who vanished from the same area as Graham. Jesse Matthew was indicted by a grand jury in Fairfax, Virginia on Monday for the 2005 sexual assault on charges that also included attempted murder and abduction. According to the indictment, Matthew, 32, ""did feloniously, willfully, deliberately, intentionally and with premeditation attempt to kill (the victim) in the commission of or subsequent to an abduction with the intent to defile."" The then-26-year-old victim in that attack was able to provide enough of a detailed description to yield a police sketch, one that years later would link Matthew to the case of Morgan Harrington, the Virginia Tech student who vanished in Charlottesville in October 2009. Harrington was found dead the following January. Police at the time said ""forensic evidence"" linked the two cases. Fairfax County prosecutor Ray Morrogh said Monday that he could not comment on how this investigation and indictment relates to the Harrington or Graham cases, but said ""the facts and details will be revealed in the judicial process."" Jim Camblos, Matthew's Charlottesville attorney in the Graham case, declined to comment when reached by CNN on Monday. Graham last seen September 13 . Graham, a University of Virginia student, was last spotted on several surveillance cameras in Charlottesville's Downtown Mall area on September 13. The footage showed her leaving the Tempo Bar around 2 a.m., followed by a man investigators think to be Matthew. More than a month later, on October 18, Sgt. Dale Terry of the Chesterfield Sheriff's Department and his small search team were finishing up for the day when behind an abandoned home -- just eight miles from where Hannah Graham was last seen -- they found a skull and bones scattered across a creek bed. ""It was not buried, and its location was not far from the road,"" he told a local television station. ""There was not any crushing of any bones. As far as the skull, everything looked to be intact to me."" Nearby was a pair of black pants, similar to ones Graham was wearing when she was last seen. ""I do believe God wanted us to find what we found,"" Terry said. ""I don't know how else to explain it other than something inside me told me to just continue to look."" After Saturday's discovery, the weekend's remaining public searches were canceled so that authorities could focus their attention ""on recent evidence,"" according to the Virginia Department of Emergency Management. Furthermore, police now consider the Graham case ""a death investigation,"" said County Police Chief Steve Sellers. ""Today's discovery is a significant development, and we have a great deal of work ahead of us,"" Sellers said. ""We cannot and we will not jump to any conclusions."" Forensic psychologist Mike Banks told CNN affiliate WTVR that forensic work could take some time. ""If it is Hannah Graham, 100%, then at least they have their child home,"" he said, referring to Graham's parents, John and Susan Graham. The Albemarle County Police Department said it didn't know how long it will take for the forensic results to come back.","Jesse Matthew indicted in 2005 Virginia sexual assault .

"Editor's note: Campbell Brown anchors CNN's ""Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull"" at 8 p.m. ET Mondays through Fridays. She delivered this commentary during the ""Cutting through the Bull"" segment of Wednesday night's broadcast. CNN's Campbell Brown says 35 children have been dumped since Nebraska made its law. (CNN) -- Right now in the state of Nebraska, the governor is literally begging people not to bring their teenage children there to dump them, so that the state then has to care for them. But it's happening. It's happening a lot. Here is the back story: . You may have heard of safe haven laws. The laws are intended to allow parents to leave an infant at a hospital anonymously and not face prosecution. The goal is to try to prevent unwanted babies from being abandoned. The problem is that unlike other states, Nebraska set no age limit when it passed its safe haven law a few months ago, so people are literally dropping off kids of all ages at Nebraska hospitals.  Watch Campbell Brown's commentary » . In some cases, they are driving to Nebraska from other states to abandon their children. The state Legislature this week is expected to change the law because of this to now impose an age limit. But the 35 kids who have already been dumped are now part of a system. They're old enough to know what's happened. One social worker said some had begged their parents or guardians not to leave, saying they might not understand why they're being left, but they know they're being left. No change in Nebraska's law will deal with the fact there are clearly a lot of parents out there willing to walk away, or they're so overwhelmed they don't know what else to do. One mother who drove from Georgia to leave her son at an Omaha hospital said, ""Don't judge me as a parent. I love my son."" What about family, friends, church, neighbors, social services in your home state? Do all of these options really not exist for that mother? Maybe they don't. Maybe she really did feel that helpless. Nebraska can and will change its law this week, but it seems to me it has just opened a Pandora's box. We have to look and look hard at what is apparently a failure by our states to offer families any other recourse. What is happening in Nebraska should be a wake-up call. We have to look at why in just the few months that law was on the books, 35 children were left behind. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown.","Nebraska law allows children of any age to be left without penalty .

"(CNN) -- Something remarkable is happening Wednesday. A large swath of the Internet is blacking out in protest of two controversial copyright bills being considered in Congress. Major Web juggernauts such as Google and Wikipedia, some graduate schools and a number of start-ups and prominent advocates are participating in what is expected to be the largest organized online protests in more than a decade. While the actions vary from site to site -- some are shutting down, some are turning their pages black -- the message is clear: Neither the Senate's Protect IP Act nor the House's Stop Online Piracy Act represents a consensus view on how to address online piracy without undermining the open Internet, and neither should be rushed to a vote. The bills propose new enforcement tactics to be carried out by Internet intermediaries -- Internet service providers, search engines, payment processors and ad networks -- against foreign websites that flagrantly infringe U.S. intellectual property rights. This is a laudable goal, but some of the proposed measures would do more harm than good, and there is significant risk that the bills as they currently stand could infringe on First Amendment rights. The online backlash against the legislation, which began with the introduction in October of the House bill, known as SOPA, is already having a meaningful impact. Large social media sites and online communities have spread the word, and thousands of Internet users have kept up a steady stream of calls and tweets at their senators and representatives. Under intense pressure from their constituents, Sen. Pat Leahy and Rep. Lamar Smith, the bills' principal sponsors, issued separate statements last week indicating that they would revise the bills to remove requirements that ISPs attempt to block access to websites using the domain-name system, or DNS. In addition, a group of six Republicans -- including co-sponsors of the legislation -- sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid urging him not to proceed to a vote on the Protect IP Act, or PIPA, citing the public outcry as well as their own concerns. And on Saturday, the White House issued a formal response to two petitions that had each received more than 50,000 signatures. The Obama administration said it would oppose legislation that risks online censorship of lawful activity, inhibits innovation or creates new cybersecurity risks -- all charges that have been levied against PIPA and SOPA. It also criticized mandated DNS-filtering on cybersecurity grounds, offered some guiding principles and called for continued discussion between proponents, opponents and the public on how best to proceed. However, the Senate remains scheduled to try to break a filibuster against PIPA next week. If that vote succeeds, the Senate will move to an up-or-down vote on a bill -- currently being revised -- that no one has seen. If the DNS-filtering provision is indeed removed, it will be a major improvement, but this is not PIPA's only problem. Countless technologists and advocates still question whether the remaining enforcement tactics meet the balanced, sensible criteria laid out by the White House. There is still room for debate and a path forward on anti-piracy legislation. Some of PIPA and SOPA's biggest opponents have expressed support for an approach that would ""follow the money"" by requiring carefully targeted action by payment processors and ad networks to stem the flow of revenue to websites that make a business of infringement. But despite rumored changes, PIPA is not yet that bill. Reid should delay next week's Senate vote to give the bill a real chance of developing into something all sides can agree on.

"(CNN) -- Two people yell and struggle on a city street. It happens every day. And when it does, what do you do? Dwayne Fletcher found himself thrust into this position around 9:40 p.m. Sunday, as he was walking in Philadelphia's Germantown-Penn Knox neighborhood. He saw a man seemingly manhandling a woman, then forcing her into a car. Fletcher said he yelled out and called police. The car sped away. But three days later, the two -- Carlesha Freeland-Gaither and the man police say abducted her, Delvin Barnes -- were tracked down 115 miles southwest in Jessup, Maryland. The fact that they were found then and there, police say, is largely thanks to Fletcher. ""This man is a hero,"" Philadelphia police Detective James Sloan said. Abducted woman found alive, suspect arrested . Fletcher didn't stop the alleged abduction, nor did he have enough information to name either the suspect or the victim. But he did pay attention, he immediately contacted authorities, and he told them everything he knew -- something that doesn't always happen, even when crimes take place in full public view. One of the most cited examples of the latter happened in 1964 in New York City. That's where Kitty Genovese struggled with her attacker on the street and in her building, shrieking for help as she was raped, robbed and murdered. According to The New York Times, at least 38 people ""watched a killer stalk and stab a woman in three separate attacks"" over a more than half-hour period. None of them intervened. And only one called police, though only after Genovese was dead. This, of course, isn't the only case of what psychologists and social scientists call the bystander effect or Genovese syndrome, as named after the slain New York woman. Gang rape raises questions about bystanders' role . In 2009, for instance, about 10 people watched a 2Â½-hour-long gang rape of a 15-year-old girl outside a Northern California high school's homecoming dance. And two years later, residents of southern China's Guangdong Province found themselves on the defensive after video came out showing passersby ignoring a toddler getting hit twice by vehicles. Outrage in China after toddler run over, ignored . That's not what happened this week in Philadelphia. Rather, Fletcher told CNN affiliate KYW that when he saw the struggle, ""I called the cops and I'm running and (yelling), 'Yo, yo, what's going on?' "" Fletcher said that he saw the woman forcibly pulled into the car, then saw her attacker get into the same vehicle. ""They were in the car for like 15 seconds. Then you just hear, like, a tap, tap on the window, and then the window come out,"" he told KYW, referring to how Freeland-Gaither managed to kick out one of the car's windows but not escape. After that, Fletcher said, ""I jumped back. I moved back, I didn't know what was going on. I didn't know if it was gunshots or whatever."" The witness called police twice and waited for officers to arrive, Sloan said. Before Philly abduction, suspect allegedly raped, burned girl in Virginia . And what if Fletcher hadn't? What if he'd walked away and never alerted authorities, spurring them to check that area right away for surveillance video? What if, because of that, they'd never gotten a description of the suspect and the getaway car? What if they'd never recovered Freeland-Gaither's cell phone, which police believe she dropped deliberately, hoping it'd lead to her recovery? After all, there are too many examples of abductions that don't end, as this one did, with the safe recovery of the victim and arrest of a suspect. Thanks to Fletcher, authorities don't have to answer any of these questions. While a great deal went into the investigation -- from several key surveillance videos, to tips, to the GPS device that a car dealer, worried about Barnes' bad credit, placed on the alleged getaway vehicle -- it all started with Fletcher. ""If it wasn't for him,"" Sloan said, ""I don't think we would have had the same outcome."" Fletcher, who KYW reports works at a local recycling center, certainly is glad for that and happy to be called a hero. ""It feels good; I wouldn't change it for nothing,"" he said. ""... But tomorrow's another day. I got to go to work. It's back to being Dwayne.""","Dwayne Fletcher saw a man force a woman into a car in Philadelphia .

"(CNN) -- Los Angeles is a funny place. And not just in an ironic sense. Also literally. More funny business happens every day in the world's entertainment capital than anywhere else. Home of blooming talents, top headliners and celebs showing up unannounced on small stages for a quick set, L.A. is where the country's top comic talent gravitates to make you -- and, more importantly, that guy from Fox -- laugh. And not just at those staple industry hubs and comedy franchises you probably know about. L.A.'s comedy circuit radiates well beyond Melrose and the Sunset Strip. From the South Bay to the Westside to North Hollywood to a vaunted stage in Pasadena where a young Robin Williams and some ex-weatherman named David Letterman once showed promise, these comedy venues consistently deliver hilarious goods. West Hollywood . Hollywood Improv, The Laugh Factory, The Comedy Store . Open since: 1970s . Top draws: From Richard Pryor, George Carlin and Rodney Dangerfield to the latest Comedy Central luminaries, decades of the most hallowed names in comedy have called at least one of these three hubs home. Claim to fame: L.A.'s comedy trifecta . Why combine three of the country's biggest comedy club names (which have spawned multiple locations) in one short writeup? Because their flagships are within a four-minute drive of each other, and even if you missed all 400-plus episodes of ""An Evening at the Improv,"" or all 80 straight hours of the longest standup comedy show in history (a benefit held at the Laugh Factory in 2010 featuring about 150 comics) or the last 25 years of the ""Ding-Dong Show"" (Monday nights at The Comedy Store), you probably don't need us to tell you about these places if you're a standup fan. Comedy history continues to be made at these three landmarks, which have drink minimums and an industry-ish vibe. Collectively, they've presided over L.A.'s seminal standup era in the '70s and all of its subsequent renaissances, while jump-starting countless comedy careers in the process.

""The Ice House is the oldest club to continuously showcase standup comedians in the United States -- and probably the world,"" says Bob Fisher, club owner for the last 36 years. As myriad photos and memorabilia hanging on the wall outside the showroom confirm (including a 1979 contract for ""Gary Shandoling"" [sic] to perform an entire week here for $150), this place has hosted, headlined and helped launch the careers of countless performers over the years, and continues to do so.

But this Hermosa Beach institution is much more than that. The low-key room has been a magnet for so many comic vets over the years that its famous green room graffiti (signatures and one liners from many big names) now extends down the back hallway. The club has been a who's who of top and emerging comic talent for nearly four decades. Weekend shows can host up to 10 performers, featuring a range of names you know or soon will, plus the odd illusionist working a set of A-game magic between gags. Smart audiences here (""Are there any engineers in the crowd?"") lean more toward the neighboring aerospace industry than Hollywood.

"(CNN) -- Five things to know about Eid al-Adha: . 1. Considered one of Islam's revered observances, the four-day religious holiday corresponds with the height of the Hajj -- the pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia that annually draws 2 million Muslims. 2. Eid al-Adha commemorates when God appeared to Abraham -- known as Ibrahim to Muslims -- in a dream and asked him to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience. As Abraham was about to sacrifice his son, God stopped him and gave him a sheep to kill in place of his son. A version of the story also appears in the Torah and in the Bible's Old Testament. 3. Pronounced EED al-UHD-huh, the holiday begins Friday and ends Monday -- the last day of the Hajj. Eid al-Adha is also known as the Feast of Sacrifice or Greater Eid. It is the longer of two Eid holidays observed by Muslims. Eid al-Fitr -- or Little Eid -- follows the conclusion of the holy month of Ramadan. 4. During Eid al-Adha, many Muslim families sacrifice a sheep and share the meat with the poor. They also are required to donate to charities that benefit the poor. Muslims also routinely exchange presents during the holiday. 5. Eid Mubarak (pronounced EED muh-BAR-ack) and Eid Saeed are routine greetings used during the observance to offer best wishes. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","The Muslim religious holiday Eid al-Adha begins Friday and ends Monday .

"Kano, Nigeria (CNN) -- At least 15 people were killed Monday in a suicide attack on a Shiite religious ceremony in the northeast Nigerian town of Potiskum and six others in a shooting by soldiers, a Shiite cleric and a paramedic said. A suicide bomber blew himself up amid a large crowd of Shiite Muslims holding the annual Ashura ceremony to commemorate the murder of Imam Husseyn, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed, in Karbala 1,300 years ago. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack, but militants from the Boko Haram Islamist group, who have waged an insurgency in the region for five years, have been responsible for previous attacks in Nigeria. Soldiers who deployed after the blast, in the Tsohuwar Unguwa area of the town, broke into the nearby Shiite seminary and opened fire on mourners who were sheltering from the blast, killing six, said Mustapha Lawan Nasidi, leader of the Shiites in Potiskum. ""A suicide bomber â€Ždetonated explosives he was carrying among a large crowd of people commemorating Ashura near our seminary, Madrasatul Fudiyya, killing 15 people and injuring more than 50 others,"" Nasidi said. ""To our shock, soldiers who deployed to the scene shortly after the blast broke into the seminary, where some people had taken shelter, and opened fire on them, killing six and injuring four others,"" he said. CNN has asked the Nigerian military for comment on the shooting claim but has not received a response. He said the death toll could grow because of the seriousness of the injuries. ""It was a huge crowd, and many of them were affected by the explosion,"" said a policeman who helped evacuate casualties. Tanimu Musa, a paramedic who attended to the â€Žinjured, called for aid. ""We have 21 dead bodies and dozens of wounded. We need more blood and medical supplies to tend to those injured,"" Musa said. This is not the first deadly attack in Potiskum, the commercial hub of Yobe state. In July, four Shiites were killed in an explosion at an open-air mosque in the Dogo Tebo area of town. And in May 2013, three Shiite worshippers were killed and several injured when gunmen fired on people saying their evening prayers outside Nasidi's home. Both attacks were blamed on Boko Haram.

"(CNN) -- The chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee is accusing Republicans of being ""Paleozoic"" on same-sex marriage. ""The Republicans continue to cling to this really Paleozoic commitment (to oppose same-sex marriage)... even going so far as saying we should... explore amending the Constitution to prohibit people from being able to marry who they love,"" Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said Tuesday on MSNBC's ""The Daily Rundown."" While a wave of Senate Democrats and President Barack Obama didn't start endorsing same-sex marriage until the past two years, Wasserman Schultz blasted Republicans for long being ""completely out of touch with the issues that are the most important to voters right now."" Her comments came after a Supreme Court decision Monday effectively cleared the way for same-sex marriage in five states and possibly an additional six states located in the same circuit appeals courts. What's next in the fight over same-sex marriage? GOP's position . Republicans largely stayed quiet on the issue, though Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and some social conservative leaders expressed outrage by what they described as the courts' judicial activism. Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, was on the same MSNBC program Tuesday before Wasserman Schultz. He defended the GOP's platform defining marriage as a union between a man and a woman -- and seeks a constitutional amendment to enforce the idea. ""I'm not running from that position. That's our position on it, and it's still our position today,"" he said. Will same-sex marriage become a 2014 issue? While he understands why conservatives are outraged by the courts' action, he added, the issue is unlikely to spill over into the midterm elections next month. ""People... are right to be concerned about what's happened here, but it doesn't mean it's the issue every single morning that we're dealing with in regards to these midterms,"" he said.","Republicans are ""Paleozoic"" on same-sex marriage, a top Democrat said .

"(CNN) -- The coup was televised through one messenger. When the Thailand military announced it had taken over the government, it also meant that all state-run, satellite and cable TV providers had been ordered to carry only one signal -- that of the army's. Major news channels, including CNN, have been taken off air. Even Cartoon Network and Thai PBS could no longer air their usual programs. Patriotic music showing the military logo dominated broadcast signals. Without radio stations or television channels, those in Thailand who had access to the Internet turned to YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+ and various messaging apps. Trending hashtags related to Thursday's coup included #ThaiCoup and its Thai language version, which translates to ""Coup d'etat 2557"" (2557 is the current Thai year on a Buddhist calendar), as well as a more offbeat #CoupMovies. One user referred to the dozen successful coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932. Social media has become increasingly important in government upheavals. Examples include the Arab Spring, the 2009 Iranian election results protests and the #Euromaidan movement in Ukraine that started late last year. When the flow of information is stemmed through more traditional channels, many seek alternatives for updates and information. Where protests and public gatherings were restricted, people connected and gathered virtually. Thailand remains under martial law, which among other things includes restrictions on where protesters can gather, what TV and radio broadcasters can air and what can be posted on social media. Netizens have been warned by the Peace and Order Maintaining Council (POMC), which has seized power, not to post content that could be considered opposing or critical of the Thai military group. That didn't stop the tweets. ""I'd be surprised if the army did censor social media, because I think it's a really bad move,"" said Jon Russell, Asia editor at The Next Web. ""Already, they've been criticized by the international community for what they've done. Censoring the Internet is an awful means to an end -- they'd lose a lot more than they'd gain from doing it."" Russell, who has lived in Thailand for five years, wrote in a post that ""Thailand has not been afraid to censor social media in the past."" Thailand temporarily banned YouTube in 2007, because of materials deemed offensive to the King, according to news reports. And in 2011, Thai authorities asked Facebook to remove materials considered insulting to the monarchy, according to several outlets. Facebook is the most dominant social network in Thailand, with 26% of the population using it, according to the social management system, Hootsuite. Following is Google+ and Twitter. Instagram is also surging in popularity in the country. Critics of the coup are not the only ones voicing their political thoughts on social media. On Tuesday, a Facebook page purporting to represent the Peace and Order Maintaining Council was created. Its info page said its purpose is to ""distribute news, information and announcements pertaining to POMC."" In just four days, the page had 200,000 Facebook likes.

"(CNN) -- There is no shortage of amazing industrial commercial applications for 3-D printing -- internal organs, stem cells, artificial limbs, art, cars, customizable furniture. But if you had a 3-D printer sitting on your desk at home, what would you make? Some people know immediately: They'd create physical Minecraft models, make manga figurines, pop out replacement parts for a motorcycle. But most people will likely see a 3-D printer, think it's cool, then have no idea what to do next and move on. That could change, though, as dirt-cheap 3-D printers like the Printrbot or new MakiBox simplify the technology and put it in more people's hands and home offices. ""The market for desktop 3-D printers right now is really makers, professional users and people who have a lot of patience and time,"" said Jonathan Buford, the entrepreneur behind the $200 MakiBox 3-D printer. The MakiBox attempts to simplify 3-D printing for a more consumer-friendly experience, by lowering the price and reducing the complexity of assembling the devices and minting objects. Amateurs, basement inventors and hobbyists with no experience printing in three dimensions can jump right in and start experimenting with minimal investment. There are trade-offs, of course. The $200 version uses only the less expensive PLA plastic, which can melt at a lower temperature than other materials. A $300 version of the printer is available that can work with more substances. The final products will be a step down from what you could make with more professional machines. ""We're not optimizing on quality because we think there's actually room for 'good enough,'"" said Buford. The idea for MakiBox grew out of the Makible crowdfunding site. The project's goal was to connect the dots between product prototypes, crowdfunding, and the eventual manufacturing process. Say a product designer comes up with an idea for a pedometer armband. He could raise money from interested mall-walkers, then be guided through the product manufacturing process. Buford has unique experience in all three areas. Based in Hong Kong, he studied mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and has worked as a toy designer. In 2005, he struck out on his own, crowdfunding a product before starting a co-working space in Hong Hong called Boot.hk. He launched Makible in 2011. To get the ball rolling and generate interest in the site, Makible posted a seed project the team had been working on internally: a cheap and fast 3-D printer. Posted in January 2012, the MakiBox kit was priced at $350 and aimed at entry-level consumers who didn't want to drop thousands of dollars on a higher-end desktop 3-D printer like the MakerBot Replicator ($2,000). It quickly raised $100,000, and the team pushed aside the crowdsourcing idea to work full time on the 3-D printer. Now a staff of six full-time employees is perfecting and shipping beta versions of the MakiBox A6 for $200, feeling out the nascent market for cheap 3-D printers. Buford thinks that if the technology becomes more accessible, creative people will come up with broader applications we haven't thought of yet, and desktop 3-D printer sales could take off. Or the 3-D printer could go the way of the home photo printer. When personal photo printers first debuted, there was a spike in sales, but slowly the demand dropped. People weren't printing out as many photos, and if they did it was generally cheaper and easier to have them done by one of the photo services with higher-end printers, such as Wal-Mart or Shutterfly. Staples has already announced plans to offer 3-D printing services in some stores. ""I'm not really sure there is an established market for this or that people do know what they're going to use it for,"" said Buford. ""It's a Wild West market right now; we don't really know where it's going to end up."" Over the next six months, Buford plans to contine rolling out the MaxiBox while also returning to the idea of connecting engineers, inventors and product developers to the sometimes confusing world of manufacturing. He's already seeing a surge in everyday devices that connect to the Internet and is working with local entrepreneurs in Hong Kong. ""What we're looking at doing is developing tech that bridges that gap between traditional manufacturing and 3-D printing,"" Buford said. Part-time inventors experimenting on cheap 3-D printers might be the next wave of people seeking out his help.","New desktop 3-D printers are dropping in price and getting easier to use .
Makers of the $200 MakiBox think there's a market for ""good enough"" printers .

"(CNN) -- The United States and Brazil jointly agreed on Tuesday to postpone Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's state visit to Washington next month due to controversy over reports the U.S. government was spying on her communications. Brazil protested recent disclosures of National Security Agency surveillance, which were included in media reports citing information apparently leaked by Edward Snowden, a former agency contractor who previously admitted leaking U.S. surveillance information to journalists. A White House statement announcing the postponement said President Barack Obama had previously ordered a thorough review of American intelligence activities, but it acknowledged that process would take several months to complete. As Brazil's uproar over NSA grows, U.S. vows to work through tensions . Rousseff spoke with Obama on the phone Monday in a last-minute attempt to patch things up, according to both governments. They decided for now to shelve the visit that had been scheduled for October 23. Brazil still is not satisfied with the situation. ""The conditions for a state visit on the previously agreed date haven't been provided,"" Rousseff's office said. But the White House said the two agreed to a postponement because they did not want the visit to be ""overshadowed by a single bilateral issue, no matter how important or challenging the issue may be"" and that the trip would be rescheduled. ""The president has said that he understands and regrets the concerns disclosures of alleged U.S. intelligence activities have generated in Brazil and made clear that he is committed to working together with President Rousseff and her government in diplomatic channels to move beyond this issue as a source of tension in our bilateral relationship,"" the White House said. Brazil, Mexico summon U.S. ambassadors over espionage reports . The reports alleged the NSA spied on Rousseff's mobile phone and e-mail communications as well as those of many of her advisers and oil giant Petrobras. The reports embarrassed and outraged her, making the prospect of bilateral trade talks extremely difficult. The United States is Brazil's second-biggest trading partner after China. The state visit was intended to bring the two biggest economies in the Americas closer together. A Brazilian president hasn't embarked on a state visit to the United States in almost two decades.

"(CNN) -- Brazilian authorities have confiscated food ""not fit for consumption"" from two hotels that will host the English and Italian national teams during the upcoming World Cup competition in Brazil. According to Procon, the Brazilian consumer protection agency, inspectors found food past its consumption date at the Portobello Hotel in the city of Mangaratiba, a suburb just west of Rio de Janeiro. The Italian national team is expected to stay at the Portobello. In a surprise inspection Monday, Procon said, inspectors found 25 kilograms (about 55 pounds) of expired pasta, shrimp, salmon and margarine. At Portobello, inspectors also seized 24 kilograms (about 53 pounds) of steak, sauces, beef heart, cheese, sugar and fish without expiration labels. Fabio Domingos, head of Procon in Rio de Janeiro state, told Agencia Brasil, the state-run news agency, that he's very concerned about the number of establishments that have violated sanitation rules. ""It is unacceptable for a hotel like Portobello to store expired food. It's one of the two largest hotels in Rio state that will be hosting international teams and it's storing expired shrimp, meat and pasta. All of the expired food has been disposed of by our agents,"" Domingos said. In a statement, Juliana Castanheira, a Portobello Hotel press representative, said executives there ""are taking measures to fully comply with the law."" ""This was an exception to our practices,"" Castanheira said. ""Since our team has had to work hard to meet high demand from the public, there was a failure in the disposal of food which expired the day before the visit by the inspection agency. However, no expired or unsafe food was served to our customers."" Last week, in another surprise inspection, Procon inspectors found food past consumption quality at the Royal Tulip Hotel in the SÃ£o Conrado neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro. That hotel is expected to host the English national team during the World Cup. Inspectors there found 2.36 kilograms (about 5 pounds) of expired lard, Parma ham and salmon. The hotel released a statement to CNN saying, ""Rio de Janeiro's Royal Tulip would like to make it clear that it follows all external and internal standards of quality control of its food and drinks and is investigating this incident."" All establishments with violations have 15 days to explain to contest the charges. Otherwise, they face a fine. As part of stepped-up effort to improve food safety, hotel and tourist services during the World Cup, Brazilian authorities launched Operation Shirt 10, named for the jersey number worn by iconic Brazilian star PelÃ©, whos real name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento. Out of 13 establishments that have been inspected so far, eight have been cited and fined for expired food and other violations. The establishments where inspectors found sanitation and other violations include restaurants, supermarkets, bakeries, stores and hotels. But a Procon statement said the Caesar Park Hotel, where the Dutch national team will stay, passed inspection without a problem. Brazil will host the World Cup from June 12 to July 13, with its team among 32 squads from around the world competing for the championship. Games in the 2014 World Cup will be played in twelve Brazilian cities: Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, Cuiaba, Curitiba, Fortaleza, Manaus, Natal, Porto Alegre, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Sao Paulo.","Surprise inspections turn up food that was past consumption dates .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- Massive mudslides in northwestern China have killed 337 people, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Monday. An additional 1,148 people are missing, the news agency said, citing the civil affairs department in Gansu Province. Authorities report 76 people have been injured and about 45,000 have been evacuated from Zhouqu County in the country's northwest, according to a statement from the provincial civil affairs department. The landslides occurred early Sunday morning after heavy rains started pummeling the area Saturday, authorities said. On Sunday afternoon, Premier Wen Jiabao and other government officials arrived at the mountainous region to survey the damage, according to Xinhua. Wen also insisted that electricity be restored and traffic resumed in Zhouqu County as soon as possible. The premier trudged through the mud and rocks in the badly hit Sanyan Valley, where some 300 households were submerged by the mudslides, Xinhua reported. ""Currently the key tasks and challenges are: expanding the scope for search and rescue; dealing with the barrier lake (caused by mudslides) in a timely and scientific manner; cleaning the sludge and resuming the supply of drinking water,"" Wen said Monday, according to Xinhua. The mudslides caused the Bailong River in Gansu province to become obstructed and overflow, and sent water rushing over its banks, state-run CCTV reported. The Chinese military used explosives to blast through the blockage, a spokesman with the emergency rescue headquarters told Xinhua. Excavators also were used to remove the debris and start a controlled release of the water. In Gansu, villagers -- many of them barefoot -- slogged through the mud carrying their children and their belongings on their shoulders. Some villagers carried bodies wrapped in blankets and placed on wooden planks hoisted onto their shoulders. The water level in the county seat of Chengguan Township had receded by 40 cm (16 inches) Sunday, after floodwaters carrying mud and rocks submerged half the town, Mao Shengwu, head of the prefecture, told the news agency. ""Torrential rains began to fall at around 10 p.m. Saturday. Then there were mudslides and many people became trapped. Now sludge has become the biggest hindrance to rescue operations.

""Since excavators can't reach the site, we can only use spades and our hands to rescue the buried,"" He Youxin, an officer with the Gannan branch of the Gansu Headquarters of Chinese People's Armed Police Force, told the news agency. His rescue team has saved 23 people and recovered 15 bodies, he said. But, ""It's very hard to locate the people washed away by floods. It's hard to say what their chances of survival are,"" he said. The news agency said the police rescued two children and three adults who were trapped atop a seven-story building, half of which had been washed away by the flood waters, according to a video clip shot by a police officer shown on Chinese Central Television. More than 300 homes in Yueyuan Village in the county had been buried. But the number of deaths there were not known, Mao told the news agency. A total of 600 soldiers arrived in Zhouqu County to perform relief work, Xinhua said. Three other detachments consisting of more than 1,700 soldiers as well as a 180-member medical team are on their way to the affected areas. China's armed police have also sent 2,100 members to help, the news agency reported. By Sunday afternoon, the provincial civil affairs department had sent 3,900 tents, about 40,000 boxes of instant noodles and 31,300 boxes of bottled drinking water to the county. But the county still needs 441 tons of drinking water and 22 tons of instant food, said a spokesman with the prefecture's government, according to Xinhua. The county needs an estimated 11,023 tons of water and 551 tons of instant food in the next 25 days, Xinhua reported.

"(CNN) -- Suicide should NEVER be presented by media as a means to resolve or escape one's problems (contrary to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' twitter post, the genie is not free, the genie's pain has now been dispersed to a very large audience). While I do not know, and no one knows, if Robin Williams is ""free,"" he is dead, and his loss has devastated us all. Suicide needs to be talked about as a fatal outcome that is, in the majority of cases, preventable and caused by severe illness and/or extreme psychological anguish. When I learned about Williams' suicide on Monday, it knocked the wind out of me. Sure, I am the president of the American Association of Suicidology, so I am alert to media coverage of suicide. I talk about suicide every day, but, like most of you, my connection to Williams is personal. I'm from Boulder, Colorado and after I moved away, I would turn on reruns of ""Mork & Mindy"" any time I felt homesick or alone. Robin Williams' portrayal of a wacky alien just trying to make it in this world provided comfort, laughter, and wonderful memories. His death, by any means, is a deeply sad event. That he died from suicide (a cause of death I try to prevent nearly every day) just makes his death that much more painful to me. Opinion: Why Robin Williams lost to depression . One of the questions I am usually asked after such a high-profile public suicide is: How does the news of a suicide affect others who are at risk? When it comes to high profile suicides, the research about contagion (or ""copycat effect"") is not clear. We can't say for sure if media coverage increases the risk of more people attempting suicide. However, our best research suggests that ""how"" we discuss suicide in the media is more important than ""if"" it is discussed. People tend to be afraid to talk about suicide, which is disheartening considering that suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. It kills more people than motor vehicle accidents and more than twice as many as homicide. Opinion: Robin Williams and depression: We all wear a mask . But in our high-tech, social media driven culture, we need to recognize that avoidance or denial of suicide simply is no longer possible. A friend of mine told me that her 8-year-old daughter came home from school yesterday talking about suicide. The specific details of Robin Williams' suicide method were discussed by children on the playground nearly 2,000 miles away from Williams' home, less than 24 hours after his death. The reality is, this 8-year-old knew more ""facts"" about the death than I did (clearly, not all professional journalists have read or follow the media guidelines regarding the reporting related to suicide and suicidality). At this time mental health professionals do not know how making this information widely available, even to school children, affects their long-term mental health. What we do know is that responsible adults need to ensure that the messages and stories related to Robin Williams suicide, just like every other suicide, are seen as opportunities to educate people that help is available (National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK; Crisis Text Line: www.crisistextline.org), that mental health treatments are effective, and that suicidal thoughts, by their very nature, tend to be time-limited -- though they may regularly recur. Our best experts believe that providing information about how to get help is one of the most useful things we can do after a highly-publicized death by suicide. When mental illness affects your family . Williams' death is also an opportunity to educate people that there are warning signs for suicide, which, if recognized, can help get people the urgent care they require to avert it. These include talking or writing about death, dying or suicide, when these actions are out of the ordinary, and withdrawal from friends, family and society. There are a number of others, so please take a moment to click here and review the warning signs of suicide. Suicide is a tragedy that can have an enormous impact on those who are left behind. While Robin Williams touched many of our lives (including mine) throughout his illustrious career, more than 39,000 people commit suicide each year -- meaning as many as 107 other individuals may have died this way on the day Williams took his life. Hopefully what will come out of this tragic loss of life is a more open dialogue about this very real health issue, which has claimed so many lives.","Bill Schmitz: Media should never present suicide as escape for problems. It's often preventable .
He says Oscars tweeted 'Genie, you're free' about Robin Williams. Wrong. His pain now on others .
Schmitz: It's unknown if celebrity suicide causes copycats; adults must address issue responsibly .

"Vero Beach, Florida (CNN) -- Kaitlyn Hunt, the 19-year-old who has been jailed in Florida over a sexual relationship she had with a 14-year-old girl, pleaded no contest Thursday to five charges as part of a deal brokered by prosecutors and her attorneys. Hunt pleaded no contest to two counts of misdemeanor battery, misdemeanor contributing to the dependency of a child and two counts of felony interference with child custody. Hunt has been in jail since August 20 for violating a court order not to contact the alleged victim. Under the terms of the agreement, Hunt will be sentenced to four months in jail, to be followed by two years of house arrest with electronic monitoring, and nine months of monitored probation after that, according to prosecutor Brian Workman. If she has no violations, she will not be a convicted felon under Florida law, and she will have the possibility of sealing her file and having the case expunged after 10 years, he said. The case garnered attention as Hunt's lawyers claimed that authorities wouldn't have gone after her if the situation had involved a male and a female instead of two teenage girls. But after Thursday's court hearing, Workman said the case would have been no different if Kaitlyn was a boy. Hunt's parents have been critical of the victim's family for going to police over the relationship, repeating that criticism Thursday. ""If we start arresting kids for having sex or sexting, you might as well turn the high schools into prisons,"" they said. The victim's family released a statement saying it was never their intent to harm Hunt, and the case was never about gender or sexual orientation. ""It was about age-appropriate relationships and following the rules and laws of our society,"" the statement said. Hunt was 18 when she was charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after she was accused of having sexual relations with the girl, who was 14. In Florida, a person under the age of 16 is not legally able to consent to sex.","Kaitlyn Hunt has been in jail since August 20 .

"(CNN) -- Oil spill cleanup is under way at many beaches along the Gulf Coast, and beach-bound travelers are keeping a close eye on coastal conditions. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Florida's Emerald Coast . Small bits of tar were found at Henderson Beach State Park over the weekend, according to the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors bureau. ""These were easily removed, and no further oil has been spotted,"" said a post earlier this week on the bureau's website. The area, which includes Destin, Fort Walton Beach and Okaloosa Island, is urging travelers to visit. ""Our white-sand beaches remain open and our emerald-green waters remain clear. In addition, offshore fishing is still going strong, with captains simply taking a more easterly course and reporting great success out on the water,"" the site said. Destin Mayor Sarah ""Sam"" Seevers told CNN that a few, small tar balls have come ashore this week but added that spotting occasional tar balls on the beach there is not unusual. ""We may go five years and not see any tar balls, and then we'll see a few. That's just a way of life on the Gulf of Mexico, Seevers said. Beachgoers are in the water as usual, she said. Pensacola and Perdido Key, Florida . The water at Pensacola Beach is open Wednesday for swimming and fishing, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. The National Park Service reported heavier oiling at Perdido Key on Tuesday afternoon. A health advisory has been issued for beaches stretching from the Florida-Alabama line to the entrance of Johnson Beach on Perdido Key, the visitors bureau website said. Swimming and fishing in the affected waters are not advised. Mike McHugh, an iReport contributor, shot video over the weekend at Johnson Beach. ""I came back to Johnson's Beach to see how the cleanup was progressing and to see what high tide brought in. At 4:30 p.m., the cleanup crews were gone. There were less tar balls, but still [they] are easy to find,"" he wrote. James Amerson, another iReporter, has been tracking the oil in Pensacola. Tar balls were found late last week on Pensacola Beach, ranging in size from 2 to 3 inches up to 18 inches, Amerson said. ""Strange to think this stuff, millions of years old, came from several thousand feet underground and floated over a 100 miles until it came to rest [on] our sugar white sands,"" Amerson wrote on iReport.com. The visitors bureau urges beachgoers to take precautions. ""According to [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration], tar balls do not pose a health risk to the average person, but visitors are advised not to pick them up,"" the website said. Gulf Islands National Seashore, Mississippi and Florida . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites are open, according to the National Park Service website. On Tuesday, the park service reported light to moderate oil occurrences at Horn and Petit Bois islands in Mississippi and Fort Pickens and the Santa Rosa area in Florida, with heavier oiling at Perdido Key. Cleanup crews continue to work in those areas. Health departments in both states urge people to avoid swimming in areas affected by the oil spill. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . In Alabama, the Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan. The beaches remain open. The pier at Gulf State Park in Gulf Shores is closed to fishing but open for sightseeing, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. The Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources have closed state Gulf waters and some inshore waters to fishing. Grand Isle, Louisiana . Oil is affecting more than 45 miles of Louisiana coast, according to a state emergency website. Grand Isle has closed its public beach, according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website. Natasha Combs, an iReporter, visited Grand Isle over the weekend to observe cleanup efforts. ""The beach was empty with the exception of the workers and the military. All of the cleanup crew were wearing [hazmat] suits. Bags of oil were gathered in piles along the beach, and workers were rinsing oil off of themselves in small plastic kid pools,"" Combs said.","Health officials have issued an advisory against swimming in Alabama Gulf waters .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama told Americans he has all the justification he needs to fire missiles into Syria. ""I have the authority to address the threat from ISIL"" he said in a primetime address on Wednesday. Where does he get it? According to senior Obama administration officials it comes from a 13-year-old vote Congress took in the days after 9/11 known as the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF.) The vote authorized President George W. Bush to go after al Qaeda terrorists. Did Obama sell his ISIS strategy? That one single vote, taken on September 14, 2001 before Obama even got to Congress as a senator from Illinois, has been used to justify every American military action since, including now the fight against ISIS in Syria. But it may not actually provide Obama with all of the legal protection he needs this time. The discussion began with legal experts who have started to take issue with applying the AUMF to the ISIS situation. It will likely become a bigger discussion in Congress in the coming days. At the crux of the debate -- what exactly is ISIS' relationship to al Qaeda? Here's the breakdown. What's the Obama administration claiming? The Obama administration argues that because ISIS formed out of an al Qaeda affiliate, Obama's plan is legal under the AUMF. ""We believe that he can rely on the 2001 AUMF as statutory authority for the military airstrike operations he is directing against ISIL, for instance,"" a senior administration official told reporters on Wednesday, using another name for ISIS, which also calls itself the Islamic State. ""It's important to note that ISIL has its roots in al Qaeda in Iraq; it was formerly the al Qaeda affiliate operating in Iraq for many years after the U.S.-led invasion in 2003,"" the official said. 5 takeaways from Obama's ISIS speech . ISIS has its roots in al Qaeda -- it grew out of al Qaeda's affiliate in Iraq, the al-Nusra Front -- but the groups split when some of ISIS' tactics became too extreme for al Qaeda. Secretary of State John Kerry reiterated the connection in an interview with CNN's Elise Labott on Thursday. ""Nobody has questioned the authority of that effort against al Qaeda over the last years. This group (ISIS) is and has been al Qaeda,"" he said. But some legal scholars are skeptical. ""The statute that Congress passed in the wake of, and as a response to, the 9/11 attacks, read now so as to authorize the use of force in Iraq and Syria against ISIS -- a group that al-Qaeda expelled publicly? It seems like quite a stretch,"" Wells Bennett, a fellow in National Security Law for the Brookings Institution wrote on Wednesday. Democratic candidates finding distance from Obama on ISIS . Where's the legal line? The question of whether the administration's justification is legal is unclear because so far officials haven't explained the various intricacies of their argument, experts caution. ""This is really complicated legally,"" Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at American University told CNN. ""The President's speech (Wednesday) night and then the background briefings haven't reflected this nuance. Although the President is not bound to explain such nuances, I think it would be better for everybody, including the President, if the administration were more out front."" Ultimately, Vladeck says, the question of whether Obama is acting legally can't be answered until we see what specific actions he takes. ""Everyone's talking about this issue in abstract terms. There are lots of different authorities that any president has when it comes to using force and the authority depends upon why that force specifically is being used."" James Foley's mother 'appalled' by how U.S. government handled her . The law vs. the political optics . If the President's not acting in a matter consistent with the law, what happens then? ""If the President is acting unlawfully, no one's gonna sue him,"" Vladeck noted. ""The remedy for a war powers violation is political, not legal."" In one sense, the politics are on Obama's side. A CNN poll taken earlier this month, before Obama's speech, found that a strong majority of Americans favor the type of expanded military actions outlined on Wednesday. Seventy-six percent of Americans support additional airstrikes against ISIS and 62% favor providing military aid to the forces fighting the group, so it may be politically untenable for members of Congress to voice too much resistance to this plan. But the favorable polling doesn't alter the bad relationship between the President and Congress. Despite the consensus on ISIS, passing a separate, ISIS specific statute that Obama could sign would be very difficult. ""The politics here are really problematic in two separate respects,"" Vladeck notes. ""One is just the optics for the Obama administration. The other is the terribly toxic relationship between the President and Congress. Even if everyone in Washington agrees that there should be some sort of forward-looking new statute to combat ISIS -- that agreement is not going to produce a statute, where in any other context in American history, it would have.""","President Obama says his power to take military action comes from a 2001 vote .

There's a debate over whether that 13-year-old law applies to the fight with ISIS ."
"(CNN) -- A specialized military unit has begun analyzing possible human remains recovered from wreckage of a cargo plane that crashed 60 years ago in Alaska, killing all on board. The C-124 Globemaster, near the end of a flight from Washington state to Alaska, crashed in November 1952 on Mount Gannett, killing 52. The debris was covered by an avalanche and not rediscovered until June 10, said Capt. Jamie Dobson, spokeswoman for the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command based in Hawaii. An eight-member team from the command flew to the site on Colony Glacier, several miles from where the plane went down. After the avalanche and over the years, some of the wreckage moved to the glacier, officials said. ""We took back with us material evidence that could possibly make an identification,"" Dobson said Saturday. Besides possible human remains, the team recovered pieces of clothing with names, life-support equipment, such as parachutes and lifeboats, personal effects and survival kits with food, she said. Military units based in Alaska were back at the scene this week to recover and safeguard additional debris. Identification of remains typically takes months, but can take years, Dobson said. Dobson called the recovery site hazardous, marked by deep crevices and shifting pieces of glacier falling into a lake. Typically, about 10% of debris in such an incident will surface. The Alaskan Command, involved with the debris recovery, did not immediately respond to a message left Saturday by CNN.","A C-124 Globemaster cargo plane crashed in Alaska in November 1952 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Democrats say a House committee has found no evidence showing that top Justice Department officials were behind a gun-trafficking investigation that let hundreds of high-powered weapons reach Mexican drug cartels. The Republican head of the committee, meanwhile, accused the department of obstructing its probe of the botched operation and threatened Attorney General Eric Holder with contempt of Congress. Holder is expected to appear before the House Government Oversight and Reform Committee on Thursday. The panel has led a high-profile investigation into ""Operation Fast and Furious,"" a gun probe run by federal agents in Arizona. It was one of several Phoenix-based operations intended to track the flow of illegally purchased American guns to the Mexican cartels -- but in practice, agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed so-called straw buyers to take weapons across the border without being intercepted. In a report released Tuesday, the panel's Democratic minority said no evidence was found that Justice Department bosses in Washington ""conceived or directed"" the plan. Their report places blame for the widely criticized investigation on federal agents and prosecutors in Arizona. While there is no evidence that the U.S. attorney's office in Phoenix or agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ""acted with anything but a sincere intent to stem illegal firearms trafficking,"" they ""created an obvious and inexcusable threat to public safety on both sides of the border"" by allowing weapons to reach the cartels, the Democrats concluded. Republican Sen. Charles Grassley, one of the leading critics of the operation, dismissed the findings as ""a knee-jerk defense (of the DoJ) from their political allies in Congress."" And the Oversight Committee's chairman, California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa, released a letter to Holder on Tuesday in which he repeats demands for Justice Department documents he says are needed to determine ""to what extent"" the department ""has obstructed our work."" ""If the department continues to obstruct the congressional inquiry by not providing documents and information, this committee will have no alternative but to move forward with proceedings to hold you in contempt of Congress,"" Issa wrote. A Justice Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CNN late Tuesday that the department ""has continuously worked with the committee in its requests for information."" Issa has hammered away at Holder during the course of the committee's inquiry and accused Justice Department officials of misleading Congress; Holder has slapped back by calling GOP allegations about the program ""inflammatory and inappropriate."" The operation came to light after the December 2010 killing of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry, when two AK-47 variants that were allowed to ""walk"" under the program were found at the scene. It drew sharp criticism from top officials, who have long said U.S. weapons are fueling Mexico's bloody drug war. The Justice Department initially denied that the ATF had let weapons cross the border, only to retract that statement as evidence of the botched probe mounted. Issa is calling for the Justice Department produce all related documents after that February 2011 letter. But Tuesday's Democratic report states that Issa's committee ""has obtained no evidence indicating that the attorney general authorized gun-walking or that he was aware of such allegations before they became public."" ""None of the 22 witnesses interviewed by the committee claims to have spoken with the attorney general about the specific tactics employed in Operation Fast and Furious prior to the public controversy,"" the Democrats wrote. Justice Department records released Friday night showed that one of Holder's top lieutenants, Criminal Division chief Lanny Breuer, and then-ATF Acting Director Kenneth Melson discussed whether illegal weapons could be intercepted in Mexico if U.S. and Mexican authorities worked together. Grassley pointed to that document Monday as evidence that Breuer knew about a gun-walking investigation as early as April 2010 and ""stood mute"" as congressional investigators demanded records from the department. ""They ignored the warning signs and failed to put a stop to it or hold anyone accountable,"" Grassley said in a statement on the Democratic report. The Justice Department's independent inspector-general is conducting its own investigation of Fast and Furious, and President Barack Obama told ABC News in October that ""people who screwed up will be held accountable.""","NEW: Issa threatens Holder with contempt over gun probe .

"Washington (CNN) -- Reince Priebus says he's leaning toward running for a third two-year term as chairman of the Republican National Committee so that he can helm what needs to be an ""about perfect"" campaign to defeat Democrats in a presidential election. Priebus told reporters at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor on Friday that he'd remain focused on the ""mechanics"" of politics -- including improving Republicans' collection of data targeting individual voters and its field operation in presidential battleground states. His comments came with an eye on 2016, when Republicans fear the favorable electorate they found in this year's midterm elections will be drowned out by a much larger turnout among left-leaning voters. Priebus pointed to wins this year in Senate races in Colorado, Iowa and North Carolina -- three states that President Barack Obama carried at least once -- as demonstrating that the GOP can win ""in a purple state in a good environment with a good candidate,"" and offering hope ahead of 2016. But, he said, Republicans will have to run a flawless national campaign -- including increasing outreach to Hispanic, Asian and black communities and targeting people who often don't vote. ""I think we've got to be about perfect as a national party to win,"" he said. ""Democrats can be good and win, and we've got to be great."" He said the RNC won't pull its staff out of presidential battleground states, and said ""we need to have a full-blown field operation in place"" by March 2015 in the key states of Florida, Ohio and Virginia. That, he said, is a tall task when staffers are tired and donors are tapped out. But, Priebus said, the party's huge wins in 2014 will help wipe out the bitter taste that was left in many GOP donors' mouths after the 2012 election. ""Our investors at the RNC are excited that the mechanics work, and they can see that a good, competent program on the ground is something they'll invest in immediately in 2015,"" he said. He underscored the party's plans to limit the number of primary debates and curtail its grueling nominating schedule, and said he'll also be more willing than he was in 2012 to criticize candidates who spend too much time ""slicing each other apart."" ""There's going to be a high level of disdain,"" Priebus said, ""for candidates who spend their time trying to destroy other Republicans.""","Reince Priebus says he'll likely seek a third term as RNC chairman .

"(WIRED) -- General Motors took a big step toward its reinvention as the ""New G.M."" today when it opened what it calls the largest automotive battery laboratory in the United States, a move the struggling company believes will hasten the development of electric vehicles. The GM battery lab is located at its sprawling Warren Technical Center campus outside Detroit, Michigan. GM invested $25 million in the 33,000-square-foot Global Battery Systems Lab to develop and test the drivetrains underpinning the Chevrolet Volt and other hybrid, battery-electric and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The automaker believes the facility, at its sprawling Warren Technical Center campus outside Detroit, Michigan, will help make it a market leader in battery and EV technology. ""The new global GM battery lab will benefit consumers across America by helping us advance the development of battery technology in the United States and put cleaner, more efficient vehicles on the road more quickly and affordably,"" CEO Fritz Henderson said in a statement. ""Our new lab improves GM's competitiveness by speeding the development of our hybrid, plug-in and extended-range electric vehicles."" The lab's opening comes one week after General Motors filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and vowed to reinvent itself as a leaner, greener company focused on fuel efficiency. It also comes as major automakers align themselves with battery manufacturers to bring cars with cords to market. Volkswagen, for example, recently signed a deal with Chinese auto- and battery-maker BYD, and Daimler bought nearly 10 percent of Tesla Motors last month. The Global Battery Systems Lab is four times larger than the cramped quarters where engineers had been working on the lithium-ion battery pack used in the Volt. It employs more than 1,000 engineers. The operation features 160 test channels and 42 thermal chambers that subject batteries to real-world driving conditions and temperarture variations. It also has 32 battery cyclers, ""treadmills"" used to deplete and charge the packs repeatedly. ""This facility is state-of-the-art and represents one of the largest and most capable battery test labs in the world,"" said Jim Queen, vp of global engineering. The lab has a maximum power capacity of 6 megawatts. The lab also features a thermal shaker table for testing the structural integrity of each pack and a battery tear-down workshop for failure analysis and reverse-engineering competitors' batteries. The Global Battery Systems Lab is the crown jewel in GM's battery program, which includes labs in Mainz-Kastel, Germany and Honeoye Falls, New York. General Motors is working with LG Chem on the battery that will provide the Volt with an all-electric range of 40 miles, and it has a joint deal with Compact Power and LG Chem to continue developing the technology. GM also has joined the University of Michigan in creating a battery-specific engineering curriculum and a battery lab in Ann Arbor. GM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week and is radically scaling back its operations, but work on the battery lab started in December 2007 shortly after GM started developing the Volt. Construction started in August and engineers started testing batteries there in January. The company plans to open a factory somewhere in Michigan to begin producing batteries by the end of 2010, at which point the Volt is slated to start rolling off an assembly line at the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly factory.

"Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- The sound of gunfire, confusion, a lockdown and then an evacuation. Witnesses, students and parents told frightening stories Friday about a school shooting that police say left six adults and 20 children dead. Many details of the attack were still unfolding, but the sight of dozens of emergency vehicles and police spread across the wooded campus made it clear Sandy Hook Elementary School has become the nation's latest infamous crime scene. For now, evacuated children are being comforted and reuniting with their parents at a nearby firehouse where, outside, an American flag flies at half-staff. There, couples enter and exit, some leaving without children and walking silently and tearfully past a nearby cemetery. One couple, escorted by firefighters seemed especially shaken -- eyes bloodshot and lips trembling -- stricken by the events of a clearly devastating day. In the hours following the morning attack, parents rushed to the school after first hearing the news. They reunited with their children, clutching them and then hurrying away. Support crucial for kids after trauma . Lynn Wasik wrapped her arms around her 8-year-old daughter, Alexis, cloaked against the cold in an oversized jacket. The girl described her ordeal after police and teachers barged into her third-grade classroom and ordered her and her classmates to hide in a corner. ""Everybody was crying,"" Alexis said. ""And I just heard the police officers yelling."" Her mother said she first learned about the emergency through an automated phone call message. She said the message wasn't clear about the school where the incident had occurred. In a panic, she raced to Sandy Hook, eventually finding Alexis unharmed. ""My heart is in a million pieces for those families,"" said Lynn Wasik. ""Who could do something like this? It's just sickening."" Slain principal worked to keep students safe . Like Wasik, other parents wrapped their arms around their children as they hurried away from the scene. The FBI presence became much more evident in the afternoon. Several federal officers in tactical gear were coordinating with state and local law enforcement. Officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives arrived to join the investigation. ""I was in the gym at the time,"" student Brendan Murray told CNN affiliate WABC. ""I heard screaming and I thought a custodian was knocking down things. Police came in, teachers yelled to get to a safe place. Police were knocking on the doors -- police were at every door, leading us down, quick, quick."" Brendan said he later joined classmates and ran to the firehouse ""really quick. We were all really happy that we were all alive."" At the firehouse, counselors such as Rabbi Shaul Praver lended a hand to help the traumatized. Some suffered from ""terrible anxiety,"" Praver told CNN. ""It's very hard to console parents in this situation,"" he said. ""There's no theological answer to this. What you have to do is hug them and just be with them and cry with them."" 'Hope my mom is ok': Tweets from the shooting . 'Why? Why?' Teary-eyed parents continued to emerge from the firehouse. Some were talking on cell phones, using words like ""chaotic"" and ""devastating."" Others were openly weeping into their phones as they walked up a wooded roadway leading away from the school. ""Why? Why?"" one woman cried as she walked away. Earlier, a woman who lives near the firehouse described seeing ""a bunch of children with a bunch of adults"" apparently evacuating toward a nearby park. ""I seen five children running up through our back field,"" the woman told CNN. ""And by God, those poor little guys were running."" Temperatures weren't far above freezing at the time of the evacuation. Adults led children away from the school. Many of the kids wore no coats and were dressed in brightly colored clothing. They marched in a line -- one behind another -- with their hands resting on the shoulders of the children in front of them. How do we stop the violence? 'Pop, pop pop' Children and adults shared their versions of the attack. One parent who was inside the school at the time of the shooting described hearing a ""pop, pop, pop,"" sound around 9:30 a.m. In the room with her were the school's principal, vice principal and the psychologist. All three left the room and went into the hall to see what was happening. The parent ducked under the table and called 911. ""I cowered,"" she told CNN's Meredith Artley. The shooter ""must have shot a hundred rounds."" Later the parent said she saw two adults lying dead in the hallway, in a pool of blood. Although school shootings have become sadly familiar in 21st century America, violence is not common in this picturesque 300-year-old town of about 27,000. ""I can't believe -- in a small town like this -- we've never had anything like this happen,"" a father of a Sandy Hook student told local CNN affiliate WTNH. ""I was pretty shaken up. I did not know who or what happened."" ""It doesn't seem possible,"" said another parent. ""You have something happen so close to home. ... I guess I'm still in shock.""

Surrounded by restaurant co-workers Richelsoph shared a conversation she had with a friend whose 5-year-old daughter attends Sandy Hook. ""She's really shaken up right now,"" said Richelsoph. ""I don't know how she's ever going to bring her daughter back to that school."" Also at the restaurant was Tracy Ryan, who teaches at another elementary school. Newtown's schools, she said, have helped to attract new residents from different parts of the state. ""People move here for the school system,"" she said. ""It's got great schools.

"Tokyo (CNN) -- The light bulb above our dining room table begins to swing. The windows rattle. The table shakes. Then the whole room shudders, the walls vibrating violently. A vase of flowers wobbles on a top shelf. Glasses clink. There's a loud rumble and a roar. Then the bookshelf tears loose from the wall, scattering books everywhere, before we hear a shattering crash. Then comes silence. But not for long. A few seconds later the floor begins to buck. The walls bulge. The room jumps up and down and moves from side to side. Crockery starts flying through the air. I dive under the table, hold a cushion over my head, shut my eyes and start laughing. When I open them I see Tokyo collapse in front of my eyes. Then a buzzer sounds and an instructor comes into the room. My disaster preparedness instructor bends down and looks at me cowering under the table. She's pleased with my performance. ""Well done, you survived your first earthquake,"" she says with a smile. ""Not bad for a beginner."" More: The best sushi restaurants in Tokyo . Preparing Tokyo residents for disaster . Tokyo has a number of unusual and relatively unknown attractions -- the world's only tapeworm museum and a noodle museum housing the world's largest collection of pot noodle cartons come to mind. But only one tourist site has been declared an official disaster zone. The Tokyo Earthquake Simulation Center is located on the fourth floor of the city's Ikebukuro Bosai-kan fire station. It's open to the public and there's no charge to experience two minutes of terrifying tremors. ""Residents of Tokyo are required to attend courses to enhance their disaster preparedness awareness,"" says my instructor. ""Children and salarymen all come to learn what to do in the event of an earthquake."" The computer-controlled earthquake mimics a quake measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale. There are 50,000 reported earthquakes in the world every year. They vary in seismic intensity. No area of the earth is entirely free from the threat, although some areas are more active than others. Japan has had more than 60 major quakes, with the first recorded in 684. The 2011 Tohoku quake registered a 9.0 magnitude and claimed nearly 16,000 lives. The world's biggest earthquake is believed to have been the 1960 Valdiva Quake in Chile, which was a 9.5. The quake that hit California in 1906 and ruptured a 70-mile length of the San Andreas fault was an 8. Other big ones have hit in Lisbon in 1755, New Madrid, Missouri in 1811 and Alaska in 1899. The Lisbon quake -- which killed at least 60,000 people -- was so powerful that the water in Loch Lomond in Scotland oscillated for two minutes. A serious earthquake with accompanying aftershocks is simulated every half hour every day except weekends and Tuesdays at Tokyo's Life Safety Learning center. There are similar centers in Tachikawa and Honjo. ""The Great Hanshin-Awaji earthquake brought about catastrophic devastation,"" my disaster preparedness tutor tells me. ""We must all learn safety measures so we know what to do in such an emergency. It might save our own life and the lives of others. Here we learn how to behave during a catastrophe. How to keep a cool head and a calm body. Our programs improve all-round earthquake skills."" The center has a permanent exhibition to the 1923 Tokyo earthquake. On September 1, 74,000 people died in seven seconds. Fifty-four percent of the brick buildings and 10% of all reinforced-concrete structures collapsed. One percent of the city's houses were destroyed and 700,000 homes were burned down. The shock started a tsunami tidal wave that reached a height of 36 feet at Atami on Sagama Bay, where it destroyed a further 150 houses and killed 60 more people.

We watch motorways buckle and skyscrapers cave in. It could be make believe. But there are no special effects. Courses at the center include basic fire extinguisher training. There's a special room where you're given a canister and told to spray foam over anything and everything. ""It's very popular with the adults, as well as the children,"" says my instructor. ""But there's a serious side. Students learn how to protect themselves and prevent fires from spreading after an earthquake. We also use a smoke maze and a tunnel to help people get used to being in smoke and learning how to get out of smoke-filled buildings in an orderly manner. ""We teach emergency first aid. And how to resuscitate injured people and administer cardiac massage. This is all to minimize the casualties when and if a quake strikes. We also have escape shoot drills. ""We have a lot of people coming back. Not because they want to learn more. They just enjoy being in an artificial earthquake scenario. Would you like to enjoy another one yourself?"" She smiles. ""I can arrange it. I can cause earthquakes!"" So once again I sit at the table in a mock-up of a typical small Japanese apartment, complete with kitchenette. The young woman asks me if I'm ready, then presses a button. The room begins to shake again. Following instructions, I run to the stove to turn off the gas supply and then open the door. Grabbing a cushion I find safety under the kitchen table. The walls tremble and then the floor. The bookcase sways. Through the window I can see video footage of falling masonry and giant dust clouds. One moment a building is there and another it's gone. The Tokyo area experiences minor tremors every day. My second one of the afternoon is over. I pass with flying colors and am equipped to deal with an earthquake if I ever find myself in one's epicenter.

"(CNN) -- Syrian military forces have taken control of villages in the northern part of Aleppo, Syrian state news agency SANA reported Friday. Syrian army forces ""eliminated big numbers"" of militants and destroyed scores of vehicles used by them in three villages in the northern countryside of Aleppo, the news agency said, citing a military source. The opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported Friday that one of the seized villages, Handarat, which is crucial because it sits on a hill overlooking the only entry point into the area. The Observatory, however, later reported that rebels had retaken the hill of Handarat amid heavy clashes, which continued Friday. It is estimated that there are up to 300,000 people in the rebel-held areas, and it's unclear if the militants will allow civilians to leave the war-torn region. The number of people who have fled Syria and registered as refugees amid the country's civil war surpassed 3 million in August, and a further 6.5 million are believed to be displaced within the nation, the U.N. refugee agency has reported. The war, pitting an Alawite Muslim-dominated regime against a largely Sunni Muslim insurgency, has torn the country apart. Numerous factions, some of them Islamist, oppose the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and one of them -- ISIS, or the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria -- has captured large swaths of northern and eastern Syria for what it says is its new Islamic caliphate.","Syrian forces seize villages in the northern part of Aleppo, state news agency reports .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- A 36-year-old woman who was reported missing shortly after Christmas has been found dead in Atlanta, authorities said Wednesday. Investigators used dental records to identify a body found in southwest Atlanta as that of Stacey Nicole English, the Fulton County Medical Examiner's office said in a statement. An autopsy did not reveal a cause of death, the office said, and further investigation and testing probably will take several weeks to complete. English's abandoned car was discovered, with the motor running, in Atlanta in late December. Police have made no arrests in the case. They also have named no suspects. Robert Kirk, a St. Louis man who had stayed with her December 24-26, said English was ""acting peculiar and out of character"" during the stay, adding that ""she began screaming in the apartment and shouting biblical scriptures and indicating that the world was coming to an end,"" a police report said. He said that he left around 10:30 p.m. on December 26, after English ""began asking him if he was Satan"" and told him to leave ""her residence immediately."" A friend, Michelle Strothers, told police that she last saw English on that day or the next one. In an interview with police on New Year's Eve, Strothers said that her friend ""appeared upset"" and told her ""she felt as if someone was attempting to hurt her."" ""She also stated that Ms. English was acting out of character, and began discussing the end of the world and quoting biblical scriptures,"" said the police report. Earlier, English's mother and stepfather told police that they typically talked with her ""several times a week"" and became worried after she did not answer their calls since they last talked with her on Christmas. They eventually used a spare key to enter her apartment, where they saw ""no sign of English,"" the police report said. Her mother, Cynthia Jamison, said that English ""was currently taking medication"" and had attempted suicide by overdose a little more than two years earlier, according to police. Private investigator T.J. Ward, hired by the family, told HLN's Vinnie Politan that neither homicide nor suicide can be ruled out at this point, and that the area is being treated as a crime scene. ""When toxicology comes back (we will) see if there was something in her system that could have caused her death.""","NEW: Toxicology reports will provide important info, private investigator says .

"Simferopol, Ukraine (CNN) -- Amid the chaos in Ukraine, an odd standoff played out Sunday at one military base on the country's Crimean peninsula. Several hundred men, wearing dark green camouflage uniforms without insignia, surrounded Ukraine's Perevalnoye base near the Crimean capital of Simferopol, according to a CNN crew that was there. But rather than the tense scene one might expect with two forces facing off, the men -- who were on foot and in a dozen or so vehicles -- walked peacefully near 15 Ukrainian soldiers standing guard at the base. Reporters have walked right up to the men in dark green and asked them who they are, but they have refused to respond. The Ukrainian soldiers are doing the same. That mood continued amid crowds of civilians who were there to voice their opinions about the chaos that has enveloped Ukraine in recent months, starting with street protests that were sparked by President Viktor Yanukovych's rejection of a trade deal with the European Union. Yanukovych was ousted February 22. There has been a deepening schism in the country ever since, between those in the west -- who generally support the interim government and its European Union tilt -- and those in the east, who prefer a Ukraine where Russia casts a long shadow. Emotions are most intense in Crimea, the last major stronghold of opposition to the new political leadership. Ukraine suspects Russia of fomenting tension in the autonomous region that might escalate a bid for separation by its Russian majority. Kiev mobilized troops and called up military reservists. Russian generals led their troops to three bases in the region and demanded Ukrainian forces surrender and hand over their weapons, Vladislav Seleznyov, spokesman for the Crimean Media Center of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, told CNN. Speaking by phone, he said Russian troops had blocked access to the bases. But, he added, ""there is no open confrontation between Russian and Ukrainian military forces in Crimea."" He said Ukrainian troops continue to protect and serve Ukraine. At the base Sunday, pro-Russian protesters chanted on one side of the street, while pro-Ukrainian protesters, including a priest and a man who read aloud from the Bible, rallied on the other. A group of women sang in support with Ukraine. Those who supported Russian intervention marched carrying Russian flags. They sang ""Crimea is part of Russia"" and recited verses that suggested former Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev gave Crimea away, from Russia to Ukraine, in the 1950s without the consent of the people. There was a brief shouting match between the protesters but the peace was maintained. In the meantime, political rhetoric heated up and Ukraine's leaders foreshadowed more ominous days ahead. ""This is a red alert. This is not a threat,"" Ukrainian interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said. ""This is actually a declaration of war to my country."" Speaking in a televised address from the parliament building in Kiev, he called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to ""pull back his military and stick to the international obligations."" ""We are on the brink of the disaster."" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry blasted what he described as Russia's ""incredible act of aggression"" during an appearance on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday . Other countries are ""prepared to put sanctions in place, they're prepared to isolate Russia economically,"" he said. Opinions about what is best for the region are divided. In Kiev, thousands of people rallied in the central Independence Square, the cradle of Ukraine's three-month anti-government protests that led to Yanukovych's ouster. The crowd held up signs reading ""Crimea, we are with you"" and ""Putin, hands off Ukraine."" At a military base in Crimea, a car carrying Russian troops rolled up early Sunday morning. They commanded Ukrainian troops to lay down their weapons and mount the Russian flag, Sergei Stichenko, chief of the Central Operative Force of Ukraine's Navy, told Crimean network ATR TV. A Russian captain ordered them to leave. Stichenko said he refused. ""I told him no one is going to leave the base. Moreover, no one is going to go to the side of the Russian Federation,"" he said. ""We only obey commands from Kiev."" But back at another military base near Simferopol, a 66-year-old man named Nikolai Petukhov marched up to the entrance of the facility carrying a Russian flag. He told CNN that he hoped Putin would facilitate democratic elections in Ukraine. When asked whether he thinks Crimea should be part of Russia or Ukraine, he said, ""If you look at it logically, it should be part of Russia."" Back in the Perevalnoye base, more civilians showed up to join the protest groups. Some women held up signs that said, ""God save your people."" A Ukrainian woman named Kseniya spoke to CNN. She was skeptical that a peace would hold for long, of the men in the dark green, she said. They ""say they are here to protect us, but who will they protect us from?"" she asked. Waving a Russian flag, Petukhov, a former soldier, insists Crimea is Russian and should return to Russia with Putin's help. MAP: How Ukraine is divided .

"(CNN) -- Ted Ligety and Mikaela Shiffrin continued to bask in the golden glow of Olympic triumph as the American pair recorded impressive World Cup victories Saturday in their specialist disciplines. Ligety, who topped the giant slalom podium in Sochi, recorded his sixth victory at Kranjska Gora in Slovenia, the first man in World Cup history to achieve that feat at the same venue in the same discipline. The 18-year-old Shiffrin made it four World Cup wins in slalom this season with a dominant victory at Are in Sweden. It wrapped up the overall slalom title for Shiffrin, who becomes the first woman to win eight World Cup races before the age of 19. She held off a trio of Swedes, Maria Pietilae-Holmner, Anna Swenn-Larsson and Frida Hansdotter over the two runs. ""The second run was difficult but I was lucky to start when the sun came out and to have a better visibility. Anna and Maria had an amazing second run too, so that inspired me to go fast,"" she told the official FIS website. Ligety also had to protect a big lead from the first leg and came under pressure from Austrian veteran Benjamin Raich and Henrik Kristoffersen of Norway, who finished 0.18 and 0.25 seconds behind in second and third. ""This is definitely a really cool hill. It has so much personality and it's really a fun hill to ski. It has the steep parts. It has some rolls. It has a little bit of a gliding section. So it's a true GS skier's hill,"" the 29-year-old Ligety said. Marcel Hirscher of Austria claimed fourth spot to maintain his 50-point lead over Ligety in the discipline's overall standings ahead of the World Cup finals in Lenzerheide next weekend. ""I'm just skiing race to race and wins are always important even if they don't go for the title,"" Ligety said. Defending champion Hirscher has also closed to 41 points behind Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway in the race for the overall title heading into the final round of racing.","Ted Ligety wins World Cup giant slalom at Kranjska Gora .

"Atlanta (CNN) -- Authorities have arrested three suspects in the assault of two Delta Air Lines employees who were mugged and beaten on Atlanta's subway earlier this month. All three suspects live in Atlanta and are being held on charges including aggravated assault, aggravated battery and robbery by force, MARTA police announced Monday. MARTA, or Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, is the city transit system. The suspects include a 16-year old male whose name is not being released because of his age and two brothers, Zantavious Sanchez Scott, 20, and Jarquez Scott, 19, MARTA police said. Transit police said they are continuing their investigation and searching for others who may have been involved. They said they have warrants for at least two other suspects, ages 19 and 14. ""We are continuing our investigation into this unprovoked and senseless act,"" said MARTA Police Chief Wanda Dunham. ""We advise anyone who may have been involved to turn themselves in. We intend to find you and will prosecute you to the full extent of the law."" The attack happened April 16 as the two Delta employees rode a southbound train toward Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, police have said. As many as 20 to 25 people attacked the two men. One of the victims said teenagers hit him with a soda can before pushing him down and taking his billfold. He reported a cut next to his left eye from the assault. The other Delta employee said he received a cut on the lip and reported nothing stolen. According to accounts from the victims and witnesses, the incident happened shortly after Atlanta police dispersed a large group of young people who had been attending a party at a club near downtown Atlanta. Some of the youths boarded a MARTA train a few blocks away. As the train headed south, several suspects attacked the two Delta employees, and then exited the train at another station, police said. One of the victims said he was not left shaken by the attack. ""I think you have to be vigilant and you have to be careful, but that's true wherever you go,"" said the man, whose name was not released. ""But I've never felt unsafe on MARTA.

"(CNN) -- In 2009 the U.S government dubbed January 28 ""Data Privacy Day."" Four years later, it's the government's own actions to obtain personal information that are in the spotlight, thanks to new reports from Google and Twitter. The goal of Data Privacy Day is to educate people and companies on the vulnerability of personal data, including information shared on social networks, financial data and anything stored on cloud services. The holiday is spearheaded by the National Cyber Security Alliance (NCSA), a nonprofit organization that works with government agencies and major tech companies including Intel, Google, Microsoft and Facebook. ""We want to raise universal awareness about people respecting the privacy of others and safeguarding their data,"" said Michael Kaiser, NSCA's executive director. To mark the occasion, Twitter released its latest transparency report, which breaks down government requests for user data as well as copyright complaints and ""take down"" requests. Google followed up on its own transparency report, released last week, with a blog post explaining how it fields government requests and a new section on its transparency report that addresses common questions about the process. The numbers from the two companies show a steady increase in requests from the U.S. government for personal data. Usually these requests are part of criminal investigations or court cases, according to the two companies. The majority of requests from U.S. agencies are subpoenas, followed by search warrants, court orders and some emergency requests. Search warrants are more difficult to obtain than a subpoena and require a higher standard of probable cause. In the past six months, Google received 21,389 requests for data, a 70% increase since the company first started releasing the report in 2010. The largest single entity requesting information continued to be the U.S. government, which submitted 8,438 of the requests. Google turned over some or all of the requested information 88 percent of the time, Twitter 57 percent of the time. Twitter received 1,858 requests for information about 1,433 accounts, 815 of which were from the U.S. government. The social network added a new home for its transparency reports, transparency.twitter.com, and expanded the report to include more details about the requests and an expanded entry to cover the activity in the United States. ""It's our continued hope that providing greater insight into this information helps in at least two ways: first, to raise public awareness about these invasive requests; second, to enable policy makers to make more informed decisions,"" Twitter's legal policy manager Jeremy Kessel said in a blog post. Transparency and education about what the government can access and how are important, but the companies also want to change the laws to better protect user privacy in the first place. ""We're a law-abiding company, and we don't want our services to be used in harmful ways. But it's just as important that laws protect you against overly broad requests for your personal information,"" said Google's chief legal officer David Drummon in a blog post on Monday. Under the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), a file stored on a hard drive in your home has greater protection than information stored with a third-party. Whereas the government would require a search warrant for anything in your house, it can request access to e-mails older than 180 days or information stored in the cloud with a subpoena, which is easier to obtain. Twitter and Google are both members of the Digital Due Process Coalition, an organization that is lobbying to update the act. Drummon explained Google's process for handling requests, which involves notifying users of the requests when legally allowed, and requiring a search warrant for search query and private information from agencies conducting criminal investigations. ""We believe a warrant is required by the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits unreasonable search and seizure and overrides conflicting provisions in ECPA,"" says Drummon. These kinds of reports and posts are important tools for educating the public about how and when government agencies can access information, but government requests are only one sliver of data privacy fluency. People can also take steps to better control what they share online on social networks or apps that collect location data. Kaiser recommends people familiarize themselves with privacy policies and regularly update privacy settings on sites such as Facebook. The day isn't just to raise awareness among consumers. Business are also key players in data privacy, and while big names like Google and Twitter have large legal and security teams, smaller companies that also have access to personal data might not. ""We want them to be aware of their responsibility to be stewards of the data people entrust to them,"" said Kaiser.","Data Privacy Day seeks to increase awareness about personal data online .

"(CNN) -- A 56-year-old married woman has won half of the second-largest Mega Millions jackpot in U.S. history and has taken the cash option, which after taxes, will be about $120 million, Georgia Lottery President Debbie Alford said Wednesday. Ira Curry, of Stone Mountain, came to the lottery office with the winning ticket of hand-picked numbers, a mix of family birthdays and the lucky number 7. She did not appear at the afternoon lottery announcement in Atlanta. Curry bought the ticket at the end of the day Friday and it was a last-minute decision, Alford said. Alford gave a few details about Curry, saying she is married and had her daughter check online for the winning numbers after a radio announcer mentioned 7 was the Mega ball number. Two tickets matched the winning numbers in Tuesday night's $648 million jackpot. Curry's half of the cash option comes to $173,819,742.50, before federal taxes (25%) and Georgia taxes (6%), officials said. According to CNN's calculation, the payout will net her $119,935,622.32. It will take one to two weeks before Curry will get her check, Alford said. Curry bought her winning ticket in Atlanta at a Gateway Newstand in the lobby of an office building near the city's Buckhead community; the other ticket was sold in San Jose, California, lottery officials said. ""(Curry) had the radio on, and the announcer was talking about the Mega ball, which was seven,"" Alford said. So Curry called her daughter and ""between tears of joys and laughter,"" the daughter relayed to her mother that she'd won, the lottery president said. Curry told Alford, ""I was in a state if disbelief. I still didn't believe it when my daughter told me,"" Alford said. No lotteries in these 7 states . Alford said she suspects Curry called her boss to say she wouldn't be coming in to work because Curry met with lottery officials between 11 a.m. and noon. Curry told lottery officials she hadn't had time to think about what to do with the money. The winning numbers were 8, 14, 17, 20 and 39, with a Mega ball of 7. Twenty ticket holders will win $1 million after matching all the numbers except the Mega ball. Strong sales boosted the jackpot to $648 million from previous estimates of $636 million and $586 million, lottery officials said. That's tantalizingly close to the U.S. record -- a $656 million Mega Millions jackpot split by three winning tickets in March 2012. This jackpot was so large in part because Mega Millions became tougher to win. The prize rises with each miss, and no one had won it since organizers increased the pool of numbers to choose from -- making astronomical odds even longer -- in October. The California winning ticket was sold at Jenny's Gift Shop in a San Jose strip mall, lottery officials said. You won the big one. Now what? The chance of winning -- never particularly bright -- got worse in late October, when Mega Millions increased the drawing's pool of numbers. The odds of hitting the jackpot, which were 1 in 176 million, are now 1 in 259 million. You have more than 1,000 times better chance of an asteroid or comet killing you -- and that's using the longest estimated odds for the celestial bodies -- according to Tulane University. ""Winning the Mega Millions is akin to getting struck by lightning at the same time you're being eaten by a shark,"" said Todd Northrop, founder of Lotterypost.com. $800 million in lottery prizes unclaimed . Previously, lottery players chose five numbers, ranging from 1 to 56. It's now 1 to 75. But the sixth, gold ball has fewer numbers from which to choose, as the pool decreased from 46 to 15. Mega Millions tickets are sold in 43 states -- all but Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Mississippi, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming -- plus the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

"(CNN)  -- Every May, thousands of tennis fans descend on Stade Roland Garros in Paris to watch their heroes battle for French Open glory. The setting for the clay-court grand slam is the epitome of style and French elegance, with its location in the chic 16th arrondissement a major part of the attraction. Named after a famous French aviator, Roland Garros first staged the tournament in 1928 -- but when World War II intervened it served a darker, non-sporting purpose. Paris-based research center Memorial de la Shoah owns archive material that confirms Roland Garros was used by the French government as a prison camp or ""centre de rassemblement"" for political dissidents and foreign nationals. For a 10-month period from September 1939 until June 1940, several hundred prisoners -- possibly more because no accurate records have been kept -- were kept under close guard in the grounds and bleachers of the stadium. Can Federer stop Nadal equaling Borg's record? The center, which is dedicated to chronicling the persecution of Jews during World War II, provided CNN with written accounts from people imprisoned there plus evidence from Nazi officers. One letter, which can be seen in the picture gallery above, was sent to a welfare group set up to protect Jewish immigrants by five internees complaining about the conditions in which they were confined. ""We the undersigned Jews who left Central Europe in the wake of anti-Semitic persecution and being held at Roland Garros stadium, have the honor to speak to the Committee for the rights of Jews to ask him to kindly send a delegate on site that could safeguard our interests,"" it read. Those who signed the letter were aged 18-51, including a medical student, engineer, mechanic, furrier and pianist. Fauna fight: The battle over the Roland Garros expansion . This evidence corroborates that of Jewish author Arthur Koestler, who was held at Roland Garros and later wrote about his experiences. Born in Hungary, Koestler was a member of the German Communist Party in the 1930s and, as a foreign national living in Paris, was rounded up and taken to Roland Garros. The prisoners were poorly treated according to Koestler, who chronicled his plight in his autobiographical book ""Scum of the Earth"" -- which was published in 1941 after he fled to Britain. ""At Roland Garros, we called ourselves the cave dwellers, about 600 of us who lived beneath the stairways of the stadium,"" he wrote. ""We slept on straw -- wet straw, because the place leaked. We were so crammed in, we felt like sardines ... It smells of filth and excrement, and only slits of light can find their way inside. ""Few of us knew anything about tennis, but when we were allowed to take our walk in the stadium, we could see the names (Jean) Borotra and (Jacques) Brugnon on the scoreboard."" Roland Garros to keep French Open . Koestler was sent to the notorious Le Vernet camp before volunteering to join the French Foreign Legion, later deserting and finding his way to England where he spent the rest of his life. The pair he referred to were members of the ""Four Musketeers"" who dominated pre-war French tennis. Borotra went on to become the General Commissioner for Sports in the Vichy government before himself being arrested by the Gestapo in 1942 and deported to a prison camp in Germany from which he later escaped. The Shoah archives also include a chain of correspondence from SS captain Dr. Heinz Rothke -- who headed Jewish Affairs for the Nazis in Paris in February 1942 -- to SS major Rolf Gunther, a senior member of Adolf Eichmann's staff in Berlin. Gunther asked if the tennis stadium is still being used to hold prisoners, and whether any Jews were being held there. Rothke's reply said that Roland Garros had not been used for purposes of internment since June 1940. The French tennis federation (FFT) has not included details of the internment of prisoners in its official history of Roland Garros. When contacted by CNN, it declined to comment. However, the FFT has previously acknowledged that the stadium was used to hold political prisoners, though it denies any Jews or Nazis were ever confined there. ""They were German, Austrian and Italian,"" its cultural director Jean Christophe Piffaut told the Jerusalem Post in 2004. ""France at this time was terrified to be spied on by the enemies. As soon as the French authorities had verified the reality of the activities of the people that were in this curious camp, they let them free."" The Shoah center said allegations by news organizations including the BBC that Roland Garros had an even more sinister use as an internment camp for Jews were untrue. It has been reported that Jews were held there before being deported to death camps in Germany during the rule of the Vichy government in Nazi-occupied Paris.  According to Karen Taeb, the Shoah center's chief archivist, there is ""no evidence"" to support these claims. Yet it is known that other sports stadiums were utilized. Cycling's Velodrome d'Hiver (Winter Velodrome), like Roland Garros, acted as a temporary internment camp from 1939-40 for women prisoners. But in 1942, on July 16-17, it was used for the infamous ""Rafle du Vel d'Hiv"" which saw more than 12,000 Jews rounded up with 8,000 taken to the cycling track ahead of deportation to concentration camps. Shimon Samuels, the director of international relations at the Paris branch of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said sports stadiums were often used for such purposes. ""It is a blight on the honor of sports,"" he told CNN.","Stade Roland Garros was used as an internment camp at the start of World War II .

"(CNN) -- A computer-science detective story is playing out on the Internet as security experts try to hunt down a worm called Conficker C and prevent it from damaging millions of computers on April Fool's Day. This piece of computer code tells the worm to activate on April 1, 2009, researchers at CA found. The anti-worm researchers have banded together in a group they call the Conficker Cabal. Members are searching for the malicious software program's author and for ways to do damage control if he or she can't be stopped. They're motivated in part by a $250,000 bounty from Microsoft and also by what seems to be a sort of Dick Tracy ethic. ""We love catching bad guys,"" said Alvin Estevez, CEO of Enigma Software Group, which is one of many companies trying to crack Conficker. ""We're like former hackers who like to catch other hackers. To us, we get almost a feather in our cap to be able to knock out that worm. We slap each other five when we're killing those infections."" The malicious program already is thought to have infected between 5 million and 10 million computers. Those infections haven't spawned many symptoms, but on April 1 a master computer is scheduled to gain control of these zombie machines, said Don DeBolt, director of threat research for CA, a New York-based IT and software company. What happens on April Fool's Day is anyone's guess. The program could delete all of the files on a person's computer, use zombie PCs -- those controlled by a master --  to overwhelm and shut down Web sites or monitor a person's keyboard strokes to collect private information like passwords or bank account information, experts said. More likely, though, said DeBolt, the virus may try to get computer users to buy fake software or spend money on other phony products. Experts said computer hackers largely have moved away from showboating and causing random trouble. They now usually try to make money off their viral programs. DeBolt said Conficker C imbeds itself deep in the computer where it is difficult to track. The program, for instance, stops Windows from conducting automatic updates that could prevent the malware from causing damage. The program's code is also written to evolve over time and its author appears to be making updates to thwart some of the Conficker Cabal's attempts to neuter the worm. ""It is very much a cat and mouse game,"" DeBolt said. It's unclear who wrote the program, but members of the Cabal are looking for clues. First, they know that some recent malware programs have come from Eastern European countries outside the jurisdiction of the European Union, said Patrick Morganelli, senior vice president of technology for Enigma Software. Worm program authors often hide in those countries to stay out of sight from law enforcement, he said. In a way, the Conficker Cabal is also looking for the program author's fingerprints. DeBolt said security researchers are looking through old malware programs to see if their programming styles are similar to that of Conficker C. The prospects for catching the program's author are not good, Morganelli said. ""Unless they open their mouth, they'll never be found,"" he said. So, the most effective counter-assault simply may be damage control. One quick way to see if your computer has been infected is to see if you have gotten automatic updates from Windows in March. If so, your computer likely is fine, DeBolt said. Microsoft released a statement saying the company ""is actively working with the industry to mitigate the spread of the worm."" Users who haven't gotten the latest Windows updates should go to http://safety.live.com if they fear they're infected, the company's statement says. DeBolt said people who use other antivirus software should check to make sure they've received the latest updates, which also could have been disabled by Conficker C. The first version of Conficker -- strain A -- was released in late 2008. That version used 250 Web addresses -- generated daily by the system -- as the means of communication between the master computer and its zombies. The end goal of the first line was to sell computer users fake antivirus software, said Morganelli. Computer security experts largely patched that problem by working with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers to disable or buy the problematic URLs, he said. That process-of-elimination approach isn't likely to be effective with Conficker strain C, Morganelli said. The new version will generate 50,000 URLs per day instead of just 250 when it becomes active, DeBolt said. The first iteration of Conficker is thought to have grown out of a free function for security programs created by Dr. Ronald Rivest, a computer science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""Any technology can be used for good or evil, and this is just an example of that,"" Rivest said. Many viruses have taken pieces of benevolent programs and used them for ill. But overall the ""open source"" environment online promotes computer security far more than it enables hackers, DeBolt said. ""I don't blame the open-source community at all"" for virus attacks, he said. CA said it recently found a piece of code in Conficker C that says the worm will become active on April 1. Previous versions of the malicious software launched on specific dates noted in the program code, so the April Fool's Day launch date is not likely to be a trick, DeBolt said. ""The best minds in the industry are working on this to protect customers,"" he said. ""We're trying to reduce the impact of the April 1 date as best we can. But we know ... this malware will continue to evolve.""","The Conficker C computer worm is expected to activate on April Fool's Day .

"(CNN) -- Arsenal extended their lead at the top of the English Premier League, but only by a point as Everton earned a 1-1 draw at the Emirates on Sunday. Roberto Martinez's team carried the confidence of a midweek win against Manchester United into the match but it was Arsenal who looked to have grabbed all three points when Mesut Ozil scored deep into the second half. The German international slammed home from close range in the 80th minute after Theo Walcott had headed the ball back across goal. But Everton's attacking persistence paid off four minutes later when substitute Gerard Deulofeu flashed a shot past Wojciech Szczesny. Olivier Giroud nearly won the match in injury time for the Gunners with a sensational long range effort which rattled the bar but Everton held on and remain unbeaten in eight league matches. ""We have to say Everton were a very good side today, especially at the start of the game, the first half-an-hour ..."" Arsene Wenger said afterwards. ""After that we have the better control in the final 15 minutes of the first half and second half, but they always remained dangerous in counterattacks. The regret we have tonight is that we are 1-0 up with seven minutes to go. But overall, it's a point and we can say it is a logical result."" Arsenal are now five points clear of Liverpool and Chelsea who both have 30 points, with Manchester City one point further back. The draw sees Everton remain in fifth with 28 points now from 15 games. ""The performance from our point of view, I couldn't be happier,"" Martinez said. ""The only bit of criticism is that we need to take our chances and probably in the final third we were not ruthless enough. But the way we controlled the game, I haven't seen many teams come to the Emirates and do what we did today. So really, really pleased."" Earlier, Fulham ended a run of six consecutive league defeats with a 2-0 win over Aston Villa at Craven Cottage. Goals from Steve Sidwell and Dimitar Berbatov from the penalty spot gave new coach Rene Meulensteen his first win in charge following Martin Jol's sacking last weekend and lifts the west Londoner's to 18th place in the table. Villa remain in 10th place with 19 points, three points behind David Moyes' Manchester United who suffered a second consecutive home defeat to Newcastle United on Saturday.

"(CNN) -- ""Gone Girl"" was that rarity: a best-selling book that was also well reviewed, earning spots on both The New York Times best-seller list and critics' best-of lists. Will the movie starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike which opens Friday measure up? 'Unfilmable' movies? No such thing, says Hollywood . It's hard to say. Early reviews have been positive, but some critics have reservations. The New Yorker's Anthony Lane highlighted the differing needs of books and movies as the reason for his mixed review. While complaining about one of the film's subplots, he observed, ""It comes straight from the novel, and you can picture the outcry if (director David) Fincher had chopped or changed it, but so what? A director's task is not to suck up to readers, or to flatter his source, but to imagine it afresh, as film, while seizing on those aspects that matter to him most."" It's a fine line. Let an adaptation leave out a character or condense a plot and book fans will scream in protest. But include every nuance, every tangent, and moviegoers will yawn with fatigue. Studios will always rely on books -- they're an easy source for new stories. And many of those adaptations will end up as hit movies. But that doesn't mean they're always done well.

"(CNN)  -- A political crisis in Honduras escalated Thursday as a defiant President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales, followed by hundreds of supporters, led a loud but peaceful protest to a military base in order to personally take possession of thousands of ballots to be used in a contested referendum Sunday. President Manuel Zelaya Rosales, middle, reviews troops with Gen. Romeo Vasquez Velasquez, right, in 2008. Zelaya, a leftist elected in 2005, suddenly found himself pitted against the other branches of government and military leaders over the issue of the referendum. The referendum at the center of the storm asks voters to place a measure on November's ballot that would allow the formation of a constitutional assembly that could modify the nation's charter to allow the president to run for another term. Zelaya, whose four-year term ends in January 2010, cannot run for re-election. The Hondurans Supreme Court had ruled the referendum illegal, and Congress and the top military brass agreed, but Zelaya remained steadfast. ""Sunday's referendum will not be stopped,"" Zelaya said at the entrance of the military base where boxes of ballots were removed from storage and put into trucks to be taken to the presidential palace. Moving the ballots prevented them from being voided or destroyed to comply with the court's ruling of the illegality of the vote. Zelaya and his supporters braved an overcast and rainy day and sang the national anthem as the cardboard boxes filled with ballots were moved out of storage. ""We have the right to vote and the right to organize,"" Zelaya said. ""The military should rectify their position in favor of the people and ignore the extortion of the elite."" The protest was the latest in a day of developments that have created a political crisis in a country where some 70 percent of the population lives in poverty. Earlier Thursday, the Supreme Court ordered that the military's top commander be returned to his job immediately, a little more than 12 hours after Zelaya fired the general for saying the armed forces would not support the referendum. Gen. Romeo Vasquez Velasquez had said the military was caught in a difficult position because the Supreme Court had ruled earlier that the referendum is illegal, but Zelaya was going ahead with the vote and instructed the armed forces to provide security. The heads of the army, navy and air force had resigned to show their support for Vasquez. Zelaya referred to the court as the ""Supreme Court of Injustice"" after their ruling. The court ruled 5-0 that Zelaya violated the general's constitutional rights by firing him without cause, said magistrate Rosalina Cruz. Also on Thursday, the National Congress convened an emergency session at which many members lauded Vasquez and the military, calling them ""heroes."" The general's firing was arbitrary, many members said. The president of the Congress, Roberto Micheletti, said the assembly unconditionally supports the armed forces for respecting the constitution, news reports said. In another blow for Zelaya, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal said Thursday the referendum is illegal. The military chief had said after he was fired that he respected the president's decision to dismiss him but could not violate a Supreme Court order last week that prohibited the military from supporting the referendum. ""We are soldiers and we have to comply with our responsibilities,"" Vasquez said early Thursday. ""We are not afraid of any judge,"" he said. ""We are only afraid of the judge of history."" Zelaya said he would ask the Organization of American States to investigate the ""crisis,"" which he said was being perpetrated by people who want to hurt democracy in Honduras. Congress passed a law Tuesday night that would prohibit a referendum 180 days before or after the planned November general election. Under that law, Sunday's referendum could not be held. Politicians huddled Thursday as tension gripped the nation. Rumors of a coup had been circulating for days, heightened Wednesday when the armed forces were placed on high alert and held training exercises to prepare for civil disturbances and urban warfare, news reports said. There were no signs of any military intervention Thursday, though. David Matamoros, a member of the nation's Supreme Electoral Tribunal, said on CNN affiliate Televicentro that the election panel supports the military's action. The military ruled Honduras for 25 years, until a democratically elected civilian government came to power in 1982. Zelaya narrowly won the presidency on November 27, 2005, garnering 49.8 percent of the vote to 46.1 percent for Porfirio ""Pepe"" Lobo.","NEW: President Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales: ""Referendum will not be stopped""

"(CNN) -- The North Korean military issued a fresh burst of ominous rhetoric Thursday, warning that U.S. bases in Guam and Japan are within its ""striking range."" The statement from the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army, carried by the North's state-run news agency, follows the announcement by the United States this week that its B-52 bombers were making flights over South Korea as part of annual military exercises. ""The U.S. should not forget that the Andersen Air Force Base on Guam where the B-52s take off and naval bases in Japan proper and Okinawa where nuclear-powered submarines are launched are within the striking range of the DPRK's precision strike means,"" the North Korean military said Thursday. Despite Pyongyang's rhetoric, no U.S. Navy submarines are based in Okinawa or anywhere else in Japan, although they may make calls at U.S. bases there. DPRK is short for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name. Interactive: Nuclear weapons: Who has what? Citing what it called the United States' ""nuclear blackmail and threat,"" the North said it that it, too, would ""take corresponding military actions."" Pyongyang had already reacted angrily to the B-52 flights, warning Wednesday of ""strong military counteraction"" if the planes made more sorties over the Korean Peninsula. Angry words after new sanctions . Tensions have spiked in the region since North Korea carried out its latest underground nuclear test last month, the first under its new young leader Kim Jong Un, prompting the United Nations Security Council to respond by toughening sanctions on the secretive regime. The sanctions enraged the North further, and during the week when the Security Council was voting on them, it ratcheted up its threats, suggesting it could carry out a pre-emptive nuclear strike on the United States and South Korea. Although analysts and American officials say Pyongyang is still a long way from being able to carry out such an attack on the U.S. mainland, the United States' bases in Japan and Guam appear to be within range of the North's conventional weapons. In its comments Thursday, ""the Kim Jong Un regime is just firing back"" at its enemies in response to the B-52 flights and the military exercises of which they're a part, said Lee Jung-hoon, a professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul. He said that the U.N. sanctions were also likely to be fueling the North's ire, but that the regime's threats were largely driven by domestic concerns. ""They're doing all this to prop up the regime,"" Lee said. The military first strategy . Since Kim took over from his father as the head of the North Korean government in late 2011, he appears to have maintained the pursuit of a stronger military deterrent rather than adopting a more conciliatory approach to relations with South Korea and the United States. The result has been a major foreign policy headache for U.S. President Barack Obama, with Kim showing more interest in dialogue with the basketball star Dennis Rodman than U.S. diplomats. As well as the nuclear test, his government has conducted two long-range rocket launches -- one that failed and one that succeeded -- both of which were widely viewed as tests of ballistic missile technology. Kim has also revamped the military's leadership, ousting some generals and promoting others. The nuclear test and rocket launches have shattered hopes of any new talks on the North's nuclear program in the near future. Indeed, Pyongyang has said recently that the program is not up for negotiation and announced that previous nonaggression treaties with Seoul no longer apply. A new North Korea . The regime's unabashed declarations about its nuclear weapons, which it had been much cagier about in the past, show that ""it's not the same North Korea as 10 years ago,"" Lee said. The United States and other global powers need to ""formulate a whole new strategy"" to address the changed situation, according to Lee. ""The way we've been dealing with it for the past two decades has failed,"" he said of the regime. ""It has become close to being able to deploy nuclear weapons."" Although U.S. officials say they don't believe North Korea is in a position to strike the United States at the moment, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel last week announced plans to deploy additional ground-based missile interceptors on the West Coast as part of efforts to enhance the nation's ability to defend itself from attack. ""The reason that we are doing what we are doing, and the reason we are advancing our program here for homeland security, is to not take any chances, is to stay ahead of the threat and to assure any contingency,"" Hagel said at the time.","North Korea is verbally ""firing back"" at recent moves by the U.S., an analyst says .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama spared few from his zingers at Saturday's White House Correspondents' Dinner -- including himself. He stepped to the podium as DJ Khaled's ""All I Do Is Win"" played as an introduction and told the audience, ""Rush Limbaugh warned you about this -- second term, baby."" His advisers were ""a little worried about the new rap entrance music,"" and suggested that he kick off his speech with jokes at his own expense to ""take himself down a peg."" But, the president responded, ""after 4Â½ years, how many pegs are there left?"" Obama went for it anyway, joking about his appearance -- ""These days I look in the mirror and I gotta admit: I'm not the strapping young Muslim socialist that I used to be,"" he said -- and his recent ""rookie mistakes,"" one of which being his remark about California Attorney General Kamala Harris. At a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee in California, Obama called Harris the country's ""best-looking attorney general."" ""As you can imagine, I got in trouble when I got back home,"" Obama said. ""Who knew (Attorney General) Eric Holder was so sensitive?"" Then there was his pitiful basketball score at the White House Easter Egg Roll, and the kerfuffle over Jay-Z and BeyoncÃ©'s trip to Cuba. ""Maybe I have lost a step, but some things are beyond my control,"" he said. ""For example, this whole controversy about Jay-Z going to Cuba. It's unbelievable. I got 99 problems, and now Jay-Z's one."" The second term can take its toll, he went on, quipping that he's tried taking inspiration from his wife, Michelle -- but bangs don't really work on the commander-in-chief, as photos displayed on the screen proved. He's also been advised to take a page from Michael Douglas' performance in 1995's ""The American President."" Obama asked Douglas, who was in the audience, ""What's your secret? Could it be that you were an actor in an Aaron Sorkin liberal fantasy? Might that have something to do with it? I don't know."" While he was airing out his frustrations, the president acknowledged the political bickering in Congress. ""It's simple: we need to make progress on some important issues,"" he said. ""Take the sequester: Republicans fell in love with this thing. And now they can't stop talking about how much they hate it -- it's like we're trapped in a Taylor Swift album."" The press was also included in his standup routine. The History Channel, whose depiction of Satan in its TV miniseries ""The Bible"" left viewers claiming that it resembled the president, wasn't in attendance, likely because of that incident, Obama said. ""Of course, that never kept Fox News from showing up -- they actually thought the comparison was not fair to Satan,"" he joked. To CNN, he said he admired the ""commitment to cover all sides of the story, just in case one of them happens to be accurate,"" while he commended the ""nice change of pace"" at MSNBC. The network now has his former political adviser David Axelrod working for them, whereas ""MSNBC used to work for David Axelrod."" Although he kept the audience laughing, the president made sure to address the tragedies that have happened over the past few weeks. ""These have been some hard days for too many of our citizens,"" he said, closing out his speech. ""As we gather here tonight, our thoughts are not far from the people of Boston, the people of West,Texas, and the families in the Midwest who are coping with some terrible floods. So we've had some difficult days."" Yet through the efforts of first and all those who helped those during their time of need, ""even when the days seem darkest, we have seen humanity shine at its brightest."" As the invited guests arrived at Saturday's dinner, they were curious about the tone Obama would strike in light of the headlines. But with TBS' late-night talk show host Conan O'Brien tasked with leading the night's ceremony, at least a little comedy was a certainty. The ""Conan"" comedian said when his role was announced in February that guests could expect ""(two) minutes of jokes, then 40 minutes on public employee pension reform."" O'Brien first hosted the Correspondents' Dinner in 1995. Obama, who attended the gala for the fifth time Saturday, has also become a pro at landing some of the night's biggest punchlines. The president quipped at last year's dinner, which was hosted by ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, that his hair had grayed so much since taking office he was just a few years out from looking like Morgan Freeman. The Beltway gala, also known as the ""nerd prom,"" sees Washington's newsmakers stroll a red carpet that's also filled with press and stars from across entertainment. Attendees included fashion influencers like Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, and sports stars like Olympic champ Gabrielle Douglas and Louisville sophomore Kevin Ware, who suffered a horrific leg break during an NCAA tournament game last month. There were also enough famous faces to have the night mistaken for an awards ceremony. Kerry Washington, Rebel Wilson, Katy Perry, Sofia Vergara, John Legend, Elizabeth Banks, Psy, Michael J. Fox and Matthew Perry were all in attendance. With the president being a professed fan of Showtime's ""Homeland,"" perhaps it wasn't surprising to see stars Claire Danes and Morena Baccarin there as well. Some of the night's best lines actually came from Kevin Spacey, who participated in a comedic video billed as ""secret footage"" showing how the Correspondents' Dinner comes together. Spacey, as his ""House of Cards"" character, Majority Whip Frank Underwood, wheeled and dealed with both press and politicians. ""Washington and Hollywood: Some new faces, some old faces, and some new faces on old faces. And I do sympathize, Conan, and not just for that backstabbing Leno, but having to host. It must be so hard to write jokes about a town that already is one,"" Spacey said in the spoof. ""Democrats, Republicans, the White House, Congress -- you all came together to make this spoof. That's what real bipartisanship looks like. I may lie, cheat and intimidate to get what I want, but at least I get the job done. So I hope some of you were taking notes."" O'Brien's routine was well-received, as he closed the night by riffing on the ""nerd prom"" theme, pointing out how much the event resembled a high school cafeteria. With so many stars there on shows that draw their drama from the Beltway, O'Brien did an imaginary casting for a ""major TV miniseries about the power players in Washington."" Vice President Joe Biden would be played by Bob Barker, while Speaker of the House John Boehner would be played by ""tan mom."" When O'Brien focused his humor on the president, he nailed him on his jobs strategy: ""As you all know, the president is hard at work creating jobs. Since he was first elected, the number of popes has doubled. The number of 'Tonight Show' hosts has tripled."" But the comedian also took a moment for reflection as he brought up the Boston Marathon bombing, thanking the president ""for visiting that great city and helping those people begin to heal."" The dinner, which raises money for journalism scholarships, was first established in 1920 with the intent to increase communication between the president and the press. It was a men-only event until 1962, when President John F. Kennedy said he wouldn't attend unless women were invited as well.","NEW: President riffs on news networks, Jay-Z, hairdo .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- The South Korean Navy fired warning shots after three North Korean patrol boats crossed the maritime border at the Yellow Sea, an official with the South Korean Defense Ministry said. The North Korean boats crossed into the South Korean waters at the boundary, known as Northern Limit Line (NLL), at around 4 p.m. local time (3 a.m. ET) on Tuesday. The ships returned to the northern side after a South Korean naval vessel fired ten warning shots. The NLL is the de facto maritime border, which stretches from the western coast of the peninsula into the Yellow Sea, marking the boundary between the two neighbors. It was set by the United Nations following the Korean War but the North does not recognize it. Incidents have been known to occur on and around the border, including one earlier this year when North and South Korean artillery batteries exchanged hundreds of shells.","South Korean Navy fires at three North Korean patrol boats Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- The European Union is stepping in to save its dairy from going sour. The EU Commission announced Thursday it will pay for temporary storage of butter, skimmed milk powder and certain cheeses in order to help its farmers deal with the impact of Russian economic sanctions. In a tit-for-tat move against Western sanctions, Russian President Vladimir Putin banned imports of most agriculture products from the U.S., the European Union, Norway, Canada and Australia. The move was in response to countries imposing economic sanctions against Russia in the aftermath of the flight MH17 disaster. The EU has already announced that it will spend $43.2 million helping peach and nectarine growers hit by the ban, followed by a $165 million aid package for certain fruit and vegetable farmers. Europe's food exports to Russia were worth $15.8 billion in 2013, making up about 10% of the bloc's agriculture exports, according to EU data. European countries sold more than $3 billion worth of dairy products to Russia in 2013 -- $1.3 billion worth of cheese, $192 million in butter and $140 million of fresh milk. The new measures will allow farmers to store their dairy products for longer. ""It gives us time to find other markets to sell these products,"" EU spokesman Roger Waite said. The price tag on the help for milk farmers is not yet clear as details will be announced next week. ""At the moment, there is no formal ceiling on butter and skimmed milk products,"" Waite said. But the ban of foreign food is more than just an inconvenience for Russians. Russia is the world's fifth largest agricultural importer and remains dependent on food supply from abroad -- its agricultural trade deficit extended to $26 billion in 2013, according to data from the European Commission. With billions of dollars worth of food disappearing from the market, prices are likely to go up and experts forecast increased Russian inflation, which is already running at 7.5%. Russians will still be able to enjoy European wines and spirits, as well as bread, pasta and cereals as these have escaped the embargo. In 2013, EU countries sold nearly $1 billion worth of spirits and $733 million worth of wine to Russia.

"(CNN) -- True crime stories are usually messier than fiction: They may be considered ""solved"" but still raise questions that can't be answered. That is true of CNN's five-part series, ""Taken: The coldest case ever solved."" Readers delved into the details like armchair detectives. Many amateur sleuths told us they devoured the tale of the 1957 kidnapping and murder of Maria Ridulph in a single sitting. Then they filled the comments sections with some very good questions. We know some of the answers. But other mysteries remain, perhaps forever. Such is the nature of cold cases. Question 1: Strange, the guy knew the girls, being their neighbor, while they didn't know him? And in a small town where everybody knew everybody else? Several readers asked why Kathy Sigman didn't know or recognize John Tessier as the kidnapper who called himself ""Johnny,"" especially if he lived a couple of blocks away in this small town. He certainly seemed to know who Maria was. Perhaps the answer has to do with the difference in their ages. Kathy was 8. Maria was 7. Tessier was 18. Think back to when you were a kid. Do you remember any of the teenagers from your neighborhood? John Tessier, or Jack McCullough as he was later known, had more reason to know and remember the Ridulph and Sigman families. Maria's sisters put on backyard plays, and he told CNN that he recalled attending one as a boy. An old newspaper account reveals a strange twist: At the age of 8, Tessier was struck by a taxicab driven by Kathy's father. Police and prosecutors say Tessier had an eerie fixation with Maria. Question 2: If only police had let Kathy get a look at Johnny Tessier in 1957, this whole case might have turned out differently. Why didn't they? CNN was unable to obtain all of the police and FBI reports -- some remain under seal. So it cannot be fully explained why Kathy never got a look at Tessier at the time. He did not have a criminal record then, so there would have been no mug shot. Later, Kathy told us, she was never allowed inside the Tessier house after the kidnapping. She wonders now if there were too many secrets inside. Was his mother afraid she'd make the connection? Answers to many questions can be found in CNN's evidence gallery . It is clear from reading local news accounts that there was a strong feeling among local law enforcement officials that the kidnapping must have been the work of someone passing through town. That bias likely shaped the investigation. John Tessier did pass a polygraph test on December 10, 1957, and the FBI agent who administered the test believed that a teenager would not have been able to hide his involvement. The day after he was cleared, Tessier left town and joined the Air Force. He returned four years later, but by then Kathy Sigman and her family were living on the other side of town. Question 3: Kathy described ""Johnny"" as having long blond hair but the photos show him with brown hair. Black and white photographs make hair appear to be darker than it is, particularly the hair color popularly known as ""dishwater blond."" Question 4: What time did it get dark outside? This question stirred considerable debate; it deals with the disputed time of the kidnapping and whether Kathy Sigman could get a good look at the kidnapper. The sun goes down early in Illinois in December, by about 4:20 p.m. Whether the kidnapping occurred before 6:20 p.m., as police believe, or about 7 p.m., as the defense contends, doesn't matter: It would have been dark either way. Question 5: What was the ""Western"" Maria's father was watching when she went back inside for her doll? And what time did it come on? Couldn't this information help establish the time of the kidnapping? Michael Ridulph told the FBI that he had started watching ""Cheyenne"" or perhaps some ""Jim Bowie"" frontier show at about 6:30 p.m., after Maria had gone out to play. This is consistent with a reader's research that ""Cheyenne"" began at 6:30 p.m. Central Time. It is not clear whether the FBI ever verified when the show aired, but CNN does not have the full set of FBI reports. Hundreds of pages remain under seal by the agency, which cites ""ongoing investigations."" Question 6: Why was Maria not reported missing until 8:10 p.m.? The Ridulph family's FBI interviews indicate that they conducted a thorough search of the neighborhood before contacting the authorities. Maria's father, Michael, used a whistle to call her. Maria had a tendency to wander off. Her father was embarrassed about a year earlier when she wandered away and turned up just as a search party was being organized. Her brother, Chuck, also later expressed regret that he did not wave down a passing patrol car while they searched for her. Question 7: I remember this case well. It reminded me of the Grimes sisters, which happened a year before. Why didn't these people keep a better eye on their children? We have no way of knowing what Kathy and Maria's parents knew about the Grimes case, but the crime was well known in the Chicago area. The Grimes sisters were older and lived much closer to the city. Barbara and Patricia Grimes, ages 15 and 13, vanished in December 1956 on the way to see the Elvis Presley movie ""Love Me Tender."" Their bodies were found in a field in January 1957. The Grimes case remains unsolved to this day. John Tessier was aware of the Grimes case; he mentioned it to an Air Force recruiter on December 4, 1957. According to the FBI report, he ""appeared well-read on the Grimes murder."" He also mentioned that he was glad he wasn't in Sycamore the previous night because a little girl had gone missing. He added that he'd never be considered a suspect in the Sycamore case because his girlfriend's father was a deputy sheriff, the FBI reports state. Question 8: I'm curious about a part of this story that wasn't elaborated on, the disappearance of his daughter. Is he a suspect in that as well? Christine Tessier vanished in 2005 at age 34; her body was identified in June 2013. She was found in the drainage ditch of a golf course in San Antonio, Texas, shortly after she disappeared. But the body was so badly decomposed it went unidentified for years. Police are investigating the case as a homicide but are saying little else. Jack McCullough and his wife, Sue, say he was in Seattle at the time Christine vanished. He says he could not afford to go to Texas to search for her. Finally, the Maria Ridulph case is but one mystery among thousands, as two readers reminded us. They provided a list of some of the cold cases involving girls and teens from Washington state, where Jack McCullough lived for decades. They want his DNA checked. We cross-checked our readers' lists with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and The Charley Project.

"(CNN) -- The death toll in Syria is probably now approaching 70,000, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Tuesday. In early January, Pillay said that 60,000 people in Syria had died, a figure that she called ""truly shocking."" She blamed the international community for failing to act. At that time, CNN tried to put the number in perspective. Sixty thousand people is roughly the population of Terre Haute, Indiana; or Cheyenne, Wyoming. It's how many people would fit in Dodger Stadium, and it's more than the 50,000-plus U.S. combat deaths in Vietnam. The war in Syria has been raging since March 2011 when protesters, partly inspired by Arab Spring uprisings in the region, began demonstrating for more freedom. That movement quickly morphed into a movement against President Bashar al-Assad, who was appointed president by Syria's rubber-stamp parliament in 2000 after his father died. The largely amorphous group of anti-al-Assad rebels who have been trying to oust al-Assad, the Free Syrian Army, has had many casualties, but many innocent civilians have died. No area of the country seems safe. The opposition activist organization Local Coordination Committees of Syria (LCCS) said 136 people were killed in war-related violence across Syria on Tuesday, including 47 in Damascus and its suburbs, and 32 in Aleppo. CNN cannot independently verify those figures. In mid-January, Aleppo University was the scene of horrific violence. One student described to CNN his dizzying attempt to help another after bombs exploded at the school, saying that he reached out his hand to help only to wind up grasping a fellow student's severed hand. Every day looks the same in Syria. Al-Assad's forces bombard neighborhoods. Body counts are recorded by anti-government rebels and activists. United Nations envoys -- two of them so far -- have tried to negotiate to end to the fighting. In late January, envoy Lakhdar Brahimi tried to persuade the U.N. Security Council to do something. ""Syria is being destroyed bit by bit and, in destroying Syria, the region is being pushed into a situation that is extremely bad and extremely important for the entire world,"" he said after meeting with the body in private. Throughout the war, there have been several instances in which observers have surmised that the bloodshed might be near an end. They've been wrong every time. Al-Assad has made those predictions seem even more foolish when he's given speeches in which he says all his government is doing is fighting back ""terrorists."" There are Syrians who still very much support al-Assad, too. For example, in a recent CNN exclusive, CNN's Frederik Pleitgen reported from Saidnaya, a predominantly Christian town outside Damascus that is standing firmly behind al-Assad. ""I don't know why, but we love the president very much,"" said Housam Azar, a Saidnaya resident and organizer of the town's militia. ""Sure, there have been mistakes, but we love the president a lot.""","U.N. high commissioner for human rights said a month ago that death toll was 60,000 .

"(CNN) -- Alabama lawmakers are calling on U.S. District Judge Mark Fuller to resign over allegations that he hit his wife ""several times with a closed fist"" in an Atlanta hotel room in August. U.S. Sens. Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby of Alabama released separate statements Thursday calling for Fuller's resignation. Shelby said Fuller has ""lost the confidence of his colleagues and the people of the state of Alabama."" Sessions said Fuller's ""unacceptable personal conduct violates the trust that has been placed in him."" According to a police report obtained by CNN, Fuller's wife, Kelli, suffered ""lacerations to her mouth and forehead"" in the August 9 incident at the downtown Atlanta Ritz-Carlton hotel. He also grabbed his wife ""by her hair, pulling it out,"" the report says, leading her to suffer ""bruises on her ankle, thigh and knee from being dragged."" Fuller's wife was ""treated on scene by (paramedics) but refused to be transported to the hospital,"" according to news release from the Atlanta Police Department. Fuller spent the night an Atlanta jail after being charged with misdemeanor battery in the alleged domestic violence incident. Earlier this month, he accepted a pretrial diversion without having to admit guilt. The program, typical for first-time domestic dispute offenders, involves a substance abuse assessment and counseling. Fuller's wife was heard on 911 calls telling dispatchers, ""Help me, please. Please, help me. He's beating on me."" She agreed to the terms of the pretrial diversion. Following his acceptance into the pretrial diversion program, Fuller said in a statement to CNN, ""I deeply regret this incident and look forward to working to resolve this issue with my family, where they should be resolved. I look forward to completing the family counseling that I voluntarily began several weeks ago and to successfully completing the requirements of the diversion."" Toobin: Wife-beating is not a private matter . U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Alabama, compared Fuller's infractions to recent incidents in the National Football League. ""If an NFL player can lose his job because of domestic violence then a federal judge should definitely not be allowed to keep his life-time appointment to the federal bench,"" she said in a statement. Sewell said she would support moving forward on an impeachment if Fuller doesn't resign. Fuller's attorney said calls for his client's resignation are ""unwarranted"" and said drawing conclusions between Fuller and the ""Ray Rice case ... represents a failure of critical thinking."" Immediately following Fuller's arrest, all of his cases were reassigned to other judges, his attorney Barry Ragsdale told CNN, and ""no cases are coming to him."" His return to the bench is ""all dependent on when the 11th circuit court investigation is done,"" Ragsdale said. Fuller was confirmed to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama in 2002.

"(CNN) -- Many parents don't realize that the worst asthma day of the year actually occurs in September. Clinical studies have shown that greatest number of hospitalizations due to asthma peak 17 days after Labor Day, which in 2013 will be September 19. Why? As students return to school, there are a number of external factors, including respiratory allergens, viral infections and environmental irritants that can act together to create a ""perfect storm"" of asthma triggers. To better understand the September phenomenon, we need to better characterize some of the underlying causes. Outdoor allergens may seem to be the most obvious trigger. Ragweed, one the largest contributors to upper respiratory symptoms in the United States, produces pollen most aggressively after mid-August. However, indoor allergens can be a much more serious issue for patients with asthma. Schools across the United States contain a number of potential respiratory allergens, including mold, dust mites, pet dander and, in some cases, cockroaches and mice. When children switch from a summertime outdoor environment to a climate-controlled indoor environment, overall daily exposure to these allergens can increase and severe symptoms can result. What's in a pollen count anyway? Additionally, even though ""flu season"" is commonly known as a winter phenomenon, contagious viral infections are spread and shared as much, if not more, in September as they are in January. The school week is spent in an enclosed space with hundreds of other children (many of whom do not have sophisticated hygiene practices), which can provide stress to any student's immune system. Catching ""the common cold"" can cause additional problems for a child with asthma. Many respiratory infections can lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of asthma symptoms. Indoor air particulates such as aerosols, chalk dust and other irritants, can also lead to an increase in asthma symptoms. While these irritants may not trigger a true IgE allergen response, they can cause rhinitis and other conditions that can exacerbate asthma. American kids have higher allergy risk . For patients with allergic asthma, exposure to allergens, infections and irritants can make mid-September a very challenging time. In addition, the combination of virus and sensitization with high allergen exposure substantially increases the risk of hospital admission. So what can parents do to avoid these asthma triggers? Good preparation includes education. During a back-to-school wellness check-up, it's a good idea for parents to talk with their family clinician about both allergies and asthma if they suspect their child may be experiencing either condition. After understanding the history of the symptoms, the clinician may order an allergy blood test to determine if possible allergic triggers are contributing to the asthma and other allergy-like symptoms. If testing does identify allergic sensitization, a clinician can then advise parents on how to manage exposure to the allergens. The first step in any allergy treatment plan is to avoid exposure as much as possible. While it may be almost impossible to remove all dust mites from a school, reducing exposure to them at home is a much more manageable task. Allergen-proof pillowcase covers can dramatically reduce exposure to dust mites, and since allergy symptoms usually occur because of cumulative exposure, allergen avoidance at night may help a child feel better all day long. The same is true for mold and other allergens. It may be easier to control mold in the home environment (bathroom and/or bedroom) rather than the school environment. The key to effectively reducing a patient's exposure to allergens is to know which triggers to specifically target. The ""September Asthma Epidemic"" is coming, but with appropriate preparation and education, it can be managed. If you're unsure about your child's risk, speak with your doctor about his or her past history and consider testing. Together you and your family clinician can determine which triggers might affect your child and create a plan to better manage the epidemic.

"(CNN) -- A deadly winter storm that began in Southern California and stretches to Texas threatens to wreck Thanksgiving week travel plans all the way to the Atlantic. At least six people have lost their lives in traffic crashes blamed on the storm system since late last week. An arctic air mass is expected to keep temperatures 15 to 20 degrees below normal along the East Coast through Thursday. Even if the system fails to deliver heavy snow, it could cause air travel disruptions with high winds, forecasters say. Airlines flying in and out of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport ""pre-canceled about 300 departures to reduce the number of stranded travelers"" Sunday in ""anticipation of winter precipitation,"" the airport's official Twitter account said. Ten percent of flights at Oklahoma City's Will Rogers World Airport were also canceled due to the weather Sunday. Three travelers died in a multi-vehicle crash on icy Interstate 40 in northwest Texas late Friday, Texas State Trooper Chris Ray said. The dead included a person who got out of his vehicle to render aid and was struck, Ray said. Anther 11 people were injured in the crash, some critically. At least 20 people were taken to local hospitals from collisions within three miles of the fatal pileup, according to Oldham County, Texas, Sheriff David Medlin. ""We have about 4 inches of snow on the ground,"" Medlin told CNN on Sunday. ""Road conditions are still dangerous, and people should drive cautiously and avoid roads unless absolutely needed."" A 4-year-old girl was killed Friday when a car carrying her slid off icy U.S. Highway 70 in New Mexico, said the state Department of Public Safety. The child was not properly restrained, the department said. Also in New Mexico, a woman in her 50s died Saturday when the pickup truck that she was riding in rear-ended a semi-truck during heavy traffic near Gallup, New Mexico State Police said. In Yuba County, California, a 52-year-old passenger in a car died when a tree fell on top of the vehicle Thursday, the county sheriff's office said. Ice is blamed for causing Willie Nelson's band bus to spin out of control and crash into a bridge pillar on Interstate 30 near Sulphur Springs, Texas, early Saturday. Three of the five members of Nelson's band were hurt, according to police and the band. Nelson was not on board. Flood threat in Arizona . Lingering rain prolonged the flood threat in Arizona, the National Weather Service said. Friday's 1.6 inches of rain in Phoenix made it the second wettest November day ever recorded in the desert city. Lighter amounts fell Saturday, but drainage areas already were full. In New Mexico and West Texas, snow and ice covered Interstate 10. The highway was open through Texas, but officials urged caution, especially on bridges. New Mexico could see up to 8 inches of snow accumulating through Monday. Storm will reach Carolinas by Monday . On Sunday, the forecast for northern Texas and parts of Oklahoma called for rain and sleet, and some spots were expected to get up to 4 inches of snow. Rain and sleet will extend through Dallas and into northern Louisiana. ""Tomorrow is going to be the big event. After midnight, it's going to be so close to freezing, that's when we're anticipating it to be bad,"" Sgt. Lonny Haschel with the Texas Department of Public Safety said Sunday. Rain is expected to stretch from Texas to Georgia on Monday and to the Carolinas on Monday night, with sleet and snow in northern parts of that swath. The heaviest rain is expected across parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida and South Carolina. By Tuesday, the rain will reach the mid-Atlantic states and parts of the Northeast. Freezing rain could develop in the southern and central Appalachians. Travel delays next week in Northeast . Rain, wind and possibly snow will cause travel delays beginning as early as Tuesday in the East, said CNN meteorologist Melissa Le Fevre. ""We are going to see delays,"" Le Fevre said. ""We're just waiting to see if the impacts are going to be severe or just annoying."" The deciding factor will be whether a low-pressure system moving north out of the Gulf of Mexico travels inland or close to the East Coast, she said. According to AAA projections, 43.4 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more from home during the Thanksgiving holiday weekend this year. Fewer people traveling for Thanksgiving .

"(CNN) -- Could simply sitting on a train or in a classroom land you in the hospital? That's a possibility in Northern California, where health officials are trying to get the word out that a University of California, Berkeley, student may have exposed classmates and strangers to measles. The school's university health services said a student who contracted measles -- likely during a trip overseas -- had spent time in and around campus and commuting to and from his home in Contra Costa County on Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, trains during the February 4 to 7 morning commutes and in the late evening. In the process, he may have infected any number of people, and not just those he rubbed elbows with or shared bodily fluid with. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes, measles spreads through coughing, sneezing or breathing and ""any child who is exposed to it and is not immune will probably get the disease."" Erika Jenssen, the communicable disease program director for Contra Costa Health Services, said Thursday even those who shared the same airspace as the infected student 1 to 2 hours after the fact -- and who have not been vaccinated for measles -- may get sick. ""Measles is a very serious viral illness,"" Jenssen told reporters, ""and it is very contagious."" The good news is that the majority of Americans can't get it, because they are vaccinated for life. The Berkeley student, though, was not vaccinated. Measles start out much like a common cold, with high fevers, red eyes and a telltale rash often following. Children are particularly susceptible: About 10% of them who get measles come down with ear infections, and roughly 5% end up with pneumonia. One or two of 1,000 children with measles die, according to the CDC. Measles vaccinations typically are given at an early age and over multiple rounds. A person isn't considered fully vaccinated until they have gone through the whole gamut, meaning that young people midway through that process still may be at risk.","A Cal Berkeley student diagnosed with the measles may have exposed others .

"(CNN) -- Superstorm Sandy has caused more damage, death and homelessness in New York and New Jersey than any climate-related event in living memory. Yet with two damaging hurricanes two years in a row, and with what science is telling us, this does not feel like a once-in-a-lifetime event. It feels like a trend. With what we know about rising sea level and what we understand about the rate of world warming and how tropical storms pull their strength from the temperature of the ocean, Sandy feels like a very harshly spoken word to the wise. And so the answer to the question ""What should we do next?"" may be difficult, with truly profound implications. I think we really have only two viable long-term building options: 1) Barricade. 2) Retreat. Rebuilding is not a viable option. And what would we barricade? The whole Long Island to southern New Jersey area? Boston to Washington? The East Coast? Opinion: What's next after Superstorm Sandy? The Netherlands relies on dikes to keep out the sea. There are gates in England to close rivers to storm surges of the kind that last week blew open my friend's garage door on 22nd Street east of 11th Avenue in New York City, suddenly washing him to the back of his studio, submerging him briefly, floating tons of his art-making tools and ruining decades of drawings and the tools of his trade. Others fared worse, of course. One of my neighbors nearly drowned trying to walk from her home to higher ground half a mile away; two unknown heroes in survival suits wading in waist-high water appeared at the height of the storm and pulled her and her swimming dogs into a canoe and walked them to safety. Her house remains habitable, unlike many others along the coast of Long Island, New York and New Jersey. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . By flooding areas that few suspected were within the reach of seawater, Sandy told us that the ""coast"" is a wider ribbon than we thought it was last week. So for the hard questions: Should people rebuild? Should the whole country pay for it? I certainly love shoreside living. I love walking the beach in the morning with my dogs. I love my boat and the people at Montauk's Westlake Marina where I keep it. I love many facets of the always dynamic water borderlands, the birds and fishes, the turtles and dolphins and other creatures who, in their seasons, draw tight to our coastline. There is magic. And part of that magic is its timelessness. And part of the timelessness is that as the coast changes, the coast is what remains. And yet it moves. I have federal flood insurance, thank you. But really, it's time you considered cutting me off. I am not against people taking their chances along the shore. Risk is part of what draws us. But the risk should be ours to take and bear if we want to. Federal flood insurance is a counterproductive way for the rest of the country to subsidize people -- putting billions of dollars and millions of lives at continuous risk, encouraging wholly inappropriate development. And it encourages larger, more expensive homes (often second homes) than fewer people would build if their insurance premiums reflected real risk. In fact, few private insurers will touch most of these places. Let us think twice, fully comprehend that the stakes are ours alone, and then let those of us willing to risk it take our chances. The government should at this time help victims get their lives back on track. But no federal dollars should magically appear for rebuilding in flood-prone areas. The spots that flood will take repeated hits. Everyone knows this. To help people rebuild in those places is to help put lives and investment in harm's way. It's foolish. Where I live, the houses that stayed dry are the ones just high enough to let water flow around into the extensive, protected wetlands. The houses that flooded stand where water goes on its way to wetlands. Eatocracy: Volunteers dish up support after Sandy . Wetlands are wet for a reason. We would be wise to rebuild in ways that let water flow around dwellings into restored wetlands. Then, two things would start happening: . One: Wetlands, recovered oyster reefs, fish nurseries and wildlife would all be part of a revitalized coastal protection strategy that simultaneously includes recovery of valuable living resources. Two: The taxpaying public could begin to regain access to the coast for recreation, access too often denied by private development that is largely enabled by taxpayer-funded federal flood insurance. Eliminating taxpayer-funded flood insurance to people now insured in low, flood-prone areas (including where I live) can be done compassionately, honoring existing insured persons with funding in the aftermath of this wreckage. But importantly, insurance that would up to now go for rebuilding should be redirected toward relocation and resettlement. That is easier said; for many, relocation would be wrenching. But losing your home or your life can be wrenching, too. Insurance for new building in flood-prone areas should be ended. People who really want to take their chances should do just that, or pay real commercial insurance premiums if they can find a willing insurer. Eventually even Lloyd's of London will likely decide it's had enough. Insurers must be realistic about risk in ways politicians don't have to be. Will we choose a wiser course that recognizes that we're still in the path of the next big storm? I wouldn't bet on it. The nonviable option -- to keep rebuilding all the time -- is what people will likely choose. From a decision-making viewpoint, it's easier to make no decision. But the frequency of big storms appears likely to increase in the Northeast. It's not a time for easy decisions, because we won't be faced with easy events.

"(CNN) -- Most of us have agreed to share a cab with a stranger while traveling, but we haven't wound up in jail as a result. That wrong-place-wrong-time nightmare scenario, however, is apparently what's happened to Stacey Addison, an American veterinarian from Oregon, who has been traveling solo around the world since January 2013. According to the Oregonian newspaper and Addison's Facebook page, on September 5, Addison traveled from Indonesia into Timor-Leste (also known as East Timor) and shared a cab from the border crossing at Batugade to the capital city of Dili. ""Along the way, another passenger asked to pick up a package at a DHL office,"" reports the Oregonian. ""Police, acting on a tip from Indonesian authorities, were watching and found methamphetamine in the parcel. ""Addison and everyone else in the cab were arrested."" ""I was held in the Dili Detention Center for four nights then released after an initial hearing,"" Addison later posted on Facebook. ""The judge ordered that my passport be held until further investigations have been completed."" ""(Addison) was conditionally released September 9 but wasn't allowed to leave the country,"" according to the Oregonian. ""Prosecutors told her she was needed as a witness for an investigation that could take a year."" Solitary confinement, hair chopped . After an October 29 court appearance, Addison was jailed again without explanation or warning, and spent five days in solitary confinement. It's unclear when Addison will be released. The Oregonian reports that local U.S. consular officials have visited twice with Addison in prison and that U.S. State Department officials will meet with the Timorese ambassador on Friday. Addison's mother, Bernadette Kero, has established a Facebook page PleaseHelpStacey. On November 1, Kero posted the following update: . ""Yesterday I spoke with Josh at the U.S. Embassy in Dili after his visit with Stacey at Gleno prison. ""He said that conditions are basic but decent. ... She is in 'Induction' period so alone for 5 days and her hair has been cut short per prison protocol. She will be moved to the Female Unit on Monday. ""He told me she was being strong. ... She (said) how difficult it was to be all alone in a small cell with nothing to do but worry all day."" ""I am trying to keep busy and keep the anxiety at bay, but the uncertainty is always there,"" Addison posted on Facebook on October 19, between her first and second incarcerations. ""This isn't how I had imagined I would be spending my time during the trip of a lifetime. I hope it is all over soon.""","Travel nightmare comes true for American Stacey Addison in Timor-Leste .

"(CNN) -- After a year of tumultuous weather and global change, it should not be surprising that 2012 proved to be a transformative period for public opinion on energy. Changing attitudes on the most hotly debated topics matter a great deal because they set the course for future policy decisions. Taking a closer look at trends over the past 12 months hints at what to expect in several key areas of the U.S. energy landscape in 2013. Natural gas boom -- and controversy . Hydraulic fracturing, also known as ""fracking,"" has been around for more than half a century, but recently expanded rapidly because of advances in horizontal drilling deep underground. Despite this proliferation of new wells, 59% of Americans say they are unfamiliar with the term, down from 63% in March, according to the latest findings from the University of Texas at Austin's Energy Poll. Although the majority still does not seem to know much about fracking, a deluge of media attention to this controversial extraction technology has likely raised its profile significantly since last year. However, increased awareness is not synonymous with public approval. Among those familiar with hydraulic fracturing, support decreased from 48% to 41% over six months. Similarly, a December poll by Bloomberg reported that 66% of Americans would like greater government oversight of the process, up from 56% in September. When Matt Damon's new film ""Promised Land"" debuts in January, expect public recognition and heated debate over hydraulic fracturing to rise further. Climate change gets real . When Gov. Mitt Romney quipped, ""President Obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans"" at the 2012 Republican National Convention, his audience burst into laughter. During the debates that followed, neither party's nominee mentioned climate change once as a policy priority. Weeks later, Superstorm Sandy ravaged the Northeastern United States, flooding many parts of New York City, New Jersey and other regions along the Atlantic Coast. Both candidates immediately canceled campaign events in the wake of the storm and Mayor Michael Bloomberg endorsed President Obama, citing his commitment to tackling climate change. After a summer of record-breaking drought followed by this single powerful hurricane in a major metropolitan area, attitudes shifted. In March, 65% of Americans surveyed said they thought that climate change was occurring. By September, after the summer drought, that number reached 73%, with the greatest gains among Republicans and independent voters. Earlier this month, The Associated Press-GfK poll followed up, reporting that after Sandy, 78% of Americans now say global temperatures are rising. Because weather can influence opinions on climate change, it's possible that a wet and stormy winter -- ironically, also exacerbated by climate change -- could push attitudes in the other direction. Regardless, in 2013 expect to hear less argument about whether the Earth is warming and a more serious policy discussion by elected officials across levels of government about how we might mitigate the effects of rising seas, changing ocean acidity, agricultural uncertainty and extreme weather events. Renewables gain ground . Renewable energy technologies have been available for decades, but 2012 may have been the tipping point for their wider adoption. There has been a significant increase in the percentage of Americans who say they are likely to buy hybrid or electric vehicles or use ""smart"" electric meters within the next five years. Most notably, between September 2011 and September 2012, the percentage of Americans who say they are likely to install solar panels at home increased from 21% to 28%. These trends may reflect changing attitudes on climate, media attention to energy during the election cycle, rising gas prices or cheaper, widely advertised new alternatives. Most likely, it's a combination of all these. What's clear is that we are now on the cusp of a renewables revolution with greater options and cost-saving technologies than ever. They are finally becoming more affordable, reliable and practical, with solar power at the helm. Still, it's important to note that as we ring in 2013, China, not the United States, has taken the lead on renewables. The big picture . Polls tell the story of how attitudes are shifting, but short of having a crystal ball, there is no way to unequivocally predict what major world events will influence our nation's energy future. For example, another nuclear disaster or offshore oil spill could play an enormous role in shaping the next generation of energy priorities. What can we count on in 2013? In the past year, the percentage of Americans saying they consider themselves knowledgeable on how energy is produced, delivered and used has increased from 24% to 33%. More are likely to seek added information about reducing their own energy use and a higher percentage rate energy issues as important to them. Amid economic uncertainty, volatile prices and global unrest, Americans are paying closer attention to the energy decisions that affect us all. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sheril Kirshenbaum.","Public attitudes shifted on key energy issues in 2012 .

"(CNN) -- It seemed an unlikely prospect at the start of the year but Roger Federer has the very real chance of ending 2014 at the summit of the men's game for the sixth time. Sunday saw the 33-year-old Swiss maestro cut the gap still further on Novak Djokovic by winning his hometown tournament in Basel for a sixth time with a 6-2 6-2 win over Belgium's David Goffin. Federer has closed to less than 500 points behind his Serbian rival with a massive 2,500 points on offer for next week's Paris Masters and the season-ending ATP World Tour Finals in London. The 17-time grand slam winner was year-end number one from 2004-07 and last achieved the feat in 2009 , but his fortunes have been revived under new coach Stefan Edberg. The Basel triumph is his fifth title of the year and after winning the Shanghai Masters earlier this month, beating Djokovic in the semifinals, he is on a 12-match winning streak. There was never much doubt Federer would wrap up his 82nd career title from the moment he broke Goffin in the very first game. Goffin had gone into the match off the back of 43 wins in 45 matches, some on the second-tier Challenger Tour, but could not match the excellence of his opponent. An early break in the second set set the pattern again and Federer closed out victory after just 51 minutes with an audacious drop shot. ""I'm very happy with this week and with my season,"" said Federer, who has also led Switzerland into next month's Davis Cup final against France. ""I've had a lot of highlights this year and I'm hoping for one or two more,"" he added. In other ATP Tour action Sunday, Britain's Andy Murray saved five match points before beating Tommy Robredo of Spain in the final of the Valencia Open. Murray had to recover from a set down to level after a very tight second set tiebreaker, against a man he beat in the final to win the tournament in Shenzhen last month. The third set was also closely fought, with both men struggling physically. Murray emerged the winner after three hours and 19 minutes for his third title in five weeks. He moves up to fifth in the standings in the race for a place in the ATP World Tour Finals.","Roger Federer wins Basel title for sixth time .

"(CNN) -- Torontonians love Rob Ford. His brother? Not so much. Ford, the crack-smoking, wise-cracking, scandal-soaked mayor, coasted to an easy win on the Toronto city council Monday night. His brother, Doug Ford, who ran for Ford's old job as mayor -- lost. Rob Ford decided not to run for re-election as mayor after he was diagnosed with a malignant liposarcoma, a rare and aggressive cancer. The cancer, doctors said, spread from the fatty tissue of Ford's abdomen to other parts of his body. He tapped his campaign manager and brother, Doug, to run for mayor in his place. On Monday night, Rob Ford won the Ward 2 city council seat, with 58.9% of the votes. His brother lost the mayoral race to John Tory. Fall from grace . Rob Ford's fall from grace, if you can call it that, began in May 2013 with the release of a cell phone video that appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine. The Toronto city council largely stripped him of his mayoral powers months later over those and other allegations of bad behavior. Ford didn't back down, though, instead vowing ""outright war"" on the city council. The mayor apologized for ""a lot of stupid things,"" including having used crack cocaine, but he refused to resign or enter rehab. In fact, despite all the criticism and his becoming a punchline for jokes in Canada as well as the United States, Ford launched a bid for re-election. This past spring, after a local newspaper reported on a new video that allegedly showed him smoking crack cocaine, Ford relented on one front: by going into rehab. He returned to work in late June after a two-month rehab stint, saying he was ""ashamed, embarrassed and humiliated"" by some of his past actions. But he refused to resign or refrain from campaigning, saying to the voters of Toronto, ""I look forward to serving you for many, many more years."" Ford's term officially ends December 1.

"(CNN) -- A Florida police department is investigating one of its officers after he shot a 61-year-old woman in the back with a Taser on Tuesday afternoon. The incident was captured on videotape by a nearby witness. Officer Terry Mahan of the Tallahassee Police Department and other officers responded to complaints about open-air drug sales in the area, the police department said in a statement Wednesday. Probable-cause affidavits paint a scene in which officers feared for their safety because of angry residents berating police and calling others to the scene. Police had detained three people when Viola Young ""approached the police car inquiring about one of the individuals arrested,"" the statement said. ""An officer advised her to stay back, and a second officer approached Young and attempted to place her under arrest."" In the video, Young can be seen yanking her arm out of Mahan's grasp before turning and walking in the opposite direction. She takes only a few steps before the officer fires a Taser cartridge into Young's back. The woman collapses face-down on the pavement, then rolls over onto her back. Another police officer approaches Young and arrests her. In a narrative included in a probable-cause affidavit, Mahan wrote that he went to the scene after officers there called for backup. When he got there, he saw two officers engaged with two suspects on the ground, and ""there was a crowd of people that had gathered around them and were yelling at the officers,"" he wrote. As Mahan put one arrested suspect in the back of a patrol car, Young pulled up, forcing Mahan ""to take [his] focus off of one of the arrestees and engage her,"" Mahan said in his report. ""Young's actions obstructed officers while in the course of completing their legal duties,"" he wrote. Mahan told Young to leave. She responded that she wanted to know what was going, but Mahan told her, ""now was not the time for that,"" and instructed her to leave again. She refused, he wrote. ""I informed Viola Young that she was under arrest and reached out and took her left arm. Young yanked away, turned and began to move away from me in an attempt to defeat her lawful arrest,"" Mahan wrote. ""I deployed my Taser, and fired one cartridge striking Young in the back. Young was incapacitated and fell to the ground."" Mahan took Young into custody ""without any further resistance,"" he wrote in his report. Texas student tased by police exits coma, enters rehabilitation . From another officer's narrative, it appears police had to leave soon after the arrests ""due to the hostility of the individuals remaining at the scene."" Young was medically cleared by Leon County Emergency Medical Services before being sent to the Leon County Jail, along with the other three individuals arrested, police said. None of the four faces drug-related charges. They all were charged with resisting an officer without violence, and Laguna Young was charged with a probation violation that Leon County Jail records indicate stems from a previous conviction on cocaine and drug paraphernalia charges. Family wants answers in Florida teen's death after Tasering . Laguna Young was the only one of the four who had not been released as of Wednesday afternoon. It's not clear if Laguna Young, 41, is related to Viola Young. After reviewing the video of the tasing incident, Tallahassee Police Chief Michael DeLeo called for an internal investigation, he said. ""We will conduct a thorough investigation into this incident. We want to be transparent with the community by sharing what we can at this point, including the video,"" DeLeo said in a statement. Mahan has been placed on administrative leave with pay while the investigation is being conducted, DeLeo said. Because the case is now part of an internal affairs investigation, ""this will preclude us from making any other statements, other than what is in our release, in regards to this case until the full investigation is complete,"" police spokesman Officer David Northway said.

"(CNN) -- Jockeys may rely on real live horsepower to help them reach the winning post, but they still train like athletes. When you are riding half a ton of flesh at 40 mph you have to be able to hold your horse. The riders, as well as their runners, follow a strict fitness regime -- and the result is a proven formula for a well-balanced and healthy body. ""Fitness has changed massively from the days when jockeys were just turning up at the races and were drinking,"" flat racing jockey Martin Lane told CNN. ""Now we're at the peak of our fitness. It's definitely not just sitting on a horse!"" In the English town of Newmarket, ex-jockey Richard Perham runs a boot camp for jockeys at the British Racing School. Any budding jockey hoping to gain a license to ride from the British Horseracing Authority now has to pass a fitness assessment laid out by Perham. Getting race fit starts by building the key muscles used to guide the world's speediest steeds to the finish. The legs, lower body and core are the three areas of the body on which jockeys focus in training. Upper body strength is also crucial when it comes to controlling the horse. ""If you looked at a jockey without clothes on, there aren't many who have an ounce of fat underneath the skin,"" Perham told CNN. ""It's literally muscle and bone. Jockeys are incredibly well-toned athletes in the same way that Olympic champions Jessica Ennis or Mo Farah are."" Racing fit . Jockey training is not for the faint of heart, or those who like a lie-in. Lane trains six days a week -- and only allows himself a rest on Sunday mornings. ""I'm up around half past five or six most mornings,"" the 27-year-old explained. ""I'd then spend two and a half hours riding out. ""Then I'll have a cycle -- I ride 150 miles each week. The aerobic fitness from the cycling is what gets you through the season. ""Before the season starts, I'm at the gym with a personal trainer three mornings a week working on basic strength and a bit of boxing thrown in there as well. ""In the afternoons I go racing, and race riding keeps you pretty fit too."" Jockeys can also top up their conditioning at the British Racing School's training suite in Newmarket. Here resident fitness coach Yariv Kam, a former basketball player, oversees bleep tests, squats (at the wall and standing on wobble cushions), timed sit-ups, push and pull band exercises and the dreaded plank. All these exercises in some way replicate the crouched racing stance adopted by jockeys -- the so-called ""Martini glass"" position. This precarious pose also asks the riders to summon balancing skills, and this is tested on the ""equisizer"" -- a cross between a rocking horse and a bucking bronco. Complete with a swishing tail and cozy blanket, the equisizer is a lifesize, legless horse which simulates the forwards and backwards rhythm that jolts jockeys during the races. It is used, along with other simulators like Perham's own Rideaway device, to help jockeys stay balanced -- and stay on the horse. ""Balance and fitness are equally important for jockeys but balance must come first,"" explained Perham. ""In the same way that in yoga you need to hold those positions for a period of time, a jockey also needs core stability to maintain his balance."" One meal a day . Maintaining equilibrium is also important for jockeys when it comes to their weight. They are put under enormous pressure to meet weight requirements. In the U.S. and Great Britain, the minimum riding weight is 53 kg for the leaner flat racing jockeys and 61.5 kg for jump jockeys. The majority are naturally slim and slight, so their fitness regimes do not tend to be focused on weight loss, although the amount of intensive training and riding does help keep off the pounds. ""I'm lucky that I can literally eat whatever I want and I won't get any heavier than 53 kg,"" explained Lane, who started riding when he was 12. ""But some of the other guys struggle with one meal a day. Mentally, it's a big task not to be eating."" The British Racing School also helps jockeys maintain a balanced diet by offering advice from nutritionists. There is also a jockey cook book which includes calorie-counted recipes such as Mexican beans and rice, and spicy sausage hot pot. Not just about the horse . But, in the same way that motorsport drivers rely on the horsepower of their car engines, aren't jockeys mainly relying on real horsepower to win races? Perham concedes that the work level is split 90% to 10% in favor of the horse. But Lane, who has ridden more than 350 winners, believes jockeys can lose races if they are not physically fit. ""People say, 'It's the horse, you just have to sit there,' but we have proved that fitness definitely comes into it,"" he reasoned. ""It may only be 10% us but if we're only 50% fit then the jockey can only commit 5% of the work during a race. ""If we're not as fit as we can be then we're definitely affecting the horse."" As an example, he cited last weekend's Shergar Cup, a team event held at Britain's Ascot racecourse where jockeys compete for international teams. ""The English and European jockeys were so much fitter than the jockeys from the rest of the world. You could see at the finish they weren't as strong."" To show how hard it is to train like a jockey, Perham put World Sport anchor Alex Thomas through his physical tests for CNN's Winning Post show. At the British Racing School, Thomas was unseated on his first ride on the equisizer. He also found he was no match for a professional jockey like Lane. In Perham's fitness assessment, Thomas managed to last 40 seconds in the sit-up test compared to the jockey average of 240 seconds, and while the average rider could stay in the stomach-clenching plank pose for 180 seconds, the journalist managed a third of that time. ""I knew it was going to be hard but I didn't think it would be that tough,"" Thomas grimaced at the end of his grueling physical. ""Safe to say, I won't be applying for my racing license anytime soon!"" All-round fitness . Not everyone has the lean and light physique that is a prerequisite for becoming a jockey, but getting race fit can help anyone become a fitness thoroughbred. ""The tools we use are all based around gym exercises that people do,"" explained Perham. ""The simulator that I've designed is based around preparing jockeys but it's also very, very easily adaptable as a piece of gym equipment, similar to a rowing machine or a cross trainer. It's an all-round fitness tool."" While following such a training regime might not ultimately help you ride a winner in the Grand National or Breeders' Cup, Lane agrees that the principles of the program have benefits for anyone wanting to get fit. ""It's good for an all-round level of fitness,"" he added. ""Being fit makes everyday life so much easier.""","The British Racing School at Newmarket runs a fitness boot camp for jockeys .

"San Juan, Puerto Rico (CNN) -- Puerto Rican salsa legend Jose Luis ""Cheo"" Feliciano, a giant of the genre, died in a car crash early Thursday morning in San Juan, police said. He was 78. A crooner with one of the most recognizable and imitated voices in Latin music, Feliciano sang with the long-running Fania All Stars in the heyday of New York's thriving salsa scene in the 1970s. ""Cheo was one of the most important stalwarts and forces of our music,"" said Juan Moreno Velazquez, a New York-based journalist who has written biographies of salsa's biggest stars. ""He will be mourned in Puerto Rico and throughout Latin America. He connected to the people, a true stalwart of our culture for all Latinos. The passing of this icon leaves immense pain throughout Latin America."" Indeed, the governor of Puerto Rico has declared three days of mourning and, throughout the island on Thursday, many motorists drove with their headlights on in tribute. Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla said in a statement: ""Today, Puerto Rico lost one of its greatest voices."" Feliciano was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, and made a name for himself in New York as a musician and singer for a number of groups. Considered salsa royalty, Feliciano was awarded a Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2008. The fatal car wreck happened about 4:13 a.m. Thursday, Puerto Rico police said. Feliciano lost control of the Jaguar he was driving and crashed into a light pole, police said. He died at the scene. Police told CNN en Español the singer was the only person in the car. The speed he was traveling at was under investigation, police said. His wife, Coco, told reporters that Feliciano did not like to wear a seat belt. The singer's son, José Enrique Feliciano, praised his father at the scene of the accident. ""Papi is for all times, leaving his music and his heart to the people,"" he said. ""Thank God that we have his music to remember him."" The singer was diagnosed with a treatable type of cancer last year, and he had undergone cancer treatments. In a statement, U.S. Rep. Nydia Velazquez called Feliciano a Puerto Rican treasure. ""His music embodied the rhythm of Puerto Ricans living in New York City and his lyrics helped tell our collective story,"" she said. The death of Feliciano, beloved for his hits such as ""Anacaona"" and ""Amada Mia,"" was noted on the Twitter and Facebook accounts of some of Latin music's biggest stars, from Ricky Martin to Ruben Blades, who tweeted ""BROTHER CHEO. I've just learned of the accident and it is difficult for me to accept."" Singer Ricardo Montaner tweeted: ""I cannot believe that Cheo is no longer with us ...

"(CNN) -- No issue has been hotter throughout the run-up to the election than jobs -- and both candidates took pains to tackle the issue during their first debate Wednesday at the University of Denver. ""Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created,"" Democratic incumbent Barack Obama said. The facts: . In 2009, Obama's first full year in office, people in states across the country were losing their jobs at a startling clip. In Ohio, the unemployment rate was 10.6%. But over the next few years, the nation saw slow increases in employment in the retail, education and health care sectors. Today, most states are gaining jobs. The key swing state of Ohio now has a 7.2% unemployment rate. The Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that a lot of jobs have been created under Obama's leadership -- 4.4 million by the bureau's latest count. What Obama did not say, however, was that the nation shed 4.3 million jobs during the early days of his term, and that the net gain since he took the oath of office in January 2009 is just 125,000 jobs. Complete coverage of CNN's Fact Checks . Conclusion: . Many voters blame that initial weakness on the fractured economy Obama inherited from his Republican predecessor, former President George W. Bush. But in terms of sheer numbers, Obama's assertion that he created 5 million jobs does not tell the whole story and is therefore false. Also during the debate, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that 23 million people are out of work in the nation. ""There is suffering in this country,"" said Romney. ""And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. It's absolutely extraordinary. We've got 23 million people out of work."" The facts: . When the recession began, workers in every category lost jobs, but those in the middle and higher wage groups lost more of them. And when the jobs started coming back, the lower-wage jobs came back stronger. That means that, while the nation has replaced lost jobs, many of those new jobs pay less than the old ones did. To reach his 23 million figure, Romney counts everyone who is unemployed, has stopped looking for work or is underemployed -- working for less money than before or able to find only a part-time job. Conclusion: . Romney is stretching his figures to the breaking point -- which makes his claim false. What it all means: . If history is any guide, the employment figures could prove key in this race. In August, the U.S. unemployment rate was 8.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. No president has been re-elected with an unemployment rate above 8% since Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s, during the Great Depression. Fact Check: Oil and gas production .

"(CNN) -- The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is arguably the greatest mystery in the history of commercial flight, with an extensive search failing to turn up a single piece of definitive evidence of its whereabouts. On Sunday, the search vessel GO Phoenix is expected to arrive at its designated search area in the southern Indian Ocean to begin the next phase of the search. The ship, and two others which will arrive within the month, will conduct detailed sonar sweeps in an attempt to locate wreckage of the plane. Here's where we are with the search for MH370. What happened initially? Around 1:30 a.m. on March 8, air traffic controllers in Subang, outside Kuala Lumpur, lost contact with Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, a Boeing 777-200ER, over the sea between Malaysia and Vietnam. The plane's transponder, which identifies the aircraft and relays details like altitude and speed to controllers, stopped transmitting, and the passenger jet seemingly disappeared without a trace. Planes and ships from 14 countries initially searched areas of the South China Sea, south of Vietnam and the Malaysian peninsula. The search was then widened and then shifted location as it was determined that the plane diverted south. Since then resources have been focused on a swathe of the Indian Ocean, around 2000 km (1242 miles) off the west coast of Australia, the so-called ""seventh arc."" What has been done in the Indian Ocean so far? After seven weeks of intense but fruitless searching, the international air effort to find the plane ended in late April, shifting the focus to an underwater search. Hopes were raised in May as radio beacon signals -- ""pings"" -- were thought to have been detected, but the area where the pings were thought to originate from was discounted in May. Since the active search was postponed, the Australian government has been creating an accurate survey of the sea floor in the search area. One ship, from Dutch surveying company Fugro, continues to map the underwater topography. To date, over 111,000 square kilometers of the wide search area have been analyzed and mapped by the Australian government and its contractors. The existing data for the sea floor in that area is at a very low resolution, says Stuart Minchin, head of the Environmental Geoscience Division of Geoscience Australia, the agency overseeing the mapping process. Getting an accurate picture is crucial as the drones that will be conducting the underwater sonar search in the upcoming phase will need to be guided with precision to avoid damage. ""In the second phase of the search, which involves towing devices close to the sea bed to get a very fine resolution picture of what's down there it's important to have that level of detail so we don't run into objects,"" he said. ""It's a long way from shore at very significant depths so it's a logistical challenge. It's unprecedented in terms of doing a survey of this size and in this remote location."" It has been an involved, long and difficult process. ""The recently acquired (underwater survey) data has revealed many of these seabed features for the first time,"" the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), the agency leading the search, said in a statement. The survey also reveals finer features that were not visible in previous, low-resolution survey data. At the request of the Malaysian government, the Australian government -- in particular the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) -- has been tasked with leading the search. ""The complexities surrounding the search cannot be understated,"" the ATSB says. ""It involves vast areas of the Indian Ocean with only limited known data and aircraft flight information."" What happens next? The Australian government said in August that it has picked Fugro Survey, a Dutch company for the mapping and the next phase of undersea search, along with a vessel, the GO Phoenix, supplied by the Malaysian government. The latter will, weather permitting, arrive at its assigned search zone late Sunday and, will deploy towed sonar to begin the search on on Monday and will conduct search activity for 12 days before going to Fremantle, in Western Australia, for resupply. The search vessel will be joined by the two Dutch ships, the Fugro Discovery and the Fugro Equator, later in the month. The Equator is currently finishing up detailed mapping of the search zones. ""The current plan envisages that we will progressively cover our priority search areas over the course of about a year,"" Martin Dolan, Chief Commissioner and CEO of the ATSB, told CNN by phone. What we know is that the aircraft will be found close to the arc, the final attempt at communication between the aircraft systems and ground stations. We've done progressively more refined and detailed analysis of the other satellite information that has enabled us to prioritise (search areas) along that arc. ""We have a high probability that the aircraft will be found at the southern end of that long arc. We now know in considerable detail what almost all of the search area looks like, we've mapped these in detail. We can tow our sonar equipment about 100 meters (329 ft) from the ocean floor in confidence that we won't run into any unexpected obstacles."" What happens if/when the wreckage is found? Dolan says that it largely depends on where, and how, the plane is found. The Australian contingent, he says, is still discussing plans with their Malaysian colleagues on how to proceed in the event of a positive identification of plane wreckage. ""If you have a debris field identified, to be able to know what to do with it requires careful mapping and photographing, which will take up to a month,"" he says. ""Until we've got that largely completed we won't understand the sequence of what we're able to do in relation to wreckage and human remains."" What happens if they don't find it within the current search timetable? There is $60 million ($52.8 mil) earmarked by the Australian government for mapping and underwater search, and Australian expenditure is to be matched by Malaysian government. It is a significant resource upon which to draw, Dolan says. However, ""if at the end of that we haven't found the aircraft, then it's really going to be a matter for governments to decide what's next what resources they might wish to supply and I can't really preempt what that discussion might be.""","Next phase of search operations set to begin, with underwater sonar drogues to be deployed .

"(CNN) -- Iconic Pop artist Andy Warhol is often quoted for his statement, ""In the future, everybody will be world-famous for 15 minutes."" Twenty-five years after his death, his influence on contemporary art has well surpassed the 15-minute mark. Campbell Soup Company is the latest entity to honor his legacy. This week, 1.2 million limited-edition cans of condensed tomato soup with labels inspired by his Pop art go on sale. The specially designed Campbell's soup cans pay tribute to his lively color palette, using orange, blue, pink and teal to spruce up the familiar design. The labels commemorate the 50th anniversary of Warhol's famed art piece ""32 Campbell's Soup Cans."" Some of Warhol's famous quotes are printed on the Campbell's cans, too, including ""Pop art is for everyone."" This quote is significant as his wide-ranging body of work helped ""blur the boundaries between high and low culture,"" said Michael Hermann, director of licensing at The Andy Warhol Foundation. Warhol appealed to a massive audience from all walks of life, he said. Warhol's humble roots stem from a working-class neighborhood in Pittsburgh, where he was born in 1928. As an adult, he moved to New York City, where he set up a studio and built his fame and fortune. His enormous body of work included multiple mediums and featured subjects ranging from celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe to simple, everyday items such as a banana. ""I believe Warhol's popularity is certainly due in part to his uncanny ability to present the familiar from unexpected perspectives through visually and conceptually impactful works of art. However, it seems his influence today comes as much from his biography as someone who embodied the American dream and celebrated creativity and individuality,"" said Hermann. When once asked why he painted the soup cans, Warhol noted, ""I used to have the same (Campbell's soup) lunch every day for 20 years."" He was also known to say, ""I was looking for something that was the essence of nothing, and that was it."" His unique style of artistic expression and world view is credited for launching his career and the Pop art movement. Art collectors have paid millions of dollars for some of Warhol's pieces, but shoppers at Target, where the limited-edition soup cans are on sale, will have to shell out only 75 cents for a 10.75-ounce can. ""What continues to amaze me is that 25 years after his death, Warhol continues to have a profound influence on our culture,"" said Hermann. ""For me, this is a true testament to his genius, and I can only imagine that Andy would have loved shopping at Target for this soup."" Campbell Soup Company never commissioned Warhol to paint the original soup cans. Former president and CEO of the company, William Beverly Murphy, initially had reservations about Warhol's work 50 years ago, and Campbell took a ""wait and see approach"" before fully supporting him. Now, the company takes great pride in its association with the iconic artist. ""Thanks to Andy Warhol's inspired paintings, Campbell's soup will always be linked to the Pop art movement,"" Ed Carolan, vice president and general manager, of Campbell North America stated in a news release to CNN. ""It is only fitting that 50 years later, we celebrate the enduring legacy of these two American icons by coming full circle and bringing his art back to the Campbell's soup cans that provided him with inspiration,"" noted Hermann. The Campbell's soup labels were produced under license from The Andy Warhol Foundation, a not-for-profit corporation that promotes the visual arts. Some revenue generated from the project will fund the foundation's endowment, from which it distributes grants that support the ""creation, presentation and documentation of contemporary visual art,"" according to Hermann. In addition to the soup cans, Campbell has partnered with The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York as a sponsor of the educational programs associated with an exhibit paying tribute to Warhol. The show, ""Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years,"" opens September 18. Warhol's piece ""Big Campbell's Soup Can, 19¢"" is included in the exhibition, along with some of his other famous works. What are your favorite Andy Warhol images?

"(CNN) -- Palm weevils. To look at, these tiny bugs are relatively unassuming, perhaps even slightly creepy to the insect-adverse. To Mohammed Ashour, however, they are the solution to many of the ills facing the developing world. The humble palm weevil could potentially eradicate world hunger and malnutrition, it could lift whole communities out of poverty, and bring down global C02 levels. For a creature measuring just a few inches in length, that's a lot of power. ""If anything, our business model is too disruptive,"" says Ashour, who launched Aspire with four fellow MBA students from McGill University. Their aim is to introduce insect farming to countries with an affinity for insect consumption and a lack of access to nutritional sustenance. Their idea won them the 2013 Hult Prize, which provides $1m seed money for the most game-changing social enterprise, as well backing from the Canadian government-funded Grand Challenges. With their winnings, Aspire set up a pilot program in Ghana, where food insecurity remains an issue in various parts of the country. Currently, 75% of pre-school-aged children and two-thirds of pregnant women in Ghana suffer from anemia, according to the World Health Organization. ""In the rural community, the food is mainly made up of carbohydrates. Because of the fact that you're not getting the protein you need -- there isn't much fish or beef in the diet -- I think what they eat is lacking in nutrition,"" says Dr. Clement Akotsen-Mensah, an entomologist and research fellow at the Forest and Horticultural Crops Research Center at the University of Ghana. ""The palm weevil can be a good supplement,"" he adds. In 2013, the UN Food and Agricultural Organization released a report advocating insect consumption worldwide. The report found that pound-for-pound, palm weevils -- like other insects -- have similar levels of protein as beef, but beats out the bovine in levels of iron, potassium, zinc, phosphorous and several amino acids. While the government supplies pregnant women with iron pills and vitamins, Ashour says locals aren't always too amenable to taking them. ""In areas where iron deficiencies seems to be the greatest, there is also a lack of education, or sometimes a lack of trust in government. If you go to a small village outside of Accra, good luck instructing a woman to take a package of pills and expect an order of compliance,"" he notes. ""We're introducing iron and protein in a way that is much more culturally acceptable."" Moreover, some Ghanians, particularly those living in the north and east, already make palm weevils a part of their diet. ""You won't see it everywhere in Ghana, but in places where it is consumed, it is consumed with quite a high affinity,"" says Ashour. While he notes that Ghana has ""a strong demand,"" he says what it lacks is supply, as currently the bugs are harvested by hand. By introducing farming, Aspire is not only increasing access to a cheaper and more nutritional source of protein, it says it is introducing new revenue streams for Ghanians living in poverty. ""The process of farming itself isn't overly complicated. Someone who is uneducated but industrious can do it and get it up and running in a short amount of time,"" says Ashour. Aspire has decided to target farmers living in rural and peri-urban communities, where, Ashour notes, there is an abundance of land, but a dearth of opportunities. Aspire would provide farmers with the kits and training free of charge, then buy back the weevils to distribute en masse throughout the country. Aspire is also looking into creating products from the weevils, such as a high-protein flour that could be added to any dish to make it more nutritious. ""I think it has a lot of potential,"" says Akotsen-Mensah. ""Previously, the wood from the palm trees wasn't really used for anything. People would make wine from it maybe, then leave it. Now they can use it to raise the weevil, and get some small income. It could have a great economic impact,"" he adds. Aspire has other insect-farming projects it's either launched or is looking into. The group has also set up a pilot grasshopper-farming program in Mexico, and is looking into introducing cricket farming in Kenya. The choice of insect is determined by local tastes. It is also looking at introducing entomophagy -- or the practice of bug-eating -- into the United States. While the project in Ghana is fairly new (Aspire launched the program less than three months ago), Ashour has high hopes for it, ultimately envisioning his weevil products to reach 30% of the market in Ghana. ""You're asking an optimist,"" he concedes. ""I really see us having great impact. By next year's end, it would be possible to reach anywhere from 500,000 to one million people.""","Two billion people eat insects in 162 countries around the world .

"Tunis (CNN) -- When artist Nadia Jelassi exhibited work in Tunis last year, she hoped the piece would prove a talking point. But when ultra-conservative Salafist Muslims took an interest in her installation at a spring arts festival in Tunisia's capital, the reaction was much stronger than she bargained for. Deeming a number of artworks in the exhibition heretical, Islamist extremists vandalized the gallery, issued death threats to Jelassi and fellow exhibitors, and rioted in the streets in some of the most serious unrest since the 2011 revolution. Along with fellow artist Mohamed Ben Slama, she now faces charges of harming public order and morals through her work -- charges that could see them sentenced to up to five years in prison if convicted. ""I never imagined this could happen, not even in my worst nightmares,"" said Jelassi. The clash highlights growing tensions between liberal and religious forces over the limits on free speech, as they jostle to define the identity of the new Tunisia following the ouster of dictator Zine el Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. One of the pieces that triggered the protests was Jelassi's installation ""Celui qui n'a pas ... (Anyone who has not ... ),"" which featured mannequins of traditionally veiled women, positioned amongst a pile of stones, with text written on both the female figures and the stones. The work, Jelassi told CNN, was about ""trying to show two different ways to practice Islam -- one spiritual, and one closed."" But some of the protestors, alerted to the exhibition by postings on social media, interpreted the artwork as implying traditionally dressed women should be stoned. Ben Slama's artwork, which was also singled out by the protesters as indecent, depicted a line of ants emerging from a child's schoolbag to spell the word ""Allah."" Read more: Inside Tunisia's former dictator's palace -- fake diplomas, sports cars, and a stuffed leopard . After festival organizers refused a request from the aggrieved Salafists to remove the offending works from view, thousands of hardliners took to the streets, leaving the walls of the gallery scrawled with graffiti reading: ""Non-believers have no place in Tunisia"" and ""You are enemies of God."" This is not the only flashpoint Tunisia has seen. In late 2011, religious conservatives also protested against a Tunis television station and attacked a theater for playing films deemed un-Islamic, while there have also been reports of conservatives attempting to enforce Islamic dress codes. The group behind the protests are the Salafists -- ultra-conservative Sunni Muslims who are becoming an increasingly strident political force across the Arab world in the wake of the Arab Spring. Having suffered repression under the rule of Ben Ali, they now seek a greater voice in the new Tunisia, pushing to impose a stricter vision of Islam than that championed by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party which runs the interim government. One Salafi cleric, Sheikh Adel Elmi, told CNN he believed art should promote religious virtue, and he had opposed the exhibition because it contained nudity. ""We are against violence, and for dialogue,"" he said. ""But we act in response to provocation, and I consider nudity to be violent."" Read more: Arab women take a stand on sexual violence . But other Tunisians, particularly those of a secular, liberal persuasion, hold a different view of their country's future. While Islam has always been the main religion in Tunisia, politics have long been secular. Mounir Letaief, a 52-year-old painter from Tunis, says the views of those who value freedom of expression, artistic or otherwise, must also be taken into account as the country attempts to rebuild itself. ""I respect them,"" Letaief said of the Salafists. ""But they have to respect me and the other people who think different."" Tunisia's interim government says it is against censoring art -- but that a red line exists when it comes to blasphemy. A proposal has been tabled to criminalize blasphemy in Tunisia's new constitution, due later this year. ""Even in the most modern societies, there are limits -- whether it's security or religious,"" Culture Minister Mehdi Mabrouk told CNN. ""In order to protect freedoms, we need to set these limits."" Meanwhile, Jelassi is waiting to see what will become of the charges against her, with international groups such as Human Rights Watch calling on Tunisian authorities to drop them. The charges were being used to stifle the freedom of expression of ""artists, journalists, and other citizens who voice criticism of religion,"" Amna Guellali, a Tunis-based researcher at Human Rights Watch, told CNN. But Jelassi said she would continue to resist any attempt to impose a new culture of censorship in Tunisia. ""Freedom of expression is not something we invented, its limits are well known,"" she said. ""But the sacred is something personal, and no one should intervene in that.""","Art has become a target for hardline Islamists in Tunisia after the revolution .

"(CNN) -- An American couple hopes to return to the United States next week to be reunited with their family after a two-year legal nightmare has trapped them in Qatar, charged with wrongdoing in the death of their adopted daughter. On Monday Matthew and Grace Huang will appeal their conviction, which has garnered international attention and raised questions in the media about the prosecution and overall fairness of the Qatari justice system. ""It has been a very confusing and almost incomprehensible process to us,"" Grace Huang said in a phone interview from Qatar. ""We are tired. We just want to go home."" When their 8-year-old daughter Gloria died in January 2013, the couple was immediately arrested on charges they starved her to death. ""It was a shock,"" Grace said. ""She is our daughter."" The Huangs, who maintained their daughter suffered from an eating disorder, have denied wrongdoing in connection with her death and are fighting the conviction. Matthew Huang was employed in Doha by an international company working on construction projects for the 2022 World Cup. After a lengthy trial, the Huangs were convicted of endangering the life of their child. They were sentenced in April to three years in prison. The State Department has expressed concern about the fairness of the legal proceedings in the case and disappointment in the verdict. A YouTube video made about the case by advocates for the Huangs portrays a happy multiracial family, provides insights into Gloria's death and raises questions about the prosecution. In the video, Justin Brooks, director of the California Innocence Project, one of the advocacy groups assisting with the Huangs' defense, says ""the case completely lacks any type of due process."" He calls the Qatari prosecution's case ""outrageous."" The United States has suggested that cultural misunderstandings were at the heart of the charges, that evidence provided by the defense was not carefully considered and due process for the Huangs has not been provided. A report by pathologists hired by the defense, obtained by CNN, states they found no evidence tissue samples were taken from Gloria's body after her death, despite the fact Qatari investigators submitted an autopsy report. Advocates for the Huangs suggested the lab report was fabricated and said their request with the Qatari judiciary for a formal investigation has gone unanswered. ""There is no credible evidence,"" said Eric Volz, who heads the firm David House Agency that is also assisting with the Huangs' case. ""In an objective court the judge should have thrown out the case."" Several U.S. officials have privately expressed confidence in the Huangs' innocence, calling the case a ""sham."" But the Obama administration has sought to exhaust all legal proceedings before seeking the Qatari government's direct intervention in the case. A United Nations special rapporteur investigating the justice system in Qatar has also called attention to the Huangs' case and urged the government to release them and send them home. After spending nearly a year in prison, the couple was released last November. They are prohibited from leaving Qatar during their appeal. The case suggested racial overtones when questions were raised by the prosecutor and police about why the Huangs, who are Asian, adopted children from Africa. The Qatari prosecutor has sought to paint Grace and Matthew Huang as inhumane, alleging they bought their adopted daughter cheaply from her poverty-stricken parents in Africa and has since threatened to seek human trafficking charges. The couple's two sons, also adopted from Africa, were temporarily placed in a Qatari orphanage after the couple's arrest, but have since been sent back to the United States to live with Grace Huang's mother. The entire family has chipped in during the prolonged separation. With Matthew Huang fired from his job, the couple is living on donations from family and friends. Grace Huang's brother, Daniel Chin, has given up his job in California to work on the case full time. He is the nerve center of the family, raising money for the family's expenses and defense costs and dealing with the Huangs' lawyers and advocates. Chin has met with lawmakers and administration officials in Washington, urging them to make the Huangs' case a greater priority. He has weekly Skype chats with his sister and has traveled several times to Doha for their judicial proceedings, which the Qatari court continues to postpone. ""Often it's hard to keep working on something when it feels we are just a small family trying to fight against"" a country, he said in a phone interview, before leaving Friday for Qatar for the Huangs' appellate hearing. The case puts the United States in a difficult situation with a close ally with whom it is working on hot-button issues in the Middle East. Qatar is a key ally in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS and host to many countries' forces involved in airstrikes. The Qatari government also helped the United States secure the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity this year. ""Qatar is a key ally for the U.S. government,"" Volz says. ""The day the Huangs were wrongly convicted the U.S. announced an $11 billion arms deal with the Qataris. And when Bowe Bergdahl was released, President Obama publicly thanked the government. That all sends a message not only to Qatar but to other countries that there is no cost to Americans being wrongly imprisoned in their country."" Volz noted the United States has upped the pressure on the Qatari government in recent months to resolve the case quickly and release the Huangs. Last week the State Department issued a statement urging the Qatari government to ""immediately"" lift the Huangs' travel ban, bring the case to an ""expeditious and just conclusion"" and allow the couple to return to the United States. ""We are really hopeful that as a result of the State Department making this public demand that the Qataris lift the travel ban, that there is a good chance that Matt and Grace can come home,"" Volz says. Her parents and other family members describe Gloria as a happy child, who loved butterflies, flowers and the color pink. ""She loved to talk, to dance and she loved music,"" Grace Huang said. ""She loved hearing stories."" But consumed with their nightmare in isolation, the Huangs and their family have not had a chance to grieve for their daughter. ""Everything has revolved around her case and our situation,"" Grace Huang said. ""We haven't had a chance to really say goodbye and mourn. We just really want to be able to honor her place in our lives with our friends and family and that hasn't happened yet."" ""Nobody in the family has had time to grieve about Gloria and her death and the fact she passed away,"" Chin said. ""Especially Matt and Grace. To see my nephews without their parents, who have not been able to hold them for the past year. It's heartbreaking."" The couple is fearful to go out in public, spending most of their time in their Doha apartment. With a 10-hour time difference, they spend every hour they and their two sons, 8 and 12, are all awake on Skype, talking and going over homework. The technology has been a godsend, but virtual parenting isn't easy. The kids have stored away last year's Christmas gifts until the family can celebrate together. ""We are trying to be as involved as we can be, but we are really tired of trying to do it over the Internet,"" Grace Huang said. ""We have missed birthdays, anniversaries and so many special events. We are longing to be home with our family again."" ""We are encouraged that they are urging the Qatari government to lift our travel ban and are hopeful everyone here would respond to that request and allow us to travel home to be reunited with our family. But of course, we are not home."" she said.","Matthew and Grace Huang were living in Qatar when their daughter died .

"(CNN) -- Robbie Parker has a message for the family of the gunman who killed his 6-year-old daughter and 19 of her school mates. ""I can't imagine how hard this experience must be for you, and I want you to know that our family and our love and our support goes out to you as well,"" Parker said, as he remembered his oldest girl, Emilie Alice. Emilie died Friday at the hands of a gunman who opened fire at her elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, in the second deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. The attack killed 20 children, between the ages of 6 and 7, and six faculty members at Sandy Hook Elementary School, before the suspect apparently committed suicide. Earlier, the man allegedly killed his mother, bringing to 27 the number of lives he took. Fighting back tears with his voice cracking, Parker asked Saturday night that the tragedy ""not turn into something that defines us, but something that inspires us to be better, to be more compassionate and more humble people."" Remembering the victims . Parker's comments came amid a public mourning in this southern New England town of 27,000, where residents have been trying to make sense of the shooting. Many of the victims' parents asked for privacy as they grieve. But Parker, 30, stepped forward to talk about Emilie. He moved his family from Utah to Connecticut eight months ago after accepting a job as a physician's assistant in the newborn unit at Danbury Hospital. That's where he was when he got word of the shooting -- in a telephone call from his wife. Parker, though, was unable to leave the hospital, which went into lockdown as a precaution over the school shooting. ""It went from ... 'I can't imagine this is happening. This has to be some sort of a mistake,'"" Parker said. ""I didn't think it was that big of a deal at first. I thought with the first reports that were coming in it didn't sound like it was going to be as tragic as it was."" When the lockdown was lifted, Parker raced to a firehouse near the school where parents were gathering to wait for news of their children. How you can help . There, a photographer captured a photo of an agonized Parker and his sobbing wife, Alissa, as they left the firehouse, presumably after discovering their daughter was among the casualties. On Saturday, Parker vacillated between present and past tense as he talked about his daughter, struggling to come to terms with Emilie's killing. ""My daugher Emilie would be one of the first ones to be standing up and giving her love and support to all of those victims, because that is the type of person she is,"" he said. She was ""an exceptional artist and she always carried around her markers and pencils so she never missed an opportunity to draw a picture or make a card for someone."" He recounted how his daughter slipped one of her cards in the casket at the funeral of her grandfather, who died in October in an accident. She was the oldest of three girls, and helped one sister learn to read and helped the youngest to do crafts. ""She was their best friend,"" he said. Emilie's ""laughter was infectious,"" he said. ""This world is a better place because she has been in it."" The outpouring of grief from people around the world has overwhelmed the family. Thousands who never met the girl are mourning her on Facebook after friends of the Parker family established the Emilie Parker Fund page. What started out as an effort to help the family raise money to take Emilie's body back to Utah for burial has become an online spot for thousands to mourn. Share your tributes . On the Facebook page, the 6-year-old smiles back with a wide smile and twinkling blue eyes. ""Dear Parker family, thank you for the love and forgiveness you have shown. Our hearts were all broken yesterday as we learned of this tragedy,"" wrote one person. Many posting on the page offered prayers of support and condolences to the family. Parker told reporters on Saturday that he and his wife were still trying to come to terms with the enormity of the loss. ""I don't know how to get through something like this, how to process something like this and get our lives going,"" he said. On Emilie's last day, she and her father spoke Portuguese, a language he was teaching her. ""She told me good morning. She asked me how I was doing. I told her I was doing well,"" he said. ""I gave her a kiss and told her I loved her, and I was out the door."" He left for work. And then she for school.

"(CNN) -- Dear park visitors, . Please don't take selfies with bears. It's stupid. Love, the U.S Forest Service . That pretty much sums up a warning issued recently by wildlife officials at Taylor Creek Visitor Center in South Lake Tahoe, California.

""We can't have visitors creating dangerous situations for themselves and others. People are risking serious injury or death if they get too close to a bear."" And if you don't care about your own health, at least consider the bears. If one attacked, officials would have to capture and kill it. Black bears tend to swarm Taylor Creek this time of year thanks to an annual run of kokanee salmon, according to Mother Nature Network. And Taylor Creek staff say they are ""routinely"" seeing people getting friendly with the animals in an effort to update their Instagram feed.

"(CNN) -- As the number of seasonal influenza cases continues to rise, reports of vaccine shortages in some locations are beginning to circulate. But vaccine manufacturers say there is plenty of vaccine for those who want to get a flu shot. MedImmune, manufacturer of FluMist, the only flu vaccine that comes in a nasal spray, produced 12 million doses for the current season to fill customer orders. In addition to those orders, they produced extra doses. FluMist is approved for healthy people between the age of 2 and 49. ""Right now we currently have 310,000 extra doses that could ship tomorrow,"" Tor Constantino, MedImmune spokesperson, told CNN. ""All of those expire next month. Another 70,000 doses are available that could ship tomorrow, and those expire in March. The company has another 250,000 doses they're holding in reserve that would be shared between Medicaid's Vaccines for Children Program (VCP) and the Department of Defense (DOD). In total, they have a surplus of 620,000 extra doses. Sanofi Pasteur made more than 60 million doses of Fluzone for the United States alone. According to Michael Szumera, SP's director of public relations, they've sold out of some versions of Fluzone, but the company has adult flu vaccine ready for immediate shipment. Fluzone is a relatively new type of flu shot with a very short needle, making it less intimidating than a traditional flu shot. ""This product is available in two presentations: Fluzone intradermal vaccine for ages 18 to 64 and Fluzone High-Dose vaccine for ages 65 and above,"" Szumera said. ""Additionally, in response to unanticipated late-season demand, we have arranged for a limited supply of additional vaccine in 0.5-milliliter unit dose vials. This product is indicated for ages 6 months and above. We are accepting orders for this product and anticipate being able to start shipping in late January."" Glaxo Smith Kline, makers of Fluarix and FluLaval, said they, too, have adequate supply to meet customer demand. The pharmaceutical company has produced about 25 million doses of vaccine, most of which have been shipped. ""We have completed production of this year's vaccine, and are confident supply of seasonal flu vaccine should cover demand,"" Dr. Leonard Friedland, who heads up medical affairs and clinical development for GSK Vaccines North America. ""The greater issue is that less than 50 percent of the U.S. population gets vaccinated each year."" Flu leads to Texas teen's death . Novartis committed to 30 million doses of their vaccine Fluvirin and shipped more than 36 million. Spokeswoman Julie Masow says they are working to address any urgent needs. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, flu vaccine makers produced about 135 million doses this year. As of early this month 128 million doses had already been distributed. CDC spokesman Tom Skinner told CNN he was not aware of widespread problems with finding vaccines. ""There may be spot shortages out there, and people wanting to be vaccinated should call ahead to the provider to see if they have vaccine,"" Skinner said. There have also been reported shortages of the antiviral Tamiflu Oral Suspension (Tamiflu OS), the liquid version of Tamiflu. When taken early, this drug can reduce the severity of symptoms and the length of illness. It is recommended mostly for people at higher risk of flu complications. There were temporary delays in new shipments of Tamiflu OSral Suspension, driven in part by an early and strong flu season, Tara Iannuccillo, spokeswoman for Genentech, said in an e-mail. ""We experienced an increase in demand due to a higher prevalence of influenza Type B early in the season,"" Iannuccillo said. Tamiflu OS is typically prescribed for children under the age if 13 and people who have trouble swallowing. But pharmacists can mix Tamiflu capsules into liquid for those patients who require it. 5 ways to protect your child .

"Milford, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Whew. After 48 days of living with helicopters, heavily armed police officers, the rumors and constant questions -- where is he? -- the people of northeast Pennsylvania can finally relax. The manhunt for Eric Matthew Frein, accused of killing a Pennsylvania state trooper, is over. Heavily armed U.S. marshals captured Frein on Thursday night and turned him over to state police, who slapped the slain officer's cuffs on him, put him in the back of the trooper's squad car and sent him back to the barracks where the ambush occurred. ""We just thought it was fitting,"" State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said. Frein, 31, is charged with first-degree murder and other charges in a September 12 ambush outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove. He's accused of killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and wounding Trooper Alex T. Douglass before melting into the thick Pennsylvania woods. Authorities had worried the survivalist and military buff with a reported history of cop hatred might go out in a violent standoff. In the end, he gave up without a fight. His capture ended a lengthy search that burned through some $10 million, according to the county prosecutor, and likely as many nerves. ""It actually felt like I was in a war zone a couple of weeks ago, and it was hard to sleep for a few nights, worrying about where he is,"" resident Mark Denny told CNN affiliate WNEP-TV. The capture . The squad of 13 U.S. marshals -- armed like a military special operations squad -- found Frein at an abandoned airport near Tannersville, authorities said. Frein hadn't been spotted. He was discovered as part of a ""routine sweep through the woods,"" State Police Lt. Col. George Bivens told reporters. And he wasn't armed at the time of his capture, according to police, much to the relief of authorities who feared a violent showdown. When marshals surprised him in a field near the airport, he obeyed their orders to get down on his hands and knees and told them who he was, Noonan said. There was no struggle, Pike County District Attorney Raymond Tonkin said. Investigators searching the area did find a cache that included a sniper rifle, Noonan said. The rifle appears to be consistent with casings gathered during the investigation, he said. Frein was in good physical condition when he was captured, apart from a cut on his nose that he had before the marshals found him, according to Noonan. He looked ""healthier than I would have expected,"" Noonan said. ""He's been stashing food, he's been staying out in the woods,"" Noonan said. ""He had a lot of locations he knew how to hide in. And also, he had been preparing himself by participating in these re-enactments, especially in the Vietnam era, where he specifically trained himself and trained with other people to hide in the woods and avoid detection."" Officials said they were unsure how long he had been hiding at the airport. Opinion: Were cops out of line in trooper-killing arrest? Court appearance . During his court appearance Friday Frein looked thin, with the cut on his nose and abrasions on his forehead. His left cheek was swollen. His voice was strong as he answered, ""Yes I do,"" to a Pike County judge's question if he understood the charges against him, which include first-degree murder and criminal homicide of a law enforcement officer. About 30 police were in the room for the 10-minute hearing. Tonkin, the district attorney, said he plans to seek the death penalty. Frein is being held in the Pike County Correctional Institute in Lords Valley. In an interview with CNN on Friday, Gov. Tom Corbett said he expects authorities to make sure Frein stays safe. ""I'm sure they will have all precautions taken, not only for his well-being from other inmates but from himself, too,"" Corbett said. Motive unclear . Tonkin declined to say what, if anything, Frein has revealed about the attack that left Dickson dead and Douglass critically wounded. Douglass has since been released and is continuing to recover, according to police. After his arrest, Frein made statements implicating himself in the shootings, according to a law enforcement official who was briefed on the capture. Authorities also found his diary, but contents of that document haven't been revealed. Authorities have not discussed a motive but have said Frein has talked and written about hating law enforcement. ""I've characterized his actions in the past as pure evil, and I would stand by that,"" Tonkin said Friday. A review of his computer hard drive shows he had planned an attack for years, authorities said. According to the criminal complaint against him, Frein searched the Internet going back to 2012 for information related on placing supply caches, police manhunt techniques and how to evade them and other topics. ""Eric Frein had a mission that was to attack law enforcement,"" Noonan said. ""If he got out of those woods, we were very concerned that he would then kill other law enforcement. And if not them, civilians. That's why we had to keep the pressure on."" There was no indication that anyone was helping Frein, who was ""quite well-prepared,"" Noonan said. 'A celebration' Frein's arrest punctured the thick tension that had blanketed the region for weeks. ""It's been a long seven weeks,"" Corbett said on CNN's ""New Day."" During the search, some outdoor activities were curtailed and some schoolchildren didn't go out for recess. ""It's just exciting and we're happy. We didn't go out of school for weeks for recess,"" resident Shannon Juirad told WNEP. And then there was the question of Halloween. At least one community, Barrett Township, canceled trick-or-treating as the search dragged on, instead suggesting children show up at a school parking lot to collect candy under the supervision of local and state police. But with Frein in custody, the trick-or-treating will go on as normal, said Barrett Township Board Chairman Ralph Megliola. ""I'm ecstatic -- and just in time for Halloween!"" Megliola said. Pennsylvania Game Commission Executive Director R. Matthew Hough lifted the temporary prohibition on hunting and trapping activity in all areas that had been affected by the manhunt. Outside the police barracks, residents held a sign reading, ""Way to Go PSP."" Passing motorists slowed, also offering words of encouragement for the Pennsylvania State Police. ""We all have children and we were afraid to go outside, we were afraid to do anything,"" one woman told CNN affiliate WBRE-TV. ""I can't even explain what I'm feeling right now, this is awesome. We are so proud of our Pennsylvania State Police, their hard work,"" another said. ""Now it's a celebration,"" one woman wearing a ""Barrett Proud"" shirt told WNEP. CNN's Miguel Marquez reported from Milford, Pennsylvania, and CNN's Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- The first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on American soil went to the emergency room last week, but was released from the hospital even though he told staff he had traveled from Liberia. ""A travel history was taken, but it wasn't communicated to the people who were making the decision. ... It was a mistake. They dropped the ball,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""You don't want to pile on them, but hopefully this will never happen again. ... The CDC has been vigorously emphasizing the need for a travel history,"" Fauci told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" Hospital officials have acknowledged that the patient's travel history wasn't ""fully communicated"" to doctors, but also said in a statement Wednesday that based on his symptoms, there was no reason to admit him when he first came to the emergency room last Thursday night. ""At that time, the patient presented with low-grade fever and abdominal pain. His condition did not warrant admission. He also was not exhibiting symptoms specific to Ebola,"" Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas said. The patient, identified by his half-brother as Thomas Eric Duncan, told hospital staff that he was from Liberia, a friend who knows him well said. A nurse asked the patient about his recent travels while he was in the emergency room, and the patient said he had been in Africa, said Dr. Mark Lester, executive vice president of Texas Health Resources. But that information was not ""fully communicated"" to the medical team, Lester said. The man underwent basic blood tests, but not an Ebola screening, and was sent home with antibiotics, said Dr. Edward Goodman with Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital. Three days later, the man returned to the facility, where it was determined that he probably had Ebola. He was then isolated. ""The hospital followed all suggested CDC protocols at that time. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas' staff is thoroughly trained in infection control procedures and protocols,"" the hospital said Wednesday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has helped lead the international response to Ebola, advises that all medical facilities should ask patients with symptoms consistent with Ebola for their travel history. Duncan's travel history ""was not acted upon in an appropriate way,"" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. ""A nurse did ask the question and he did respond that he was in Liberia and that wasn't transmitted to people who were in charge of his care,"" Gupta said. ""There's no excuse for this."" A U.S. official told CNN senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen that the situation was clearly ""a screw-up."" A patient who shows up to a hospital with a fever and a history of travel to Liberia should be treated as an infection risk, the official said. Asked repeatedly by Gupta whether the patient should have been tested for Ebola during his first visit to the hospital, CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden said officials were still looking at details about how the case was handled. ""We know that in busy emergency departments all over the country, people may not ask travel histories. I don't know if that was done here,"" Frieden said. ""But we need to make sure that it is done going forward."" Friend: I called the CDC with concerns . Duncan is a 42-year-old Liberian national, according to his friend. This is Duncan's first trip to the United States, where he was visiting family and friends. The close associate, who does not want to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case, contacted the CDC with concerns that the hospital wasn't moving quickly enough after Duncan's second hospital visit. The associate said Duncan is ""all right"" now, but is in pain and hasn't eaten in a week. The patient is now under intensive care and isolated, Frieden said. He is in serious condition, the hospital told CNN. Neither the hospital nor government officials have identified Duncan by name. Obama administration recirculates guidelines . It's unknown whether others were infected after Duncan's first visit to the hospital. People who have Ebola are contagious -- but only through contact with infected bodily fluids -- when they display active symptoms of the virus, such as a high fever, severe headache, diarrhea and vomiting, among others. It's not like a cold or the flu, which can be spread before symptoms show up, and it doesn't spread through the air. Liberia is one of the hotspots in a large outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, with 3,458 cases and 1,830 deaths as of September 23, according to the World Health Organization. Other countries affected include Guinea, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. In total, more than 3,000 people have died in those countries from Ebola, and more than 6,500 have contracted the disease. This summer, two American missionaries who were working in Liberia contracted the virus and were brought back to the United States, where they were treated with the experimental drug ZMapp. Another American doctor working with the same charity was also infected in Liberia and brought home for treatment. They all have since recovered from the virus and were released from care. The CDC has ramped up a national effort to stem the spread of Ebola, and in September President Barack Obama spoke at CDC headquarters in Atlanta. He called the virus a global health and security threat, and pledged U.S. assistance to the affected countries to try to stem the tide of the disease. After the Dallas diagnosis, the Obama administration is recirculating its guidance about how to respond to the virus, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. ""In light of this incident,"" Earnest said, ""the administration has taken the step of recirculating our guidance to law enforcement agencies that are responsible for securing the border, to those agencies that represent individuals who staff the airline industry and to medical professionals all across the country, to make sure people are aware there is an important protocol that should be implemented if an individual presents with symptoms that are consistent with Ebola."" Finding the people the man came in contact with . The patient came into contact with up to 20 individuals, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings told CNN. A CDC team is in Dallas helping to find anyone he may have come in contact with, Frieden said. Once those people are identified, they will be monitored for 21 days -- taking their temperatures twice a day -- in cooperation with local and state health officials, Frieden said. Some school-age children have been in contact with the Ebola patient, but the students haven't exhibited symptoms of the deadly virus, authorities said. Five students at four different schools came into contact with the man, Dallas Superintendent Mike Miles said. The children are being monitored at home, and the schools they attended remain open, he said. Paramedics who transported the patient to the hospital have been isolated, Rawlings' chief of staff said. They have not shown symptoms of the disease so far, Frieden said. The ambulance used to carry the patient was still in use for two days after the transport, city of Dallas spokeswoman Sana Syed said. But she emphasized that the paramedics decontaminated the ambulance, as they do after every transport, according to national standards. Learn how Ebola spreads . Ebola: 9 things to know about the killer disease . Air travel testing . The Ebola patient told authorities he flew part of his trip on United Airlines, a spokesperson for the airline said, citing information from the CDC. The airline believes the patient flew from Brussels to Washington Dulles and then from Dulles to Dallas-Fort Worth on September 20, the spokesperson said. ""The director of the CDC has stated there is 'zero risk of transmission' on any flight on which the patient flew because he was not symptomatic until several days after his trip and could not have been contagious on the dates he traveled,"" the spokesperson said. Every person who travels by air is screened before departure and at arrival in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, but because the man says he began feeling ill days after landing in the United States, a screening test in West Africa would likely have not turned up that he had Ebola. However, it's unclear what kind of screening someone flying from West Africa might receive when they land in the United States, Cohen said. The CNN correspondent and her crew recently reported in and flew from West Africa, where she said they were screened numerous times for Ebola by having their temperatures taken at the airport. Should we worry? But when they arrived back in the United States, and asked travel officials about whether their temperatures would be taken or whether they'd be screened for Ebola, they were given unclear explanations about how the process worked and ultimately were not tested. Regardless, the CDC maintains that passengers on planes with the Texas patient were likely not at risk because the man was not displaying active symptoms. How the virus spreads .

"(CNN) -- It's a bad idea to deface national parks. It's even dumber to tag your vandalism across four states and have the images go viral among vexed nature enthusiasts. But authorities have identified the woman they believe is behind graffiti at eight national parks -- 21-year-old Casey Nocket of New York state. The National Park Service did not detail how Nocket was identified or whether she had been arrested. ""Investigators continue to collect evidence of the crimes, conduct interviews and are consulting with the U.S. Attorney's Office about potential charges,"" the NPS said in a statement. ""We ask the public to exercise patience and allow due process to take its course as the investigation moves forward."" Nocket is suspected of painting images on rocks and boulders in Yosemite National Park, Death Valley National Park and Joshua Tree National Park, all in California; Rocky Mountain National Park and Colorado National Monument, both in Colorado; Crater Lake National Park in Oregon; and Zion National Park and Canyonlands National Park, both in Utah. In recent weeks, photos have surfaced in online hiking forums of what appears to be a woman painting graffiti in scenic locales. The drawings includes colorful images of faces in profile and is signed with the phrase ""Creepytings 2014."" A California hiking website, Calipidder, first reported seeing social media posts about paintings on national park land. That led Modern Hiker to post several pictures of paintings that it said are by the roaming vandal. Images of the graffiti were apparently posted on Instagram. A National Park Service representative posted on Reddit, looking for more photographic examples of the graffiti. And Redditors rallied to help. Don't make these stupid travel mistakes . Naturalists and hiking enthusiasts are taking to the web to decry the defacement of National Park land. Someone has even launched a WhiteHouse.gov petition encouraging officials to throw the book at the alleged vandal for violations of federal law.

"(CNN) -- Once a haven for painters seduced by its rich colors, Marrakech is back on track to become a world-leading destination for photographers thanks to the arrival of a major new museum. Despite the reluctance of many in the city to have their image captured on film, the city already enjoys a strong relationship with the camera. It's the only place in Morocco that can boast an art venue -- Galerie 127 -- that exclusively exhibits photographs. Recently it hosted an opening, at the Gallery David Bloch, by prestigious photographer Steve McCurry. Major photography museum on the way . The city's photography scene is likely to explode over the next few years as it prepares for the 2016 arrival of the Marrakech Museum for Photography and Visual Arts. When it opens, the MMP+, as it's known, is expected to be the largest space for photography and digital visual media in the world. The imposing building will exhibit images from the 19th century alongside contemporary artists from around the world. The ambition of the museum is to become a cultural attraction for the millions of visitors that come every year to the Red City. MMP+'s cultural manager Mostafa Aghrib says the city is the perfect place to locate a major photography museum because it's retained its authenticity at the same time as becoming an economic and cultural player. ""Marrakech inspires photographers, it is abuzz with Moroccan and worldwide creativity, and for all these reasons we thought is was useful to open it in this city,"" he told CNN. The museum already has a temporary home inside the ancient walls of Marrakech's el Badi Palace and has hosted exhibitions including one by five photographers from the Magnum agency: Mikhael Subotzky, Jim Goldberg, Susan Meiselas, Abbas and Mark Power. Tricky subjects . Ironically for a city set to become an international photography hub -- and which looks so good on film -- taking photographs in Marrakech isn't always easy. Many Moroccans, here more so than further south, don't like to be photographed and they won't hesitate to make it known. It's not impossible to capture beautiful moments. Here are some tips on avoiding embarrassment: . Small is best . The bigger the equipment is, the more noticeable the photographer. Walking through narrow streets of the old medina with a bulky professional camera, a tripod and a bag full of lenses is the easiest way to spook potential subjects. Modern compact cameras are lighter, more discreet and can often do a better job with street photography. Being bold gets results . In Marrakech, I sometimes ask people for permission to take their photo, explaining that it's more an artistic approach than a journalistic one. Then I just wait for this perfect moment when they forget I'm there and get the photograph I want without disturbing anyone. So does staying hidden . The complete opposite of the previous tip, but sometimes stolen moments are the most natural and the best. It's not always possible to avoid being spotted by the people being photographed, but a polite attitude and a smile can work wonders. Follow the light . In addition to Marrakech's countless attractions, weather is one of the main reasons tourists visit the Red City -- and it's definitely a plus for photographers. There are clear skies almost daily, meaning that when the sun is at its zenith, walks through the alleys of the old medina will be beautifully lit. Not to mention the sunsets. The best spots . Whether the subject is a person a group or beautiful landscape, location is everything. It's easy to get close to people in the main square, Jemaa el Fna, but photographers shouldn't be surprised if they get asked for money in exchange of their masterpiece -- this mostly applies to snake charmers and monkey trainers. The rooftops of cafes and restaurants surrounding this square offer commanding views of the marketplace and glorious sunsets. Here are some of my favorite places: . Le Grand Balcon Cafe (northwest corner of the square): The service isn't five star, but the view over both sides of the square propels it to the top of the list. Pearl Hotel (Angle Avenue, Echouhada et Rue du Temple, Hivernage, Marrakech; +212 0 524 42 42 42) has a rooftop terrace with a panoramic view over the city and the Atlas Mountains. Palmeraie Circuit: This riverside road to the north of the city is another good place for sunsets, this time with silhouetted palm trees in the foreground. The old medina: Best appreciated without a map since getting lost in the labyrinthine backstreets of Marrakech is the best way to escape tourist traps. Place of the Seven Saints (Avenue 11 Janvier, Marrakech): Still largely unknown by tourists, these seven towers, each topped by a tree, were built in 2005 in honor of Marrakech's seven patron saints. And finally ... One note of caution: taking photographs of government buildings is forbidden and can result in arrest. Ali Berrada is a Moroccan photographer, writer and director.","With strong sunlight and plenty of color, Marrakech is a photographer's dream .
In 2016, the city will be home to the world's largest photography exhibition .

"(CNN) -- It is in our DNA to explore the unknown. But pushing boundaries and exploring space is far from easy. This week, the commercial space industry received a punch in the gut and the world experienced a jarring reminder of just how dangerous space travel can be. On its 55th test flight, Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo suffered ""an anomaly"" just two minutes after it separated from its mother ship, WhiteKnightTwo, while 45,000 feet over the Mojave Desert. One pilot was able to parachute out and is being treated for serious injuries, but tragically, the other perished. The catastrophe comes on the heels of an explosion that happened earlier in the week when an unmanned rocket built by Orbital Sciences carrying a spacecraft loaded with more than 5,000 pounds of cargo exploded into a fireball just seconds after launch at NASA's Wallops flight Facility in Virginia. Aerospace insiders routinely compare the emerging commercial space industry to the genesis of the aviation industry -- high risk, high reward. Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson said in a blog post following Friday's incident: ""We've always known that the road to space is extremely difficult - and that every new transportation system has to deal with bad days early in their history."" A new private space race has emerged in recent years, with private companies like Virgin Galactic and XCOR Aerospace competing to become the world's first commercial space line. Then you have companies like SpaceX, Orbital Sciences, and Boeing that are vying for NASA contracts worth billions. This week's events put the spotlight on the private sector's ability to shoulder the responsibility of space travel. What will the long-term impacts of disasters have on the burgeoning commercial space industry? It should be noted, that in terms of the larger government contracts, this relationship between the public and the private is not really all that new. Since the inception of the space agency, NASA has turned to the private sector to accomplish its space faring goals. Boeing is the lead contractor on the International Space Station. It is not a relationship we will see change anytime soon, even in the face of the Orbital Sciences accident. That is because the U.S. no longer has a home-grown way to get to the International Space Station. NASA is relying on the private sector to get there -- making commercial companies essential to the space agency's operations thus shielding them from the impact of public perception. The space tourism industry is different. The service it is providing is a luxury experience. The companies are at the mercy of public perception of their capabilities to safely transport paying passengers on these suborbital flights. Yes, Virgin has partnered with NASA to run research missions in zero-gravity, but beyond that, Virgin Galactic relies on selling tickets to space enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies for the bulk of its development cost. And they aren't cheap. It costs $250,000 a seat. Passengers want to know they are going to be safe. Friday's accident will surely instil fear in the more than 700 people who have signed up to make the journey. So what is the value of space tourism? And why risk human lives to make it a reality? As George Whitesides told CNN earlier this year: ""At heart, what inspires me the most is the idea that space changes you, that space has this profound impact on the people that can experience it."" What Whitesides is referring to is the overview effect, a phenomenon that space travelers are said to experience when they see the curvature of the Earth -- changing the way people see the world, thereby influencing the way in which they live. Both Whitesides and Branson have spoken openly about the fact that suborbital flights are not the ultimate end goal for Virgin Galactic. Point-to-point intercontinental travel would be the next application of this technology, meaning that one day passengers could travel around the world in about two hours. While such plans have been put on hold since the accident, Virgin Galactic is intent on taking off. In his blog post following the crash, Branson said: ""Space is hard -- but worth it. We will persevere and move forward together."" The question is, will people still be willing to pay $250,000 to go to space? Inside Virgin Galactic's spaceship .

"(CNN) -- Look miles into the future and imagine a day, when geneticists can design a flawless set of human genes in a laboratory. That future vision may never arrive, but it has taken a step closer. Scientists have built a designer chromosome and inserted it into a cell, geneticist Jef Boeke from New York University announced this week. The chromosome was a heavily altered version, a departure from its natural counterpart. A team of scientists from around the world made 500 changes to its genetic base. ""When you change the genome, you're gambling,"" said Boeke, who led the project. ""One wrong change can kill the cell."" But the cell survived and made use of its new chromosome. It also reproduced, and subsequent cells carried the new chromosome forward. Actually, make this breakthrough a second step closer to that way-out-there future. Researchers were already able to duplicate a chromosome on a computer four years ago, build it in the lab, insert it into a cell and watch it work. It was a huge advancement that created the first synthetic bacteria cell, scientists said then. But, now, there's been a leap forward, Boeke said. ""Our research moves the needle in synthetic biology from theory to reality,"" he said. It makes scientists more able to alter the design of living things. Meet yeast -- your cousin . The new chromosome and the cell Boeke's scientist built it for are much more complex and are closer to those of a human being. The kind of cell Boeke used? Brewer's yeast. Yeast cells, human cells, plant and animal cells have in common that they are ""eukaryotes"" -- cells with a nucleus wrapped in membrane. Our chromosomes, which are located in those nuclei, are made of enormously long strings of DNA. They are wound up like twists of yarn that take on that familiar ""X"" shape many associate with the genes they contain. And they are called eukaryotic chromosomes. Boeke's breakthrough represents the first report that a whole eukaryotic chromosome was constructed from scratch, NYU said. Boeke and his team call their new designer chromosome ""synIII."" Mammoth knitting task . It took seven years and the help of 60 students to build synIII with the help of computer modeling. Each student put together about 1,000 genetic molecule pairs called ""base pairs"" to make strings of DNA. They were joined together to make a genetic strand 273,871 base pairs long. That's actually shorter than the yeast's natural chromosome, which contained 316,667 base pairs. And that's where the design and manipulation come in. Broeke and his team took out 47,841 base pairs that were repeats of other pairs -- along with some ""junk"" DNA. The new designer chromosome is a cleaned up, streamlined version of the original. Shuffling the genetic deck . Yeast has about 6,000 genes and shares about a third of them with humans, although yeast is a much simpler beast. That makes it easier to study. In fact, its genetics are probably better known than those of any other living thing, NYU said. Although Boeke studies human genetics, too, he is not planning to design a set of synthetic human chromosomes. But he would like to build all 16 required for an entire yeast cell. And he has made some progress already. Students are figuring out how to make DNA strands 10 times as long as the ones they made the first time around. It should speed up production of subsequent chromosomes. Boeke also wants to improve upon the yeast cells in the process, now that his team can shuffle its genes around like cards in a deck. ""It will allow us to ask, can we make a deck of cards with a better hand for making yeast survive under any of a multitude of conditions, such as tolerating higher alcohol levels."" That might make for stronger glass of beer, but it could also have other uses: The new cells could possibly be programmed to ""brew"" medicines, vaccines and fuels.","Scientists built a designer chromosome and inserted it into a yeast cell .

"Irbil, Iraq (CNN) -- Turkish soldiers and tanks took up position along the border with Syria on Tuesday as its government debated whether to deploy troops to battle the Islamic State terror group, a move that comes as tens of thousands pour into the country to escape ISIS fighters. The flood of refugees from Syria has escalated -- with 150,000 people fleeing to Turkey in recent days -- as ISIS fighters armed with tanks and heavy weapons advance on the predominantly Kurdish town of Kobani, known in Arabic as Ayn al Arab, destroying villages in their path. ISIS fighters were just three kilometers (nearly two miles) east of the northern Syria town late Monday, a civilian in Kobani told CNN on condition of anonymity. CNN cannot independently confirm the claim, though it matches reports released by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group. U.S. airstrikes overnight targeted ISIS positions near Kobani, said Rear Adm. John Kirby, spokesman for the Pentagon. It was unclear whether the strikes stopped the ISIS advance, and Kirby provided only cursory details about what they targeted and what damage may have resulted. When asked why airstrikes in the Kobani area appear to be limited, a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a lack of direct, reliable intelligence on the ground and the need to be precise to avoid civilian casualties were among the factors. Poll: Americans back airstrikes, but oppose use of U.S. troops . Turkey considers going after ISIS . If ISIS takes Kobani, it would control a complete swath of land from its self-declared capital of Raqqa to the Turkish border, more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) away. It has been fighting for months, capturing portions of northern and eastern Syria and western and northern Iraq for what it says is its new Islamic state -- or caliphate. The Turkish Parliament on Tuesday took up the issue whether to send troops into Iraq and Syria to fight ISIS. The debate was expected to continue into the latter part of the week before lawmakers voted, according to Anadolu, Turkey's semi-official news agency. Turkey has said it is offering support to a U.S.-led coalition targeting ISIS, but has stopped short of joining the 40-some countries who make up the coalition. But with more than 150,000 refugees pouring into the country since last week, adding to the hundreds of thousands who have already fled the Syrian civil war, and concerns about ISIS controlling border points, Turkish lawmakers are taking up the issue. Obama assesses ISIS strategy . At the same time, U.S. President Barack Obama met with his National Security Council to discuss what White House officials described as a comprehensive strategy to counter the threat posed by ISIS, also known as ISIL. The meeting follows Obama's admission on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that the United States underestimated the strength of ISIS and overestimated the ability of the Iraqi security forces to fight the group. Nowhere was that assessment more evident than in reports ISIS had seized another Iraqi military base about 80 kilometers (50 miles) west of Baghdad over the weekend. Dozens of ISIS fighters attacked the Albu Aytha military base, north of Ramadi, where 180 Iraqi soldiers were stationed, according to Faleh al-Essawi, deputy head of the Anbar provincial council. ISIS has been fanning out across the Sunni-dominated Anbar region in recent months, targeting bases one by one across the vast area. Syrian town fears massacre; Obama admits underestimating rise of ISIS . About a week ago, details emerged regarding the massacre of more than 100 Iraqi soldiers at bases in Saqlawiyah and Sejar, also near Ramadi. A handful of survivors accused the Iraqi government of failing to respond to pleas for help ahead of the final ISIS assault on the base, after a dayslong siege. ISIS overruns military base . While the majority of soldiers withdrew from the Albu Aytha base prior to it being overrun Sunday by ISIS fighters, a number of soldiers appear to have been killed. Images posted online by ISIS purport to show the takeover of the base in question, and include images of men dressed in uniform who appear to be dead Iraqi soldiers. While CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the ISIS images, giveaway features on the base and in the landscape do appear to show western Iraq, specifically, and very likely the base in question. ISIS also seized a large weapons cache left behind at the base, al-Essawi said. Amid the continuing violence, a string of car bombs and mortar attacks hit Iraqi cities, leaving dozens dead. In Baghdad, two car bombs and seven mortar attacks struck primarily Shiite neighborhoods, killing at least nine people and wounding 40, police officials said. Car bombs also exploded in the predominantly Shiite cities of Hilla, Karbala and Basra, Iraqiya state TV reported. All three are south of the Iraqi capital. UK carries out first airstrikes . The attacks came the same day that the United Kingdom said it conducted its first airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, striking targets four days after Parliament voted to approve the country's involvement. British planes helped Kurdish troops who were fighting ISIS in northwestern Iraq, dropping a bomb on an ISIS heavy weapon position and shooting a missile at an armed pickup truck, the UK's defense ministry said. An initial assessment indicates both strikes were successful, according to the ministry. British planes had been involved in reconnaissance missions over Iraq in the days since lawmakers approved UK airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq on Friday, but Tuesday's strikes were a first. Britain joins the United States and France as countries that have hit ISIS in Iraq with airstrikes, while Belgium and Denmark have also said they also will provide planes. Of those nations, only the United States -- in partnership with some Arab countries -- have struck ISIS positions in neighboring Syria. Australia police arrest man accused of funding U.S. fighter in Syria . Peshmerga 'need more support' In northern Iraq, Kurdish fighters known as Pershmerga, went after ISIS fighters in Rabia, a major border crossing between Syrian and Iraq that has been under the control of the militants since late June, Brig. Gen. Hazhar Ismail at the Peshmerga Ministry in Irbil told CNN. ISIS has been collecting money from people who use the border crossing, he said. The operation was preceded by coalition airstrikes. In Iraq, airstrikes overnight destroyed more ISIS transport and armored vehicles. There were also strikes near Mosul Dam, one of the country's largest hydroelectric dams, the U.S. military also said. The dam provides water to most of northern Iraq. There were also strikes northwest of Baghdad and one that hit west Fallujah, according to the military. On the ground, Hazhar said, the Kurdish forces needed closer air support in the form of helicopter cover during operations. He complained that the Peshmerga's budget, weapons and training must go through the central government in Baghdad and claimed that the Peshmerga ""have not received one dollar from Iraq, even though Parliament has approved funds."" Opinion: To beat ISIS, focus on young people . CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from Irbil and Gul Tuysuz from near the Turkey/Syria border, while Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- For much of the last century, people in the small town of Libby, Montana, were surrounded by toxic asbestos. It covered patches of grass, dusted the tops of cars and drifted through the air in a hazy smoke that became a part of their daily lives. The W.R. Grace plant in Libby, Montana, in an undated photograph. It closed in 1990. Now, after decades of suffering and watching loved ones die, area residents are getting their day in court. Federal prosecutors have begun a trial of the mining company they blame for the pollution, which doctors say left more than 1,000 people ill and more than 200 dead. ""There's never been a case where so many people were sickened or killed by environmental crime,"" says David Uhlmann, who helped spearhead the case when he was the Justice Department's top prosecutor of environmental crimes before stepping down in 2007. ""It's the most significant environmental criminal prosecution that's ever been brought."" Donald Munsel, a 71-year-old Libby resident, told CNN on Monday that the legal efforts ""should have been over a long time ago."" Munsel says he has suffered from lung cancer linked to asbestos exposure. Those who lost loved ones were among the first witnesses at the trial. Arguments began last week at the federal courthouse in Missoula, Montana. They said the town was kept in the dark about the dangers. One woman said that as kids, she and friends would light up the toxic dust and even ""put it in our mouths,"" CNN affiliate KPAX-TV of Missoula reported. Until 1990, W.R. Grace & Company operated a mine in Libby that produced vermiculite, a substance used in all sorts of products, from insulation to fertilizers. The vermiculite was contaminated with tremolite asbestos -- a particularly toxic form linked to numerous illnesses including mesothelioma, a cancer that can attack the lining of the lungs, abdomen, or heart. The government's indictment alleges that W.R. Grace conspired to ""knowingly release"" the asbestos. It says the company tried to hide the dangers from employees and residents, leaving them ""in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury."" ""It was a purpose of the conspiracy to conceal and misrepresent the hazardous nature of the tremolite asbestos contaminated vermiculite, thereby enriching defendants and others,"" the indictment reads. And the indictment says W.R. Grace tried to ""defraud the United States and others by impairing, impeding, and frustrating"" the Environmental Protection Agency and other government agencies once they launched an investigation in 1999. The 10-count indictment also includes charges of wire fraud and obstruction of justice. If convicted, the company could face criminal fines of up to $280 million -- twice the value of its profits from the mine. Five executives who are named as defendants could face prison time. Prosecutors plan to try a sixth executive separately. Company denies conspiracy . The company does not deny that asbestos emanated from its plant. Nor does it question whether some people were sickened and killed, though a definitive number of deaths linked to the vermiculite plant probably will never be known. But W.R. Grace denies any kind of conspiracy. In fact, the company says, it acted responsibly and took appropriate steps. Main Street in Libby, Montana. Some residents say the town was kept in the dark about asbestos dangers. In a statement when the indictment was issued in 2005, W.R. Grace said it ""categorically denies any criminal wrongdoing."" That statement came before the company launched a series of legal challenges that went as far as the U.S. Supreme Court. In response to questions from CNN, W.R. Grace said at the time that it was acting as a good corporate citizen and had voluntarily paid millions of dollars in medical bills for 900 Libby residents. Both sides are now respecting the request of U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy that they not speak to the media. In the courtroom, defense attorneys have noted that the asbestos problem dates back to about 1920 -- long before W.R. Grace took over the mine in 1963. Attorneys say that as information about the asbestos came to light, the company took numerous steps to mitigate the dangers and were open about it. W.R. Grace followed a ""plan"" that was in no way ""hush hush,"" and was subject to government inspection, defense attorney David Bernick told the jury, according to KPAX. The defense also says the government had ""vast information"" about asbestos in Libby before the EPA came along in 1999 to launch an investigation. Deputy U.S. Attorney Kris McLean told the jury that the the trial is about ""holding this company and these officials accountable for a very serious wrong,"" KPAX reported. The government says internal memos from the company will help make the prosecution's case. In testimony that began last week, residents described the clouds of smoke that would emanate from the mine and drop dust across the town. ""Vermiculite was all over the ground"" at the mine's export plant, said Cameron Foote, a minister from the nearby town of Troy. He said he ""didn't see any hazard"" and would walk through the piles ""without his shoes"" on, KPAX reported. He also said the vermiculite was mixed with wood chips and covered the ground under the bleachers and dugouts at baseball fields. Residents cope with illness . CNN visited Libby in 2000 and met Dan and Della Schnetter, who described their devastation when Dan became seriously ill at age 38, after he had stopped working at the mine. Both his lungs filled with fluid, and he was diagnosed with asbestosis, a lung disease caused by asbestos particles . Had he known of the dangers, ""I wouldn't have raised my children here. I would not have. I wouldn't have took them up on the hill to breathe the same stuff I was breathing,"" he said. Health problems can occur years after exposure to asbestos. The Schnetters filed a suit against the company. It was among dozens that were settled. ""My dad, he is still alive,"" the Schnetters' daughter, Jessica Holcomb, told CNN on Monday. ""His lungs have gotten worse, but he's not on oxygen yet. We just pray to the Lord and take one day at a time."" Art and Helen Bundrock and four of their five children were diagnosed with asbestosis. ""We just grew up with it. It was always there,"" Helen Bundrock said. ""The kids always liked to go with Dad in his rigs because you could play tic-tac-toe."" She added, ""they called it a nuisance dust, the company did."" But Alan Stringer, who was a project manager at the mine, told CNN in 2000, ""From the time Grace understood that there was a problem, there was a continuous movement of minimizing the risk to the employees."" Stringer was named as a defendant in the case, but he died in 2007. Speaking to CNN on Monday, Helen Bundrock said that she is now on oxygen. Her oldest child, Bill, is in his mid-50s and goes ""off and on oxygen,"" she said. Bill had also worked at the mine. The other children are doing well overall, though she said that their fifth child, a daughter, also was diagnosed with asbestosis. She blames the company. ""I feel kind of sorry for those people. They have to live with themselves. I know there's a much higher judge, and they will be facing him sometime,"" she said. Squaring off in court . Reporters in the courtroom have noted a striking frequency of objections by the defense. Many involve the critical issue of timing. Judge Molloy has ruled in the defense's favor that the government must prove a conspiracy took place after the Clean Air Act took effect in 1990. And due to the statute of limitations, the government needs to demonstrate that criminal conduct occurred in 1999 or later, former prosecutor Uhlmann told CNN. He called timing ""one of the big challenges the government has in the case."" The trial has seen some courtroom drama. In one tense exchange, the EPA's cleanup coordinator for Libby, Paul Peronard, accused defense attorney Bernick of spouting ""nonsense."" Peronard also testified that his dog ate a piece of evidence -- a notebook that might have contained relevant information, KPAX reported. The trial is expected to last for months. Yet residents of Libby have gotten used to waiting. Generations after the town began suffering, 10 years after the EPA launched its investigation, and four years after the indictment was issued, stricken families are watching to see who may ultimately be held accountable.","Federal prosecutors blame mining company for asbestos pollution .

"(CNN) -- Wiry, wizened and dressed in a tattered old jelaba robe, Abdul-Hakim lives in a world in which fact and fantasy are blurred together through an ancient alchemy. Almost every day over four decades and more, he's stood out in Jemaa el Fna, the great sprawling square that forms the heart of medieval Marrakech in Morocco. In cold winter rain and mist, and in the searing heat of the endless desert summer, he's one enduring fixture, a constant force in a realm constantly touched by change. He stands there, knitted cap pulled down tight over a balding scalp, fingers gnarled and black with dirt, a face conjured from a weather-worn sheet of chapped leather. As the muezzin's voice radiates down over the long morning shadows, Abdul-Hakim finishes his prayer and steps out into the sunlight. Having given a blessing that begins ""All things to the pious,"" he claps his hands to gain an audience. All of a sudden, the story begins: . ""There was once a woodcutter named Mushkil Gusha,"" he says, his voice rasping a tale from the ""Arabian Nights."" ""A man who was as honest and kind as any other alive ..."" Within an instant, a halqa has formed, a sacred circle of souls. Pressed shoulder to shoulder, the listeners crane forward, as they do, day in day out, every day. For them, Abdul-Hakim's stories are a kind of magical lifeblood, a wisdom and an entertainment all rolled into one. ""He transports us to distant kingdoms,"" says Malik, a shopkeeper from a nearby perfume stall. ""Only he can weave magic like this. I was brought up with his tales, just as my own sons have been."" The hakawati, the storyteller, lowers his voice, a technique to draw the listeners in towards him. He takes his time, feeding them the tale as though it were some delicious sweet. Powders and homemade lotions . A stone's throw away, a healer is setting up his stall. He's dressed in the light blue robe of the Tuareg, his skin as dark as his teeth are white. From an old Berber chest he pulls out his wares -- a clutch of ostrich eggs, a pair of dried chameleons, a jaguar's skull and an assortment of vials and jars, powders and homemade lotions. Beside him is another medicine man. His stock in trade is sulfur and antimony, dried damask roses, and a half-gallon pot of lizard oil. Across from him is a dentist. In his right hand is a pair of electrical pincers. In his left, a shoebox half-filled with human teeth. ""I never cause any pain,"" he explains meekly. ""You see, it's because I whisper a spell as I make the extraction. Take a seat here, sir, and I will prove it to you now."" By late morning, the tale of the woodcutter Mushkil Gusha is nearing its end, and the dentist, from the inner reaches of the desert, is posing for a picture. A tourist from Brooklyn slips out his camera and points to a bottle marked with a skull and crossed bones. He wonders aloud what's inside. The Tuareg healer grins a fearsome, almost maniacal grin. ""It's for revenge,"" he lisps. The last shadows melt away as noon approaches, and as the summer heat begins its raw and unrelenting suffocation. A scattering of tourists amble about, soaking up an atmosphere that has allured visitors for centuries. They're from every corner of the world. Distant desert outpost . These days most people fly in directly to Marrakech. It sometimes feels as though they hardly have a clue where are. After all, the airport could be anywhere. The ancient mud walls that encircle the city's medina are a clue though -- a clue that this was once a distant desert outpost, fortified for life and death. Marrakech may be easy to get to now, but it's smack in the middle of Morocco's red desert. With that heritage comes a kind of Twilight Zone sense of the miraculous. Like the tales woven by Abdul-Hakim, Marrakech blurs the lines between fact and fantasy, and touches all who venture here with its sorcery. As the afternoon heat reaches its height, the snake charmers slink out from the cool of the cafes, the shrill sound of their flutes, known as rhaita, forming a hypnotic stage on which their overheated cobras perform. Gradually, the afternoon heat begins to wane. And, as it does so, a slew of acrobats tumble and fall across the square's great open space. Members of the Gnaoua, an ancient brotherhood, they clatter huge iron castanets, warding away supernatural jinn. Abdul-Hakim pauses for the late afternoon prayer. When he's done, he sips a little water and chews on m'simmen, a kind of Moroccan pancake. And then, wiping his eyes with the corner of his handkerchief, he begins another favored tale from ""The Thousand and One Nights,"" a story half as old as time, called ""The City of Brass."" Sheep brains and spicy sausages . As his words waft out over the square, there's the thunderous sound of steel wheels rapping hard over stone. Dozens of iron carts are hurtling forward. Like gun carriages hastening to war, they're pushed into position at lightning speed, and quickly unloaded. Within a few minutes, clouds of dense oily smoke are billowing up into the dusk, as the stalls start touting all manner of foods. In Jemaa el Fna's nocturnal incarnation, tourists and locals dine on sheep's brains and spiced Berber sausages, mutton tagines, roasted chicken and trout. A lithe good-mannered figure is hustling for custom outside Stall 117. Going by the nickname ""Denzil Washington,"" he appears ready to sell anything. Working as a volunteer in an orphanage by day, he supports himself by touting in the square at night. ""One-one-seven!"" he cries is a faux cockney voice. ""It'll take you to heaven!"" Away from the smoke, the incandescent light bulbs, and the uproar of the feast, a blind musician draws a bow over the strings of a battered old violin. A microphone strapped around his neck leads to a little amplifier, cupped in the hands of his young grandson. The sound stretches out like a magic carpet laid over the desert floor. Listen hard, and you find yourself transported back in time to an encampment in the wilderness, a watering hole for camels and men. As the night approaches, the medicine men and the healers pack up their bones, their potions, and their boxes of human teeth. The Gnaoua disappear into the shadows, and the snake charmers slink away home for another night. Abdul-Hakim is one of the last to go. Pausing at a cliffhanger in his epic tale, he tugs off his knitted cap and holds it upside down. A few Dirham coins are dropped in by locals. The storyteller does a mental calculation. Just enough for dinner. ""They'll be back here in the morning as sure as day follows night,"" he says. ""You see, they're caught in my spell. I can see it in their eyes. They simply can't resist."" Tahir Shah moved from London to Casablanca 10 years ago. He's the author of more than 15 books and is best known for ""The Caliph's House,"" which details the tribulations of living in a haunted Moroccan home.","Jemaa el Fna, Marrakech's ancient central square, hosts snake charmers, medicine men, food vendors .

"(CNN) -- The steep rock walls of Thailand's Hellfire Pass symbolize the slavery, starvation, torture and lost lives of thousands of POWs and Asian civilians during World War II, when Japan forced them to build the infamous Death Railway to boost its invasion of Burma. At today's Hellfire Pass Memorial Museum, visitors can share the misery and memories of those years, and learn from survivors who tell what happened and why. Recently named the best museum in Thailand and ranked among the top five in Asia by TripAdvisor, the haunting site and museum are called a ""must"" by the travel website. Fifty miles away, in the town of Kanchanaburi (about 75 miles west of Bangkok, near Thailand's border with Myanmar), evocative ceremonies take place annually from November 28 to December 7 during River Kwai Bridge Week, commemorating the Allied bombing of the area, which began on November 28, 1944. Events include cultural performances, plus a sound and light show portraying the history of the Death Railway, which crossed the so-called Bridge on the River Kwai on its route through Hellfire Pass. More than 16,000 enslaved British, Dutch, Australian and American POWs perished at these sites. More than 90,000 Asians also died from starvation and disease during their forced labor, according to the United Kingdom's Forces War Records. Together, the sites make this corner of jungle in Thailand one of the most sobering and evocative places on the planet for travelers with an interest in the horrifying events of World War II. Fatal railway . ""Hellfire Pass"" and ""Death Railway"" are terms coined by POWs whose fate was sealed in a sinister, deadly agreement. In August 1942, Thailand's prime minister Field Marshal Phibun Songkhram signed an agreement with Japan to allow the laying of a single-meter-gauge railway track toward British colonial Burma (now Myanmar). In October 1943, Japan began transporting troops and supplies on that finished railway through newly carved Hellfire Pass, to support its 1942 Burma invasion. For slave labor, Tokyo used more than 60,000 POWs -- 30,000 British, 18,000 Dutch, 13,000 Australians and 700 Americans. Most were captured when Britain surrendered its colonial hold on Singapore in February 1942, while other POWs were seized in Britain's Malaysia and Dutch-held Indonesia. About one-fifth of the POWs died from untreated diseases and starvation -- they were given watery gruel rations and sadistic punishments while building Hellfire Pass and the Death Railway. Executions of prisoners and laborers were common. Tokyo was in a brutal rush, so its commanders in Thailand forced up to 180,000 Indians, Malayans, Singaporean Chinese, Tamils and other Asians to labor at the sites under similar conditions, according to the Forces War Records. The railway totaled 260 miles (415 kilometers), including 190 miles (304 kilometers) in Thailand from Nong Pladuk to Hellfire Pass on the Thai-Burma border, plus 70 miles (111 kilometers) to reach Thanbyuzayat inside Burma, where it linked trains to Rangoon. When the Allies began bombing the railway in November 1944 and 1945, they killed some POWs laboring there. Allied aerial bombing during 1945 also destroyed almost every railway bridge throughout Thailand. Some railroad tracks near Kanchanaburi survived the war, but Hellfire Pass disappeared amid jungle growth. Visiting Hellfire Pass . In the 1980s, a handful of Australian survivors rediscovered the overgrown Hellfire Pass section of the route and campaigned to turn it into a memorial. Guided tours are now available, but many people prefer to linger on their own. While most tourists visit the River Kwai bridge and main POW cemetery at Kanchanaburi, others say they experience stronger and more profound feelings at Hellfire Pass. Taxis and local buses are available between the sites. You can walk through Hellfire Pass's narrow 85-foot-deep (26 meter) trench in the Tenasserim Hills along its 1,640-foot-long (500 meter) track. POWs and forced laborers painstakingly hacked open the mass of solid rock using hand tools, making it wide enough for the train to slide through. Nearby, the TripAdvisor top-rated and air-conditioned Hellfire Pass Memorial Museum is run by the Office of Australian War Graves. It offers videos, photographs, drawings, tools and testimony. The highly recommended portable audio headset includes the voices of survivors who describe atrocities they endured, which you can listen to while wandering between Hellfire Pass's stone walls. From the museum, a walking trail of a few hundred yards leads to Hellfire Pass, also called the Konyu Cutting, and you can continue walking down the abandoned railway line for a couple of miles. That route reveals a gorgeous valley, other rock ""cutting"" railway passes and a couple of trestle bridges. The jungle is often hot and humid, with voracious mosquitoes. Visitors unprepared to deal with either usually find the going uncomfortable. Nearby WWII attractions . Back in town, the manicured Kanchanaburi ""Don Rak"" War Cemetery includes most of the POWs' remains recovered from nearby mass graves. POWs are also interred at nearby Chungkai, and in Myanmar at Thanbyuzayat. The excellent Thailand-Burma Railway Center, next to the cemetery, displays research by an Australian who was a Commonwealth War Graves Commission manager of the Kanchanaburi and Chungkai war cemeteries. The center includes extensive details about the railway, Hellfire Pass, POW camps and cemetery sites in Thailand, plus biographies and artifacts. Visitors can also tour Kanchanaburi's Thai-owned JEATH Museum and World War II Museum. Managed by a Thai Buddhist temple, the JEATH ""Wat Tai"" Museum's design is similar to the bamboo-and-thatch shacks where POWs were housed, and displays POW testimonies and paintings, plus news reports and other objects. Scary, painted wooden effigies show life-sized prisoners being tortured, dying and laboring on the railway, alongside statues of Hitler, Tojo, Stalin and other wartime leaders. The acronym JEATH indicates the countries of Japan, England, Australia, Thailand and Holland, which were intertwined in the Death Railway's creation. Nearby was the so-called ""Bridge on the River Kwai,"" a POW-built steel and concrete structure with 11 curved spans. Next to that was a wooden trestle railway bridge, still partially preserved. Both bridges were completed in 1943, and repeatedly bombed by British and U.S. warplanes. Today, tourists can take a short train ride across a fully functional, duplicate ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" closer to Kanchanaburi -- built to resemble the obliterated original. You can also walk across the bridge and take boats on the river below. Hellfire Pass in popular culture . The Death Railway's main structure was immortalized in the partially fictional 1957 movie classic, ""The Bridge on the River Kwai."" In 2013, Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman starred in ""The Railway Man,"" portraying Death Railway survivor and former POW Eric Lomax. On October 14, Australian author Richard Flanagan, 53, won Britain's Booker Prize for his novel titled, ""The Narrow Road to the Deep North,"" describing his father's experience as a POW who survived after laboring on the Death Railway.

"(CNN) -- Bottles of Extra Strength Tylenol will soon have a new warning on their caps: ""Contains acetaminophen. Always read the label."" The bright red lettering is an effort by Tylenol's parent company, Johnson & Johnson, to reduce the number of accidental acetaminophen overdoses that occur each year. ""Acetaminophen overdose is one of the most common poisonings worldwide,"" according to the National Institutes of Health. Taking too much of this pain reliever can cause severe liver damage. The Food and Drug Administration sets the maximum limit for adults at 4,000 milligrams per day. One gel tablet of Extra Strength Tylenol contains 500 mg. People should keep their doctor and pharmacist informed about all the medications they are taking to ensure that they are not consuming more than the daily limit, according to the FDA. They should also avoid taking acetaminophen with alcohol. ""With more than 600 (over the counter) and prescription medications containing acetaminophen on the market, this is an important step because it will help remind consumers to always read the label,"" Johnson & Johnson said in a statement about the new caps, which will arrive in October.

"(CNN) -- Jim Carrey has been making audiences laugh for years, but the star says he's really a ""weird, serious person."" Jim Carrey is a star on the big screen, but he says he would love to do a play on Broadway. He says he's battled depression and loves to do drama as much as the funny stuff. Fans of his lighter side, though, may be glad to see his latest film is a comedy, ""Yes Man,"" which opens in theaters Friday. Carrey spoke with CNN's Larry King about his life on and off the screen. King: How did you get this project? Carrey: I think projects find me. You know, it's really interesting. Everything I've done, from ""The Truman Show,"" the ""Eternal Sunshine"" to ""Yes Man"" and ""Bruce Almighty,"" always come into my life at the perfect time. King: So have you turned down anything you regretted? Carrey: I never regret. ... [But] you know, ""Meet the Parents"" was something that I was developing. King: You turned that down? Carrey: Yes. I actually created the Fockers in a creative meeting. Yes. But, it was perfect that Ben Stiller did it. When I saw it, I went, ""That's the way it's supposed to be done."" King: The premise of ""Yes Man"" is what? Carrey: It's a gentleman by the name of Carl Allen, who has kind of stopped living. He got hurt in a relationship and he just kind of went into his shell, and he decided to say no to life. And he decides that, at a certain point, that he's kind of losing touch with everything. He runs into a guru -- a new-age master played by Terrence Stamp. ...  And he makes a covenant with this man that he will say yes to everything no matter how ridiculous it is. King: Isn't ""no"" the hardest word to say? Carrey: It is hard for me. Especially when you've got money. It's like, you know, there's so many people, man.  Watch Carrey's interview with Larry King » . King: Are you the most comfortable with comedy? Carrey: No, I love it all, honestly. I love -- I love being creative. ... I feel so lucky to be given all of these opportunities, to be able to do a movie like ""Ace Ventura"" and then do ""The Truman Show"" and ""Eternal Sunshine,"" and to be able to do the ""Yes Man,"" which is flat-out comedy and that has a little something to think about. King: Ever want to do Broadway? Carrey: Sure, sure. I'll do that. King: Do a play? Carrey: I would love to do it. I hope I could do it. King: How did you and [girlfriend Jenny McCarthy] -- how did that happen? Carrey: It's funny how that happens when you're in a place that's really wonderful. I had already gotten to a place in my life where I felt at peace, and I was invited to David Spade's birthday party. And I went out there that night and I was just in a zone. And I just felt wonderful. It was one of those times when you don't have to be anywhere but where you are. King: And you had no girlfriend? Carrey: I had no girlfriend at the time. I mean, I was just knocking them off one after another. It was just sick. But -- so I went to the party. And I just stood there in the middle of the room and kind of had that feeling like I was everything I felt. And she looked at me, and she said, ""You just looked so peaceful that I had to come and talk to you."" King: What did you think when you saw her? Carrey: I went -- well, I mean, I'd seen her a bunch of times, never in person. But I just thought -- well, she's nothing like the persona, like the ""Singled Out"" person that I met -- or that I knew, that I had seen. Because I don't think I wanted to go out with that person. You know? She was brilliant, but that wasn't the choice I would make. She was completely different than that. She was really sweet. King: And that's magic when it hits? Carrey: Yes. Beautiful. King: You can't predict it? Carrey: No. You're just lucky while it's there, you know. That's all, just lucky. King: Are you going to marry Jenny? Carrey: No. I am married to Jenny. I love Jenny very much, and we have a great relationship. And we've both been married a couple times. ... I like it the way it is, and I think she likes it the way it is. You know? And that's all we need. I really don't, at this point of my life, feel like I need to have the approval of someone in the collar or a judge to tell us that our relationship is sacred. King: Didn't you suffer from depression? Carrey: Yes. King: How did you get through that to this? Carrey: Well, that's another thing. You know at the risk of like opening up the whole Tom Cruise Prozac argument, you know, I don't disagree in many ways. I think Prozac and things like that are very valuable to people for short periods of time. But I believe if you're on them for an extended period of time, you never get to the problem. You never get to see what the problem is, because everything is just kind of OK. And so, you don't deal. And people deal when they get desperate. King: So how did you do it? Carrey: I take supplements. ... It's a wonderful thing. It's amazing. I'm going to talk a lot about it in the near future. King: You're going to write about it? Carrey: Yes.","Jim Carrey: Projects always come into my life at the perfect time .

"(CNN) -- Alabama legislators passed several restrictive abortion bills this week, including one that could mean felony charge against any doctor performing such a procedure on a woman who'd been pregnant as little as six weeks. The four measures easily passed the state's House of Representatives on Tuesday, and they still need to go through the Senate and be signed by Gov. Robert J. Bentley to become law. Both of those steps are real possibilities, given Alabama's conservative bent and the fact the Senate, like the House, is Republican dominated and Bentley belongs to that party. Still, even if all that happens, it's no guarantee that all of the measures will become law. Last year, North Dakota passed its own law to ban abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detected -- much like one passed Tuesday, by an overwhelming 73-29 margin, by Alabama representatives. But a federal judge, Daniel Hovland, subsequently granted a temporary injunction blocking the law's enforcement because its pre-viability provisions were ""invalid and unconstitutional."" In his decision, the judge said ""there is no question"" that the law known as HB 1456 directly contradicts a ""litany"" of Supreme Court cases that address restraints on abortion, including Roe v. Wade. Judge blocks restrictive North Dakota abortion law . Like that North Dakota legislation, the Alabama law does not mention abortions being allowed in cases of rape or incest. The only exception is when not having an abortion ""is likely to result in the death of the pregnant woman or is likely to result in substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman, not including psychological or emotional conditions. Doctors would be required to check for a fetal heartbeat. If they don't, they'd be charged with a Class C felony. They would be similarly charged if they check and find a heartbeat, then perform an abortion. (The pregnant woman would not face charges.) ""In almost every medical situation, the litmus test to determine the need for continued medical treatment is the existence of a pulse,"" state Rep. Mary Sue McClurkin, a sponsor of the bill, said in a statement. ""We owe the same respect and reverence to the life of an unborn child that we would pay to any person facing a medical emergency."" As the National Institutes of Health and other experts and groups note, a fetus' heartbeat typically cannot be detected until at least 6 weeks into a woman's pregnancy. The Alabama and North Dakota laws, then, would effectively ban abortions beyond that point -- making them the most restrictive such laws in the country. A number of states have passed abortion bans after 20 weeks, such as Texas, Nebraska, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Indiana and Alabama. Arkansas has a ban in place for pregnancies beyond 12 weeks. Some states have no time limit, while others allow abortion up to the end of the second trimester, which is about 27 or 28 weeks into one's pregnancy. In addition to McClurkin's bill -- which is dubbed the Fetal Heartbeat Act -- the Alabama state representatives chamber also passed a measure increasing the required wait time before an abortion is performed from 24 to 48 hours. Another bill states that a woman must be informed about perinatal hospital services as alternatives to abortion when a fetus is found to have a condition that will likely result in death within three months of birth. The pregnant woman must then state, in writing, that she is declining such hospice services. Lastly, a fourth bill toughens parental consent requirements for minors seeking abortions. They can go through the courts to try to get the chance to have such a procedure without a parent or legal guardian's consent. And the bill also prohibits parents from coercing a minor into having an abortion. House Speaker Mike Hubbard lauded these bills and others, saying he is ""proud to lead the House at a time when we have enacted more pro-life protections than at any other period in Alabama history."" ""In Alabama, we will fight tooth and nail to preserve and protect the life of the unborn until the liberal, activist Supreme Court decision making abortion legal in the United States is overturned,"" Hubbard said. ""Republicans in the Alabama House believe that life begins at conception and that a heartbeat is evidence of a viable life that deserves to be defended."" But Nikema Williams, an official with Planned Parenthood Southeast, sharply criticized the measure, including the so-called Fetal Heartbeat Act, which she noted would bar abortions ""before some women even realize they are pregnant."" ""It's part of an extreme agenda to restrict all abortions under any circumstances in the state of Alabama,"" she said from Montgomery, one of five Alabama cities that have abortion clinics. ""All of these are another attack on women's healthcare."" And the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama called out the legislators for passing bills that will ""invite litigation (that) will cost the state dearly."" ""This callous and reckless behavior proves that politicians aren't conscious of Alabama citizens or the financial catastrophe that this state is in and are more interested in pandering than they are in solving the problems facing Alabama,"" the ACLU said. This isn't the first time Alabama legislators have passed a restrictive abortion law that's brought opposition and possible interference from the courts. Last July, U.S. District Judge Myron H. Thompson issued a temporary restraining order that blocks Alabama from enforcing a key portion of a new abortion law that requires doctors at an abortion clinic to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. The state had argued the measure is designed to protect the health of a patient. The plaintiffs call it medically unnecessary due to the safety of abortion procedures and said enforcement of the section will force them to shut down. Judge bars Alabama from enforcing provision in abortion law .","Alabama legislators pass 4 restrictive abortions bills; none are state law -- yet .

"(CNN) -- How big a threat do foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq pose to the West? It's a question that has been much on the mind of policymakers and commentators, especially since U.S. President Barack Obama announced the United States was ramping up its military role in the region. Will such fighters return with dangerous new skills and experience that they are determined to use against their home country? Or is the potential threat by these fighters overhyped? The answer depends on what the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria decides to do with them. So far, jihadi groups in Syria have not been sending foreign fighters on attack missions in the West in any sort of systematic way. But if the group decides to ""weaponize"" its fighters, we will have a much bigger problem on our hands. Since 2011, around 3,000 Western Muslims have gone to Syria, where many have joined the most radical elements of the insurgency. And there is no question that some of these individuals will pose a terrorist threat when they return. We know this because it has already happened -- Syria veterans are suspected of involvement in one successful and at least six unsuccessful alleged attacks in Europe and Australia over the past year. Yet there is no reason to expect all -- or even a majority -- of these people to try to attack us in the future. During my research, I have found that of all Western Muslims who joined conflict zones before 2011, no more than one in nine moved on to terrorism in the West. In fact, this estimate is probably at the high end -- the real historical average may be closer to one in 15 or 20. This suggests that the more helpful question is therefore not whether the foreign fighters in Syria are a threat, but what proportion of them will be. Can we not simply assume that somewhere between one in nine or one in 20 of the fighters in Syria will become terrorists, and try to plan accordingly? Unfortunately, it's not that simple because the ""blowback rate"" -- the proportion of outgoing fighters who later return to attack -- varies significantly between destinations. Take the conflict in Somalia, for example, which attracted hundreds of Western foreign fighters in the previous decade, but produced few attacking returnees. In contrast, of those who went to Afghanistan and Pakistan in the same period, a substantial proportion plotted attacks on their return. So, how can we determine whether Syria will produce foreign fighters that are more like Somalia or more like Afghanistan and Pakistan in terms of blowback? It largely depends on whether you have a group in the theater of conflict that strategically targets the West. For example, the Afghanistan-Pakistan area has a high blowback rate because it is home to the so-called al Qaeda Central, a group whose sole preoccupation is to mount attacks in the West. Al Qaeda excelled at taking foreign fighters who had come to fight with the Taliban and persuading them to undertake attacks in Europe or the United States instead. Most other jihadi groups, even al Qaeda's own affiliates, are not equally invested in this strategy. True, they all spout anti-American rhetoric and may even dabble in anti-Western extremist actions. But they invest the bulk of their resources in local operations. And so far, that has been true of ISIS, too. Of course, if you look for anti-Western statements and links to potential international plots, you will find them. But these indications actually make up a small proportion of the group's overall ideological production and military operations. The fact is that there is little to suggest that ISIS has had a sustained and centrally directed global operations program. This is one of the reasons why the blowback rate from Syria has so far been low, several plots notwithstanding. Six plots involving a total of, say, 10 or 20 Syria veterans make for a blowback rate of one in 150 or one in 300. Yes, it is still early in the conflict, and several plots may have gone unreported. But Syria is still looking like a low blowback foreign fighter destination. There is, however, the question of whether Western intervention in Iraq and Syria will cause ISIS to go global. Certainly, the group has taken a more anti-Western posture over the past few months. It has repeatedly threatened to attack the United States, and it has beheaded American hostages in Syria. In a noteworthy statement, for example, ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani recently called on supporters worldwide to attack members of the coalition in any way possible. So we should not be surprised if ISIS embarks on a limited but sustained external operations effort, along the lines of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, which combines a primarily local agenda with a small global side operation. Ultimately, though, ISIS is unlikely to go all in on global operations the way al Qaeda Central has. The organization is not designed for that, and such a strategy is not compatible with its state-building ambitions. Besides, ISIS' threats have so far differed in tone from those of al Qaeda Central. Where the latter says, in effect, that ""we're coming at you regardless,"" ISIS has basically been saying, ""We'll come at you if you attack us."" It's a somewhat more reluctant declaration of war. None of this is to suggest that some foreign fighters in Syria won't come back and do bad things regardless of what ISIS' leaders choose to do -- they undoubtedly will. And it is also important to remember one more thing, namely that although the early signs suggest that the threat from foreign fighters returning is low, the potential for attacks is still there. Indeed, if ISIS starts to ""weaponize"" its Western recruits in a strategic way, then the foreign fighter threat will take on a more significant -- and more deadly -- complexion than it has so far.","Likelihood of foreign fighters planning attacks in West varies by where they were, writer says .
ISIS less interested in planning attacks overseas than al Qaeda, Thomas Hegghammer says .
ISIS is unlikely to go all in on global operations the way al Qaeda has, he says ."
"(CNN) -- A Florida woman is recovering after being attacked by a bear who ambled into her open garage and sifted through her garbage cans in search of food, sheriff's deputies said Sunday. The woman said as many as five bears ""of various sizes"" were rooting through her trash when she walked into the garage, Seminole County Sheriff's Lt. Pete Brenenstuhl said. A black bear ""dragged her from inside the garage out into her driveway,"" leaving her with scrapes and cuts to her face and legs, Brenenstuhl said. The woman escaped and ran back into her home, where her husband called 911, he said. She was taken to a nearby hospital for treatment. Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Greg Workman said initial reports that several bears had attacked the woman were wrong. ""There were several bears observed near the area, but one bear is responsible for her injuries."" Lt. Jeff Hudson said the woman had an ""encounter with a black bear"" but could not confirm the reports of multiple bears being involved in the incident. The Saturday night encounter came the same day Florida wildlife officials warned that black bears and their cubs have started moving around in search of food after winter. The agency urges residents to use bear-resistant trash cans to prevent incidents like the one on Saturday night. ""Now is the time to expect bears to show up looking for food,"" Dave Telesco, the head of the wildlife commission's bear management program, said in Saturday's advisory.

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- A Sunni town north of Baghdad that has been surrounded by ISIS for more than two months came under heavy attack on Monday, local police and residents said. At about 9 a.m., a suicide bomber in a seized military Humvee struck a dirt berm that was built as part of the defenses around the southern part of Dhuluiya. The bombing cleared the way for a second suicide bomber in another Humvee to drive into the center of the town and strike the market area. At least nine people were killed and more than 70 others were wounded in the two bombings. . Shaalan al-Jibouri, a resident of Dhuluiya and a local journalist, explained the situation to CNN from inside the town. He said ISIS seized the town in June, but on June 18, the al-Jibour tribe, along with the local police, pushed ISIS out of the southern part of the town and took control of the area, while ISIS remained in control of the northern part. Since June, al-Jibouri said, the southern part of Dhuluiya has been besieged and under constant attack by ISIS. Local officials have counted 72 attacks, including hundreds of mortar and artillery shell strikes. The attack on Monday, he said, was the worst since the ISIS offensive began. On July 16, he said, ISIS blew up a vital bridge connecting Dhuluiya to the predominantly Shiite town of Balad about 10 kilometers (6 miles) to the west. Al-Jibouri said the bridge was a lifeline for the town and even though Balad is a Shiite town, its local officials and residents have supported and assisted residents of Dhuluiya throughout the siege. He described a dire humanitarian situation in the part of Dhuluiya that has no medical care and having to move people to Balad for treatment there. The destruction of the bridge has forced them to use small boats to move the injured and get supplies, which has been very difficult, he said. Al-Jibouri said the people of his town and its police force are determined to continue the fight, with women and young boys taking up arms to defend their home. ""We lived through a bitter experience in 2006 under these people. They did not distinguish between security forces and civilians. They massacred people then and they will do it again. ... We will not allow them to enter the town. Dhuluiya will continue its resistance until the last breath, over our dead bodies will they enter this town."" Al-Jibouri's wife and 16-year-old daughter were wounded when an artillery shell hit close to their home last week. He said local officials have repeatedly asked for government support but have received only ""empty promises."" ""In the name of humanity we call on President Obama, who says they are the protectors of humanity -- where are your planes, your missiles?"" ""Why this terrorism, why are our children being killed, our homes destroyed? We call on the American people to pressure their government to help us."" A number of people in the room with him also said they want the United States to help them, saying even if it's American troops, ""we welcome them."" They accused the Iraqi government of a double standard, apparently a reference to the fact that about a week ago, Iraqi troops broke the ISIS siege in the town of Amerli, which is predominantly Shiite.","Town was taken over by ISIS in June, but police and local tribe regained control of part of it .

"(CNN) -- Russia's policies on foreign adoptions made headlines when the government announced it would no longer allow Americans to adopt Russian children. But hidden away in Russian orphanages are thousands of children with disabilities who aren't orphans, whose harmful treatment has long been hidden from public view -- even from most Russians. When I visited a Russian orphanage last year as part of a human rights investigation, a volunteer led me to a crib where a boy under 3 feet tall, wearing a diaper, smiled at us. ""This is Roman,"" she said. ""He's 18 years old. He has Down syndrome."" Roman reached for me to pick him up and I felt his protruding ribs. I could hardly believe he was 18. Yet the birthdates labeling the cribs of other equally frail and undersized children revealed that most were also teenagers with conditions including Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, and blindness. In fact, well over 165,000 children live in Russia's state orphanages for children with disabilities, comprising nearly 50% of the country's orphanage population. A 2012 report by an international children's advocacy organization noted that of 10 countries surveyed, Russia had the highest rate of children living in institutional care. The vast majority of children with disabilities living in Russian state orphanages have living parents, but many children are there after doctors gave parents dire assessments of their child's prospects for development. State orphanages are typically geographically isolated, and children living there are often cut off from their families and communities and from the variety of experiences available to other children, such as attending school. It is also often difficult for anyone not living or formally employed in these institutions to visit -- even children's parents. I spoke with parents of institutionalized children with disabilities who told me that staff discouraged them from regularly visiting their children or taking children home for weekend visits, on the basis that too much attention would ""spoil"" children and make it difficult for them to readjust to institutional routines. I visited 10 orphanages across Russia, gaining access to those few institutions where staff were willing to let me in. I spoke with children and activists who are fighting to protect their rights, and I learned that life in institutions, and the neglect, isolation and even violence it can entail, are what rob children of potential. In most orphanages I visited, staff relegated children they deemed to be ""too disabled to learn,"" to separate wards where they lay in cribs with little attention except to change their diapers or adjust their feeding tubes. Members of staff used rags to tie many children's heads, limbs and torsos to their cribs or other furniture, or sedated children to prevent them from trying to leave their rooms or from knocking their heads against crib railings. Orphanage staff told me many children forgot how to walk after months of being tied up or confined. It is tempting to attribute these children's conditions to lack of material resources, yet that was not the issue. I saw playrooms with new dolls, books and games arranged out of children's reach. I saw wheelchairs stacked in hallways, while children who could have been on the playground lay in their cribs. One activist told me that the majority of children with disabilities in Russian orphanages receive little or no education. Due to such a lack of attention, education, health care and adequate nutrition, children's disabilities grow more pronounced, or children develop new impairments. Psychologists and other child development specialists agree that life in institutions contributes to physical underdevelopment, stunted intellectual development, and difficulties forming stable relationships. Violence that children may experience in institutions can lead to severe developmental delays, additional disabilities, and irreversible psychological harm. The reality is that the sooner children are moved out of orphanages and into families, the better their chances of making up for lost time. I met many Russian children with disabilities whose birth, foster, or adoptive parents raised them to be active, happy children, despite the gloomy predictions of doctors and adoption officials. School-age children who could neither walk nor talk learned to do so after loving parents adopted them or took them home and marshaled resources for them to study and receive health care. Russia's international human rights obligations include ensuring that children are not separated from their parents against their will, and protecting children from all forms of violence and neglect. The government has taken steps in this direction, including a strategy outlining plans to reduce the use of institutional care and curb child abandonment during 2012-2017. But this and other federal policies lack clear plans for implementation. As I undertook my research, I met social workers, psychologists and disability rights experts who tell parents of newborns with disabilities about positive examples of families who have raised children with disabilities. I visited organizations that provide these families with services such as parents' support groups. And I met activists who shepherd prospective Russian foster and adoptive parents through bureaucratic red tape so they can take children home. So many of the children I saw would be better served if the government focused on maintaining a network of support services to keep children with their families and in their communities, rather than rely on what is currently an abusive orphanage system. There is a network of caring people already. What it needs is government support and the will to make this happen.","Andrea Mazzarino: Many nonorphan kids with disabilities in Russian orphanages .

"(CNN) -- The scandal over allegations that Secret Service agents brought prostitutes to their hotel rooms in Colombia ahead of a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama keeps growing. And with it come awkward questions about whether a strong macho element in the culture of the U.S. Secret Service could pose a threat to security, and how women agents fit into the picture. Journalist and commentator Kiri Blakeley asked in a blog post Tuesday why there are not more female Secret Service agents to counter this kind of bad behavior. ""The reason there should be more is simple: Women don't get into trouble the way men do,"" she wrote. ""Seriously, can you imagine a bunch of Secret Service gals going on a trip to Colombia, where they are scheduled to secure the environment for their boss, who happens to be, oh, the most powerful man in the world, and then hiring a bunch of call guys?"" she asks. The identities of the 11 Secret Service agents implicated in the investigation have not been disclosed, nor have those of as many as 10 U.S. military personnel also suspected of involvement. But it is widely assumed they are all men. Three agents involved in scandal leave Secret Service . However, Jeffrey Robinson, who wrote ""Standing Next to History: An Agent's Life Inside the Secret Service,"" with former senior special agent Joseph Petro, said the incident in Colombia should not cast doubts on the professionalism of Secret Service agents as a whole, whatever their gender. ""They are to a man -- and woman -- so extremely proud, and share that pride and esprit de corps, like the Marines. And when a bunch of idiots pull a stunt like this, these men and women are insulted and infuriated by it,"" he said. ""But at no point was the president under threat and it never could have led to that."" Robinson puts the Colombia incident down to ""alcohol, mixed with testosterone and a dash of hubris, and that's a nasty combination,"" but points out that bad behavior by groups of men away from home is not a rarity. ""But they are idiots, they know what they are supposed to do and how they are supposed to behave,"" he added of the agents allegedly involved, some of whom are reportedly married. How many female Secret Service agents were among several hundred U.S. personnel sent to Colombia to safeguard Obama during a summit in Cartagena is not known. But Robinson says women -- who made up about a quarter of the Secret Service's 6,913 employees in 2010, according to an Equal Opportunity Employment Commission report -- are an integral part of the Secret Service. This is because women have to be able to do everything the male agents do, including expert firearms use, and are deployed in just the same way to protect the president, he said. ""They really can shoot that weapon -- and when Secret Service fire, they don't miss,"" he said. Women are also better suited than their male counterparts to do some things, Robinson said, such as accompanying the first lady if she makes a restroom stop. They also fit right into the presidential protective division, or PPD -- the innermost ring of steel around the president. Former Secret Service agent Petro had women on his detail when he was in charge of the PPD for President Ronald Reagan, Robinson said. ""They had to ride the big thoroughbred horses the same as the men,"" Robinson said. ""Or when they went skiing with Dan Quayle, they had to be able to ski and keep up with him while still wearing the gun and the radio. Physically, it's tough."" The Secret Service has not yet responded to a CNN request for information on how its women agents are deployed. But its annual report for fiscal year 2010 outlines the efforts made to find suitable female recruits. Those who have taken part in college sports are of particular interest, the report says, as ""the goal is to target college/university women athletes who are capable of completing the Secret Service's rigorous physical fitness training program."" Women have been part of the Secret Service for four decades. The first female Secret Service agent to die in the line of duty was Special Agent Julie Y. Cross, in 1980. Barbara Riggs, a veteran agent of the Secret Service, marked a happier milestone when she became the first woman in the agency's history to be named deputy director, in 2004. Ronald Kessler, a former Washington Post reporter and author of ""In the President's Secret Service: Behind the Scenes with Agents in the Line of Fire and the Presidents They Protect,"" says an under-representation of women is not a factor in how the Colombia scandal unfolded. ""They are involved in everything. There's not a problem with women at all. I just don't think there's any issue here at all,"" he said. And suggestions that a pervasive macho culture within the service may have fueled the agents' misconduct are also off the mark, he said. ""When women first started there was this issue, but that's a long time ago. Obviously this episode raises questions like that, but it's really not representative. The problem is that the management is lax in many ways. There's lots of corner-cutting going on."" Kessler told CNN in another interview that the image generated by the scandal of agents partying hard while on work trips also is misleading. ""They are so overworked most of the time that they are forced to go into overtime, that they barely have time for a life, let alone to party,"" he said. With internal investigations ongoing and a likely Senate Judiciary Committee hearing next week, there will be little in the way of good times coming soon for those caught up in the furor. And the spotlight shone on the Secret Service may mean it's in line for a wider shake-up. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Virginia, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, is one of those who think change is overdue -- and that Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan will have to go. ""I think it's time to put somebody else in there to make sure we're getting a different culture in the Secret Service,"" Forbes told CNN. CNN's Brian Rokus, Dana Bash and Stacia Deshishku contributed to this report.","A reported prostitution scandal in Colombia shines a spotlight on the agency's culture .

"(CNN) -- Auto-correct and ""Angry Birds."" GPS, and those awkward texts from last night. Mobile phones, and their promise of unprecedented connectivity, have altered the way we live. And it all started 40 years ago today. That's when Martin Cooper, a vice president at Motorola, stepped onto a New York City sidewalk and made the first known cellphone call in history. And, whether you thank him or blame him, we haven't stopped talking, texting and tweeting since. In the time since Cooper brandished what would become the DynaTAC phone, our mobiles have gone from now-laughably clunky bricks to sleek, stylized slivers of technology. Now they're becoming fashionably monstrous with phone-tablet hybrids like the Galaxy Note. And, along the way, they've changed everything. ""We knew that someday everybody would have a (cell) phone, but it was hard to imagine that that would happen in my lifetime,"" Cooper said to CNN last year. ""And now we've got almost five billion phones in the world. Wow."" Cooper and his team had been in a race with AT&T's Bell Labs to create a cellphone. They'd worked for about three months on the model he walked outside with on April 3, 1973. And that first call? It was to AT&T's Joel Engell, who headed up Bell Labs. ""I called and told him, 'Joel, I'm calling you from a cellular phone, a real cellular phone, a handheld, portable, real cellular phone',"" Cooper recalled. And, as he recalls it, his rival wasn't quite as talkative. ""I don't remember exactly what he said, but it was really quiet for a while,"" he said. ""My assumption was that he was grinding his teeth. He was very polite and ended the call. When asked about it, he says he has no recollection of this moment."" It would take 10 years for a version of that DynaTAC (Dynamic Adaptive Total Area Coverage) phone to hit the market, for a hefty $3,900. The kind of phone Gordon Gekko wielded in ""Wall Street,"" it weighed 2.5 pounds and was about a foot tall. Compare that to the iPhone 5, which weighs in at under 4 ounces, is less than 5 inches from top to bottom and sells at prices starting at $199. Not that Cooper, now 84, necessarily embraces every aspect of the latest advances in the field he helped create. ""I must tell you as much as we were dreamers, we never imagined that all these things could be combined into one. And I'm really not so sure that it's a great thing,"" he said. ""Phones have gotten so complicated, so hard to use, that you wonder if this is designed for real people or for engineers.""

"(Mental Floss) -- Whenever a message in a bottle is discovered on a beach or floating in the ocean, it feels like something out of a fairy tale. The idea that two people have made a connection that mathematics would say is virtually impossible gives us hope that life is more than a series of random events. Here are five stories of the almost unbelievable connections these messages have brought about. 1. A soldier to watch over them . When Josh Baker was 10 years old, he dumped an entire bottle of his mother's vanilla extract down the sink. He then wrote a quick note that said, ""My name is Josh Baker. I'm 10. If you find this, put it on the news. The date is April 16, 1995."" He stuffed the note inside the empty extract bottle and threw it into Wisconsin's White Lake. Life went on and, after high school, Josh signed up for the Marines. During his tour of duty in Iraq, he survived the dangers of fighting door-to-door in Fallujah and made it back home to the U.S. safe and sound. Tragically, shortly after his homecoming, Josh was killed in a car accident, leaving his family and friends devastated and asking the obvious question, ""Why?"" A few months later, Steve Lieder and Robert Duncan, friends of Josh's, were walking on the banks of White Lake, when they saw something glimmer on the water. After fishing it out, they realized it was a vanilla extract bottle with a piece of paper inside. To friends and family, the message from 10-year-old Josh appeared when they needed it most. It felt as though he was reaching out, letting them know that he was watching, and trying to help them move on. This message of hope is currently displayed in the Bakers' home as a constant reminder that their son is still with them, even though he's gone. 2. Love in a bottle . Ake Viking was a lonely Swedish sailor who decided to place his search for love in the hands of fate. He wrote a simple letter ""To Someone Beautiful and Far Away,"" corked it inside a bottle, and tossed it overboard in the hopes that it might help him find a young woman to marry. Two years later, in 1958, he was surprised to receive a letter from a Sicilian girl, Paolina, who said, ""I am not beautiful, but it seems so miraculous that this little bottle should have traveled so far and long to reach me that I must send you an answer..."" The two began writing one another and, three years after he threw a bottle into the sea, Ake moved to Sicily to marry his very long-distance love. Mental Floss: Six lost treasures waiting to be found . 3. A ticket to freedom . During a 1979 cruise to Hawaii, Dorothy and John Peckham passed the time by writing notes and throwing them overboard inside empty champagne bottles. They asked anyone who found one of their bottles to write them back, and even went so far as to include a $1 bill to cover the postage. On March 4, 1983, John's 70th birthday, the couple received a letter from Hoa Van Nguyen. Nguyen, a former soldier in the Vietnamese Army, said he and his younger brother had found one of the Peckhams' bottles as the two men were floating 15 kilometers from the shore of Songkhla Province in Thailand. They were braving the waters of the Pacific in a small, shallow riverboat in order to escape the Communist regime in Vietnam. When they saw the bottle, they felt as though a prayer had been answered, giving them the strength to carry on. After reading the letter, the Peckhams looked for Songkhla on a map and were shocked to find that the bottle had traveled 9,000 miles from Hawaii. The Peckhams corresponded with Hoa for years, sharing in his joy when they received a photo from his wedding, then again nine months later when they saw his newborn son. But most of all, they empathized with Hoa's desire to give his family the best life he could. So when Hoa asked if the Peckhams could help his family move to the U.S., they didn't hesitate. After months of working with U.S. Immigration, the two families finally did meet in 1985, when a plane from Thailand landed in Los Angeles -- the Nguyens' new home. 4. The right fisherman . In 1999, Steve Gowan spotted something clinging to his fishing nets. It was a very old bottle containing two letters written by Pvt. Thomas Hughes, dated September 9, 1914. The first message asked the person that found the bottle to forward the second message to Hughes' wife, Elizabeth. The note for Elizabeth was a nice, simple love letter, showing that his wife was in his thoughts as he made his way to France to fight in the early days of World War I. After reading the letters, Gowan felt a great personal responsibility to see that they found their way home, even though he assumed Mrs. Hughes had died long ago. He began searching for her descendants and soon learned that Thomas and Elizabeth Hughes' daughter was still alive in Auckland, New Zealand. Sadly, Hughes died in battle shortly after he wrote the letters, so he never got to see Elizabeth, nor his 2-year old daughter, Emily, ever again. Due to her young age at the time of his death, Emily never knew her father, though she grew up listening to stories about him from her mother and cherishing his posthumously award medals. So when The New Zealand Post offered to send Gowan to Auckland to hand-deliver the bottle to Emily, he jumped at the chance to help her connect to this lost piece of her past. For Emily, the bottle was a great source of joy and comfort. She said her father's message couldn't come home ""until the right boat came along at the right time with the right fisherman."" Mental Floss: Why bottled water has an expiration date . 5. Laura Buxton, meet Laura Buxton . (Technically this isn't a ""message in a bottle"" story, but it's the same concept -- and the story is simply too good not to mention it.) In June 2001, Laura Buxton, who was almost 10 years old, released a red balloon into the air over her hometown of Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire, England. On one side of the balloon, she had written ""Please return to Laura Buxton,"" and on the other side, her home address. A few weeks later, a man 140 miles away in Milton Lilbourne found the balloon stuck in the hedge that separated his farm from the next-door neighbors. He noticed Laura Buxton's name and address and immediately took the balloon to the neighbors' house, showing it to the 10-year-old girl who lived there ... whose name was also Laura Buxton. Laura Buxton from Milton Lilbourne wrote Laura Buxton from Stoke-on-Trent to let her know that she had found the balloon. Thinking this coincidence was simply too amazing to be true, they decided they had to meet in person. And that's when things got really weird. On the day of the meeting, the two girls wore the same outfit -- a pink sweater and jeans. The girls were the same height, which was unusual because they were both tall for their age. They both had brown hair and wore it in the same style. They both had 3-year-old black Labrador retrievers at home, as well as gray pet rabbits. They both brought their guinea pigs, which were the same color and even had the same orange markings on their hindquarters. It was almost as though these two Laura Buxtons were the same person. The strange events surrounding their meeting have helped the girls form a strong bond, and they remain friends eight years later. Both feel the circumstances that brought them together are too significant to be written off as mere coincidence. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- Echoes of the 2012 prostitution scandal in Cartagena, Colombia, lie at the root of the turmoil that has upended the Secret Service, prompting the ouster of its director in the wake of security lapses. One link to the White House, involving a former unpaid intern, the son of an Obama donor, who was investigated for possible involvement in the scandal, has caused internal complaints about the fairness of the 2012 probe. The scandal eventually led to the ouster of eight employees, and discipline against a handful of others at the Secret Service. However, in the years since, current and former employees, as well as congressional investigators, have complained that White House links to the episode weren't properly investigated, perhaps for political reasons, and that the punishment against Secret Service was too severe. How to make a President safe again . The internal dissension over Cartagena is one reason why, according to current and former employees, a series of recent security lapses prompted whistleblowers to go to Congress to report the Secret Service's incomplete accounting of security lapses that have further embarrassed the agency. In the wake of the Cartagena scandal, the White House counsel's office conducted a probe, interviewing more than a dozen staffers who worked on advance preparation for the presidential trip to Colombia, according to a person close to the probe. It also reviewed a single document purporting to show that a woman had signed her name and a room number on a hotel a piece of paper that appeared to be a sign-in sheet; the room number corresponded to the volunteer's room. The paper didn't bear a logo, or any indication of being hotel stationery or official business record, according to the person close to the probe. Richard Sauber, an attorney for the former intern, says his client ""categorically denies having a prostitute in his room and neither he nor his father contacted anyone at DHS or the [White House] to seek special treatment - the allegations are false and everyone involved knows they are false."" The White House determined that the paper, which didn't include any official logos or stationery marks, couldn't be relied on as proof of wrongdoing. The White House investigators deemed his denial credible. The Washington Post published a story Wednesday night alleging that the incident was covered up, and citing complaints from a former investigator with the Homeland Security Department's inspector general who claimed that political interference from the White House prompted changes to be made to the DHS inspector general's report on the Cartagena incident. The Post also cited multiple government officials who argue the White House investigation into the volunteer was nowhere near as extensive as the weeks long probe into the Secret Service agents and Pentagon personnel. Can the Secret Service actually change? The person close to the internal probe disputed that there was a coverup, citing multiple media accounts of the possible White House link that have been published in the past two years. An administration official said the White House's review was thorough and that purported hotel records wrongly implicated at least two people: one, the White House intern, and the other, a Secret Service employee. The White House concluded that there was no inappropriate conduct by the intern, the official said. ""We took this very seriously,"" the person close to the probe said. ""The idea that this [investigation] was done flimsily is just not true."" Complaints that Secret Service employees were treated more harshly than a White House intern overlook one fact, the person close to the probe said. The Secret Service agents implicated are armed U.S. government employees charged with protecting the life of the president and should be held to a higher standard than an unpaid White House volunteer who technically wasn't a government employee, the source argued. Despite the White House denials, inside the Secret Service, the handling of the Cartagena incident has led to dissension. Some of the Secret Service employees who were implicated were required to sign non-disclosure agreements as part of the disciplinary process, which has further aroused suspicion about the handling of the matter. According to current and former employees, low morale among some Secret Service employees is behind some of the recent lapses. And it has prompted employees to report their complaints to Congress, instead of using internal channels to report problems. Julia Pierson, the agency's director appointed to help clean up the aftermath of Cartagena, was ousted last week. Her predecessor, Mark Sullivan, under whose watch Cartagena and other lapses occurred, is now a Washington consultant. Sullivan was the subject of probes by the Justice Department's public integrity section and the Homeland Security inspector general's special investigations unit. They investigated allegations he lied to Congress when he testified that the prostitutes involved in the scandal posed no issues for U.S. intelligence agencies. Investigators determined that U.S. intelligence community had information about at least one of the women involved because of possible links to drug cartels, according to people close to the probe. The Justice Department and DHS inspector general each separately cleared Sullivan of wrongdoing. Joshua Hochberg, Sullivan's attorney, said ""Questions that arose concerning Mr. Sullivan were looked at and determined to be unfounded."" Sullivan recently was appointed to help the government come up with best practices in the aftermath of the Benghazi terrorist attacks.

"(CNN) -- In the new movie ""Interstellar,"" Earth is on the brink of becoming uninhabitable and the future of human life rests in the hands of Matthew McConaughey. Or rather, it rests in the hands of the farmer and former NASA pilot McConaughey plays in ""Interstellar,"" Christopher Nolan's latest epic that is pretty much guaranteed to be a hot topic this awards season. What's less guaranteed is whether moviegoers will take to this sci-fi adventure, which also stars Anne Hathaway as one of the four space explorers who set off through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a more hospitable planet. Director and co-writer Nolan, who has previously shown his skill with ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy and ""Inception,"" worked closely with theoretical physicist Kip Thorne to create an experience that would do for audiences what ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" once did for the director. ""One of my earliest movie memories is my dad taking me to see '2001' in (London's) Leicester Square on the big screen,"" Nolan recalled in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. ""It was such an extraordinary feeling: to be taken off this planet and to the furthest reaches of the universe. It has really been an ambition of mine: If I ever had the opportunity to get involved in a large-scale science fiction project, something about exploring our universe, I would try to seize the opportunity."" With this being a Nolan movie, the question of whether ""Interstellar"" is any good might seem to answer itself. But if you assume that there's consensus on this one, you'd be wrong: critics are having some stark disagreements on whether Nolan's $165 million effort is a success. Just how wide-ranging are the reviews? Take a look: . Will moviegoers like it? The New York Times' A.O. Scott thinks it's ""hard to imagine that (Nolan's) fans -- who represent a fairly large segment of the world's population -- will be disappointed by 'Interstellar.'"" That's because to Scott, the movie is ""a terrifically entertaining science-fiction movie, giving fresh life to scenes and situations we've seen a hundred times before,"" even if it does ""occasionally (stumble) over pompous dialogue or overly portentous music."" The New Yorker, however, predicts that only the diehard science geeks are going to be into this. ""('Interstellar') is ardently, even fervently incomprehensible, a movie designed to separate the civilians from the geeks, with the geeks apparently the target audience,"" said the magazine's David Denby. ""There's no doubting Nolan's craft ... but, overall, 'Interstellar' -- a spectacular, redundant puzzle, a hundred and sixty-seven minutes long -- makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it."" Is the story emotionally resonant? One of the big aspects to ""Interstellar"" is its focus on relationships, especially the relationship between parent and child. McConaughey's former pilot/farmer, Cooper, has two children he leaves behind in hope of finding a new place for humans to thrive; his preteen daughter, played by Mackenzie Foy, is particularly distraught over his abandonment. But that's not all: While our space explorers are off on their search, time is moving differently for them than it is on Earth. What feels like a handful of hours out in another galaxy is the equivalent of years passing for Cooper's kids -- so many years, in fact, that Jessica Chastain and Casey Affleck also star in ""Interstellar"" as the adult versions of Cooper's children. That sounds like it's tailor-made to be gut-wrenching, but critics were conflicted over the plot's emotional impact. ""It's rare that a big-budget studio movie has such cerebral aspirations and such startling strengths and weaknesses. The visual spectacle can be breathtaking, but the emotional, earth-bound saga fails to be as moving,"" said USA Today's Claudia Puig. ""The story is ever-ambitious, sometimes riveting and thought-provoking, but also plodding and hokey and not as visionary as its cutting-edge special effects. And at nearly three hours, the film would have benefited from more judicious editing."" Village Voice's Stephanie Zacharek agreed, saying in her review that ""whatever his strengths may be, Nolan lacks the human touch. ... (I)n all of Nolan's films, human connection is such a noble idea that it's beyond the grasp of flesh-and-blood people. Nothing in 'Interstellar' is ever ragged or raw or dirty (though there is, admittedly, a lot of dust)."" But then you have Variety's Scott Foundas, who thought ""Interstellar"" was ""more emotionally accessible than his coolly cerebral thrillers and Batman movies. ... like all the director's best work, (it) manages to feel handcrafted and intensely personal."" And what about that ending? The last act of ""Interstellar,"" says Slate's Dana Stevens, could be the make or break moment for moviegoers. ""How you feel about the movie may hang on your reaction to this scene -- about which I'll say only that, like the end of '2001: A Space Odyssey,' it takes place in a space that seems to exist in between the familiar world we know and some strange alternate dimension,"" Stevens said in her review. ""Going back over and over this crucial moment with a fellow critic on the train home, I could make no sense of it—where was the encounter meant to be taking place? What laws of the universe, or of human relationships, did it purport to disclose? But the sense of visual and spatial wonder this scene evoked in me lingered long after, accompanied by a begrudging respect for the Nolans' sheer commitment to their own peculiar brand of visionary hokum."" But then there's The Wrap's Alonso Duralde, who thought that ending could very well be the curse of the whole film. To Duralde, the third act is an exercise in ""staggering wrongheadedness,"" an ending that ""feels like a betrayal because so much of what comes before it manages to be truly stunning."" So should you see it? If you can afford an IMAX ticket, enjoy space-based drama and can handle disappointment, we say give it a whirl. But before you go, there is one thing you should know about that everyone seemed to agree on: the score, from Hans Zimmer, is really, really loud. You've been warned.","Critical reaction to Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" is all over the map .

"(CNN) -- Across America, middle-class families are wondering how they'll send their kids to college, pay their mortgages and still manage to save enough for retirement. Women across America face an uphill climb in the workplace, as they continue to earn less than men. We still sit in traffic on congested roads built decades ago, and then drive on run-down roads and crumbling bridges. These are among the problems our elected leaders are expected to address. These are the issues voters want us to focus on. But those are not the issues that the American people will remember as the priorities of John Boehner and the 113th Congress. Instead, House Republicans have been focused on anything but strengthening the middle class. Under Boehner as speaker, they have hopscotched from issue to issue, not to govern, but in the hopes of finding the silver bullet to motivate their base to elect them -- because they know that they will lose on one crucial issue: the economy. Boehner and leading Republicans have said over and over that this election is about: the IRS, the Affordable Care Act, Benghazi, immigration -- and the list goes on. The headlines alone tell the story: . • 11/18/13: Obamacare Mess Defines GOP 2014 Campaign Strategy (The Fiscal Times) • 1/31/14: Republicans turn up IRS rhetoric as elections loom (Politico) • 3/21/14: Republicans Double Down on Obamacare for 2014 (Time) • 5/08/14: House GOP pursue Benghazi inquiry going into midterm campaigns (PBS) • 5/27/14: House Vote on Former I.R.S Official Signals Element of GOP Election Strategy (New York Times) • 8/24/14: Republicans Shift Focus To Immigration As Leading Election Issue (Huffington Post) • 9/23/14: Republicans think the Islamic State is their winning issue (Washington Post) But there is one constant that the American will remember about the 113th Congress: John Boehner and the tea party shut down our government. That shutdown, a year ago this week, eventually cost our economy $24 billion and hurt millions of people across the country. And while Americans were sent home from work, were denied health care treatment, and, in the case of veterans, had their benefits delayed, Republican members of Congress kept getting paid on time and didn't even need to take a break from going to the taxpayer-funded congressional gym. Across the country, Americans have already started casting votes for the 114th Congress. Those voters now have the chance to decide whether they support candidates who put special interests ahead of working moms. They can decide whether they want leaders who think women should be able to make their own choices about their health care. Voters will be casting their ballots knowing which candidate will have their back and which one will have the back of special interests. And they will remember the standout moment from this Congress: that House Republicans, who could not work together with other lawmakers on solutions, went for a shutdown instead. In the 114th Congress, House Democrats will continue our focus on the Middle Class Jumpstart agenda, a plan built on the pillars of investing in infrastructure, making college more affordable and ensuring equal pay for equal work. Ask a Democrat what this election is about. He or she will tell you it's about strengthening the economy for America's middle class -- exactly what voters want.","Steve Israel: Middle class worries about money, equal pay, crumbling infrastructure .

"(CNN) -- California Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Sunday a bill that prohibits most teenagers from getting bronzed in tanning beds, making the Golden State the first to do so. State Sen. Ted Lieu said he first tried, and failed, in 2007 to make it illegal for people between the ages of 14 and 18 to walk into a facility and use ultraviolet beds to tan. Four years later, his effort finally paid off. ""I feel great,"" Lieu told CNN of the bill's passage. ""I believe it will help save lives and prevent unnecessary suffering."" Previously, those between 14 and 18 could use tanning beds if they had a parent or legal guardian's permission. That is no longer allowed, though the use of ""a phototherapy device ... used by or under the direct supervision of a qualified physician or surgeon"" and certain services offered at tanning facilities, like spray tans, are still legal for young people. While most states regulate how minors can use tanning facilities, California's recently enacted restrictions go further than any other state, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Some counties also address the issue, with the same organization noting that Howard County, Maryland, was the first jurisdiction to ban indoor tanning for all under age 18. Governments in other countries have taken similar actions, with Brazil banning tanning beds altogether. Such steps come after the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organization, in 2009 classified ""UV-emitting tanning devices as 'carcinogenic to humans.'"" The determination was made after reviews of more than 20 epidemiological studies found that one's skin cancer risk increases 75% when a person starts using a tanning device before they turn 30, the agency noted on its website. Lieu explained that excessive tanning at an early age can be especially perilous because tanning and its negative effects are ""cumulative."" But he said that one concern is how tanning salons market such services. ""They often say come in (and get) the package deal, where you can tan a lot over a (relatively) short period of time and do intense damage,"" said the Democrat from Torrance. Still, he said that at least in some circles -- including the MTV reality show ""Jersey Shore,"" where ""gym, tanning and laundry"" is a way of life -- he believes the message about the danger of tanning beds may be getting through. ""I know that Snooki on the 'Jersey Shore' has changed to spray tanning,"" Lieu said. ""Spray tanning has no known harmful effects, and you can get tans from lotions or cream. There are safe ways to get that brown look.""","California's governor signs a law barring those ages 14-18 from using tanning beds .

"Portland, Maine (CNN) -- When President Barack Obama visited Maine on Thursday, he didn't come within 300 miles of the nurse protesting her state-mandated Ebola quarantine. But he has inserted himself in the middle of a growing debate between the federal government and states over their rules for health workers returning from the Ebola zone. Kaci Hickox, the Doctors Without Borders worker hailed by the White House as a hero for treating Ebola patients in Liberia, on Thursday defied the demands the Maine's Republican governor to remain inside her home near the Quebec border. She was spotted leaving her house by bike, trailed by a state trooper. Obama, who traveled to Portland on Thursday for a campaign rally, has sought to tamp down on fears of recently-returned health workers, inviting a group of them to the White House Wednesday and hailing their mission as essential. ""When they come home, they deserve to be treated properly,"" he said in the East Room on Wednesday, flanked by doctors still within the 21-day incubation period. ""They deserve to be treated like the heroes that they are."" Rules implemented this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention require closer monitoring of health workers returning from West Africa, but stop short of requiring any type of quarantine. Many states have gone further, insisting nurses and doctors remain isolated for three weeks. The White House has questioned those state laws, saying the rules are too strict and not guided by the science of Ebola. The virus is spread through bodily fluids and patients aren't considered contagious until they're showing symptoms of the disease. ""When I hear people talking about American leadership and then are promoting policies that would avoid leadership and have us running in the opposite direction and hiding under the covers, it makes me a little frustrated,"" Obama said on Wednesday. Hickox was initially quarantined inside a tent in Newark before being allowed to leave for her home in Maine, where Gov. Paul LePage said he'd require her to remain inside her home for 21 days. Hickox said the state rules amount to a restriction on her civil rights and has threatened a legal battle over the mandated isolation. LePage, an Republican whose past off-color remarks have garnered national headlines, sent state troopers to Hickox's Fort Kent home to enforce the quarantine. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said only that Obama believed state policies ""should be guided by science,"" but wouldn't go to say whether Obama believed Maine's rules lived up to that tenet. A five-hour drive south from the unfolding legal machinations, Democrats welcomed Obama for a political rally supporting LePage's opponent Mike Michaud, who scored a boost to his chances on Wednesday when the state's independent Sen. Angus King lent his backing. Michaud, a six-term congressman, is locked in a dead heat with LePage. Like past races in Maine, an independent is also in the mix, though Eliot Cutler is running well behind the two main party candidates. Maine's gubernatorial contest is one of only a handful of stops Obama will make on the campaign trail this year; his record low approval ratings and controversial policies have made him unwelcome in key Senate battles. Thursday Obama hit Republicans as full of bad ideas, and resistant to measures he said could help improve the lives of middle class Americans, like boosting the minimum wage and insisting on equal pay for women. The objective in Maine, according to University of New England political science professor Brian Duff, is to get Democrats to just ""act like Democrats"" -- that is, vote for Michaud over the trailing independent. ""There is a sense that voters just need a final push to come back into the fold,"" Duff said.

"(CNN) -- A handful of individuals ran a scheme of ""fraudulent lending and embezzlement"" to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars of ordinary people's savings out of Kabul Bank, a key Afghan lender that ran into trouble in 2010, an independent report says. The report, released Wednesday, catalogs the alleged wrongdoing at the bank and the apparent failure of authorities to tackle the problems before they reached a crisis point or effectively respond to and investigate the financial catastrophe that unfolded. Read more: Billions in cash smuggled out of Afghanistan every year . The scandal that engulfed Kabul Bank has severely damaged the reputation of the Western approach to banking that it embodied in Afghanistan, one of the least developed countries in the world. And its cost will be born by an Afghan government that still relies on funding from the United States and other countries. The bank was meant to provide a transparent way for Afghan government employees -- soldiers, teachers and police officers -- to receive and retain their salaries without the age-old fear of corrupt superiors confiscating the money. Opinion: Islam key to Afghan Dream . Instead, the crisis at the bank, which went into receivership last year, ""led to a loss of confidence in an already fragile financial system,"" according to the report by the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee. The committee, made up of three Afghan citizens and three overseas members, states that it is ""wholly independent from the Afghanistan government and the international community."" It is led by Drago Kos, a Slovenian who has headed a number of international anti-corruption organizations. Although the sums of money involved are small compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars spent on the war in Afghanistan by the United States and its allies, Kos on Wednesday underlined the significance of the bank to the small, underdeveloped Afghan economy.

""At the time the crisis happened, Kabul Bank had 44% of the assets of this country,"" he said at a news conference presenting the committee's report in Kabul. ""More than 1 million people had deposited their money in this bank."" The alleged fraud -- which has been linked to people with ties to the government of President Hamid Karzai, including one of his brothers -- led to Kabul Bank being deprived of more than $850 million, mainly from customer deposits, according to the report. ""Most of this money,"" the report says, ""has been redirected for the benefit of a few individuals who perpetrated and participated in a fraud with reckless disregard for the country and the people of Afghanistan."" Read more: In Afghanistan, a mother bravely campaigns for president . Many of those who have been accused of participating and even profiting from the bank's difficulties have denied any wrongdoing. The committee report, which says it ""cannot make criminal findings or assign liability,"" doesn't name people specifically, but identities can be deduced from it. A spokesman for the Afghan president wasn't immediately available for comment on the report Wednesday. Read more: Why ordinary Afghans worry about NATO summit . His brother who has been linked to the bank's problems, Mahmood Karzai, said he repaid the $4.2 million he borrowed from the bank with interest. ""When they say I am a beneficiary of this money, is there something else?"" he said by telephone. ""I do not understand the accusation. This Kabul Bank issue is completely political. Management was full of improprieties and fraud."" He said he had alerted the government to problems at the bank. The report details the complex system through which it says the individuals -- ""controlling shareholders, key supervisors and managers"" of Kabul Bank -- drew the cash out of the lender. Read more: 5 ways to help fix Afghanistan . Methods cited include loan accounts for proxy borrowers, forged documents, fake business stamps and cash ferried on the planes of an airline owned by shareholders related to the bank. ""Repayment of loans was rare,"" the report said, ""and most often new loans were created to provide the appearance of repayment."" As a result, more than 92% of the bank's loan book, or $861 million, ended up being for the benefit of 19 related individuals and businesses that ultimately benefited just 12 individuals, the report said. That left the remaining $74 million for ""legitimate customers."" The bank was operating in a ""regulatory vacuum,"" the reports authors said, with the Afghan central bank lacking manpower and expertise in fraud detection. Even when warning signs were detected in Kabul Bank's activities, ""several efforts to take enforcement action against the bank were met with interference and were not implemented,"" the report said. The problems at the bank became public in 2010. The removal of the chairman and chief executive in August prompted panic, including a run on the bank and unrest in the streets. ""Kabul Bank had become a national crisis and the Afghan economy was brought to the brink of collapse,"" the report says. The government was forced to guarantee all deposits. That, combined with the closure of the bank during an Islamic holiday, averted a wider catastrophe. The bank was put into conservatorship, and shareholder rights were suspended. Kos said Wednesday that rescuing the bank will cost Afghanistan and its people 5% to 6% of gross domestic product. Efforts to reclaim the hundreds of millions of missing dollars and bring those responsible to justice have proved problematic. As of the end of August, $128.3 million in cash had been recovered. Nearly 40% of that came from normal customers, the report says, even though they represented only 8% of the loan balance of the bank when it went into receivership. Kos and the other authors also criticized Afghan authorities' efforts to investigate and prosecute the case. ""There has been clear and direct interference with the criminal process by high-ranking officials that goes so far as to identify who should, and who should not, be indicted for criminal conduct,"" it said. ""The lack of action from the Attorney General's Office also because of political influence has resulted in a lack of investigation, procedural delays that have allowed perpetrators to escape and likely for money derived from Kabul Bank to be lost forever,"" the report says. The Attorney General's Office didn't respond to calls seeking comment Wednesday. The report's authors also appear to be unimpressed with the actions of a special tribunal set up to deal with the case of Kabul Bank. ""The tribunal appears to have been engaged in everything else except the processing of the one case they have before it, contrary to the most basic principles and laws related to fundamental justice,"" the report says. ""Even the recent criminal proceedings at the tribunal do not wholly satisfy concerns about whether justice will prevail in the Kabul Bank case."" The report concludes with a stark warning: ""If the systemic issues raised by Kabul Bank are not resolved, the viability of Afghanistan as a fully functioning democracy is lost."" CNN's Jethro Mullen reported from Hong Kong and Nick Paton Walsh from Beirut, Lebanon. CNN's Masoud Popalzai in Kabul contributed to this report.","A report details alleged wrongdoing at Kabul Bank, a key Afghan lender .

"(CNN) -- Kei Nishikori chose a timely moment to secure his first win over Andy Murray and leave the home hope facing an early exit from the ATP World Tour Finals in London. A run of 20 wins in his last 23 matches had raised hopes that Murray could challenge for the title at the end of season finale, but Japan's Nishikori has left that in severe doubt after a 6-4 6-4 victory in Group B play Sunday. Nishikori is the first Asian player to make the prestigious eight-strong tournament and could not have hoped for a better start with his first victory in four attempts against the fifth seed. Murray must now hope to beat world number two Roger Federer and Canada's Milos Raonic in his final two group matches to progress to the knockout stage in London as he admitted. ""It's harder to qualify when you lose your first match. That's pretty obvious,"" Murray said. ""I need to win my next two matches more than likely, and win them well if I want to go through. ""That's going to be tricky because Milos (Raonic) played fantastic last week in Paris, and Roger always plays well at this event."" The enormity of his task was underlined later Sunday as Federer swept aside Raonic to begin is quest for a seventh title at the end of season showpiece. Federer swept through the first set 6-1, but was at least taken to a tiebreak in the second set by his outclassed opponent. That proved a mere formality as the second seed took it without dropping a point to wrap up victory in just under an hour and a half. Nishikori, beaten by Marin Cilic in the U.S. Open final, overcame early nerves at the 02 Arena as he fell an early break behind to Murray. He broke back in the sixth game and made further inroads on a shaky Murray service to take the opener. Fourth seed Nishikori pulled 4-1 ahead in the second set before Murray showed his fighting spirit by breaking back to level at 4-4. The comeback proved short lived as Nishikori held his service and then broke Murray to 30 to wrap up victory in one hour 36 minutes. ""Maybe in the beginning I was a little bit tight, but I started feeling better and the second set was almost perfect,"" Nishikori said. ""I knew I had to be more aggressive than usual and that's how I won. It's my goal to go to the semifinal and final."" Group A, featuring world number one Novak Djokovic gets underway Monday with the Serb playing Cilic and Australian Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka facing Tomas Berdych. In other tennis action Sunday, Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova sealed a third Fed Cup win in four years for the Czech Republic by clinching victory over Germany in Prague. Kvitova beat Angelique Kerber in a three-set marathon 7-6 (7/5) 4-6 6-4 in a shade under three hours to give the Czechs an unbeatable 3-0 lead. World number four Kvitova and Lucie Safarova had set the scene Saturday with singles wins over Andrea Petkovic and Kerber respectively. Germany's Julia Goerges and Sabine Lisicki beat Czech pair of Andrea Hlavackova and Lucie Hradecka 6-4 6-3 in the ""dead"" doubles rubber to leave the final score at 3-1 in the home side's favor.","Kei Nishikori beats home hope Andy Murray in ATP World Tour Finals .

"(CNN) -- Being a world leader doesn't necessarily mean being a fashion leader. It also doesn't make you immune to that awkward part of the international travel deal -- occasionally giving in to the demands of your local hosts and doing something you wouldn't normally do, all in the name of cross-cultural comity. Taken each year (with some exemptions) in the traditional or often jazzed-up garb of the host country, the famed Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC) ""family photo"" (it's also been called the ""silly shirts"" photo) dates to the first APEC summit held near Seattle in 1993. To foster a sense of informal exchange, participants at that summit were asked not to wear ties. At the same meeting, then U.S. President Bill Clinton presented bomber jackets to participants. (Very cool move.) Since then it's been all on -- and all in -- with everything from South American ponchos to Vietnamese ao dai. Like group tour t-shirts and other travel-inspired clothing purchases, these may look OK at the time and generate a sense of unity. But they later run the risk of mixing with mothballs at the back of the closet and only seeing the light of day, or night, during a bout of nostalgia or for a themed party. Perhaps inspired by Japan in 2010 deciding to buck short tradition, the APEC group dress code has been shelved in recent years. But at last year's APEC summit, on the sun-kissed Indonesian island of Bali, it was back on - leaders looked reasonably resplendent in Balinese-designed shirts. On Monday, this year's host China continued the custom. Leaders donned high-collared, ""Mao-style"" jackets in shades of burgundy, teal and brown to attend a gala dinner at in Beijing. But as the photos spread around the world, many thought they were attending a Star Trek convention rather than a state banquet, with the outfits resembling those sported by Spock or Captain Kirk. Host Chinese President Xi Jinping worked his silky tunic but the awkward expressions of U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin suggested many guests wished they could be transported away from the pomp and protocol by using the hit show's immortal catchphrase: ""Beam me up, Scotty.""

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- Israeli police shot and killed a Palestinian man who attacked police officers with a knife in a village in northern Israel early Saturday, an Israeli police spokeswoman said, amid simmering tensions in the region. Police had gone to arrest a man suspected of throwing a Molotov cocktail in Kafr Kana when they were attacked by the 22-year-old Palestinian man carrying a knife, spokeswoman Luba Samri said in a statement. The officers fired in the air ""but after facing undeterred danger, the police fired at young man,"" the statement said. He later died of his injuries in the hospital. Local officials gave a conflicting version of events, however. And a locally circulated flier denouncing the killing, which named the man as Khair Hamdan, suggested his crime was being an Arab. A mobile phone recording of CCTV footage obtained by CNN appears to show a young man running toward a vehicle, causing it to stop. He then appears to hit one of the front windows three times with his right hand but it's unclear if he is holding anything. When the door behind starts to open he lunges toward that too, causing it to close again. The young man then backs away and a man armed with a handgun gets out of the vehicle and appears to fire at the attacker as he turns away. The young man falls to the ground. More men get out and the attacker is pulled along the ground and lifted into the vehicle, which then drives away. The entire scene plays out in little over a minute. Village official: 'Racist' act . Samri said the incident was being investigated and that extra police officers would be sent to the area. About 50 young men gathered and burned tires on Saturday morning at another entrance to Kafr Kana, she said, but they were dispersed by police and the situation calmed down. Mujahed Awawdeh, head of the Kafr Kana local council, told CNN that Hamdan had approached the police vehicle and started knocking on the passenger side window after another resident of the village was arrested shortly after midnight. ""Moments later you can see in the video the police exited the vehicle and shot the man point blank in cold blood,"" he said, describing it as a ""racist"" act against an Israeli Arab. Nahi Said, a member of the local council, said the video did not show a knife and accused the police of ""flexing their muscles on a community that is not armed."" He said the arrested man was Hamdan's cousin. Kafr Kana's central council committee said a demonstration would be held Saturday afternoon to show people's anger at Hamdan's killing by Israeli police. Contested holy site . The incident comes amid heightened tensions which erupted into clashes Friday between stone-throwing Palestinian youths and Israeli security forces in East Jerusalem. Palestinian medics said at least 30 youths were injured. Earlier in the week, there were two hit-and-run attacks by drivers in Jerusalem, one against three soldiers and the other against pedestrians at a rail station in eastern Jerusalem. A second person who was hit at the train station died Friday. Another 12 people were injured and an Israeli border police officer died in the attack Wednesday. The driver of the van involved was shot to death by police. The violence comes against a backdrop of days of unrest over the Temple Mount, or Haram al-Sharif. Israeli police on Wednesday clashed with Palestinian youths at the holy site, leaving more than 15 people injured, according to paramedics with the Red Crescent. It was just the latest round of unrest there since activist Rabbi Yehuda Glick was shot and gravely wounded on October 29 after championing more Jewish rights at the site, where Jews can now gather but not pray. Israeli police shot and killed a suspect in Glick's shooting. CNN's Kareem Khadder reported from Jerusalem and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London.","Israeli police say they shot a Palestinian man who threatened them with a knife .

"(CNN) -- Seven men were executed by beheading Wednesday in Saudi Arabia for stealing, according to SPA, the official Saudi New agency. The deaths came a day after the United Nations called for the kingdom not to carry out the punishment, in part because the men had allegedly not been given fair trials. The U.N. said the men were reportedly accused of organizing a criminal group, armed robbery, raiding and breaking into jewelry stores in 2005. The U.N. special rapporteur on torture, Juan E. Mendez, said there are also grave concerns that the men were tortured during detention and forced to sign confessions. ""This is not the only in breach of Saudi Arabia's international obligations under international law, which imposes an outright prohibition on torture, it is also in breach of the government's international obligation under the Convention against Torture that explicitly forbids the use of all forms of torture for the purpose of extracting confessions or acquiring information,"" he said. SPA issued a statement on behalf of the Ministry of Interior that starts with a Quranic verse from the chapter ""The Table Spread."" ""The punishment of those who wage war against God and His Messenger, and strive with might and main for mischief through the land is: execution, or crucifixion, or the cutting off of hands and feet from opposite sides, or exile from the land: that is their disgrace in this world, and a heavy punishment is theirs in the Hereafter.""

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- An Indian court Saturday convicted a teenage boy for his part in the gang rape last December of a medical student who later died of her injuries, sentencing him to three years in prison. The sentence drew immediate protests outside the court and from the victim's family, who feel it is too lenient for a crime that shocked the city and prompted a nationwide debate over the treatment of women and the handling of sexual assaults. The teenager was convicted of murder, rape and robbery. His trial was in juvenile court because he was 17 at the time of the crime, and the three-year sentence is the maximum allowed under the court's rules. Protesters in the street outside the court raised their fists and shouted, ""We want justice!"" If the teenager was old enough to commit the crime, they said, then he is old enough to have been tried as an adult and face the death penalty. The victim's parents attended the trial and said they plan to appeal. ""We want him to be hanged,"" the victim's visibly upset mother told reporters. ""I am not at all happy with this verdict. By not punishing this teenager, this verdict is encouraging other teenagers to indulge in such acts and does not provide any safety to girls."" The teenager is the first of five suspects to be tried for their role in the attack, which happened December 16 on a moving bus in New Delhi. The group assaulted the 23-year-old woman and her male companion, robbing them and then dumping them at the side of the road, police said. While the man was eventually discharged from the hospital, the woman was so badly hurt that she had to be airlifted to a hospital in Singapore in ""extremely critical condition,"" doctors there said. She died two weeks later. The man said he and the young woman watched a movie before boarding a private bus to return to her home in a New Delhi suburb. The bus driver made lewd remarks and five other men taunted the couple and locked the doors, the man told Agence France-Press in January. ""They hit me with a small stick and dragged my friend to a seat near the driver's cabin,"" the man said. Then the ""driver and the other men raped my friend and hit her in the worst possible ways in the most private parts of her body."" The driver used an iron bar in the attack, he told the news agency. The friend said he suffered a broken leg. ""The cruelty I saw should not be seen ever. I tried to fight against the men but later I begged them again and again to leave her,"" he said. In an interview with Reuters, the man said the abductors drove the couple throughout the city for about two hours before dropping them below an overpass; he was unable to stand and had no clothes. ""Three-wheeler taxis would slow down, take a look at us and move on,"" he said. ""So would cars and motorcycles. We got no help for nearly 20 or 25 minutes."" When three police vehicles finally did show up, he said, ""they couldn't decide among themselves which police precinct has jurisdiction."" His friend bled profusely throughout the ordeal, he said. Despite the outrage over the attack, the problem of sexual violence in India persists. An American woman was raped in June after visiting a popular Hindu temple in northern India. After failing to find a taxi to take her back to her hotel, she accepted a ride from three men who took her to a wooded area, then raped and robbed her, authorities said. A 4-year-old girl died after being sexually assaulted by a 35-year-old man in Ghansaur in April, and a 5-year-old girl was allegedly raped two weeks earlier in New Delhi. Two men were arrested in that case. A Swiss woman and her husband who were on a cycling tour across the India were attacked by a group of men in March after they set up camp near a forest in the central part of the country. The men beat the husband and raped the wife, police said. Last week, a 23-year-old female photographer was allegedly gang-raped in Mumbai by five men, the police chief there said. The woman was on assignment with a male colleague when some men approached them, took them to a nearby mill under false pretenses, then tied them both up and raped her, Mumbai police commissioner Satypal Singh said. The woman was in stable condition after the attack. CNN's Sumnima Udas reported from New Delhi. Melissa Gray reported and wrote from Atlanta.","The teenager is convicted of murder, rape, and robbery .

"(CNN) -- Physical inactivity causes 1 in 10 deaths worldwide, according to a series of studies released in British medical journal The Lancet, putting it on par with the dangers of smoking and obesity. The results also suggest that public health officials treat this situation as a pandemic. Specifically, Harvard researchers say, inactivity caused an increase in deaths from coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, breast and colon cancers and caused more than 5.3 million deaths in 2008 worldwide. If physical inactivity rates were to go down by even 10% to 20% worldwide, they say, it could save between a half-million and 1.3 million lives each year. This could also raise global life expectancy by almost a year. FDA approves new diet drug . ""This summer, we will admire the breathtaking feats of athletes competing in the 2012 Olympic Games,"" wrote Dr. I-Min Lee, a Harvard researcher and the lead author of an article accompanying the series of studies. ""Although only the smallest fraction of the population will attain these heights, the overwhelming majority of us are able to be physically active at very modest levels, which bring substantial health benefits."" This series of five studies was specifically timed to be released just days before the start of the 2012 Olympics in London next week, and each of the studies focused on one specific issue related to physical inactivity and its effect on global health. Adults and children at increased risk . The first in the group of five studies suggested that one-third of adults, and close to 80% of adolescents worldwide, are at increased risk of disease as a result of physical inactivity. According to the report, some 1.5 billion adults worldwide face a 20% to 30% increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and certain cancers. Researchers also found that inactivity levels varied widely across the globe, with the lowest levels in Bangladesh (5%) and the highest levels in Malta (71%). ""In most countries, inactivity rises with age and is higher in women than in men [34% vs 28%],"" wrote Dr. Pedro C. Hallal, a professor at the Universidade Federal de Pelotas in Brazil. ""Inactivity is also increased in high-income countries."" Big baby may increase cancer risk for mom . Why are some people more active? The second study looked at why certain people and groups of people exercise while others do not. The study authors found that previous research focused on individual-level factors such as age, sex and socioeconomic status, and they were conducted primarily in high-income countries. But they suggest future research focus on middle and lower-income countries. ""Research has been heavily concentrated in a few developed countries, most of which have stable or falling rates of noncommunicable diseases, rather than in low-income countries where understanding of evidence-based strategies for increasing physical activity is poor,"" wrote Adrian Bauman, a researcher from the University of Sydney in Australia. ""Targeting factors known to cause inactivity is key to improving and designing effective interventions to increase activity levels."" Bauman and his colleagues found that health status, being male, young or wealthy tend to make people more physically active, as does family and societal support for physical activity. What works to promote physical activity . The third article in The Lancet series looked at what specific programs and types of programs work to promote physical activity. ""Because even moderate physical activity such as walking and cycling can have substantial health benefits, understanding strategies that can increase these behaviors in different regions and cultures has become a public health priority,"" wrote Gregory Heath, a researcher from the University of Tennessee and the lead author of this study. Too much TV linked with weaker kids . Heath and his team found that the use of mass-media campaigns to promote exercise, as well as signs to remind people to be active -- taking the stairs, for example -- had some effect on getting people more active. The team also found that free, public exercise events, creating an environment that was conducive to exercise (bike lanes and walking trails), and improving public transportation were more likely to improve physical activity. ""Overall, our findings showed the interventions to have consistent and significant effects on physical activity and behaviors,"" Heath wrote. ""Even though in some instances the effect sizes of these interventions were rather modest, they were large enough to translate into real population-level benefits if rolled out on a larger scale."" Using mobile phones to get people active . The fourth study found that technology, and specifically cell phone technology, could be significant in helping people get fit. ""With the high prevalence of both physical inactivity and the rapid growth of the mobile phone sector in low-income and middle-income countries, there is a potential for population-level effects that could truly affect global health,"" wrote Dr. Michael Pratt, a researcher from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers believe that with more than 4 billion text messaging users worldwide, this could be an effective way to deliver health-conscious messages, particularly in low-income countries. According to this report, Pratt and his team estimated that using Internet-based technologies could be twice as effective in middle-income countries as in high-income countries, given that 71% of the world's population lives in these countries and many have access to cell phones. ""This is a big challenge, but marked progress in countries such as Colombia and Brazil suggests that it is also an achievable challenge,"" he wrote. Inactivity should be considered a pandemic . The final report suggests that physical inactivity should be recognized as a global pandemic and should be treated like any other infectious-disease pandemic would be. ""The role of physical inactivity continues to be undervalued despite robust evidence of its protective effects,"" wrote Harold Kohl, a researcher at the University of Texas School of Public Health and lead author of this study. ""The response ... has been incomplete, unfocused and most certainly understaffed. ... The effect of this tardiness has been to put physical activity in reverse gear compared with population trends and advances in tobacco and alcohol control and diet."" Kohl called on countries -- low, middle and high-income -- to work across disciplines to fix this problem. ""Physical inactivity is an issue that crosses many sectors and will require collaboration, coordination and communication with multiple partners,"" he wrote, citing specifically city and community planners, transportation engineers, schools, parks and recreation officials and the media. He says that almost 75% of World Health Organization member countries have some sort of plan to improve physical activity, but only 55% of the plans have been put into effect and only 42% of the plans in effect are well-funded. ""Substantial improvements in the infrastructure of planning and policy, leadership and advocacy, workforce training and surveillance must be realized,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- There's a great song by Todd Snider called ""The Ballad of The Kingsmen."" In it, he sings, ""Marilyn Manson gets a lot of chicks. They're weird chicks. But they're chicks."" And it's true. Heaps of (weird) women lust for Marilyn Manson. He's a bona fide rock star. Really, that's why most guys get into playing music in the first place. To increase their sex appeal. If, say, owning a bagel shop somehow proved to be just as glamorous, right now teenagers would be boiling delicious circles of bread in their parents' garage. But that's not the case. In fact, never in the history of the world has anyone ever said, ""Make love to me, Bagel Man."" Those words. In that order. Not even once. Sorry, Bagel Man. They're just not that into you. Whereas, when it comes to truly sexy male occupations, the official list seems to top out with musician, athlete, and Anthony Bourdain. But good luck trying to get THAT job. ""Are you Anthony Bourdain?"" ""No."" ""Thanks for coming in. We'll keep your rÃ©sumÃ© on file."" Fortunately, though, almost anyone can at least aspire to be a musician, and a new study backs up this seemingly obvious connection between attractiveness and playing an instrument. Or even just holding one. You see, in the study, which was conducted by a professor at the University of South Brittany in France and published in the journal ""Psychology of Music,"" a 20-year-old ""good looking"" man was challenged to ask 300 women for their phone number. For 100 of those women, the man carried a guitar case. For another 100, he held a gym bag. And for the final third his hands were empty. In the end, 54 women out of 300 gave him their number. Which, even at an 18% success rate, still seems like a rather impressive return (And much better than my lifetime batting average of negative-12%). Maybe it's time to change my go-to pickup line. ""So, do you like greyhound racing?"" But let's get back to those phone numbers. In the study, 31 of the 54 -- a vast majority -- were achieved when the subject was carrying a guitar case. Fourteen women offered up digits while he was holding nothing. And only nine were received when the gym bag was used as a prop. Scientific conclusion: Never exercise. Ultimately, the research suggests that the attraction of a musical instrument is real, as it may indicate physical and intellectual abilities. And I totally buy that. Understanding music is difficult, and someone who knows how to play an instrument usually is also mentally capable of forming complete sentences. Which I am not. Though, to be fair, I play bass guitar and that tends to rattle the brain. I'm pretty sure actual ideas fall out of my nose in the shower. So, generally speaking, holding that guitar case seems to work quite nicely. But this female attraction to male musicians shouldn't be seen as baseless or shallow or ditsy. Quite the opposite. It's a good thing to appreciate a man with intellectual interests beyond dominating his fantasy football league. And it works both ways. Women with musical instruments also get major sexy points. (Susan Tedeschi, do you like greyhound racing?) Of course, one shouldn't just play music for the sole purpose of appearing more attractive. For that, God invented whiskey. Instead, the ultimate goal is to play music for the joy of playing music. But usually that's just an evolution over time. Dreams of stardom often come first. And it starts early. Hell, I've wanted to be a rock star since I was a kid. Sure, there was a short phase where, as a young man, I yearned to be veterinarian. However, that quickly went away when, one afternoon, I was allowed to hang out at a local clinic and promptly saw a dog get his testicles cut off. That changed things. ""Welp, thanks for letting me come by, Doc. I'm gonna go home now and rethink my life."" So, aside from that momentary lapse of reason, my heart has pretty much always been set on rock stardom. But you see how well that's going. Anyway, screw it. I'm opening a bagel shop.","A French study finds holding a guitar makes you sexually attractive .
