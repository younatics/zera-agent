"Gaza City (CNN) -- A rocket was fired into northern Israel from southern Lebanon, and the Israeli military responded with an artillery strike, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces said Friday. The rocket landed near the northern Israeli town of Metula, which sits right by the Lebanese border, and no damage or injuries have been reported. It was not immediately clear who fired the rocket. The IDF spokesman said that Israel holds the Lebanese government responsible for the attack. Two rockets were launched from the town of Mari in southern Lebanon, Lebanon's official news agency NNA reported, while a third rocket failed to launch. The artillery strike from Israel landed on the outskirts of Kfarshouba, the news agency added. The exchange of fire comes amid Israel's aerial offensive in Gaza against the militant Palestinian group Hamas and the stream of rockets fired into Israel from Gaza. Israel calls up reservists . As fears of an Israeli ground assault grew among Gaza residents on Thursday, Israel revealed it has beefed up its forces by calling about 30,000 reservists to their units. ""We are utilizing that force to enable us to create a substantial force around Gaza, that if it is required, we'll be able to mobilize as soon as possible,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. The Israeli Cabinet has authorized the military to call up 40,000 troops if needed. That is 10,000 more than were called up during Israel's offensive into Gaza in November 2012. Government spokesman Mark Regev said units have been deployed. ""We're ready to go, if we need to go,"" he told Blitzer. Regev said Israel didn't want a situation where Hamas, which controls Gaza, was given a ""timeout"" where it could regroup before restarting its attacks. The mood is grim in Gaza, where Israeli airstrikes have killed at least 91 Palestinians, including women and children, and injured more than 620 since they began late Monday, Palestinian officials said. They said 23 people died in strikes Thursday and four more people succumbed to their injuries. Throughout Gaza, people are expecting an Israeli ground incursion. Many people have nowhere to flee and there are no bomb shelters. ""I can't leave. I have nowhere to go. Better to stay at home, inside and be safe,"" one resident of the town of Bait Hanoun in northern Gaza told CNN. Most residents live in homes without safe rooms and walls made of breeze block, which a bullet could pass through like paper. Rising death toll . Each day the death toll has risen in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces said Thursday it has struck at 785 Hamas targets since announcing the start of its offensive Monday with the aim of hurting Hamas and stopping rocket attacks on Israel. Tensions in the region flared last week after the killings of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, followed by the killing in Jerusalem of a Palestinian teenager that police say may have been an act of revenge. Israel blames Hamas for the deaths of the three Israeli youths, although the group has denied responsibility. The IDF has said its targets in Gaza include rocket launchers, tunnels and the homes of senior Hamas leaders, which the IDF describes as ""command centers."" But among the dead are 22 children and 15 women, including an 18-month-old baby and an 80-year-old woman, according to information from the Palestinian Health Ministry. The Palestine Liberation Organization said Israeli bombs have hit civilian infrastructure, including a line that provides water to a refugee camp and a sewage plant. The IDF has not responded to the accusations. It says it uses phone calls and drops empty shells on roofs -- what it calls ""roof knocking"" -- to warn civilians that airstrikes are imminent. But the approach doesn't guarantee their safety. In one case, members of a family returned to a house in Gaza shortly after having been warned to evacuate it, Lerner, the Israeli military spokesman, said. They were caught in the airstrike. He called their deaths a tragedy, saying, ""This is not what the IDF does."" U.S. willing to help broker cease-fire . Hopes for a cease-fire appeared dim even as world leaders called for the two sides to stop the violence. U.S. President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke by phone. ""The United States remains prepared to facilitate a cessation of hostilities, including a return to the November 2012 cease-fire agreement,"" the White House said in a written statement, referring to the Egyptian-brokered deal that halted the previous Israel-Hamas conflict. The President also condemned rocket attacks from Gaza and said the United States reaffirmed Israel's right to defend itself. U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon told reporters he has been reaching out to regional leaders in an attempt to help get the two sides to stop the violence soon. ""It is imperative not only to restore calm today, but to establish a political horizon for tomorrow,"" he said. ""Without the prospect of an end to the conflict, the sides will grow ever more polarized."" 'Prepared for all options' There have been hints for days from some Israeli officials about the possibility of a ground offensive in Gaza, but there were questions about the government's appetite for such a conflict. Netanyahu said Wednesday that the aerial offensive would be expanded and continue ""until the firing at our communities stops and quiet is restored."" He didn't specify what the expansion of Operation Protective Edge would entail, saying that Israel's military ""is prepared for all possibilities."" No Israelis have been killed so far by the hundreds of rockets fired toward southern Israel by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other militant groups in Gaza. Some Israelis have been wounded by the attacks. A CNN crew in Gaza was setting up a live shot when four rockets streaked overhead in the direction of Israel. Some in the crowd cheered. When told there were air raid sirens going off in Israel, there were more cheers. The Israeli Defense Forces said early Friday that since the start of Operation Protective Edge, 548 rockets have been fired at Israel. The country's Iron Dome defense system has intercepted 118 of them, the IDF said. Hamas and other militant groups in Gaza are believed to have about 10,000 rockets of varying ranges, according to the Israeli military. Israel has said some 3.5 million residents live in areas within reach of the rockets. Sides speak at U.N. Security Council meeting . Israel and the Palestinians laid out their positions at a U.N. Security Council meeting Thursday. Ambassador Riyad Mansour, permanent observer of the State of Palestine to the United Nations, accused Israel of ""terrorizing our people, killing dozens of civilians and injuring hundreds."" Allegations by Israel that Palestinians are using human shields are ""audacious,"" he said, and he rejected the argument that Israel is defending itself. Israel ""deliberately carries out reprisals and collective punishment against the Palestinian people in declared retaliation and revenge ... for the killing of the three Israeli settlers, which the Palestinian leadership has clearly condemned,"" Mansour said. Israel, for its part, called on the Security Council to condemn Hamas and its launching of rockets across the border. Ron Prosor, Israeli ambassador to the United Nations, played a recording of a siren during the middle of his remarks, to show how Israelis only have 15 seconds, he said, to run for cover. ""Asking Israel to show restraint while our cities are under constant attack is like asking the fire brigade to battle an inferno with nothing more than buckets of water,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- I recall being an undergraduate in Russian Studies at Amherst College when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979. I was flabbergasted when then-President Carter initially expressed surprise that Leonid Brezhnev and his cronies decided to undertake that ill-fated adventure. Just the little I knew of Soviet history at that time led me to conclude that one should never be naÃ¯ve about Russia. Wisely, the Carter administration soon implemented a wide-ranging and powerful set of sanctions against the USSR. By comparison, Barack Obama is now making Jimmy Carter look like Attila the Hun with a series of empty threats and ""too little, too late"" punitive measures against Putin's Russia. On February 28, President Obama warned Russia not to take military action against Crimea, and if he did so, serious ""costs"" would be imposed. A few weeks later, Crimea was annexed to Russia and virtually no serious ""costs"" have been incurred from U.S. sanctions. Now Obama and our European allies have virtually conceded Crimea, but again warn Putin that we really mean it this time, that if you take military action in Ukraine outside Crimea, you will be really sorry! I think the only thing that has surprised Putin is how weak Obama's response has been. The administration was not prepared for the contingency that Putin would act so brazenly. But Obama's stubborn insistence on a measured, incremental approach seems premised on his belief that Putin will, after his frustration and anger clears, come to his senses and seize the proverbial ""off ramp"" Obama and his officials ritualistically refer to, hearkening back to nearly two years of the mantra, ""Assad must go."" We know that Assad never left, and I see no evidence that Putin wants to take the ""off-ramp."" Surely Putin's goals were not limited to getting Crimea while losing Ukraine. That does not make sense. And since he has met virtually no push back for Crimea, why would he stop there? It is not like his views on Ukraine are not fairly well known. At the Bucharest NATO summit in April 2008, Putin told George W. Bush in no uncertain terms that Ukraine was not a real country. And now Putin has found the appropriate moment to demonstrate to the ""trans-Atlantic community"" that Ukraine is not a real country by starting to dismember it with impunity. In case there was any doubt about Putin's views of the illegitimacy of the post-Cold War European security order in Europe, his vitriolic speech to the Federal Assembly in Moscow on March 18 should clarify it for skeptics. I have no doubt that there is nothing Vladimir Putin would rather do than delegitimize the post-Cold War order, expose the Trans-Atlantic partnership as a sham and deeply degrade U.S. leadership in the world. He has already gone fairly far down that path in four weeks. Why do American presidents have such a hard time understanding Russian leaders? First, it starts with our inability to fathom just how traumatic the collapse of the Soviet Union was for several generations of Russians. From a clinical standpoint, Russia has been suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder for the past couple of decades. Putin resonates with many Russians because he is seen as the embodiment of the humiliation, status deprivation and grievances that the country has purportedly suffered. Making matters worse, he was an intelligence operative virtually abandoned by what he and his brethren view as incompetent Soviet leadership. The ethos of the Russian intelligence officer going back to the foundation of the secret police in the early 19th century centers on their special, almost messianic obligation to save Russia from itself -- a task only they were adequately trained for. These were people who, for example, enthusiastically supported the U.S. initiative more than 20 years ago to remove nuclear weapons from Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, not because they gave a damn about nonproliferation but because when the day came for Russia to restore the ""Greater Russia,"" that task would be much easier with nukes out of the way. In the 1990s, many speculated about the danger of a ""Weimar Russia"" scenario in which the humiliated superpower would re-emerge in more of a fascist form. I am afraid that day has arrived. Putin's task is to take back what a certain streak of Russian nationalism views as not only rightfully, but sacredly, what should be Russian. Obama may satisfy some supporters and even some critics by taunting Putin and Russia as a ""regional power"" of no great consequence acting out of ""weakness."" This will only bait the bear to lash out to demonstrate who is really weak and who is strong. It is a game that Obama is not psychologically equipped to understand, let alone win. A Russian strike, either after a manufactured provocation or without one, into eastern Ukraine, is inevitable. Putin smells blood in the water, and nothing we have said or done will deter him. Economic measures alone are insufficient. If Obama does not rise to this challenge soon, I fear that Putin will happily ruin his legacy and U.S. credibility, with massive collateral damage for Russians and Ukrainians. Putin will likely meet his own end if he miscalculates in Ukraine. It is incumbent for the United States, its allies and most importantly Ukrainians themselves, to help Putin not miscalculate because if he does, there will be hell to pay for all of us.","Andrew Kuchins: Obama and allies have issued empty threats at Putin .

"(CNN) -- A patient isolated in a California hospital after possible Ebola exposure does not have the virus, testing revealed. The unidentified patient, who had recently traveled to West Africa, was isolated at the Kaiser Permanente South Sacramento Medical Center during the testing. ""We're happy to report that we've heard from the Centers for Disease Control that the test result is negative,"" Dr. Ron Chapman of the California Department of Public Health told reporters Thursday night. The patient was considered ""low-risk,"" and tests were being conducted out of ""an abundance of caution,"" the public health department said. The CDC tested the patient's blood samples to determine whether the Ebola virus was present. The hospital said all necessary precautions were being taken to safeguard other patients and staff while the testing was carried out. There are no confirmed cases of Ebola in the state, the agency said in a statement Wednesday. 'Miraculous day' On Thursday, Dr. Kent Brantly became the second of two American missionaries infected with the virus when working with Ebola patients in Liberia to be discharged from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. The other, Nancy Writebol, was released Tuesday and has decided to not make public comments, according to the hospital. But Brantly gave a news conference in which he gave thanks for their recovery. ""Today is a miraculous day,"" Brantly said. ""I am thrilled to be alive, to be well and to be reunited with my family."" Emory's staff is confident that the American patients' discharges from hospital pose ""no public health threat,"" said Dr. Bruce Ribner, director of Emory's Infectious Disease Unit. The pair were the first humans to receive an experimental Ebola drug called ZMapp, which may have saved their lives. What happens when you survive Ebola? External bleeding . The Ebola virus causes viral hemorrhagic fever, which refers to a group of viruses that affect multiple organ systems in the body and are often accompanied by bleeding. Early symptoms include sudden onset of fever, weakness, muscle pain, headaches and a sore throat. They later progress to vomiting, diarrhea, impaired kidney and liver function -- and sometimes internal and external bleeding. The virus spreads through contact with organs and bodily fluids such as blood, saliva, urine and other secretions of infected people. Earlier this month, a patient with a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City for Ebola testing, but tested negative. He had recently traveled to a country in West Africa where Ebola has been reported, the hospital said in a statement. More than 1,350 people have died in the West African Ebola outbreak since the first cases drew attention in March, the WHO said Wednesday. Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea have been at the center of the outbreak, with a dozen cases also confirmed in Nigeria. CNN's Laura Ly and Josh Levs contributed to this report.","Tests confirm a patient isolated in a Sacramento hospital is not infected with Ebola .

"(CNN) -- Along the Rust Belt and in cities dotting the Northeast and Upper Midwest, Catholic communities are mourning the loss of parishes. It's a five-year trend of sweeping church closures that most recently hit Cleveland, Ohio. St. James parish in Lakewood, Ohio, is slated to close. The interior replicates a 16th-century Sicilian cathedral. Wally Martens, a Cleveland native, can look out his kitchen window and see the spiritual home that has served his family for five generations. St. Ignatius of Antioch has been with him and his loved ones through life and death. ""It's the place where most of us were baptized, most of us got married, most of us graduated from grade school and some of us were buried,"" Martens, 68, said of the west side urban parish that serves 1,200 households. To find out that the building is set to be shuttered is ""like losing somebody in your family."" Earlier this month, Bishop Richard G. Lennon of the Diocese of Cleveland, which serves more than 750,000 Catholics, announced that 29 parishes will close and 41 others will merge. The reconfiguration plan, which will effectively cut 52 parishes in the current tally of 224, is scheduled to go into effect by June 30, 2010. ""Closing a parish is very emotional,"" Bishop Lennon said in a written statement. ""I have personally experienced the closing of my own childhood parish in Boston, which members of my family helped establish in 1914. ... I pray that my decisions will serve the needs of this Diocese and its people.""  Parishioners speak out on closings » . Other cities that have had waves of closures have included places as various as Camden, New Jersey; Allentown, Pennsylvania; and New York City. All of this comes at a time when the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life reports that Catholicism in America has lost more affiliated members than any other faith tradition. There are reportedly 67.1 million Catholics in the U.S., according to The Official Catholic Directory 2008. Compared to the 2007 number of 67.5, that's about a 400,000 decrease in one year. And the Pew Forum found that approximately a third of its survey respondents who were raised in the Roman Catholic Church no longer attend the church. What drove the decision to close parishes in Cleveland were population shifts to outlying areas, financial strains that have 42 percent of parishes ""operating in the red"" and priest shortages, diocese spokesman Robert Tayek explained. The bishop, he said, is trying to find ""an equitable solution."" But the announcement has raised many questions. Among them: What happens to the struggling neighborhoods that have come to rely on outreach and programs offered by some of these inner-city parishes? ""Too many bishops are treating parishes as if they were Starbucks franchises,"" said Sister Christine Schenk, a Cleveland-area nun who's been fighting for nearly two decades to institute change in the church through her organization FutureChurch. ""It's about more than money. It's about mission to the people,"" she said. ""This isn't what Jesus would do."" The Rev. Bob Begin of Saint Colman couldn't agree more. ""The founder of our church started his mission by saying, 'I came to bring good news to the poor,'"" said Begin, who described his parish as serving about 1,300 people in a community where the average income is below $20,000. Saint Colman, which is slated to merge with another parish elsewhere, gets daily knocks on its doors from nearby residents, many of them immigrants from 25 different countries, who are in need of all kinds of assistance, he said. ""If this parish weren't involved in bringing good news to the poor, I would not spend a lick of energy trying to keep it open,"" the pastor said. ""But because it is bringing good news to the poor, then I have a responsibility to guard and defend this mission against anyone who threatens it."" His parish and others affected by the recent announcement had until 5 p.m. Friday to file an appeal with the diocese.  According to The Plain Dealer, which conducted a survey of the parishes, at least 11 had filed as of Friday morning. The diocese itself refused to comment on numbers. For those who didn't file, the bishop's decision is final. But if what happened in Boston, Massachusetts, is any indication, no parish should count on the appeal working. Bishop Lennon came to Cleveland from the Archdiocese of Boston, where he oversaw the reorganization and closure of parishes and came under harsh criticism from many. One such critic was Peter Borré, chairman of the Council of Parishes, a Boston-based advocacy group for imperiled parishes. In 2004, within months of the Archdiocese of Boston announcing it would pay a settlement of $85 million to more than 500 alleged sex abuse victims, 83 parishes were put on the chopping block, ""which was a head spinner,"" Borré said. In the end, because of his organization's relentless efforts, Borré said, only 60 parishes were cut. His group coordinated around-the-clock vigils or sit-ins that are ongoing, four and a half years later, in five Boston-area parishes. He also has led the charge to navigate the appeal process for nine parishioner groups that have now taken their battle all the way up to the Apostolic Signatura, or, as Borré called it, the ""Vatican Supreme Court."" The assumption is that the highest level of the Vatican will deny the appeals this spring, but Borré said it is important to him and the others to fight as far as they can go. ""Other than vigils, this is the only step still open to us,"" he said. ""Secondly, we are the lead dog on this sled. We are the first that has experienced this phenomenon, and we have made it a self-appointed task to let the rest of America know what to expect."" As of Friday morning, eight Cleveland parishes had reached out to Borré for language to help in their appeals. Others likely drafted letters of their own. But some affected parishes had no intention of fighting. Ray Daull, 68, a deacon at Christ the King in Cleveland Heights says a merger, which will combine his parish with three others, is a good thing. It'll be sad to see his church of 52 years go, but given its deficit and shrinking attendance, with a merger, ""We will have more resources ... and the money can go into doing our work,"" he said. But for parishes such as St. Ignatius of Antioch, the one Wally Martens can see from his window, accepting the end is not yet possible. ""There was a general gasp, and then sadness turned to madness,"" the Rev. James McGonegdal, Marten's pastor of 20 years, said of the announcement he made at Mass on March 15. ""Some of the parishes knew they'd be closing, whereas for St. Ignatius and a couple other parishes, it was almost like a sudden death. You grieve in a different way."" A standing-room only crowd poured into the parish last Sunday to show growing support. Martens said in a week's time, $900,000 had been pledged to finance the church and send a message to the diocese. For Martens' 92-year-old mother, Pauline, pondering life without her parish is unthinkable. For most of her life, it's the only one she's known. ""I just thought the church would go on forever,"" she said. ""I expected to be buried from there. But I guess the way things are going, I just don't know what'll happen to me.""","Parish closures hit Catholic communities across the Northeast and Upper Midwest .

"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- The last time I'd seen Tacloban, it was a mangled wreck. Much of the city had been smashed. What was left was a landscape of rubble, rain and mud, stripped and torn-down trees, smashed vehicles and isolated concrete shells that had been homes. Worst of all was the smell of death and decay as bodies were dragged from the ruins and left at the side of the road to be collected. The living were in a state of shocked bewilderment. It was a little more than a week after Typhoon Haiyan had pummeled this Philippines city. As I climbed onto a U.S. military flight to Manila I could see thousands of people trying desperately to get out on one of the handful of aid flights -- a stark testimony to the devastation they were leaving behind. Half a year on . Coming back, almost seven months later, I was prepared for the worst and half expecting to see a city still in shock, lacking the basics of food, water and housing. But Tacloban surprised me. The scars of Haiyan are still vivid but the city is recovering. The main commercial district is very much open for business, the roads are cleared and busy and the power companies are restoring supply. The Coke and Pepsi plants are both back up and running and hotels are open doing a brisk trade, especially with workers from the many NGOs involved in the recovery effort. But the evidence of one of the most intense storms in recorded history is everywhere -- in shattered steel structures that were once factories, as well as the many wrecked houses left by their owners to rot in the searing tropical heat. And always most haunting are the graveyards. From tiny unmarked mounds indicating the burial of a child, to bigger plots filled with extended families. On one wooden board, I counted 22 names from the same family. Moving forward . But even amid these scenes of such desperate sadness, there is an acceptance of what has happened and a willingness to move forward. We arrived at sundown at a mass grave in the grounds of San Joaquin church in Palo, which is just outside Tacloban. An empty piece of ground just meters from the graves had been taken over by children playing, the sound of laughter ringing across the night. It is the resilience of the people here that stands out. Tacloban was a moderately wealthy, mid-sized city before the storm -- though that doesn't mean they're insulated from nature. On average 20 powerful storms hit the region ever year. Loss and destruction are part of the fabric of this region. But talk to the local people here now and it becomes clear that the rebuilding of Tacloban has reached a critical stage. The initial response to Haiyan as the international aid effort ramped up was a success -- no outbreak of disease, no widespread breakdown in law and order and enough supplies of emergency food and clean water. However, the rebuilding stage needs to be faster. After six months, less than 150 permanent new houses had been built. The master-plan calls for 200,000. While bureaucracy has been a major factor in the delays, the most important has been finding suitable land that fits in with the government's ""Building Back Better"" plan. New accommodation must be able to withstand Haiyan-like wind speeds, and be built on ground not vulnerable to storm surges and landslides. I asked Toto Andrada what he thought. I'd met Toto at the hotel the CNN team had taken refuge in during Haiyan. Producer Tim Schwarz, ""storm-chaser"" Josh Morgerman and I had helped rescue Toto, his wife and their disabled daughter who had been trapped in their ground floor room by the rising storm surge. Toto was angry at the pace of the rebuilding but at the same time he was proud of what had been achieved in the recovery. ""The national government should help the city more,"" he said. ""The money is here -- it's just taking so long for the government to release it. Why?"" His family is divided about whether they should stay. His daughter Kaykay, who has cerebal palsy, probably put it best though. ""I don't mind where we are,"" she said. ""As long as we are together.""

"(CNN) -- The tragic death of Eric Garner at the hands of the NYPD -- a fatal scuffle caught in all its horror in a video shot by a bystander -- is, in part, the product of a nationally recognized police strategy, ""broken windows."" It may have outlived its usefulness in many parts of New York. Garner, a father of six, was allegedly a low-level street hustler, a ""buttlegger"" illegally selling cigarettes one at a time or in packs without taxes applied. When police approached and tried to arrest Garner -- something they'd done before â€” the man jumped up, complaining that he had no goods on him, had not been dealing and didn't want to be hassled. The cops swarmed Garner, with at least one appearing to choke Garner and press on his neck as he gasped, eight times: ""I can't breathe."" You can see the disturbing video here. He died shortly afterward. As the video went viral, community protests and vigils mounted. A central issue in the protests is the fact that the video shows one officer, Daniel Pantaleo grabbing Garner by the neck and pressing down on his head and chest, in apparent violation of a police rule that bans such choke holds. ""Members of the New York City Police Department will not use choke holds,"" Section 203-11 of the NYPD Patrol Guide says. ""A choke hold shall include, but is not limited to, any pressure to the throat or windpipe, which may prevent or hinder breathing or reduce intake of air."" Two of the officers involved in the incident have been assigned to desk duties with their guns taken away. NYPD Commissioner William Bratton has promised a ""top to bottom"" retraining of every member of NYPD in how to arrest people, as well as a review of the department's use-of-force policies. Bratton has also met with the FBI in anticipation of a possible federal lawsuit alleging that Garner's civil rights were violated. Choke holds were banned 20 years ago after the death of a young man, Anthony Baez, who was killed in a confrontation with police after a football he was tossing with friends hit a police car. The officer who choked Baez to death was ultimately sentenced to seven years in prison. Bratton was recently re-appointed to the top post after a long stint in Los Angeles, giving the latest incident an eerie deja-vu quality. Despite the ban on choke holds, new incidents continue to pile up: The NYPD's Civilian Complaint Review Board received more than 1,000 complaints about the use of choke holds between 2009 and 2013, but punished only nine officers, none of them with anything more serious than a loss of vacation days. The Rev. Al Sharpton has vowed to press the NYPD and Mayor Bill de Blasio on the investigation of the Garner case, which has been turned over to the local district attorney. But the larger question remains: Why was a team of six officers enforcing an almost laughably low-level crime like selling loose cigarettes for 50 cents apiece? The answer lies in New York's dramatically successful experiment with battling an out-of-control crime wave in the early 1990s, much of it built on a ""broken windows"" theory first developed by criminologists George Kelling and the late James Q. Wilson and laid out in a famous 1982 Atlantic Monthly magazine article. The idea is shorthand for a phenomenon known to sociologists: Leaving an otherwise safe building with an unfixed broken window signals to criminals that nobody cares about the property, which quickly becomes a haven for prostitution, drug dealing and serious crimes. With murders back then hitting more than 2,000 per year, NYPD cops were told by Bratton to stop waiting for the next 911 call and tasked with enforcing seemingly minor ""quality of life"" matters like public urination, panhandling and vandalism that made people feel unsafe. The strategy provided an immediate payoff. Cops doing quality-of-life patrols in the subways discovered that people jumping the turnstile (entering without paying) often turned out to have drugs, guns or outstanding warrants. Most turnstile-jumpers weren't dangerous felons, but it turned out that dangerous felons often didn't bother to pay the fare. So enforcing small violations helped catch truly dangerous criminals. Even more important, when streets and subways began to feel safer, more people used them -- and the very presence of more law-abiding citizens always acts as a deterrent to crime (it creates more witnesses who are likely to point out the bad guys to cops or actually intervene to stop certain kinds of crimes). Bratton, an architect of the broken windows revolution in policing, appears to be going back to his old playbook during his second tour as commander of the NYPD: So far this year, officers have arrested 240 subway performers, who do such things as break dance and perform backflips on moving trains. But the Garner case shows it may be time to revise, reduce or scrap broken windows policing, at least in some neighborhoods. When Bratton became commissioner for the first time, in 1994, the city had just finished a year with 2,420 murders. The number last year was just 333. The subways aren't out of control, the break dancers aren't carrying weapons, and low-level cigarette hustlers aren't causing the kind of disorder the city weathered in the 1990s. As Garner is laid to rest and the cops involved get whatever fate the court system has in store, the NYPD should re-evaluate how much force and attention it needs to train on low-level crime in a much safer city.","Errol Louis: Death of Eric Garner at hands of NYPD shows old police strategy that doesn't work .

"(CNN) -- A second former co-owner of the California slaughterhouse involved in a recall of nearly nine million pounds of meat was charged with knowingly processing and distributing meat from cancerous cows, court documents released this week say. Robert Singleton, co-owner of the Rancho Feeding Corporation in Petaluma, was primarily responsible for purchasing cattle and loading shipments for distribution, prosecutors say. He is charged with distributing ""adulterated, misbranded, and uninspected"" meat, according to the documents. Singleton jointly owned the meat plant with Jesse J. Amaral Jr., the former president and general manager who is also known as also known as ""Babe Amaral."" Amaral and his former employees, Felix Sandoval Cabrera and Eugene Corda, have all been charged with unlawful sale and distribution of contaminated meat. Prosecutors allege that Amaral and Singleton directed Corda and Cabrera to circumvent inspection procedures for certain cows with signs of epithelioma of the eye, also known as ""cancer eye."" While Singleton is accused of knowingly purchasing cattle with signs of epithelioma, Amaral allegedly directed employees to carve ""USDA Condemned"" stamps out of certain cow carcasses and to process them for sale and distribution, despite having been rejected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture veterinarian. Amaral is also charged with sending false invoices to farmers, telling them that their cattle had died or been condemned and charging them ""handling fees"" for disposal of the carcasses, instead of compensating them for the sale price, prosecutors said. If convicted, Singleton faces up to three years imprisonment, with one year of supervised release, and a $10,000 fine. Amaral, Cabrera and Corda could receive up to 20 years in prison and $250,000 in fines. CNN's attempts this week to reach the four men and an attorney representing them have been unsuccessful. Between January 2013 and January 2014, Rancho processed and distributed meat from approximately 101 condemned cattle and approximately 79 cancer eye cows, according to court documents. In February, 8.7 million pounds of meat from the Rancho plant was recalled. The recalled beef may have reached 35 states and Guam, the Department of Agriculture said.

"(CNN) -- Talk about rubbing it in. As if Liverpool fans needed reminding of last season's traumatic collapse with a long-awaited English Premier League title in sight, the club's hangover was made very apparent Saturday. A 3-1 defeat at West Ham was the third in five matches for Brendan Rodgers' team, coming after a last-gasp midweek win at home to Bulgarian underdog Ludogorets in the European Champions League. On Friday, West Ham manager Sam Allardyce -- who narrowly avoided the sack last season after his side's slightly flattering 13th placing -- chided the Reds for having failed to break the recent dominance of the Manchester clubs and Chelsea. ""They were in pole position and had one hand on the trophy but they ended up throwing it away,"" he wrote in his newspaper column. ""They had no European football to distract them, their schedule was clear except for that one goal, that one focus. They were brilliant but they should have taken full advantage when they had it in the palm of their hands."" If Allardyce -- once tipped as a future England manager but often derided for his functional long-ball tactics -- was attempting mind games then you could argue that it paid off. His team went 2-0 up inside seven minutes against a new-look Liverpool side still getting to grips with the departure of top scorer, game-changer and all-round mischief-maker Luis Suarez to Barcelona. New Zealand international defender Winston Reid scored the opener from close range -- his first goal since October 2013 -- and new signing Diafra Sakho netted his third in as many games with a speculative chip from the right. Liverpool pulled one back before halftime through England forward Raheem Sterling after Mario Balotelli's shot was blocked, but the Italy striker made few other telling contributions apart from a booking when he clashed with goalkeeper Adrian. West Ham sealed victory in the 88th minute when Stewart Downing set up substitute Morgan Amalfitano, with Liverpool pressing for the equalizer. The win lifted the Londoners to eighth place, leaving last season's runner-up Liverpool languishing in 10th -- six points behind leader Chelsea, which travels to champion Manchester City on Sunday. ""It's a well-deserved victory -- it's not a lucky one, it's not Liverpool having an off day, it's West Ham being absolutely brilliant on the day,"" Allardyce told UK broadcaster Sky Sports. ""I thought the first-half performance was absolutely outstanding -- in actual fact, I thought we should have been three or four up by halftime."" It was the first time since December that Liverpool had lost successive league games, following last weekend's 1-0 defeat by Aston Villa. ""We were nowhere near the standard today,"" said Rodgers, whose team face a midweek League Cup game against Middlesbrough before next Saturday's Merseyside derby against Everton. ""It is just not quite happening for us at the moment. We have a lot of work to do and today was very disappointing in terms of performance."" Villa had gone into the weekend in second place but fell back to earth with a bump, losing 3-0 to an Arsenal team smarting from a midweek Champions League defeat away to Borussia Dortmund. With new signing Alexis Sanchez rested by Arsene Wenger, World Cup winner Mesut Ozil was given the chance to shine in a more central role -- and the German duly delivered with the opening goal just after half an hour and an assist for new signing Danny Welbeck. An own-goal from Aly Cissokho made it three in the space of seven minutes, and the game was effectively over before halftime as Arsenal moved up to fourth. ""You have to show him the confidence is there and he showed he can respond when he was under scrutiny,"" Wenger said of Ozil, who has been strongly criticized for luckluster displays this season and in the second half of the previous one. ""It's always a sensitive point, you don't know how people respond to that."" Villa boss Paul Lambert lamented the virus that had decimated his squad before the game. ""It's a tough game for us when everyone is 100% fit, but the lads were running on empty,"" said the Scot, who has been rewarded with a new contract until 2018. At the other end of the managerial security spectrum, Newcastle's Alan Pardew can thank substitute Papisse Cisse for giving him a lifeline. The Senegal striker, making his return after fracturing a kneecap in March, scored twice in the last 20 minutes to deny Hull in a 2-2 draw -- though Newcastle remained in the bottom three. Southampton moved up to second place, above Villa on goal difference, with a 1-0 win at Swansea thanks to an 80th-minute goal from sub Victor Wanyama -- the Kenyan midfielder's first for the club. Queen's Park Rangers salvaged a 2-2 draw at home to Stoke thanks to a late free-kick from Croatian veteran Niko Kranjcar, while Sunderland drew 0-0 at promoted Burnley.","Liverpool beaten for second successive match, losing 3-1 at West Ham .

"(CNN) -- Love is all LeBron needs. Or so the Cleveland Cavaliers hope. The NBA doormat-turned-upstart squad from northeastern Ohio officially got its second big jolt of excitement this offseason on Saturday, with the announcement that Kevin Love is coming its way in a trade. ""Welcome to the Land @kevinlove!"" James tweeted. Love, who averaged 26.1 points and 12.5 assists a game with the Minnesota Timberwolves, joins LeBron James in Cleveland. It was James' return to the Cavaliers -- the club he famously made ""The Decision"" to leave four years ago for the Miami Heat -- that was the NBA's biggest move, by far, since the San Antonio Spurs beat the Heat for the championship. Unlike what he'd done after joining Miami, the four-time league Most Valuable Player didn't promise he'd bring any titles to Cleveland. Part of that may have to do with the fact he didn't have the same supporting cast as he had in Miami, where he suited up with Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh. But the arrival of Love -- one of the top scorers and rebounders in the NBA -- could change the expectations. The two newcomers join a squad that for the past few years has been led by point guard Kyrie Irving. Other holdovers include Dion Waiters and Anderson Varejao. Still, it's not like Cleveland last few season have been successful: There's a reason they had the No. 1 overall draft pick -- which typically goes to one of the NBA's worst team -- three of the last four years. Cleveland didn't get Love, a forward, for free. They gave up two potentially big stars, and their last two No. 1 picks, in Andrew Wiggins and Anthony Bennett, to the Timberwolves. The Cavaliers surrendered their first-round pick in the 2015 NBA Draft to Philadelphia. The 76ers got guard Alexey Shved and forward Luc Richard Mbah a Moute from Minnesota and traded veteran forward Thaddeus Young to the Timberwolves as part of the three-team swap.

"(CNN) -- The Ice Bucket Challenge invites eye rolling. By definition, all gimmicks are designed to jump the shark, eventually. And gimmicks that look like one big selfie orgy may run into backlash faster than most. Considered another way, however, I side with those who see the Ice Bucket Challenge as a marker of something larger and something special occurring across the culture. It's not the funny videos that matter. It's the power of the peer-to-peer economy, driven by young people, now rippling through the social sector. Businesses such as Airbnb, Uberx and ""P2P"" lending firms such as Prosper Marketplace have demonstrated the heft of peer models. While the Ice Bucket Challenge itself will come and go, peer-to-peer fundraising and activism will stick around. Beth Kanter, an author and expert on nonprofit trends, points to ""PhilanthroKids"" who are leading the way. Kanter writes that ""we are starting to see a rise of crowd funding projects done by and for kids. ... These are teens (and pre-teens) with a passion for social change and who grew up not knowing what it was like to not have a cell phone or be connected to Facebook."" With the Ice Bucket Challenge, she explains, ""this was not a campaign started by the ALS Association, but young people who wanted to support the cause."" The dual forces matter. With the arrival of the sharing economy and the generational shift in deciding how to allocate scarce resources -- charitable donations and volunteer time -- donation-dependent and volunteer-dependent organizations must prepare for a new and different future. Arts researcher Alan Brown was the first person I met who figured out how peers influence how we decide which social and cultural events are worth our time and dollar, and which are not. Indeed, our study from a decade ago showed the importance of peer influence on interest in classical music concerts. In more than 11,000 interviews across 15 U.S. cities, we found 20% of adults reported attending a classical music concert in the past year. Yet nearly three times that share -- 56% -- said they would accept an invitation from a friend or family member to attend a classical music concert. What we hinted at then and now see as brutally clear is that it's all about who's doing the asking. When my sister participates in a fundraising run and sends an email asking me to donate, I do. When the professional expert from that same nonprofit organization asks me to donate, I treat the note as spam. So the critical innovation of the Ice Bucket Challenge is not the funny visual. It's what comes at the end of the videos, when the soaked participant looks into the camera and challenges family or friends to do the same. As the great songwriter Steve Goodman knew, we all want to be called out by our names. When I phoned Alan to get his take on the Ice Bucket Challenge, he noted the ""social validation"" produced through this kind of interchange. Most charitable giving is private and personal. This peer-based alternative creates a lasting good feeling that can only be realized through a kind of social alchemy, not a private act. ""There is also a generational thing we're seeing,"" Brown said, ""where young people are moving from relying on an expert critic to relying on a peer. I guess this is an extreme manifestation of that. I'm shocked by how many people have thrown buckets of cold water over their head."" A hundred years ago, Andrew Carnegie was in the midst of building 2,509 libraries around the world -- becoming, almost literally, the bedrock of American philanthropy. His money, his deal. Today, formal authority has lost some of its value. Instead of outside experts driving the allocation of volunteer time and charitable donations, ""in our world, it's the power of suggestion, when a friend invites you to something or suggests a piece of music,"" Brown told me. ""It's not just the music coming your way. It's the social imprimatur."" Because individual donations as a percentage of disposable personal income do not fluctuate much, we may find that the overall level of giving remains steady but that young people seek out charitable causes that provide the best peer-to-peer connections and honor informal influence over traditional authority. If so, the Ice Bucket Challenge is causing more than a shock to the system of the person doused. It may be sending a shock to the system of traditional fundraising.","John Bare: The Ice Bucket Challenge invites eye rolling, it seems gimmicky .
Bare: But it may signal a new kind of activism and peer-to-peer fund-raising which will stick around .

"(CNN) -- Tax day got you down? Now is your chance to flee society. Drop off the grid. Pull a Thoreau. Be you a survivalist, an environmentalist or a cheapskate-ist, you can join the growing movement of Americans embracing off-grid living. ""There's a desire to step out of the rat race, and in America, that goes very deep in the national psyche,"" says Nick Rosen, author of ""Off the Grid: Inside the Movement for More Space, Less Government, and True Independence in Modern America"" and editor of www.off-grid.net. ""You know, the pioneering spirit and sturdy self-reliance -- these things which define the American character."" For some off-griders, it's a matter of having little or no impact on the environment -- literally living off the power grid. This lifestyle has been championed by celebrities Daryl Hannah and Ed Begley Jr. Then there are those who no longer want to be a blip on the societal radar. ""Off-grid living is a spectrum that unites greens and survivalists,"" says Rosen, referring to those who choose to escape city life because they either don't trust the government or don't want it meddling in their affairs. So if you've been considering going AWOL, let tax day be your inspiration. And if you've got what it takes to look after yourself, with a little help from some earthy friends, here are a few off-the-grid destinations that will take you in. Or perhaps you'd like to drop in for a visit ... Terlingua, Texas . There's no shortage of songs about this fabled West Texas ghost town on the edge of Big Bend National Park, chock full of desert gypsies occupying the remaining mining ruins. But perhaps the most well known is Gary P. Nunn's ""Terlingua Sky"": Well, you know we're probably too old for this. / Maybe the rest of the world is too young. / We drive 500 miles to get loose and get wild / And stay up 'til the last song is done. Of course it's hard to tell just how young or old anyone is in Terlingua. Desert living takes its toll on your skin while rejuvenating the soul. Terlingua is surrounded by ruggedly beautiful terrain, sits at a high altitude and a distance from civilization that provides for some of the world's finest star-gazing and plays host to two of the most celebrated and highly attended chili cook-offs in the country. If you aren't ready to escape to the wilds of West Texas, at least plan a trip for the first Saturday of November, when both the Frank X. Tolbert - Wick Fowler Championship and the Chili Appreciation Society International cook-offs take place. And make sure to spend a night at Upstairs at the Mansion -- a boutique hotel built in the ruins of the century-old mansion owned by the founder of the Chisos Mining Co. For more information, visit www.terlinguacitylimits.com or www.chili.org. Slab City, California . ""The Last Free Place in America"" is about 190 miles southeast of Los Angeles and an hour's drive north of the Mexican border. Here, in Slab City, you'll find hundreds of free spirits living in campers, RVs and school buses scattered amongst the giant concrete-slab ruins of a World War II-era military base. When the base closed after the war, a group of servicemen stayed, and the community continued to grow -- mostly because it supports the wayward life, and neither the U.S. military nor the state of California have ever charged the squatters. Keep in mind there's no water, electricity or sewer service, so the lifestyle presents its own challenges. You might recognize the village of mobile homes or the nearby ""Salvation Mountain"" from the 2007 film ""Into the Wild"" or the book of the same name that inspired it. Illuminated by a vision from God, Leonard Knight spent 26 years and thousands of gallons of paint crafting a hillside out of adobe and straw. The giant art installation is an explosion of colors and scriptures and such a spectacular vision that an unsuspecting traveler might think it a mirage. It's worth the trip just to see the giant work of art or to take a life lesson from some of the locals making their own way in this concrete Eden. Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage, Missouri . In the heart of the Midwest lies a commune dedicated to socially and environmentally sustainable living. Located on 280 acres in Rutledge, in northeastern Missouri, Dancing Rabbit inhabitants aim to prove that egalitarian communities can thrive in America. But the main focus is on the environment, as much of the property is reserved for wildlife habitat and villagers have reintroduced native plants to the area. If you're just looking to stop in and check out the scene, stay at the Milkweed Mercantile Eco Inn, a straw-bale-constructed bed and breakfast. Dancing Rabbit also offers one- to three-week visitor programs to more fully experience the ecovillage. Most of those program participants camp on the property.

For more than 300 years, the residents of this Chesapeake Bay waterman community have managed to exist without local government, jails or police. The Methodist church and the blue crab business give the community its structure. Not only have islanders preserved a sense of order, but they've also upheld a unique way of life and dialect similar to that of the West Country of England. The assortment of islands known as Smith Island can only be accessed by boat, and many are uninhabited. If you're not looking to take up island life permanently, you should at least visit for the outstanding seafood and their signature eight-to-15-layer Smith Island cake.

"(CNN) -- Heather and Michael von Quilich are still adjusting to life without a regular payday. They are makers of customized holiday stockings, party hats and baby bibs, and their profits come in large waves at Thanksgiving, Easter and Christmas. The periodic booms allow them to live off smaller orders the rest of the year, a huge change of pace from their previous jobs in the California construction industry. ""You get into that mindset of 'go, go, go' all the time,"" said Michael, 42. ""When Jack our son was first born, I feel like his first five years were on fast-forward."" They were making good money, but something was missing. Heather, 40, was the first to press the pause button, albeit suddenly and involuntarily. She was laid off from her job as an office manager for a home builder in late 2009. Amid the job hunt, she threw herself into crafting as a hobby, and a new career path began to emerge. When friends encouraged her to sell her personalized and embroidered party hats, stockings and baby bibs on Etsy, she figured it was worth a shot. She named the store Sunshine Daydream after a Grateful Dead song in honor of the band. She set up the Etsy store and continued looking for other jobs. ""Why don't I do something I love and make it work?"" she figured. As Heather began putting more effort into the website photos and product descriptions, her husband complained about piles of fabric and supplies cluttering the house. Then in 2010, Michael lost his job as vice president of operations for a home builder and joined Sunshine Daydream as operations manager. Heather's hobby became the family's sole source of income. Over the past three years, the von Quiliches have ridden the crest of the online shopping movement that has taken their idea from daydream to successful business. Sunshine Daydream is fortified with 1,883 reviews, 438 ""followers"" and a 99% positive approval rate from buyers. ""We're not talking like we're going to buy a Lear jet,"" Michael said. ""But we can support ourselves."" Listening for 'cha-ching' It all started with a ladybug hat. For daughter Natalie's first birthday in 2010, Heather brainstormed a whimsical ladybug party hat fashioned out of red and black fabric with ""Natalie"" embroidered in curly font. She posted it on Etsy and soon enough, she started receiving requests. In the months leading up to Thanksgiving 2010, Heather branched out into holiday products by offering sets of eight Christmas stockings personalized in Sunshine Daydream's signature style of bright colors, fun font and personalized embroidering, at $10 a stocking on Etsy. From there, sales exploded. During the busy 2011 holiday season, relatives from both sides of the family crowded into the von Quilich living room to sew, embroider and help out however they could. The couple finally realized things were getting serious, and after the holiday season, they purchased four large industrial sewing machines. The investment paid off, and now they don't need the free labor. In 2012, Michael estimates Sunshine Daydream earned 25% more than the couple pulled in during their best years working other jobs. They mark progress with alerts from the Etsy app on Heather's phone. Every time Sunshine Daydream makes a sale, a cash register sound rings from her phone. Heather admits she gets nervous if a few hours go by without a new ""cha-ching."" In 2012, the phone ""cha-chinged"" every day but Christmas, they say. ""Now, this business is overwhelming our house,"" Heather said. Stacks of fabric line the hallway, potential samples are tacked on walls and pom-poms, ribbon and other materials spill out of a small workroom. Building a fan base . Heather says she values the creative freedom the new gig allows her. What was once an outlet for stress smushed into an hour or so of a hectic day is now her sole professional responsibility. ""I like to paint my world with color and with fabric,"" she says. ""Having this job allows me to do that every day."" And they've built a loyal following on Etsy that they both say is invaluable to their success. In the early days of the Etsy store, Heather says one woman e-mailed her a thank-you note, with pictures of the handmade stockings and a heartfelt description of how much she appreciated the care and detail. ""It brought tears to my eyes,"" Heather says. ""That gives me such a good feeling, that I'm responsible for adding to these family memories."" With the majority of orders coming from outside of California, the couple is even considering moving to Florida to be closer to customers in the Southeast so they can cut down on shipping costs. Most importantly, that ""fast-forward"" button is finally off and they have more time to spend with their children. And, wherever they go, the cash register ring reminds them Sunshine Daydream is alive and well. It happens in funny moments, such as the time they went to buy a pickup to carry their son's go-karts, Michael recalled. ""The guy said, 'How do you plan to pay for this?' ""And then her phone made that cash register noise.""","Heather von Quilich opened an Etsy store after she was laid off .

"(CNN) -- A toddler was found sleeping in a parked car outside a Connecticut bar early Saturday, hours after police discovered her allegedly intoxicated and incapacitated mother sleeping inside the bar. Shortly before midnight Friday, Bristol police officers responded to a call about an intoxicated woman sleeping at City Sports. The woman, identified as 22-year-old Kelsey James, was taken to Bristol Hospital for treatment and evaluation, according to a Bristol police press release. More than five hours later, James was lucid and asked hospital staff about her 2-year-old daughter, police said. Police officers obtained a description of James' car, which was parked in the City Sports parking lot. Police found the toddler sleeping in a car seat. The child was taken to Bristol Hospital for evaluation and was being held for Connecticut child welfare authorities, police said. James, a Bristol resident, was arrested Saturday and charged with risk of injury to a minor and leaving an unsupervised child in a motor vehicle. She was released on a $50,000 surety bond for appearance in Bristol Superior Court on September 2, police said. Attempts to reach James for comment were unsuccessful. Should the government step in to prevent hot car deaths? On Wednesday, the Connecticut medical examiner ruled the death of a 15-month-old boy who was left in his father's car in July a homicide. The cause of Benjamin Seitz's death was hyperthermia because of environmental exposure, the state medical examiner said. On July 7, Kyle Seitz was supposed to drop his son off at day care in Ridgefield, Connecticut, but the dropoff never occurred, his wife, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz told CNN last month. Seitz drove to work, and at the end of the day, picked Ben up at day care, only to realize he was not there. That was when Seitz found his son in the car. He rushed the child to the hospital, but Ben had died. No criminal charges have beeen filed in the boy's death, but state prosecutors said the investigation was continuing. Benjamin Seitz's death came in the wake of the June case of 22-month-old Cooper Harris, whose death after being left in a hot car in Georgia drew international attention.","Police say mother was in bar while daughter slept in car .

"(CNN) -- In 2011, Brittany Miles considered food to be her enemy. Having been tormented by schoolmates for being overweight since she was 7, she decided to fight back the only way she knew how. At the beginning of her senior year of high school, at a size 18, Miles began compulsively dieting and exercising. By the time she started college the following year, she was down to a size 4 and was obsessed with losing weight. ""Our society and my peers told me that I wasn't loveable when I was fat. That when I was fat, I couldn't be anything else,"" said Miles, now a senior and a biology major at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. ""So, I was determined to be the farthest thing from fat possible."" She began what she called a war against calories, and it quickly spiraled out of control. She limited herself to 400 to 600 calories and did 90 minutes of intense cardio daily. Yet at her lightest, Miles never dropped below a size 4. ""Just because my bone structure stopped me from being the size 00 everyone pictures, doesn't mean that I wasn't in an incredibly unsafe and unhealthy place,"" she said. Although she was 15 pounds underweight, no one caught onto her habits because they were too busy praising her for her weight loss. ""We constantly push people to lose weight, but sometimes that's not right for everyone,"" Miles said. In the United States, some 20 million women and another 10 million men suffer from a clinical eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia, according to the National Eating Disorder Association. Many people also struggle with some form of body dissatisfaction or unhealthy eating behaviors that can lead to the development of clinical disorders. Studies suggest half a million teens are suffering from eating disorders, and that their concerns about weight begin as young as 6. Going to extremes: Eating disorders in America . Miles says she didn't treat her body like she loved it when she began to lose weight. ""I deprived it, punished it and tortured it,"" Miles said. ""I was convinced that a smaller dress size was the key to happiness."" Breaking the cycle . The day after Miles moved into her college dorm, she said hello to a girl down the hall who was moving in with the help of her family. Her hall mate's sister noticed that Miles was unnaturally thin. A recovering bulimic who was studying to be an eating disorder psychiatrist, the sister had a feeling about Miles and asked the hall mate to keep an eye on her. After only a few months, the hall mate realized that Miles wasn't in a good place, mentally or physically. Her restrictive diet and obsessive exercise was obvious, so she confronted Miles on the issue, finally allowing her to get it all out. ""The thing about eating disorders is that you realize you have one. You don't need someone to tell you that you're sick,"" Miles said. ""What I needed was someone to understand and to help me understand that weight gain was OK."" The process was slow and difficult. She spent the first six months convincing herself that things such as pizza and chocolate were OK -- that eating them wouldn't be the end of the world. Over time, she began to exercise less, eat more and reshape her attitudes toward food and her body. ""During recovery, you realize that you have to make a choice,"" Miles said. ""You can choose to try and fit some predetermined mold, or you can focus on being the happiest and healthiest, both mentally and physically, version of yourself."" While Miles said starting her recovery was the hardest thing she's done, she also knows it was necessary to get her life back. She found support in an online community, a judgment-free zone where she could voice her fears. Miles says that the people she communicated with weren't experts but real people who had been where she was and could share their own experiences. She's gained 60 pounds since she began recovery and has maintained her weight for 15 months now. Currently wearing between a size 10 and 14, she says the most important part is that she's happy and her body seems to ""like to be this weight."" ""At the end of the day, weight doesn't even really matter in an eating disorder because it's a mental disease,"" Miles said. ""Yes, there's a physical manifestation of this mental illness, but it's not a problem that stems from your physical health."" A complex illness . Many people with eating disorders don't look like they have one, said Claire Mysko of the National Eating Disorder Association. It's important to remember that there's no universal picture of how anorexia or bulimia manifests itself physically, she says, and that a person can be struggling mentally without looking ""sick."" ""Eating disorders are complex illnesses with complex roots,"" she said. ""There's a strong cultural influence to be thin, and many people are vulnerable to that."" Most people can't overcome an eating disorder on their own and need professional help. On its website, the association offers several options to find help, such as phone support, live chats with counselors and referrals for treatment and support groups. There's a link between issues such as depression or anxiety and eating disorders, Mysko said. The media and popular culture often push the message that thinness is the solution to any and all problems, she said, and a person suffering from depression can be easily influenced by that. Mysko oversees Proud2BeMe, a site working in conjunction with her eating association that was formed in 2011 in response to the increasing use of the Internet to promote eating disorders and unrealistic body images. ""There's a proliferation of messages on social media and a steady stream of images that promote weight loss,"" Mysko said. ""But we're also seeing an increase in online communities that have positive messages and offer support to those suffering from eating disorders."" For more fitspiration, subscribe to our Flipboard magazine . Another upside to social media is that users have the ability to curate their own feeds, choosing the people and groups that they want to appear in their news feed. For someone in recovery or struggling with an eating disorder, the ability to ""turn off"" the negative pictures and messages can be a big step in the right direction, Mysko said. ""There's no straight line to recovery,"" she said. However, the first step is reaching a place where they want help and seeking that support from friends, family or through a doctor or counselor. Paying it forward . Miles now hosts a site on Tumblr that encourages people to embrace their bodies and reminds them that eating disorders don't manifest themselves in a certain appearance. She said beginning her own blog was her way of supporting other people in her situation, especially those who recover to be plus-sized. She no longer sees food as her nemesis and eats what makes her happy, not letting calories control the choices she makes. She's proud that she's experienced foods that she wouldn't have dared to eat during her illness. ""People who don't know me look at me now and see a 'before' photo. Little do they know that I'm an 'after' photo over 14 years in the making."" Now 21 and loving her body, she's no longer the insecure 7-year-old who was bullied at school. ""I believe that body positivity is for everyone. There is no weight limit or fitness test in order to be happy with yourself.""","Never a size 0, Brittany Miles says her eating disorder went unnoticed for years .

"New York (CNN) -- For more than 200 years, it lay hidden beneath the ground upon which New York City's World Trade Center once stood. Now, four years after its discovery, scientists say they've solved the mystery of the ship hull found in the wreckage of the former World Trade Center site in lower Manhattan. The hull, originally found by archeologists monitoring the site's excavation, has been traced back to colonial-era Philadelphia, according to researchers at the Tree Ring Research Laboratory at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University. ""An old growth forest in the Philadelphia area supplied the white oak used in the ship's frame and ... the trees were probably cut in 1773 or so -- a few years before the bloody war that established America's independence from Britain,"" according to a statement from the scientists. Researchers used a process known as ""dendroprovenancing"" to determine the hull's origins, whereby tree rings from wood samples were analyzed and referenced against several other historical tree chronologies. ""Trees respond to climate each year and that pattern of rings created within the tree produces a signature for that species in a forest or region,"" said Neil Pederson, a research scientist on the study. ""We took oak samples from the World Trade Center vessel and made a record of growth through time. We then compared it to independent records of white oak that we had."" Researchers looked at oak chronologies from Boston through Virginia, but their analysis found that the samples had the greatest compatibility with trees in eastern Pennsylvania, particularly in the Philadelphia area dating in the latter part of the 18th century. Scientists also found that the same kind of oak trees used to build the ship were also likely used to build Philadelphia's Independence Hall, where the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776, the study said. The ship was found approximately 6.7 meters, or nearly 22 feet below ground, just south of where the World Trade Center towers stood before they were toppled in the September 11, 2001, terror attacks. It was not detected during earlier construction. ""It's such an intense site already based on its recent history, so to be in the midst of this urban, modern, very fraught location, and then to be sitting on what was a river bottom, with clams and fish, and the smell of low tide, was really an amazing juxtaposition,"" said Molly McDonald, an archeologist with the environmental consulting firm AKRF, who was among those who discovered the ship's hull in the wreckage in 2010. Archeologists typically perform basic research to determine whether a construction site could be sensitive for archeological reasons, said McDonald. She and her colleagues had been at ground zero to monitor construction for any potential finds. ""Early one morning, we were monitoring and suddenly saw this curved timber come up,"" she recalled. ""It was clear to me that it was part of a ship, so we stopped the backhoes and starting hand digging."" The ship has been tentatively identified as a Hudson River sloop, which researchers say was designed by the Dutch to carry passengers and cargo over the river's rocky shallows. After being in use for 20 to 30 years, the ship is believed to have sailed to lower Manhattan, where it was eventually sunk, either deliberately or by accident, and ultimately buried by trash and other fill materials purposely used to extend Manhattan's shoreline. ""Abundant fill materials such as rocks, earth, and refuse were placed behind wooden barriers or within wood structures to create new land. Earlier wharfs and abandoned merchant ships were often a component of the fill in newly constructed land,"" according to the study. The majority of the ship remains are currently being stored at Texas A&M University, said Jason Conwall, spokesman for Empire State Development. The Lower Manhattan Development Corp., created in the aftermath of 9/11 to help plan the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan, is a subsidiary of Empire State Development, owns the ship. ""We're working on potential options for the future which could potentially include preservation of the ship, but right now, set plans are still being determined,"" Conwall said. For Pederson and fellow researchers, the ship's discovery and the investigation that followed has provided data that may prove useful for further research. ""The beauty of dendrochronology is that we can actually use those same samples to understand past climate change and the ecology of forests. The response to our work has been really big, bigger than we expected,"" Pederson said. ""For us, we have this really rich data set from the World Trade Center ship that we can use for future work. In a way, the ship lives on."" A U-boat and its American prey haunt Gulf of Mexico . Explorer: Underwater pirates looted what he says is likely Santa Maria .

"(CNN) -- They were ""wiseguys"" or ""goodfellas,"" the federal government said Thursday of five reputed mobsters indicted in connection with a string of unsolved crimes, including the fabled 1978 Lufthansa heist at JFK International Airport. In an indictment that reads like the script of ""Goodfellas,"" alleged mob captain Vincent Asaro, 78, and other alleged members of the Bonanno organized crime family are accused of murder, racketeering, armed robbery, arson and extortion. In the infamous Lufthansa robbery, a band of robbers stole about $5 million in cash and nearly $1 million in jewels from an airline cargo building in the largest cash robbery in the nation's history at the time. The robbery was part of the story in Martin Scorsese's 1990 ""Goodfellas"" film about organized crime in New York. And Thursday's indictment opened with a primer on the hierarchical structure of the mob or ""La Cosa Nostra"" and one of its most notorious families, the Bonnanos, with explanations of the roles of its boss, ""consigliere"" or underboss, administrations, crews, captains, soldiers, associates and ""goodfellas."" ""As alleged, Vincent Asaro devoted his adult life to the Bonanno crime family, with a criminal career that spanned decades,"" Loretta Lynch, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, said in a statement. ""Far from a code of honor, theirs was a code of violence and brute force. Those suspected of cooperating with law enforcement paid with their lives."" She added, ""Neither age nor time dimmed Asaro's ruthless ways, as he continued to order violence to carry out mob business in recent months."" Also charged in the indictment were fellow Bonanno family members or associates: Asaro's son, Jerome, Jack Bonventre, Thomas ""Tommy D"" Di Fiore and John ""Bazoo"" Ragano. Four of the five defendants pleaded not guilty Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Marilyn Go, who said that no bail would be set now because of the violent nature of the charges. Bonventre, who was not arraigned Thursday because his lawyer was unavailable, will be arraigned Friday. The defendant did not appear in court. Vincent Asaro's lawyer, Gerald McMahon, arrived in the crowded courtroom with a large plastic bag filled with prescription drugs for his client, who, he said, had triple bypass surgery in March. The courtroom was filled with Asaro family members and federal agents. ""Vincent Asaro said that we are going to trial on this case -- there will be no plea,"" said McMahon, who joked that the indictment was giving Scorsese the basis for a sequel to ""Goodfellas."" ""Short of a dismissal, there will be a trial. McMahon said his client has high blood pressure in addition to the recent triple bypass. ""We're gonna try to put together a sufficient bail package so he can get bail,"" he said. ""But he's not a very wealthy man, unfortunately ... My client isn't in the position to put $10 million on the government's table, either for bail or for some sort of a special deal."" Of his client's alleged involvement in the fabled heist, McMahon said: ""Innocence. Pure, actual innocence. He didn't do it, had nothing to do with it. Pretty much all the people that did it got murdered ... So, the fact that my client didn't get murdered would suggest that he didn't have anything to do with it, so I'll start right there."" Vincent Asaro is the first accused mobster to face charges in the Lufthansa heist. Ed McDonald, a former federal prosecutor who investigated the Lufthansa heist, told CNN that authorities were able to confirm at least eight killings reportedly connected to the robbery. ""You know at the time it was an extraordinarily big deal,"" said McDonald, who played himself in the film. ""It was the largest robbery in the history of the United states. For whatever reason, the tabloids in New York took a fancy to this case. They were fascinated by it, and what was happening was that a lot of the people who were allegedly involved in the robbery in some form ... were turning up dead."" The only person convicted in connection with the JFK heist was Louis Werner, a Lufthansa cargo agent, McDonald said. Werner, who was arrested a few months after the robbery, was convicted of being the ""inside man"" who provided information that helped the robbers carry out the heist, McDonald said. Other crimes described in the indictment also sound similar to events portrayed in the film -- a 1969 murder, burning a New York building and a racketeering operation that used threats of violence to extort money from victims. ""These 'goodfellas' thought they had a license to steal, a license to kill, and a license to do whatever they wanted,"" George Venizelos, assistant director-in-charge of the FBI's New York office. ""However, today's arrests of the five members of the Bonanno crime family brings an end to their violent and ruthless ways.""

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. government is stepping up efforts to collect intelligence on Syrian training camps and Americans returning from Syria amid concern that U.S. citizens fighting alongside extremists might later conduct attacks back home. ""The FBI and other members of the intelligence community have made this a top priority and are taking whatever steps they can under the law to monitor and prevent those coming back from doing us harm,"" Assistant Attorney General John Carlin said. The increased intelligence-gathering comes during what Attorney General Eric Holder describes as a ""dangerous time"" for the United States. In an interview with ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday, Holder estimated there are about 7,000 foreign fighters in Syria, coming from places like Europe and the United States. ""In some ways, it's more frightening than anything I think I've seen as attorney general,"" he said. ""This is a situation that we can see developing and the potential that I see coming up, the negative potential I see coming out of the facts in Syria and Iraq now, are quite concerning,"" he said. The FBI has dozens of investigations of Americans under way in the United States as the government tries to identify potential suspects even before they travel to Syria so they know if they come back. U.S. officials tell CNN that not all potential suspects are on the no-fly list -- making it harder for investigators to track them. Adding to the worries: thousands of fighters in Syria with European passports who are able to enter the United States. Officials say not all European countries are sharing the names of all of their suspect citizens. Alarms went off when a French Algerian extremist opened fire at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, Belgium, in May. After training in Syria with al Qaeda splinter group ISIS, he traveled through several countries in Europe before he was arrested in France. U.S. officials said it was a wake-up call that borders can be readily crossed. ""We got to make sure we partner with Europe so that know who's coming back,"" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-California, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN's ""New Day"" on Tuesday. ""We need to make sure that they take action against those that are providing material support to terrorism in Syria and elsewhere, because many of the European countries don't even have the laws to allow them to do that."" Meanwhile, the Transportation Security Administration said this month that security screeners at overseas airports may ask U.S.-bound passengers to turn on their cell phones and other electronics to prove they work and aren't explosive devices. The change is part of an update to security measures aimed at combating potential new threats from terrorists in the Middle East and Europe. A senior U.S. official told CNN that part of what prompted the enhanced security measures was intelligence that militants in Syria had details on how to make undetectable bombs. CNN's Pamela Brown, Evan Perez and Dana Ford contributed to this report.","U.S. officials are concerned Americans could return to conduct homeland attacks .

"(CNN) -- The gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a moving bus in New Delhi in December 2012 marked a sharp turning point for the debate on women's rights in India. The protests that exploded nationwide following the incident brought the issue forcefully to the political table in a way that revealed the power of the Indian masses, according to a prominent advocate for women's rights. ""As women in India, we grow up with constraints; and live with a degree of discrimination and assault,"" says Karuna Nundy, a Supreme Court lawyer, adding that privileged women, who have a significant amount of power, have to deal with it a lot less. ""But when thousands of people came out onto the streets and walked in front of the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the presidential palace, I think it became clear to me that none of us have to deal with this anymore -- that people around the country are standing with us and saying 'enough.'"" That sentiment is shared by the majority of Indians taking part in the country's general election this month, according to a recent public opinion poll. More than 90% of Indian voters see the combating of violence against women as a priority, second only to corruption, the MDRA/Avaaz survey released last week shows. According to the poll, 75% of men and women participating in the largest democratic event in history also believe that the political promises made to advocate women's rights have been inadequate so far. ""The electoral process is a very important time to hold parties to account and to make it clear that politicians will lose their seats if they don't truly represent the aspirations of the people,"" says Nundy. ""Politicians need to respond to that."" So what are some of the main promises being made by the leading election contenders? The three main parties cite similar goals, including enacting the Women's Reservation Bill, which would allocate a third of seats in parliament and state legislatures for women, as well as enforcing fast-track courts -- the same process used to convict the accused men in the gang rape case. The ruling Indian National Congress party, which has been in power for 49 years and is led by Sonia Gandhi, claims it will ensure at least 25% of staff at all police stations are female. The main opposition, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led by Narendra Modi, released its manifesto on the first day of the polls and says women's security is its focus. The recently formed Aam Adme Party (AAP or ""Common Man"" party), born out of a desire to eliminate corruption, enjoyed an astonishing victory in Delhi in the local assembly elections last year. During a news conference in New Delhi on Thursday, the party's leader and former activist Arvind Kejriwal said women's safety is the ""biggest issue which has come to the forefront"" and promised it would be high on the party's agenda. But how convincing are these pledges? ""There have always been throwaway, ad hoc references to realizing women's rights in manifestos in the past,"" says Nundy. ""In this election we see an increase in parties addressing those rights. They're addressing them more frequently but the approach is still ad hoc."" The outcry after the gang rape in Delhi did instigate some change, says Nundy. For instance, under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, stalking and voyeurism have become offenses and it is now possible to file a criminal complaint against a police officer. ""But it's not enough,"" Nundy says. For example, ""marital rape is still not criminalized, it's still explicitly legal. (The law) says it's rape unless the parties are married."" Dissatisfied with the government's efforts, NGOs, women's movements, journalists, economists, academics and lawyers are promoting their ""Womanifesto:"" A six-point plan, first drafted last year, that details what needs to be done within the next five years to improve conditions for India's women and girls. The six points are: Educate for equality; make laws count; put women in power; appoint police for the people; enact swift, certain justice; and ensure a flourishing economy. Nundy, co-founder of the plan, received early confirmation from AAP party leader Kejriwal to commit to the charter. However, the Congress and the BJP are yet to agree. Another motivation for the Womanifesto was to spell out the process in which women's issues should be tackled. Co-contributor Kavita Krishnan, who is also secretary of the AIPWA (All India Progressive Women Association) and national leader of the Communist Party of India (CPIML) says political parties end up ""moral policing women in the name of protecting them"" by imposing dress codes or punishing couples for being intimate in public. Although the mass protests following the Delhi gang rape spurred change, Krishnan argues that the focus of the outcry needs to shift: ""Among the protesters there was still a large number that demanded the death penalty for rapists and little else -- and it is this sentiment that parties tend to play to, pushing patriarchal protectionism rather than women's equality and rights."" Nundy says a drawback in India is action: ""The problem with India is not that we have bad laws; I mean, the laws aren't perfect at all, but the problem is that they aren't implemented."" Another major challenge for the Indian government is the country's 1.2 billion population, with richly diverse religious and cultural practices. Some, such as infanticide and dowry customs, are oppressive for women. So how can any plan accommodate the entire country? Referring to the Womanifesto, Nundy says: ""There would be local discussions about this. This is one page. It can't be the same plan for everyone; India's too big a country. Breaking down (the plan) for local practices and customs would be required."" Priya Nanda, group director at the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), adds: ""Civil society needs to help the government. For certain areas, even the government doesn't have the skills. ""It's not just about running out there and delivering a service or a product. You're building perspectives, trying to change norms and attitudes, so it takes time to do that.""

"(CNN) -- Actor Robin Williams was cremated and his ashes were scattered in San Francisco Bay, according to his death certificate. Williams was found dead in his Northern California home August 11 from what investigators suspect was a suicide by hanging. The certificate, obtained by CNN on Thursday, says his ashes were scattered off the coast one day later. It also says the cause of death is ""pending investigation.""

"(CNN) -- Karry Trout's first patient was a 38-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer. The patient had waited nearly six months after feeling a lump in her breast to visit the doctor. She had no health insurance. It was Trout's job, as Mason General Hospital's patient navigator, to guide the single mother through treatment and, hopefully, into recovery. Patient navigation is a relatively new field in the health care industry. A navigator's primary role is to remove the obstacles patients face in accessing or receiving treatment. More hospitals are creating these positions to help patients traverse an often-confusing medical system. Despite her inexperience, Trout could relate to the fear she saw in the patient's eyes. ""I know what the shock of a diagnosis is like. I know what the waiting and the unknowns are like,"" she says. ""I haven't experienced it personally, but I think sometimes it's worse when it's your child going through it."" Trout's daughter, Ella, was almost 8 months old when doctors first spotted a problem. One of Ella's eyes wasn't tracking properly, and soon after it started to bulge. Doctors at Seattle Children's Hospital diagnosed an optic glioma, or a tumor growing around the nerve that connects the eye to the brain. By the time she was 18 months old, Ella had lost sight in both eyes. Ella went through four years of chemotherapy, several major surgeries and six weeks of radiation all before the age of 7. New to Shelton, Washington, and a single mother, Trout struggled to keep Ella's frequent doctor appointments in Seattle, about two hours from home, as well as work a full-time job as a radiologist for Mason General and juggle never-ending insurance forms. ""It's a lot,"" Trout says. ""And when you are going through that diagnosis, and then you have all of that on top of it, it can be very overwhelming."" 4 ways to control your health care costs . Four years ago, Trout got a notice from the Susan G. Komen foundation about a grant for breast cancer patient navigation. What on earth is patient navigation? she wondered. After a bit of research, Trout realized what had been missing from her experience with Ella. ""I didn't have somebody who was my go-to person,"" she says. Trout applied for the grant, and Mason General was awarded enough money to start a program. In her role as a patient navigator, Trout does community outreach to raise awareness about the importance of breast cancer screening. She is one of the first staff members to meet with a patient after a diagnosis, providing them with information that they can read later when the shock has worn off. She works with specialists to arrange appointments and helps connect women with financial aid, transportation or child care if they need it. ""When you get that initial diagnosis, you just have a lot of questions,"" she says. ""And it's hard to pick up the phone and speak to your physician or nurse every time you have a question. That's what I'm here for."" Patient navigation programs are the result of the medical community's new emphasis on patient-centered care, says Mandi Pratt, associate director of community programs at George Washington University's Cancer Institute. ""Patient navigation, in part, is a function of how fragmented our (health care) system is,"" Pratt says. ""It makes it difficult to have a seamless experience."" Are we prepared for 18 million cancer survivors? Advocates say patient-centered care can improve outcomes and reduce costs, so much so that hospital reimbursement from insurance companies is now partially tied to patients' opinions on how well a facility treated them. In 2011, the American College of Surgeons' Commission on Cancer established new accreditation standards for cancer facilities, requiring them to incorporate ""a patient navigation process to address health care disparities and barriers to care."" The standards move us closer to a future Dr. Harold Freeman first envisioned in the 1980s. Freeman then was a breast cancer surgeon in Harlem, New York, trying to figure out why patients in his hospital had a five-year survival rate of 39% when it should have been closer to 85%. Freeman realized many patients were being diagnosed with late-stage breast cancers; they were arriving at the clinic with large masses that had obviously been ignored. Freeman identified five main barriers his patients faced in receiving care: financial, communication, medical system, psychological and personal. Obstacles ranged from not having health insurance to not understanding the language. Some patients feared doctors or mistrusted medical advice. Others simply missed chemotherapy because they couldn't find child care. ""People got lost in the complex system,"" Freeman says. In 1990, he pioneered the first-ever patient navigation program, training people from the community to listen and answer questions after a diagnosis. He also began an educational program to advocate for screenings. Over time he increased patients' five-year survival rate in the same population to 70%. These barriers are never going to go away completely, Freeman says, but patient navigation can help address them. ""Can you eliminate poverty? Probably not ... but you can change the things that poverty means,"" he says. ""If poor people are less educated, you can educate poor people. If poor people don't have access to screening, diagnosis or treatment, you can create programs to concentrate on those one by one."" For now, patient navigation is primarily being used in the cancer community, but it's spreading to other chronic diseases. Even patient navigation, Freeman says, falls prey to our fragmented system -- one filled with specialists that each operate in a separate universe. 5 million more people living with diabetes . Freeman compares the care continuum, from the first examination to survivorship, to a mile relay. ""It takes teams of people passing batons one to the other until the last runner crosses the finish line."" Since starting the patient navigator program at Mason General, Trout has helped hundreds of women cross that finish line. She often receives letters of thanks from patients who say she helped them feel empowered to make informed decisions in a time of chaos. ""I think when you go through things as a patient, you know, as a parent -- to be able to be treated with compassion and not just (as) another diagnosis is a gift,"" Trout says. ""And that's what I hope I provide."" Let's talk about sex ... and cancer .","More hospitals are hiring patient navigators to help patients through a confusing system .

"Antananarivo, Madagascar (CNN) -- With their unique shape and imposing stature, the majestic baobab trees have been an icon of Madagascar's landscape for centuries, unmovable symbols of the tropical island's luscious scenery. Six out of the eight species of the long-lived tree are endemic to Madagascar, the island country located in the Indian Ocean off the southeastern coast of Africa. The stunning country is home to a rich ecosystem that boasts an incredible mosaic of animal and plant life evolved for tens of millions of years in complete isolation. As a result 90% of Madagascar's wildlife exists nowhere else on the planet. In the midst of it all, the mighty baobab has stood tall for generations, its barrel-like trunk reaching a height of 18 meters. Often described as ""the upside down tree"" due to its unusual shape -- the tree's branches look like roots sticking up in the air -- the baobab has sparked many legends throughout the centuries. An ancient myth goes that when the gods planted the trees, they kept walking away so they placed them upside down. Read related: Madagascar's 'lemur lady' on saving endangered animals . Communities in Madagascar, one of the poorest countries in the world, have long been benefiting from the deciduous trees -- their fruits are edible, their leaves are used for medicinal purposes, while their large trunks are often excavated to serve as shelters or store water during dry periods. ""There are many interactions with the life of community living around forest,"" explains botanist Jimmy Razafitsalama. ""First, they use the bark for the construction of their house and then they use leaves as medicinal plants. They eat also the fruit because the fruit are very rich in vitamins and don't forget also it's one of the attraction for tourists to come here."" But while tourism proceeds can generate income for people often living on less than $2 a day, many other human activities are posing a serious threat to the baobab trees and the island's one-of-a-kind ecosystem. Largely dependent on the island's natural resources, many rural communities in Madagascar have to make ends meet by exploiting the land that surrounds them -- the country is estimated to have lost 90% of its forest to deforestation over the years. Environmentalists say that activities like slash-and-burn agriculture -- where an area of forest is cut and burned to create fields -- logging for timber and fuelwood and charcoal production are all destroying the island's beautiful rainforests and their endemic biodiversity. ""They cut the trees down to clear the land for agriculture or for grazing their animals,"" says Razafitsalama, who has moved to the island's northernmost part near the city of Diego Suarez to teach locals about biodiversity. In recent years, authorities in Madagascar have taken up a series of initiatives to save its precious forests. The country has launched several conservation and reforestation projects and has also marked many regions in the country as national parks, attracting ecotourists from across the world. Razafitsalama says that more needs to be done to safeguard the future of the baobab trees and the vast array of unique species living in Madagascar's forests. ""Now the government they want to increase the surface of protected areas. They made a big effort but right now I see for baobab it's not yet representative,"" he says. ""A good example is this forest in front of us -- it is not protected but this has the highest concentration of population of this endemic species."" Unless more action is taken and behaviors change, Madagascar, one of the world's true biodiversity hotspots, will risk losing more of its forests, putting in danger the survival of its unique species.","Six out of the eight species of the baobab tree are endemic to Madagascar .

"(EW.com) -- It's not an easy thing, to finish a movie without one of your lead actors. When Heath Ledger died midway through filming ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,"" director Terry Gilliam seized on the film's magical-real aesthetic and finished off the movie with Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp fake-Shemping Ledger. When Oliver Reed died before filming key scenes in ""Gladiator,"" Ridley Scott pasted Reed's head onto a body double using digital effects. It's a tricky thing, morbid and money-grubbing but also well-intentioned and even a little sacred. You want to honor the dead actor's final work; but you also want to finish your movie. River Phoenix and Marilyn Monroe died too early to salvage ""Dark Blood"" or ""Something's Got to Give;"" a tragedy for many reasons, not least because they both looked much better than ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.""

Paul Walker died in November with filming only half-finished, although given the age we live in fans had already seen Walker on set and in character.

And after all, the ""Fast"" franchise was something like Walker's life's work. But that opened up all kinds of creative problems for the Fast filmmakers â€” particularly since everyone attached to the film been proclaiming that ""Fast 7"" is an attempt at world-building towards a new trilogy. (Translation: They probably already had half-sketched plans for Brian O'Conner in Fast 10.) According to the Hollywood Reporter, the crew behind ""Fast 7"" has opted to ""retire"" Brian O'Conner. He will specifically not be killed off, according to the Reporter's sources. Universal had no comment on the report, but the rumor smells true. Given the high-speed nature of Paul Walker's death, it probably felt like bad taste to kill a character played by Walker in a movie about cars driving very fast. Still, it's difficult to imagine how O'Conner will leave the series. The franchise has a well-stated commitment to Family, and ""Furious 6"" reaffirmed the central tenet â€” sentimental, but full-hearted â€” that the characters will die for each other, even after they've ridden into several different last-big-score sunsets.

"(CNN) -- Brazil welcomed the world with a carnival of color as the greatest football tournament on earth began Thursday. Fans packed into the stadium in Sao Paulo ahead of the World Cup's opening game between the host nation and Croatia, witnessing a spectacular opening ceremony. The show, which comprised of a three-part exploration of Brazilian life, began with a journey into the Amazon rainforest with walking trees and dancing flowers. The South American country's diversity was embraced in the second part, with all facets of its culture and traditions celebrated with dancing and maracas. The ceremony, which cost $9 million, was brought to an end by a performance from Jennifer Lopez, rapper Pitbull and Brazilian singer Claudia Leitte with a rendition of the official World Cup song ""We Are One."" Join our live World Cup blog coverage . It is the culmination of a seven-year buildup to football's global showpiece which has been plagued by mass protests about the estimated $11 billlion cost of staging the tournament and concerns that stadiums and crucial infrastructure would not be completed in time. All this could be forgotten when Luis Felipe Scolari's beloved ""Selecao"" kicks off at 2000GMT in the Corinthians Stadium in its Group A opener -- the first of 64 games in a month long festival of football which culminates in the final in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday July 13. Brazil is favorite from the 32 nations to be crowned world champions again and coach Luis Felipe Scolari is urging supporters to unite behind his team in its quest for glory. ""To all Brazilians I want to tell you the time has arrived. This is our World Cup,"" said Scolari, who led Brazil to its last triumph in the 2002 World Cup. ""The first step is Croatia,"" added Brazil coach. ""After that we have six steps that we want to go up if we want to win the World Cup."" Scolari's team, inspired by key player Neymar, won last year's Confederations Cup, beating reigning world champion Spain in the final, but the action on the field was overshadowed at times by violent protests with over one million people taking to the streets in cities across the country. The protesters were angered by the poor state of Brazil's public services, the resentment increased by allegations of corruption and the ever-increasing price tag for staging the 2014 World Cup. Brazil's president Dilma Rousseff, mindful of the damage to the reputation of her country, has ordered a big security operation with a reported 150,000 soldiers and police deployed as well as 20,000 private security officers. And in an early sign that authorities will crack down hard on protests, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at a small scale demonstration Thursday about 11 kilometers from the stadium. Two CNN journalists sustained minor injuries in the incident and at least one person was arrested. Watch: CNN reporter hurt in tear gas incident . Rousseff will welcome a host of world leaders and dignitaries to the opening ceremony in Sao Paulo which precedes the first action on the pitch in the 65,000 capacity stadium. Aside from the difficulties encountered by the host nation, the world governing body FIFA has garnered unfavorable media headlines over its handling of corruption allegations in the award of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. Its 78-year-old president Sepp Blatter has faced down a revolt by European football officials by announcing his intention Wednesday to stand for re-election for fifth term next year. ""My mission is not over,"" he announced to FIFA's 64th Congress in Sao Paulo. For the millions of football fans in Brazil and the estimated 600,000 foreign supporters who have come to cheer on their heroes, such political considerations may well be of secondary importance once the action starts in earnest at 12 venues across a vast country. Vicente del Bosque's Spain will be bidding to become the first European side to win a World Cup in South America, which last hosted a tournament in 1978. Spain, twice winner of the European Championships, either side of its triumph in South Africa in 2010, face a tough opener in Group B against the Netherlands in Salvador Friday. The Dutch provided the opposition in the 2010 final where an Andres Iniesta goal gave Spain its 1-0 victory. Traditional footballing powerhouses Argentina and Germany are also expected to mount strong challenges to the likes of the hosts and Spain, but teams from Africa and Asia have also sprung upsets in recent World Cups.","Hosts Brazil kicks off World Cup 2014 against Croatia .

"(CNN) -- What's going on in Ferguson? It's been nine days since Michael Brown was killed, and his family is still waiting for information from investigators about what happened to their young man. Eyewitnesses and cell phone videos recount the minutes after his death --before Brown lay dead for five hours, uncovered in the street -- but the state can't provide the family with any information? No state autopsy reports. No witness statements. No grand jury indictment. No nothing. There's something seriously wrong here. Imagine having to conduct an autopsy on your son while his body lies in a funeral home so you can know how he died before you bury him. The Ferguson Police Department was implicated in racial profiling in a 2013 Attorney General of Missouri report, so how can anyone possibly think they would want to investigate one of their own in a shooting? The FBI should have been on hand from the beginning. While the National Guard is deploying to Ferguson, I implore local law enforcement to deploy common sense -- withdraw from the investigation. State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, appointed to coordinate security operations, has been a tremendously important presence in the community and now we need the same on the prosecutorial side. The attorney general should immediately appoint a special prosecutor working jointly with the Justice Department. The community needs this. The first and ""very preliminary"" autopsy results have just been released, and they paint a very grim picture of how Michael Brown died: He was shot at least six times, including twice in the head, according to acclaimed pathologist Dr. Michael M. Baden, who conducted the autopsy at the request of Michael Brown's family. (Let that sink in, the family had to hire a private pathologist to get answers.) At least one of the bullets appear to have entered and exited several times, shattering Brown's right eye, traveling through his face, leaving through the jawbone and re-entering through his collarbone, said Baden. The final shot was apparently the fatal one, which hit Brown on the top of the head. With 50 years of experience (he has conducted some 20,000 autopsies), Baden spoke with calming authority about his findings; he said that the state medical examiner was a trusted colleague who would likely make very similar findings. But since Baden did not have access to Michael Brown's clothing (to examine gun powder residue), or X-rays, or witness statements, or toxicology reports (and I can't help but wonder why he wasn't given access to this), he could not respond to the calls for justice in Ferguson. He said that Brown was shot from anywhere between one foot and 30 feet away. He said bullet wounds to Brown's arms could have been sustained by Brown putting his hands up or making a defensive gesture by crossing his arms. From where I sit, six bullets pumped into an unarmed kid in broad daylight is excessive force. But that only moves us slightly closer to truth. The eyewitness' accounts vary so widely -- and eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable, often refuted by the scientific evidence produced at trial. At least one witness, Piaget Crenshaw, told CNN that it ""looked as if"" the officer tried to pull Brown into the car, then was ""chasing after the boy"" until Brown turned around and was shot. But others say Brown was shot in the back. At the moment, the case hinges on the accounts of two conflicting witnesses: Dorian Johnson and Officer Darren Wilson. Johnson was walking with Brown when the shooting occurred and gave this account, reported by MSNBC: . Johnson said a police officer approached as he and Brown were walking in the middle of the street and told them to use the sidewalk. They complied, and the officer began to drive away, but then threw his car into reverse and came back alongside the teens, nearly hitting them. Johnson said he heard Wilson say something like ""What'd you say?"" before trying to open his car door and slamming it into Brown. Then, Johnson said, the officer reached out and grabbed Brown by the neck with his left hand. The two men struggled briefly, and then Wilson, still in his car, shot Brown once, Johnson said. Johnson said that he and Brown ""took off running together,"" but Brown was shot a second time ""striking him in the back,"" he said. After the second shot, Brown turned around, putting his hands in the air and saying, ""I don't have a gun. Stop shooting!"" according to Johnson. He said that Wilson then approached Brown and fired several more shots until he ""crumbled into a fetal position."" As the news conference for the autopsy was taking place, a caller to a St. Louis radio station, who identified herself only as ""Josie,"" told listeners she knew Wilson's side of the story. Here is a summary of what she said: . He says the boys were walking in the street, Wilson rolled the window down and told them to get out of street. Wilson may have called for backup when he pulled over. He heard the call for the strong armed robbery and saw the teens carrying something that might have been cigars. He pulled over and when he tried to get out of the car, twice he was pushed back into the car by Michael Brown. Brown then punched him in the face and Wilson reached for his gun. Brown grabbed the gun and at one point had the gun pushed again Wilson's hip so Wilson pushed the gun away and the gun went off. Brown and his friend ran and Wilson got out of the car and pursued. He told them to freeze and Brown and his friend turned around. Brown started to taunt him, then bum rushed Wilson, coming at him full speed. Wilson started shooting. Wilson said the final shot was in the forehead and Brown fell two or three feet in front of the officer. A source with detailed knowledge of the investigation into the shooting told CNN that ""this account is accurate."" Where witness accounts differ, an autopsy can provide certainty, as it will allow us to recreate the crime scene and -- with certainty -- know how far apart the men where, what Brown was doing when he was shot and whether he ever had his hand on Wilson's gun. There was one important question that Baden could answer for certain. Michael's mother wanted to know whether her son had suffered when he died. Baden assured her that the bullet to the head had rendered him unconscious and in his opinion ""he had not suffered."" I hope the local authorities recuse themselves from the investigation and turn it over to a special prosecutor with the attorney general. And for crying out loud, hurry up and complete the three autopsies, the investigation and the grand jury proceedings. What Ferguson and Michael Brown's family need right now are answers, and until we have them, there will be nothing but more heartbreak, chaos and uncertainty.","Mel Robbins: 9 days later, investigators still haven't told Brown family what happened .

"(CNN) -- Iceland's Meteorological Office on Sunday lowered the aviation threat level from the Bardarbunga volcano from the highest level, red, down to orange. With the lowering of the aviation threat level, all restrictions on air travel in Iceland have now been canceled and all airports in the country are open, according to the government. On Saturday, the agency raised the alert level for Bardarbunga to red, which means an eruption is imminent or in progress. But the country's Civil Protection Department said on its website Sunday that a subglacial eruption, thought to be under way Saturday, did not occur. The department said the seismic activity recorded under the ice cap of a glacier there could be something else, although an eruption is still possible. Seismic activity continues at the volcano, with two large earthquakes hitting overnight. Both measured over a 5 magnitude, the Civil Protection Department said. Scientists have noticed an increase in seismic activity over the past seven years around the volcano, located in the northwestern region of the Vatnajokull glacier, one of Europe's largest glaciers, the Meteorological Office said. The level dropped a little after the eruption of another volcano at the same glacier, Grimsvotn, in 2011, but has since picked up again. According to the Smithsonian Institute Global Volcanism Program, Bardarbunga last erupted in 1910. If it should blow its top again, it could be bad news for travelers. Volcanic ash can be a serious hazard to aircraft, reducing visibility, damaging flight controls and ultimately causing jet engines to fail.

"(CNN) -- A Baltimore police officer faces felony animal cruelty charges after he slit the throat of a dog that had escaped from home, authorities said. Nala, a 7-year-old Chinese shar-pei breed, went missing Saturday from her home in Baltimore. The same day, officers responded to a call that a dog had bitten a woman. The dog was Nala, whom police restrained using a pole around her neck, authorities said. Shortly afterward, Officer Jeffrey Bolger cut Nala's throat with a knife, even though she was contained, according to police spokesman Eric Kowalczy. She later died. ""It was a complete violation of protocol,"" Kowalczy said. ""It's not often police speak out against one of their own, but we are all truly appalled."" Just before they got to the scene, Bolger was overheard saying, ""I'm going to gut this (expletive) thing,"" according to charging documents. Nala's owner, Sarah Gossard, said police did not give her details on how Nala died until Wednesday. ""She went missing Saturday and after looking for her all day, I found out through a neighbor that she was put down,"" she said. ""Police never contacted me until today. Only after did I find out more details. I learned from the news that she was stabbed in the throat. I want justice."" Gossard said Nala was not a violent dog. ""She was just scared that day and through all of those events -- scared and lost, thirsty, hungry,"" she told CNN affiliate WBAL. ""Yes I'm very sure that she bit someone, but the actions after that were not OK."" Bolger has been with the Baltimore Police Department since 1992. He was suspended without pay, arrested and charged, the Police Department said. The woman who was bitten suffered a puncture wound on her hand and is fine, Kowalczy said.

"(CNN) -- Money, prestige and race are front and center in an ongoing controversy surrounding one of the most expensive prep schools in the country and its former student-body president. Maya Peterson was the first black female student president of The Lawrenceville School, an affluent academy for boarding and day students located in New Jersey. This March, after Peterson mocked her white male classmates on Instagram, she claims she was asked to step down or face disciplinary action. According to reports, Peterson took the first option and resigned under administrative pressure. The Instagram photos that led to Peterson's ouster are seemingly harmless: Peterson is dressed in stereotypical preppy male clothing, holding a hockey stick and staring straight into the camera. But with added hashtags including ""#confederate,"" ""#romney2016"" and ""#peakedinhighschool"" some Lawrenceville students thought the pictures were offensive. ""You're the student body president, and you're mocking and blatantly insulting a large group of the school's male population,"" one student commented on the photo. Some took it further. On the school's Facebook alumni page, comments included some visceral personal attacks calling Peterson ""a racist"" and one post referring to her has a ""miserable person"" and ""spoiled malcontent."" ""The PC policies and diversity for the sake of diversity over the last fifteen years ... have precipitated this sort of event,"" one commenter said. Peterson acknowledged her post could make white students uncomfortable. ""Yes, I am making a mockery of the right-wing, confederate-flag hanging, openly misogynistic Lawrentians,"" Peterson told BuzzFeed. ""If that's a large portion of the school's male population, then I think the issue is not with my bringing attention to it in a lighthearted way, but rather why no one has brought attention to it before."" Peterson could not be reached for comment by CNN as of publication. Posting the Instagram photo was a response to fellow classmates' concerns regarding her yearbook picture, Peterson told BuzzFeed. In the yearbook photo, she and 10 black friends raised their fists in the classic ""black power"" salute. Peterson's point of view is not unfounded, according to other Lawrenceville graduates. Anthony Smith graduated from The Lawrenceville School in 2007 and recounted several instances of racism on campus, in an e-mail exchange with CNN. In some cases racial slurs were directed at him, he said. ""I was really weirded out by how flippantly (racial slurs) were used,"" he said. Other things on campus made him uncomfortable. ""On my way to class and back, I passed by three confederate flags,"" Smith said. Smith noted that, to his knowledge, those responsible for the flags were never punished. ""The fact that Maya and friends were reprimanded for throwing up black power signs that made white students uncomfortable but these white students are never, to my knowledge, reprimanded for making black students uncomfortable is the definition of racism."" A school representative declined to comment on the presence of confederate flags on campus. In a statement, The Lawrenceville School said it ""works hard to foster an inclusive, open and engaging atmosphere that gives all students opportunities to be heard, feel respected and succeed."" Prior to the Instagram photo, Peterson was involved in several controversial incidents, according to BuzzFeed. Soon after Peterson's election, Dean of Students Nancy Thomas told students she had received anonymous photographs that included evidence of marijuana usage and inappropriate tweets by Peterson. As detailed in an article in The Lawrence, the school newspaper, the tweets were found to be fabricated, and Peterson apologized for the drug usage. The yearbook ""salute"" and Instagram photo were the final straw. Peterson was ousted as student-body president. CNN confirmed Peterson has since graduated from The Lawrenceville School. ""I understand why I hurt people's feelings, but I didn't become president to make sure rich white guys had more representation on campus,"" she said. ""Let's be honest. They're not the ones that feel uncomfortable here."" Other students disagree, and believe The Lawrenceville School serves all its students with integrity. Lindsey Gallinek, a 2012 Lawrenceville alumna now at Wake Forest University, posted a response to the BuzzFeed article titled, ""In response to poor reporting."" ""While I may never know what Maya Peterson endured, I do know that Lawrenceville tried to shape us to be the best people we could be,"" she wrote. ""Students were constantly exposed to current events and controversial issues because The Lawrenceville School wanted us to realize that there are still many problems in the world."" Gallinek placed blame with the individual students who broke the school's honor code, including Peterson. ""While Maya Peterson should not have Instagrammed that photo because she was acting as a leader, the students quoted in the article should not have made such strong statements against her."" Even Smith, the 2007 alumnus who remembers instances of racism on the Lawrenceville campus, wanted to stress the kind nature of some faculty members. Smith, who is openly gay, says that during his time there, staff went out of their way to make sure he felt comfortable. One adviser for the Catholic Students Club added ""that's so gay"" to the swear jar to limit bullying. ""I felt so safe,"" Smith said. ""I will never forget that as long as I live."" Even so, he stands with Peterson. ""Being comfortable enough to complain about another student by name in high school is the definition of privilege,"" he said. ""I think that students of color at Lawrenceville stood so much more to lose when complaining about prejudice and discomfort than white students did.""","First black, female student president removed for mocking white classmates at NJ prep school .

"(CNN) -- The recently renewed violence in the Mideast claimed more lives Sunday as Israeli strikes killed at least 16 people in Gaza and a Hamas attack on a border crossing wounded four Israeli civilians. The 16 Palestinian victims included a mother and her three children in their home, said a spokesman for the Ministry of Health, Ashraf al-Qidra. One of the targets was Mohamed Al-Oul, who supervised Hamas' financial transactions, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The IDF said a ""hit was confirmed."" The four Israelis were hit at the border crossing near the town of Erez. THe IDF tweeted that several rockets and mortars struck the checkpoint. One civilian was moderately wounded and three were injured, the IDF said, without elaborating on their conditions. The civilians had come to the crossing to aid people needing humanitarian assistance, Israel's Ministry of Defense said in a written statement. The crossing remains closed. Hamas said it fired 23 mortar shells at the site. At least 117 rockets were fired at Israel on Sunday, the IDF said via its Twitter account. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated before his weekly Cabinet meeting that airstrikes will continue and that Israel targets militants. ""The Hamas is paying and will pay a heavy price for the crimes it is carrying out. I call on the citizens of Gaza to leave every place that the Hamas is carrying out terror activity. Every place like this is a target for us. ... This is true on all fronts and for all countries,"" he said. He compared Hamas to ISIS, the militant group that now calls itself the Islamic State. ""Hamas is ISIS and ISIS is Hamas. They simply work in the same way. They are branches of the same poisonous tree,"" Netanyahu said. Israel, the European Union and the United States consider Hamas a terrorist organization. Al-Qidra told CNN that 92 people in Gaza have been killed since a ceasefire ended five days ago and more than 2,100 have died in this weekslong conflict. There were other effects of the violence, which began in early July. The United Nations, which runs many schools in Gaza, said 500,000 children were unable to begin classes on Sunday. A spokesman for the Palestinian ministry of education said more than 100 government-run schools are closed while others are being used as shelters. Fire from Syria . Also Sunday, the Israeli military said rockets from Syria hit various locations through the Golan Heights. It was unclear who was responsible for the rockets from Syria or whether they had anything to do with Israel's ongoing fight with Hamas that has raged for weeks. The Golan Heights is under Israeli government control but is considered to be occupied territory by the international community. The announcement came hours after a rocket from Lebanon struck an open area in northern Israel in a separate attack. No injuries were immediately reported in either of those attacks. Last month, a rocket was fired into northern Israel from southern Lebanon, and the Israeli military responded with an artillery strike. At the time, Israel said it held the Lebanese government responsible for the attack. Israel has waged an offensive in Gaza against the militant Palestinian group Hamas and the stream of rockets fired into Israel from Gaza. Hopes for a ceasefire appear dim despite calls from world leaders for the two sides to stop the violence. During the offensive, Israel destroyed more than 30 concrete-lined tunnels that led from Gaza into Israel. Sources, including one who witnessed an explosion, told CNN that the Egyptian army Sunday blew up five tunnels on the border with Gaza. Hamas request . Hamas is urging Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to go before the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israeli leaders for war crimes. The Palestinians are not currently under the jurisdiction of the ICC, but would be if they sign the court's Rome Statute, the treaty that established the court. Back in May, a group of 17 human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, signed a letter to Abbas encouraging him to join the ICC. The United States and Israel and some other nations have pressured Abbas not to take this step, arguing that it would harm peace talks. Hamas' announcement comes a day after one of the group's leaders admitted that its militants were responsible for the abduction of three Israeli teens in the West Bank in June. Hamas Political Bureau member Saleh Aruri added that the kidnappers did not tell their leaders about the action. The kidnappings were not approved by Hamas leadership or its military wing, he said, stressing that this acknowledgment does not equate to a claim of responsibility. The three teens were later found dead, sparking the violence that has raged since then. CNN's Ian Lee in Gaza and Michael Schwartz in Jerusalem, and Katia Hetter in Atlanta contributed to this report.","NEW: Sixteen Palestinians killed Sunday, Ministry of Health says .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Actor Mickey Rooney did not want to be buried in a cemetery plot he bought years ago, before splitting with his wife, his lawyer said Wednesday. Rooney, who died of natural causes at age 93 on Sunday, also did not want his stepson Chris Aber to attend his funeral, attorney Michael Augustine said. Rooney's wishes are the basis for a looming court fight over who controls the legendary actor's remains and makes funeral and burial decisions, Augustine said. While Rooney disinherited his children, his wife and all but one of her children in a will he signed just weeks before his death, court papers suggest there is not much in his estate to fight over. His personal property is valued at just $18,000 despite an unmatched 90-year film career. Augustine, who served as Rooney's conservator, said in a court filing that he believed Rooney's estranged wife, Jan Rooney, and her son, Christopher Aber, would attempt to remove Rooney's body from Forest Lawn Memorial Park's mortuary. A Los Angeles judge signed a handwritten order Tuesday preventing anyone from removing Rooney's remains until he holds a hearing on Friday. Augustine, who is named as estate executor in the will, is asking for that authority. Attorney Yevgeny Belous, who works with lawyer Mitchell Karasov to represent Jan Rooney, said she is the only person with authority to make the decisions. Lawyers for both sides are ""working toward the mutual goal of honoring Mickey,"" perhaps with an agreement on funeral and burial arrangements, before Friday's hearing, Belous said. ""We want Mickey to have a proper ceremony,"" he said. ""We don't want to drag this into a fight."" Rooney already purchased burial plots in a cemetery in the Westlake Village area of Los Angeles County. In fact, Rooney's mother was moved there years ago so the family would be together, Belous said. Augustine said Rooney told him shortly before his death that he no longer wanted to be buried in the plot he purchased 15 years earlier. ""Substantial intervening events"" in the years since changed his wishes, but Rooney's lack of cash prevented him from purchasing a new burial plot, he said. Rooney expressed a desire to be interred at either a veteran's cemetery or a Hollywood cemetery with other stars. Hollywood Forever, the final resting place for Rudolph Valentino, Cecil B. DeMille and a long list of long gone show biz A-listers, is one possibility, Augustine said. Augustine said he doubts a deal can be made before the judge imposes a decision, since he is demanding that Aber be banned from the funeral because of Mickey Rooney's severe dislike for the stepson who previously managed him. Rooney won a $2.8 million judgment against Aber in a lawsuit that included accusations of elder abuse. Aber has yet to pay the judgment, Augustine said. Jan Rooney signed an agreement waiving all claims to her husband's estate after the couple separated in June 2012 after 34 years of marriage, according to a court filing. She will benefit from Rooney's Social Security and other pensions totaling $8,400 a month, Augustine said. While Rooney was the highest paid actor in Hollywood 70 years ago, his personal property totaled just $18,000, according to documents accompanying his will. Rooney: A spokesman against elder abuse . The will signed by Rooney on March 11, 2014, left the entire estate to stepson Mark Rooney, one of Jan Rooney's sons, who was the actor's caretaker the last two years of his life. Rooney ""intentionally omitted"" and disinherited his eight surviving biological children and two other stepchildren from his last marriage, the will said. Rooney had no negative feelings toward his surviving children, but they were all financially better off than he was, Augustine said. He believed what little he had to leave should go to Mark Rooney and his wife, because they had been taking good care of him in the final two years, Augustine said. None of the others ""ever changed one of Mickey's Depends,"" Augustine said. A probate hearing is scheduled for May 12 to start the process of probating the actor's will.","NEW: Rooney's lawyer doubts a deal can be reached out of court on where he'll be buried .

""The truth is, I didn't even know he was in Gaza,"" she said. ""So I ran to the emergency room and found him among a few other soldiers who were also wounded and had just arrived. To my joy, he was conscious, and he spoke to me, and my heart just kept going boom, boom, boom,"" said Davidovich. Sunday was the deadliest day yet in the battle between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces said 13 soldiers were killed. Eighty-seven Palestinians died, at least 60 of them in Israel's assault on the town of Shaja'ia, the Gaza Health Ministry said. ""He kept asking about the fate of his friends, the other soldiers he was with. He didn't stop asking me. He gave me a list of the soldiers' names who he was with but some of them, I know, are not in good condition,"" said Davidovich, whose son suffered leg, eye and ear injuries. Barzilai Medical Center is the closest Israeli hospital to the border. It treats civilians and soldiers. It also treats Palestinian patients brought in from Gaza, although none were there when CNN visited. The hospital has been a frequent victim of rocket attacks. Sirens went off as Dr. Chezy Levy, the hospital's general manager, spoke. To prepare for more casualties, the hospital has brought in more surgeons and cleared its operating schedule, he said. It has 12 surgical rooms, including five in reinforced shelters. Levy said soldiers have been brought in with shrapnel wounds, gunshot wounds -- often to legs and arms -- and also other injuries consistent with a war zone. ""Since the campaign started with the infantry troops, we got a lot of casualties among the soldiers and we treated them here,"" he said. In total, 425 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It's unknown how many were militants. The United Nations has estimated that 70% were civilians. Eighteen Israeli soldiers have been killed, in addition to two civilians. Israel has used its Iron Dome defense system to block many missiles, fired by militants in Gaza, from hitting population centers. Caught in the violence, it's the hardest question in Gaza .

"(CNN) -- The two Amish girls kidnapped last week in upstate New York were sexually abused while in captivity, St. Lawrence County District Attorney Mary Rain said. Police on Friday arrested a couple and charged them with kidnapping in the abduction of the girls last week, authorities said. Stephen M. Howells II, 39, and his girlfriend Nicole F. Vaisey, 25, are being held without bond, the St. Lawrence County Sheriff's Office said. Federal charges are also a possibility. Rain said that evidence found in the couple's house, in addition to interviews with the couple and the victims, shows that the kidnapping was premeditated and that the couple had planned for more. ""There is no doubt in my mind that if they were successful, they were going to continue with future acts,"" Rain told CNN. The District Attorney's Office is also looking into whether the couple had sexually abused others, Rain said. On Wednesday of last week, an Amber Alert was issued after a 6-year-old and her 12-year-old sister disappeared from a vegetable stand near their family farm in Oswegatchie, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the Canadian border. A witness told police the girls were tending to a customer who drove up in a white four-door sedan and disappeared when the vehicle pulled away, according to the Amber Alert. The Amber Alert was canceled Thursday night after the girls were apparently abandoned along a road in Richville, about 40 miles away. ""The children walked up to a home, knocked on the door of a stranger,"" Rain told CNN affiliate WWNY. ""The stranger brought them home to their house, and police were waiting."" She said the girls were ""a little wet and cold,"" but otherwise healthy. The investigation moved quickly Friday, as ""good police work"" and tips from the girls led authorities to the suspects, St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells said. ""We have two strong young girls,"" he said. ""The reason we're able to make an arrest tonight is because of just how strong they are and things they're able to remember."" A red car and a white one were towed from the scene by authorities, affiliate WSYR reported. The house where Howells and Vaisey live is being processed for evidence, Wells said. A preliminary hearing for Howells and Vaisey that was scheduled for Thursday was canceled Monday. If convicted, the couple faces a minimum of 25 years in prison on the kidnapping charge. CNN's Ed Payne and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","A district attorney says the girls were sexually abused by their captors .

"(CNN) -- When two continents collide, there's inevitably going to be some chaos. So it is in Istanbul, on the cusp of Europe and Asia, where a serene skyline of domes and minarets looks down on streets teeming with traffic, traders and tourists. While it seems as if every inch of the city is consumed by the tumult, there are oases of calm. The Prince islands are, for most Istanbul residents, the ultimate weekend getaway, offering an escape where, crucially for anyone who's ever endured they city's motoring snarl-ups, cars are banned. A boat ride away in the Sea of Marmara, the islands offer a soothing natural environment, sightseeing and cycle rides. And because this is still Istanbul, there's also great food. There are nine Prince Islands, of which Buyukada and Heybeliada are the two of the largest and most popular. Here's what to do look out for: . Buyukada Island . To make the best of Buyukada, the largest of the islands, it's best to escape the town square -- almost permanently inhabited by a flock of dazed-looking tourists -- and head by foot or cycle to more peaceful areas. The square is, however, home to an abundance of bike rental places, so it's worth dropping 20 Turkish Lira ($9.20) on a set of wheels. Those not into cycling or walking can take a ride on the island's most popular mode of transport: a small horse-drawn carriage known as a fayton. These hoof around the major sights for about 30TL per person, or can be hired for day-long guided tours for about 80TL per hour. Once out of the town center, Buyukada begins to reveal its charms as nature mingles beguilingly with Ottoman-style architecture. Getting lost in the maze of backstreets is almost as pleasurable as exploring the island's upper areas, covered by lush pine forests. Aya Yorgi . The 6th century Aya Yorgi church and monastery, located on Buyukada's highest hill, is one of the island's most significant features. It's relatively easy to cycle here or arrive by fayton (the trip costs about 30TL) but the 20-minute slog on foot is worth the effort. The reward comes in the form of a magnificent sea view of distant Istanbul, and also the historic Greek church's beautiful interior. Walkers might glimpse sewing thread stretching from the path's beginning to end -- the remnants of a ritual believed to grant wishes that is performed annually on April 23 by the faithful. Naya Hotel . Most people visit Buyukada on day trips, but it's possible to stay longer. Naya is more of an intercultural relaxation center than a hotel, offering yoga and meditation classes and shiatsu and Ayurvedic massages. However the lovely wooden villa, with a Marmara view surrounded by palm trees and flowers, does have a handful of airy rooms available to rent. Naya Hotel, Yılmaz Turk Caddesi No. 96; +90 0216 382 45 98 . Sinek Cafe . The town center's seafood restaurants tend to be overcrowded, so it's worth seeking out this hidden cafe with overtly friendly staff and a terrier named Bıdık. With a few tables set in a garden and an open kitchen area, Sinek's modest menu includes an all-day Turkish breakfast, with sahanda sucuklu yumurta (fried eggs with cured Turkish sausage served in a metal pan) among favorites. The only downside of this secluded corner is the envy experienced when gawping at the owners' minimalist glass and steel house behind the cafe. Sinek Cafe, Yılmaz Turk Caddesi No. 110; +90 216 382 35 78. Heybeliada . Heybeliada boasts many similar activities to Buyukada, but is arguably more pleasant as it's quieter and less touristy. There are bike rentals (5TL an hour and 15TL for the day) and fayton rides, but walking around the island is a rewarding experience, with little cafes, shops, flower sellers, lounging street cats, and remarkable architecture all waiting to be discovered. Ruhban Okulu . Visible from the ferry to the island, this amazing structure perched on the highest peak and surrounded by pine trees was once a theology school run by the formidably-named Eastern Orthodox Church's Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Ruhban Okulu closed its doors as a school in 1971 but is open to visitors today. The premises also house the Aya Triada church (Chapel of the Holy Trinity) and a garden with a view so breathtaking that it might makes a pretty convincing case for divinity in its own right. The school's library still functions and welcomes researchers to its vast collection of 120,000 antique books on geography, history, theology, and philosophy. Isguzar Sokak . Located close to the town center, this street has some of Heybeliada's most notable shops and cafes. Among them is Evden, offering more than 70 kinds of jam and marmalade made by the owner. Next door, the vintage styled Luz Cafe has a menu of homemade Turkish favorites and baked goods, and a small shop of handicrafts and organic soaps. Across the street, Ya Da sells handmade notebooks, items made from deformed gramophone records, birds made from pine cones, and many other unique items. The shop next door sells antique radios, furniture, and accessories. For lunch or dinner, Heyamola Ada Lokantasi, across from the Mavi Marmara station, is one of the best options with a colorful Aegean decor and meze (cold starters) such as grilled calamari and patlıcan ezmesi (eggplant puree). Getting there . The easiest way to get there is by ferry, or vapur as they're known locally. From the Asian side, the boats push off from either the Bostancı or Kadıkoy ports almost hourly and make stops at Buyukada and Heybeliada plus the smaller islands of Burgazada, Kınaliada. From the European side, ferries depart almost every hour from Kabatas, making a stop in Kadıkoy and continuing on to the islands. Passengers can pay using the Istanbulkart (a rechargable card used for all public transportation) or buy a single ticket (jeton) from the machines located in or around the ports. The ferry ride takes about 90 minutes. A faster option is Mavi Marmara, a smaller boat that goes directly from either Kabatas or Bostanci to each of the islands separately on an hourly basis. Tickets cost 5TL. Feride Yalav is a freelance journalist living in Istanbul, Turkey.","The Prince Islands offer citizens of Istanbul a peaceful escape from their frenetic city .

"(CNN) -- Customs and Border Protection officers foiled a smuggling attempt at the U.S.-Mexico border when they discovered a woman contorted and hidden inside a suitcase. Officials released a photo this week showing the woman tucked into a ball and laying inside the luggage in the back of a vehicle. The woman, a Thai national named Pornkamol Mongkolsermsak, was charged with re-entry after deportation, CBP spokesman Victor Brabble said. She was discovered on December 30, when inspectors at the border referred the driver of a Honda SUV for a secondary inspection, CBP said in a statement. When officers inspected the vehicle, they opened up the suitcase and found the 48-year-old woman hidden underneath some clothing. Authorities did not release the name of the 56-year-old Phoenix man who was driving the SUV. The case has been turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, CBP said.

"(CNN) -- It's been described as the symbolic voice of God. You can hear it trumpeting across Israel and Jewish communities everywhere during the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah, which begins at sundown on September 24. Crafted from the horn of a kosher animal, the shofar is ""an instrument that releases, symbolically, God's voice,"" according to shofar expert Robert Weinger. ""We are waking up our spirituality. To return to god to actually cleanse ourselves."" Weinger, an American, worked in the food and beverage industry for over 20 years before he found his calling. Now, he imports shofars to the United States from Israel. Aside from importing shofars, Weinger also plays it for people and at synagogues. But when he does, he says it's not about him. ""I don't strike a pose and have the focus on me,"" says Weinger. ""The focus is on the breath of God, which is being released through me."" The instrument is almost as old as Judaism, dating back thousands of years to the time of Abraham and Isaac. ""First, during Rosh Hashanah, we sound the shofar to coronate God as the king,"" says Rabbi Meir Schweiger of the Pardes Institute of Jewish Studies. ""The second, is that the shofar is seen as an alarm, a kind of wake-up call. Take stock of what you've done over the past year."" The Jewish calendar enters the year 5775. Rosh Hashanah marks the time Jews believe God created man. ""It also marks the day when Adam and Eve ate from the tree of knowledge of good and evil,"" says Schweiger says. But first, this alarm needs to be created. In a nondescript workshop in Tel Aviv, Eli Ribak grinds down the rough edges of a ram's horn. Surrounding him are sacks of raw horns fill every corner, rising to the ceiling. Ribak's family has been crafting shofars for three generations -- and his partner's family since the 14th century. Their company, Shofarot-Israel, is one of the biggest producers of shofars in the world. Around the Jewish New Year, the horn blasts fill his small showroom. Boxes of all types of shofars line the walls. There are some made out of long and spiral antelope horns, curved rams horns and buffalo horns. But not every horn can be turned into a shofar. ""According to Jewish law, the shofar has to be something that is actually hallow inside,"" Schweiger says. ""You can't have the shofar of a cow and in fact the preferred shofar is a ram's horn."" Customers at Ribak's shop test each one trying to find that perfect pitch. ""We need to select the right shofar to the person,"" says Ribak. ""If a good shofar works for you. It won't necessarily be a good shofar for someone else."" If a customer doesn't know how to play the instrument, Ribak can teach them. Much like the trumpet ""you have to ensure that no air escapes from a very tiny hole in your lips,"" says Ribak. ""Straight and fast, that is how you blow a shofar."" For Weinger, he is listening for a specific sound. ""I am listening for the heart of god. I am listening for that pure sound that is in complete harmony.""","The shofar is ""an instrument that releases, symbolically, God's voice,"" says an expert .

"(CNN) -- It was a joyous day for Lucie Fink when she received her acceptance letter from Johns Hopkins University. Like most prospective students, she wanted to know exactly what she was getting into before she made her decision between schools. The shiny pamphlets were all fine, but Fink really needed to hear more about the school from the students. So she went to the Web to get her answers. There she came across student-produced videos and blog entries, along with posts in a Facebook group for accepted students. ""There were all these kids that were so passionate about sharing their experience,"" Fink said. ""It was then that going off to Hopkins became a no-brainer, because I had already fallen in love with the school."" Fink, who is now a sophomore, was so impressed by the originality of the student content online that she eventually became a contributor to a student-run social media site, Hopkins Interactive. The site features regularly updated blogs, videos and Twitter feeds, all produced by current students for prospective and admitted students. Daniel Creasy, the associate director of admissions and one of the people behind Hopkins Interactive, believes that it provides an uncensored look at the school. ""You definitely take a leap of faith when you put this much control of your message in the students' hands,"" he said. ""But the students feel a sense of pride that they are part of this process."" For universities competing to attract top students, it's no longer enough to have a glossy brochure and a sleek website. Schools like Johns Hopkins are reaching out to engage with applicants on Facebook and Twitter. They're also finding that a robust social media campaign, along with such creative features as student-run blogs, can lure prospective students while a stale online presence can turn them off. College admissions officers are indeed learning to interact with students where they hang out: online. According to a recent study by the Center for Marketing Research at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, 100% of universities surveyed use social media to communicate with students, up from 61% in 2007-08. The study found that 98% of the responding colleges have a Facebook page and 84% have a Twitter account. ""Social media is past the fad phase,"" said Nora Barnes, director of the center. ""The numbers speak for themselves. Many students can't afford to visit the campus, so they are depending on the podcasts and blogs to get answers."" Top social media colleges . When Ashmi Pathela, a University of Notre Dame senior, was applying to colleges, she was still receiving the traditional brochures. If she had the option of social media, she said, she would have learned more about the schools much faster. ""I think the younger generation has grown up with social media,"" Pathela said. ""It's something, like electricity, they expect it to exist."" Dean Tsouvalas, editor-in-chief of StudentAdvisor.com, also noticed this reliance on social media when students in a focus group made it clear that university catalogs did not always impress them. ""Students view the brochures similarly to school propaganda,"" he said. ""There's an aversion among them to the glossy versions that colleges put out."" Tsouvalas said that applicants often turn to the Web to talk with enrolled students about their experiences. ""They can get a sense of what life is really like on campus through social media, whether it's through a virtual tour or Twitter,"" he said. Tsouvalas has come up with a ranking system, StudentAdvisor.com's ""Top 100 Social Media Colleges,"" which classifies the universities on how well they use social media. As subjective as it may seem, the list, which was updated last month, is compiled based on a formula that requires at least 500 Facebook ""likes"" and a Twitter account for a school to be eligible. Tsouvalas said the ranking takes into account factors such as enrollment size, hours between tweets and responses to posts. Anyone browsing the Top 100 list will notice a surprising trend: It's not the Ivy League that rules the roost. Among the top 10 schools are The Ohio State University, Louisiana State University and the United States Military Academy at West Point. Although Harvard University, where Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook as a student, topped the list when it launched in March, it was soon dethroned by Johns Hopkins. What colleges do right, and do wrong . In their attempts to stand out, some universities on StudentAdvisor.com's list have gone far beyond just having a Facebook page. The chairman of the math department at Berry College made a calculus music video with his students, who sing about derivatives in a YouTube video titled ""The Derivative Rag."" The sixth-ranked University of Kentucky created a campaign around the school's colors of blue and white and a site, SeeBlue.com, that includes videos from students and staff. Many top schools also make creative use of Twitter to communicate with students. The University of Kentucky recently sent out tweets to some of its accepted students saying, ""Congrats and welcome to our Big Blue family."" Baylor University keeps its students updated on student affairs through its Student Activities Twitter account. And the admissions office of George Washington University has a Twitter account that messages applicants about interview weekends and decision dates. But other universities are still slow to catch on. While Lehigh University regularly tweets updates through its LehighUNews account, its main LehighU Twitter account hasn't been updated since September 2009. And it's not the only one. Some universities neglect their websites, tweet too infrequently or fail to reply to student questions. ""It's not enough to be satisfied that your school is on Facebook,"" Barnes said. ""Students will make a judgment about the university if it is not current and responsive online. When their post doesn't get answered, they are not interested anymore."" James Mueller, a University of Oregon senior, said he finds it annoying that many colleges do not use Twitter effectively. ""Why have a Twitter account if you only have four tweets in the past few months?"" he said. ""Also, colleges sometimes don't understand the difference between Facebook and Twitter. Sometimes they tweet clones of Facebook posts."" Daniella Phillips, a University of Florida senior, said the kind of language used in social media is important to her. She has seen some universities tweet archaic words such as ""groovy,"" which can be off-putting. ""It's like reading a text message from my mom,"" she said. ""It screams that 'I didn't do my research and I don't know my target audience.' "" Engagement is key . There is no one recipe for success when it comes to colleges' use of digital media. Tsouvalas believes universities should invite students to produce online content. He cited West Point, which uploaded a video montage of its band's drum section performing Nick Werth's ""Rhythm of Conscience."" ""It shows a personality to the school that I would have never seen before,"" Tsouvalas said. ""They are having a good time, and I loved it. That's what makes it special."" Barnes thinks universities should avoid content on social media that presents a bland, pristine image of the school. ""PR people should not be doing these blogs. Students have an antenna for that,"" she said. ""If you try to sanitize your blog, students will see right through that."" Finally, it's not enough just to have unique online features. Without attempts to interact with students, universities' fancy graphics or slick videos are good for nothing, Tsouvalas said. ""You can have an awesome page and gorgeous features, but you need to have real engagement,"" he said. ""It makes us feel that the school really does care about its students."" Tsouvalas believes universities should think about what their focus is and what they want students to see when they Google the school. ""A successful social media campaign is when students are able to have a one-to-one connection, speak directly to the school and get interesting information that they never knew before,"" he said.","Universities are reaching out to engage with applicants on Facebook and Twitter .

"(CNN) -- A hair stylist is accusing former ""American Idol"" judge and rapper Nicki Minaj of wigging out on a deal. Terrence Davidson filed suit Friday in district court in Atlanta alleging that the star not only stole his wig designs, but also cost him a potential reality show deal that he was discouraged from pursuing. According to the complaint, Davidson started working for Minaj -- whose real name is Onika Maraj -- as her hair stylist in January 2010. He says he began making wigs for her which she would then select for her appearances. At the time Minaj was a burgeoning star who had steadily built her fan base by appearing as a guest rapper on mix tapes and projects by her label mates at Young Money Entertainment. She quickly became known as the first lady of Young Money, which includes superstar rappers Drake and Lil Wayne. The female rapper also became well known for her sense of style, including a multitude of wigs ranging from platinum blonde to pink. She poses in an ensemble which includes a pink wig on the cover of her platinum-selling debut album ""Pink Friday,"" released in November 2010. Both Davidson and his attorney, Christopher Chestnut, talked to CNN about his influence on crafting Minaj's image as well as the fact that the rapper now sells wigs on her site based on the designs Davidson says he created. The stylist said he discovered the wigs were being marketed and sold after someone sent him a picture and he began researching. ""I see these wigs online,"" said Davidson, who has also worked with others in the industry, including singer Patti LaBelle and rapper Remy Ma. ""People are basically duplicating what I created for Nicki Minaj."" ""Nicki Minaj is reaping great success and financial bounty reward for Terrence's creative expertise, and he is entitled to participate in that,"" Chestnut said. ""Someone's got to stand up for the artist. We applaud the fact that she's making millions, but she's also got to pay bounty to those whose creative designs she's making millions off of."" In his suit, Davidson says he designed several wigs for Minaj, including the ""Pink Upper Bun Wig,"" the ""Fox Fur Wig,"" and the ""Half Blonde-Half Pink Wig"" that she wore in appearances, including the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards preshow. He says there were plans for he and Minaj to launch a wig line and discussions about a possible reality show. But by 2012, the suit claims, ""Minaj and her agents became mum about the business ventures and took active steps to isolate Mr. Davidson and preclude him from the notoriety he deserved for his wig designs."" ""On its face you might think, what this guy is suing over wigs,"" Davidson's attorney Chestnut said. ""But we really have to consider this in context. Hair is a multibillion-dollar industry, but moreover these are not your grandma's wigs. These are eclectic. They are decadent, and they are creative. This is about a brand that Terrence has built.""

"(CNN) -- From unauthorized dates to drunken massage parlor trips, some of South Korea's biggest K-Pop stars have been giving the military a bad name -- and now the top brass has had enough. In a country where the mandatory two-year military service for all males is a big deal, the suggestion that celebrity recruits have been enjoying preferential treatment has created a fierce nationwide backlash. In addition to leading the top trending subjects on all nationwide news portals, social media and news sites were swamped by angry user comments, while military barracks rumbled with soldiers' complaints. So last week the Ministry of National Defense announced it would be scrapping its celebrity soldier unit. ""Although we initially formed the unit to promote the military, a number of unfortunate incidents damaged the public image of the military and lowered the morale of all the regular soldiers who are in the service,"" said the ministry's vice-spokesperson Wi Yong-seob at a press conference. Preferential treatment . On January 1 this year, South Korea awoke to paparazzi photos that showed K-Pop star Rain was secretly dating top actress Kim Tae-hee. Rain landed himself in hot water because he was halfway through his military service and his secret liaisons involved special leave that is not given to regular soldiers, as well as civilian contact -- which is not permitted during duty. No more miniskirts in Seoul? New law has Koreans buzzing . Last month, a local TV crew secretly taped a group of celebrity soldiers, including Rain and fellow K-Pop star Seven, drinking together in a private restaurant following a performance to commemorate the 63rd anniversary of the Korean War. Adding insult to injury, two of the celebs, Seven and Sangchu, then reportedly broke away from the group to visit an illegal massage parlor, which was also broadcast on national TV. The backlash was immediate and furious, with the public demanding disciplinary action and musing about the integrity of military service. ""This news about Seven and Sangchu is a sign of the lack of military discipline even during the 20-month service period. And so the degeneration of the military service will continue,"" tweeted well-known lawyer Choi Young-ho. In the barracks . Soldiers currently serving in the army were particularly disgruntled. ""The news made everyone very angry in the barracks,"" said Yoo-min Kim, 24, whose army service ended in May. ""The question we were all asking was 'why do they get to have that kind of special treatment?'"" Some even questioned their entertainment value. ""What soldiers would like to see for those special concerts are the girl groups and not some male singer,"" said Kim Kwon, 29, who was recently discharged from the Ministry of Defense. The fallout . With the closure of their unit, the 16 celebrity soldiers will be sent to regular military units -- with eight of them facing punishment for violating military rules. In the past, punishment for a similar offense ranged from reduced leave to a spell in a military jail. Two members are being deployed to units in the provinces -- which will come as a rude shock after their relatively cushy desk job in the capital. The history . First formed 16 years ago, the celebrity unit acted as the military's public relations office, and was comprised of singers, actors and comedians who used their various ""skills"" in public capacities such as concerts for soldiers or military broadcasts. However, the issue of celebrities enlisting in the military has long been a controversial subject in South Korea. With the popularity of Korean entertainment soaring overseas, some say that the K-Pop stars and actors should be exempt from army service due to the substantial foreign revenue they bring into the country. In a similar vein, athletes are exempted from army service if they medal at the Olympic Games or win gold medals in the Asian Games. But it tends to be a more sensitive issue when it comes to entertainers. Famous cases . Psy is one of the most high-profile cases -- the ""Gangnam Style"" star famously repeated his two-year service in 2007 for negligence during duty in the form of private concerts and TV show appearances. The entertainer who started it all, though, was a Korean-American singer in the 1990s called Yoo Seungjun. The king of the K-Pop scene at the time, Yoo had voiced his eagerness to perform his military duty several times on television. But when the time actually came for him to enlist, the singer did an about-face and applied to become a U.S. citizen. The public felt massively betrayed and in a stunning move, the South Korean government deported Yoo and banned him from the country for life. ""Since the controversy involving Yoo, the issue of military service has been taken extremely seriously and people have stricter standards toward TV stars,"" Korean pop columnist Moon Han-pyeong told South Korean newspaper Joongang Daily. ""People think there should be no special treatment or exemption for any group.""","Celeb unit acting as military public relations department for 16 years is being disbanded .

"(CNN) -- Manchester United's poor start to the season continued with a lackluster 1-1 draw against Sunderland, leaving new coach Louis Van Gaal still seeking a first league win for his new club. United's injury problems meant that Van Gaal again had to shuffle the pack and draft 20 year old Tyler Blackett into his defense. Unsurprisingly given the changes, Sunderland started the brighter of the two and it was against the run of play when United took the lead. Some good work by Antonio Valencia, who had been restored to the starting line up, released Spain international Juan Mata who fired home from close range. But rather than build on the goal, United let Sunderland back into the game. Sunderlands's big summer signing Jack Rodwell, once considered one of England's brightest prospects, scored his first goal for the club to secure a point that left Van Gaal still waiting for his first league win as Manchester United coach. ""In the first half we played an equal match with Sunderland. We didn't create so much but scored a fantastic goal,"" Van Gaal said after the game. ""Football is played for creating chances and making goals. We haven't created so many chances today,"" he added. ""We probably had more ball possession and were more dominant than the last match but you have to win your game at that moment and we couldn't, so that's a pity."" Di Maria to arrive? As the transfer window draws to a close on September 1st, United will likely add to their squad with Real Madrid's Argentina international Angel Di Maria heavily rumored to be joining for what may be a British transfer record. Leading Spanish newspaper Marca reported Sunday that the two clubs had agreed a fee of 75 million euros ($99 million) for Di Maria.

"(CNN) -- Christy Wolford describes her first child, Lauren, as a wedding gift. She also says it was her daughter who saved her life. Wolford found a lump in her breast while she was breastfeeding. Had she not been weaning Lauren, she probably wouldn't have noticed that something was unusual with her breast, let alone have had it checked out. Wolford was only 28. ""When you're in your 20s, you think you're invincible,"" she said. At first she thought she might have a clogged milk duct, but she went to the doctor anyway. What followed were mammograms, ultrasounds, biopsies and then the diagnosis: She had breast cancer. Doctors told her other bad news: She had an 80% to 90% chance of being sterile after her treatment. She and her husband, Bubba, really wanted another child. They were hoping for a son to carry on the family name. ""That was shocking. ... It was a very hard pill to swallow,"" Wolford said. Luckily, she found another option: an ongoing clinical trial designed to help preserve a woman's fertility during chemotherapy. The study's results were published Friday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in Chicago. Hope in a trial . Since there would be about a month between surgery and chemotherapy, her doctor initially suggested that the couple seek fertility treatment. That way they could set aside embryos to be used later. The Wolfords thought about it, but the treatment's $30,000 price tag was too much. They also struggled with what they felt was a moral dilemma of what they'd do with the embryos they didn't use. Ultimately, they decided that fertility treatments weren't for them. It's a good thing, too: Wolford later learned that she had hormone-negative cancer. The fertility drugs she would have needed for egg harvesting could have made her cancer worse. When Wolford went in for her treatment at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, she learned about the clinical trial, which is funded largely by the National Institutes of Health. ""Honestly, I don't know if my poor husband even had a vote in this. I saw it as my only hope,"" she said. Trial researchers wanted to know whether the drug goserelin (brand name Zoladex) could preserve the fertility of hormone-negative cancer patients. ""It's a drug that suppresses ovarian function or puts the ovaries at rest,"" said the lead study author, Dr. Halle Moore. Goserelin is normally prescribed to women with advanced hormone-positive breast cancer to put them into menopause and stop estrogen production, which can fuel cancer growth. Studies have shown high rates of return of menstrual function, Moore says, but there have been no conclusive trials looking at ovarian function over the long term. A new approach . The goal of the trial was to temporarily halt ovarian function and then assess it two years after treatment. ""Basically, if the ovaries are inactive, then they would hopefully be less sensitive to the chemotherapy effects,"" said Moore, a breast cancer specialist at the Cleveland Clinic. More than 200 women between the ages of 18 and 49 were recruited for the trial. All were given standard chemotherapy, but half added goserelin to their treatments. Wolford was in the latter group. ""I put my ovaries into menopause, without the chemotherapy doing it first, with the hope that (the ovaries) would wake up afterwards,"" she said. She had to get an injection one week before starting chemotherapy and then once every four weeks as long as she was on chemo. ""The drug is actually quite painful. It's like a shooting a rice grain into your abdomen,"" Wolford said. Wolford's chemotherapy lasted six months, finishing in September 2006. Her menstrual cycle returned about four months later. ""Obviously, at that point, it doesn't mean that you're ovulating, and at that point, we were trying to figure out what to do next for our family,"" Wolford said. A life change . Two months later, she was laid off from her job. Believing Lauren would probably be their only child, the couple decided to open a preschool in Colorado, ""because if we can't have more children, then we'll spend time with other parents' children,"" Wolford sasaid. In late 2008, they decided to see if they could get pregnant again. When Wolford informed her doctors at MD Anderson, they asked her to come in for more tests, particularly because triple-negative breast cancer has the highest recurrence rate five years after diagnosis. Only 135 women (including Wolford) met the criteria for ovarian function testing at the two-year mark, and among those patients, researchers found that 22% of the women in the chemo-only group had premature ovarian failure, compared with 8% in the group that also got goserelin. ""That's a two-thirds reduction,"" Moore said. Researchers also found that the women in the goserelin group were nearly twice as likely to have a successful pregnancy. Wolford was one of them. She found out she was pregnant in February 2009 and believes she delivered the first baby in the goserelin group. Alexander was born eight months later. 11 myths fertility doctors hear . Then came Everett and finally baby Lukas. All told, among the 218 women enrolled in the trial, 22 patients in the goserelin group became pregnant, compared with 12 in the chemotherapy-only group. An important post-cancer issue . ""Finding a simple and accessible way to protect fertility in young breast cancer patients while not harming cancer outcomes is an important issue,"" said Dr. Lori Minasian, deputy director of the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Prevention and one of the study's co-authors. ""I think this is convincing enough that we can use this standard practice"" (for women with hormone-negative breast cancer), Moore said. MD Anderson breast cancer expert Dr. Jennifer Litton, who was not involved in the study, cautions that the study size was small. She says the research does show that it's not harmful to take goserelin to preserve fertility. But she suggests ""for patients who are sure they want to have children after chemotherapy, it is still imperative to meet with a reproductive endocrinologist to understand all their options and not just rely on goserelin."" More research needed . Although the study results are narrowly applicable to hormone-negative breast cancer, the concept may have broader applications in other cancers, said Dr. Clifford Hudis, president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Moore agrees, saying that goserelin may also be applicable with cancers that are treated with similar chemotherapy drugs, like lymphoma, but that more research is needed. Wolford is now almost nine years cancer-free. Her message to other young women in a similar situation: Be strong. It's a hard road fighting cancer, she says, but do your research and consider participating in clinical trials that could help you and other women in the future. ""To have the life you always hoped to have -- it's a really huge thing,"" she said. ""It was definitely a painful experience, but the upside was my three sons, and I would do it again in a heartbeat.""

"(CNN) -- A lone bugler sounding the traditional military farewell ""Last Post"" marked the arrival Wednesday in the Netherlands of the first dead from the crash of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17. The grieving nation then held a moment of silence to honor those killed in the crash of the jetliner, downed last week by a suspected surface-to-air missile over war-torn eastern Ukraine. In a ceremony rich with martial symbolism -- from saluting soldiers to the haunting tune used to send war dead to their rest -- 40 simple wooden caskets were solemnly unloaded from two military planes. Soldiers then walked them to waiting hearses and lowered them inside before rendering a final salute. The only sounds were the hushed orders of soldiers and a whipping wind. A long line of hearses, accompanied by police, carried the remains slowly toward a Dutch military base in Hilversum, where forensic investigators will begin the grim work of identifying them. Thousands of Dutch residents lined roads and overpasses along parts of the route to pay respects to the dead. Some applauded as the hearses finally passed through the base gates, some tossed flowers on the vehicles. Others stood silently, red-eyed. ""The Netherlands are in shock, and Hilversum, as well,"" said the city's mayor, Pieter Broertjes. Harun Calehr, whose two nephews were among the 298 people killed in the crash, called the ceremony ""very moving and a beautiful tribute."" ""It feels like we're just a big grieving family, and that somewhat helps in coping with this horrible, devastating event,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Shane Hattingh watched the procession on TV in South Africa, still wondering where the remains of his brother-in-law, Cameron Dalziel, might be. ""It's totally surreal. It was the weirdest feeling, knowing that my brother-in-law could be in one of those caskets. I just found myself wanting him to be there, but at the same time, that's too selfish,"" Hattingh said, adding that he hopes the victims who were children were the ones landing in the Netherlands first. Hattingh said his sister, Cameron's wife, also watched the procession. ""She's destroyed,"" he said, and her son has said his whole body is sore from crying. At this point, he said, his family only knows that Cameron, a helicopter rescue pilot who had recently moved to Malaysia with his family, was sitting in business class on Flight 17 -- a part of the plane that reportedly didn't sustain as much damage. ""We can only hope that things will work out for us, and we can get Cameron home and start the grieving process. ... My sister, she has no hope. It's about putting the left foot in front of the right,"" he said. The somber ceremony in Eindhoven followed a moving and meaningful send-off in Ukraine. There, white-gloved Ukrainian soldiers respectfully carried the bodies of the victims to the aircraft that flew them home to a waiting Dutch king and queen on the nation's official day of mourning. The honors afforded the remains contrasted sharply with how they were first treated in death -- blown out of the sky, then allowed to remain exposed to the elements for days. In some cases, furious Dutch officials say, they were stripped of their personal belongings. Of the 298 people who died aboard Flight 17, 193 were Dutch citizens, and it was impossible to miss the signs that the Netherlands was a nation in mourning Wednesday. Flags were flown at half-staff, and the nation's iconic windmills were placed in ""mourning position"" with wings tilted to the right. Courts suspended all trials, and even commercials were pulled from Dutch television and radio. Buses and trains were to stop on roads nationwide during the moment of silence, and landings at Amsterdam's Schipol airport were paused as a sign of respect. In the evening, hundreds attended a memorial service at St. Joris church in Amersfoort. ""Love will win. Light will break through,"" one relative of a family killed in the crash told mourners. The commemorations come amid continued confusion over who shot the plane down, and why, and what may have happened to the evidence where the plane fell to fields deep in eastern Ukrainian territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels. ""There is a lot of anger. This was a crime, and people want to make sure that this crime is being solved,"" said Eelco Bosch van Rosenthal, a Dutch journalist who covered Wednesday's ceremony. ""But today was really a day for grief, and I think tomorrow and the next few days, then that's really a new phase starting."" 'Black boxes' arrive in UK . It took days for Ukrainian rebels who control the area of the crash site to hand over the bodies and the airliner's black boxes to Malaysian officials. Now, the bodies are at a Dutch military base, and the voice and flight data recorders are in Britain for what will be a detailed scouring by international analysts. Investigators Wednesday found that the cockpit voice recorder was damaged, but its memory was intact. There was no sign of tampering. But Dutch crash investigators leading the inquiry said Wednesday they still don't have everything they need. ""At the time of writing, the investigators have not yet been able to visit the site of the crash and conduct their investigation under safe conditions,"" the Dutch Safety Board said in a statement Wednesday. ""In order to conduct an effective investigation, the investigators must have the opportunity to move around the entire investigation site freely, investigate materials and traces from up close and secure them for further study where necessary,"" the board said. ""At present, the investigators' safety has not been guaranteed."" Instead, investigators are working in Kiev and in the Netherlands using photos and other sources of information, the board said. Given conditions at the crash site, which sits essentially in the middle of a war zone, it's impossible to say when investigators might get the access they want. A British security source expressed concern to CNN's Max Foster on Wednesday about potential debris-tampering at the crash site. Conversations intercepted by Ukrainian intelligence, which British security officials find persuasive, include separatists stating that they had possession of an SA-11 (Buk missile system) as early as Monday, July 14, the source said. The separatists were also talking about moving bodies, passing black boxes to Russia and a plan to scatter parts of other aircraft on the site, according to the source. And while the black boxes are now in the hands of skilled investigators who are working hard to unspool the crucial information contained in them, it may take weeks for that analysis to yield results, the safety board said. Similarly, work to identify the bodies may take weeks or even months, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said. Some bodies unaccounted for . Officials gave conflicting reports about how many bodies were on the train that carried them from the crash site to the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, where they left for the Netherlands on Wednesday. And it was unclear how many bodies were inside the 40 caskets transported to the Netherlands. Malaysian official Mohd Sakri, who traveled on the train with the remains, said there were 282 corpses and 87 body parts aboard -- the same tally Ukrainian officials earlier gave to describe the remains recovered from the crash site. But Dutch investigators only confirmed there were at least 200 bodies transported from the crash site, said Jan Tuinder, head of the Dutch delegation. Another Dutch official said investigators were still going through the train cars and it was possible that all the crash victims were on the train. But officials said Monday that at the least, the bodies of 16 people were still unaccounted for. Their remains may still be scattered across a debris field spanning several miles. As they combed the crash site on Wednesday, monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and Malaysian experts searched for human remains. They spotted some in one location, he said. ""There's a lot of heavy debris still out there,"" spokesman Michael Bociurkiw said, ""and we're not quite sure what could be underneath."" The crash site was eerily calm on Wednesday. ""It's like everyone picked up and left,"" he said. A team of about 15 observers and Malaysian experts are doing everything they can, he said. ""But we feel somewhat on our own right now,"" Bociurkiw said. ""And as I've said many times, there are people far better placed and trained than we are to do this very specialized type of work.""

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- An Iranian woman, blinded by a jilted stalker who threw acid in her face, has persuaded a court to sentence him to be blinded with acid himself under Islamic law demanding an eye for an eye. Ameneh Bahrami refused to accept ""blood money."" She insisted instead that her attacker suffer a fate similar to her own ""so people like him would realize they do not have the right to throw acid in girls' faces,"" she told the Tehran Provincial Court. Her attacker, a 27-year-old man identified in court papers as Majid, admitted throwing acid in her face in November 2004, blinding and disfiguring her. He said he loved her and insisted she loved him as well. He has until early this week to appeal the sentence. Doctors say there is no chance Bahrami will recover her vision, despite repeated operations, including medical care in Spain partially paid for by Iran's reformist former president, Mohammed Khatami, who was in power when the attack took place. Majid said he was still willing to marry Bahrami, but she ruled out the possibility and urged that he remain locked up. ""I am not willing to get blood money from the defendant, who is still thinking about destroying me and wants to take my eyes out,"" she told the court. ""How could he pretend to be in love? If they let this guy go free, he will definitely kill me."" Bahrami told the court that Majid's mother had repeatedly tried to arrange a marriage between the two after Majid met Bahrami at university. She rejected the offer, not even sure at first who the suitor was. Her friends told her he was a man who had once harassed her in class, leading to an argument between them. But he refused to accept her rejection, she said, going to her workplace and threatening her. Finally, she lied and told him she had married someone else and that ""it would be better all around if he would leave [her] alone."" She told the court that she reported the conversation to police, saying he had threatened her with ""burning for the rest of my life"" -- but they said they could not act until a crime had been committed. Two days later, on November 2, 2004, as she was walking home from work, she became aware of a man following her. She slowed, then stopped to let him pass. ""When the person came close, I realized that it was Majid,"" she said. ""Everything happened in a second. He was holding a red container in his hand. He looked into my eyes for a second and threw the contents of the red container into my face."" Bahrami knew exactly what was happening, she said. ""At that moment, I saw in my mind the face of two sisters who years ago had the same thing happen to them. I thought, 'Oh, my God -- acid.' "" Passers-by tried to wash the acid off Bahrami, then took her to Labafinejad Hospital. ""They did everything possible for me,"" she said of the doctors and nurses there. Then, one day, they asked her to sign papers allowing them to operate on her. ""I said, 'Do you want to take my eyes out?' The doctor cried and left."" They did want to remove her eyes surgically, she learned, for fear they would become infected, potentially leading to a fatal infection of her brain. But she refused to allow it, both because she was not sure she could handle it psychologically, and because she thought her death would be easier for her family to bear. ""If I had died, my family would probably be sad for a year and mourn my death, and then they would get used to it,"" she told the court. ""But now every day they look at me and see that I am slowly wasting away."" The three-judge panel ruled unanimously on November 26 that Majid should be blinded with acid and forced to pay compensation for the injuries to Bahrami's face, hands and body caused by the acid. That was what she had demanded earlier in the trial. But she did not ask for his face to be disfigured, as hers was. ""Of course, only blind him and take his eyes, because I cannot behave the way he did and ask for acid to be thrown in his face,"" she said. ""Because that would be [a] savage, barbaric act. Only take away his sight so that his eyes will become like mine. I am not saying this from a selfish motive. This is what society demands."" Attacking women and girls by throwing acid in their faces is sufficiently common in countries such as Bangladesh and Cambodia that groups have been formed to fight it. Human rights organizations have condemned the practice in Afghanistan and Pakistan. It is not clear how often such attacks take place in Iran. Iran and Saudi Arabia are the only countries that consider eye-gouging to be a legitimate judicial punishment, Human Rights Watch has said. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr contributed to this report.","Man admitted throwing acid in Iranian woman's face in 2004 .

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Low-income households in Egypt are being hit by soaring food prices, placing a major strain on many poor families in the country, who are struggling to put basic staples on the table. Inside a small Cairo apartment, Howeida Nageh is dicing a few tomatoes in her kitchen. Her three sons have arrived home from school and they are hungry. Yet, the only food available is these tomatoes and a piece of bread -- and this will be the boys' only meal for the day. ""Things are too expensive,"" says Nageh, whose husband left her to raise her three boys alone. ""I used to take two onions and cut them over two tomatoes, cook and eat them. Now the price of onions has increased -- instead of using two, three or four onions, I now just take one and choose the smallest one,"" adds Nageh, whose largest source of income is the $30 a month she receives from the government. Read this: 'Harassment map' helps Egyptian women . Egypt, which is the world's biggest importer of wheat, brings in about 70% of its food from abroad. High prices of basic food items have been cited as one the reasons behind the 2011 upheaval that led to the ousting of long-time President Hosni Mubarak. The chant ""bread, freedom and social justice"" could be heard around Cairo's Tahrir Square, the epicenter for disgruntled Egyptians calling for change. And now, with the country's currency devaluing, many Egyptians are making their displeasure known when it comes to their daily food shopping. ""People complain,"" says vegetable vendor Milad Zakher. ""They complain because vegetables are expensive. There is no demand like before. Before the revolution there was demand and money -- we used to have money. They were buying and selling and we had income; the revolution made people with no money."" Sky rocketing prices of fertilizers and seeds, coupled with an increasingly dysfunctional government, are creating a difficult situation for farmers, and this is reflected in food prices and availability. Economist Angus Blair, president of the Signet Institute, a Cairo-based political and economic think tank, says that drastic action needs to be taken quickly to address the situation. ""If you look at the growth in population, [there are] between 83 to 87 million people in Egypt -- that's growing relatively quickly,"" says Blair. ""The agricultural sector will need a new revolution of its own to be able to feed the increasing number of people and the increasing demands for food that Egypt requires,"" he adds. Some farmers also complain that access to water can be cut for months, hampering even further their capacity to grow food. Even when they do have water, they say it is so polluted that it poisons their land and animals. Read this: Radio plants seeds of success for struggling farmers . ""First of all, if the water comes clean and regularly, the farmer's job will be easier. Cattle feed will be a high quality,"" says farmer Ibrahim Botti Omar. ""But the alfalfa that cattle eat now is irrigated with polluted water. Therefore, the cattle get a lot of diseases and in less than a year, we've seen many cattle die."" One solution could be increasing the size of farms, as most of Egypt's agriculture is in the form of small holdings of just a few acres. In many cases, small farmers cannot afford modern equipment or techniques. ""The World Bank estimates around half of all food that reaches the final market in Egypt is spoiled,"" says Blair. ""That's partly due to the farming methods, the picking, the packing, the distribution in terms of general logistics,"" he adds. Read this: Clouds on horizon for tobacco farmers . The government official tasked with reversing decades of bad management is Salah Abdul Momin, Egypt's technocrat minister of agriculture. He admits that a lot needs to be done but remains optimistic about the future. ""Looking forward, to have a strategy in this issue we have governmental land, the newly reclaimed land,"" he says. ""I'm looking to have 1 million acres in five designated areas to make new communities in this area."" In the short term, Abdul Momin is also focused on reducing wheat imports, as part of a plan to revolutionize Egypt's agriculture by 2030. But a 17-year plan could be too long term for those currently having to deal with a worsening situation. Back in Cairo, Nageh's older son, Mohamed, is studying hard to become a banker. He says he aspires to help his family to break the chains of poverty . ""I want to be something that brings joy to my family,"" he says. ""To make my mother happy first and make me happy, to feel that I'm doing something good. Something where I can make something of myself.""","Soaring food prices are putting a strain on poor Egyptian households .

"(CNN) -- Will it be a ""Bad"" night -- or a ""True"" one? The 66th Primetime Emmy Awards will be handed out Monday night, and what was expected to be a coronation honoring the final season of AMC's ""Breaking Bad"" has emerged as something a little more competitive, thanks to HBO's ""True Detective,"" the moody crime series starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. Though ""Bad"" still has a decided edge for best drama series -- the handicappers at Goldderby.com, for example, are unanimous in their support of the Bryan Cranston-led show -- the onrush of McConaughey love earlier this year, when the actor was hailed for his performances in ""Mud,"" ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and an Oscar-winning turn in ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" may turn the tide in favor of ""Detective."" It certainly received a good start. At the Creative Arts Emmys, which were given out August 16, ""Detective"" won four awards, including trophies for its cinematography and casting. ""Breaking Bad"" won just one, for its editing. HBO, 'SNL,' 'Orange' win Emmys . Here are some things to watch for as TV gets ready for its biggest night: . 1. All right, all right, all right, b*tch. ""Breaking Bad"" finished its run with acclaim as one of the best shows in TV history. Even the Internet liked the finale -- and the Internet doesn't like anything. Certainly that will be enough to earn it best drama, right? But watch out for ""True Detective."" Even if ""Breaking Bad"" wins best drama, ""Detective"" might take other major categories. For all the praise he's received, Bryan Cranston has come up empty for best actor the last two years, losing to Jeff Daniels (""The Newsroom"") last year and Damian Lewis (""Homeland"") in 2012. This time he's facing both McConaughey and Harrelson, not to mention Daniels, perennial bridesmaid Jon Hamm (""Mad Men"") and the wily Kevin Spacey (""House of Cards""). And what about ""Game of Thrones""? Sure, the series got stiffed in the lead acting categories, but it's up in supporting slots -- for Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey -- as well as best drama. Moreover, it led all programs with 19 nominations. Moreover, they ""would do things for their family you couldn't imagine."" Emmy nominations 2014: Complete list . 2. Living is easy, comedy is hard. The comedy categories are incredibly competitive this year. Last year's winner, ""Modern Family,"" is nominated once again, but this time there's a sense that it's ripe for a fall. ""Any (of the other nominees) would be better than yet another win for 'Modern Family,' "" wrote New York magazine's Margaret Lyons and Denise Martin. But what will take its place? ""Orange Is the New Black,"" Netflix's most popular show, could notch a win. So could ""Veep,"" which has the benefit of last year's lead actress winner, Julia Louis-Dreyfus. And, lurking in the corner, there's ""Louie,"" which finished perhaps its most talked-about season -- one that had audiences wondering if they were, indeed, actually watching a comedy. The performers' trophies are even more uncertain. Will best comedy actor go to ""Big Bang's"" Jim Parsons again -- he's won three of the last five -- or Louis C.K.? Will best comedy actress go to Louis-Dreyfus, ""Parks and Recreation's"" Amy Poehler or ""Orange's"" Taylor Schilling? Can Allison Janney, who won an Emmy at the Creative Arts event for her guest spot in ""Masters of Sex,"" win another for ""Mom""? It's enough to make you long for the certainty of ""Parks and Recreation's"" Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) -- who's not, incidentally, up for an Emmy. Not that he would sweat over it. 3. Remembering Robin Williams. The famed comedian and actor, who died August 11, will be remembered during the ""In Memoriam"" section in a tribute presented by Billy Crystal. Regardless of how tasteful, thoughtful or warmhearted the segment is, you can bet that someone will complain about it. 4. ""Race"" for the top. Once upon a time, there was essentially no competition in the reality-competition category: The winner was almost always ""The Amazing Race."" The popular series -- part travelogue, part game, all fun -- won nine out of 10 years from 2003 to 2012, except for 2010, when ""Top Chef"" took the title. But last year ""The Voice"" took home the trophy, and the battle isn't getting any easier. ""The Voice"" is up again, so is ""Top Chef,"" and the other nominees include ""Dancing With the Stars,"" ""So You Think You Can Dance"" and ""Project Runway."" 5. Rating Seth Meyers. This is the first time the ""Late Night"" host and former ""SNL"" newsman is hosting the Emmys, and no doubt some critics will have their knives out. Meyers admits he's nervous. ""I think it would be weird if there were no nerves,"" he said. ""It's a big undertaking and you want to make sure you treat it with the proper respect, and I think nerves constantly remind you to do that."" He's certainly hoping to do a good job, and he emphasizes: He will not sing. ""I can't! I wish I could!"" he said. Do it well, Seth, and maybe you'll get a shot. The Emmys will air Monday on NBC.

"New York (CNN) -- Six months ago, a Long Island convenience store owner turned a would-be robbery into an act of compassion. On Wednesday, the shoplifter made amends with a $50 bill and a thank you letter for saving him from a life of crime. The story began in May 2009, when Mohammad Sohail of Shirley, New York, was closing his Shirley Express convenience store one night. Security camera footage from that evening shows a man wielding a baseball bat barging into the store and demanding money. Sohail had a rifle ready and quickly aimed it directly in the robber's face, forcing the man to drop the bat and lay on the ground. Unbeknownst to the man, Sohail never loads his gun. According to Sohail, the man immediately started to plead with him, tearfully saying, ""I'm sorry, I have no food. I have no money. My whole family is hungry. Don't call the police. Don't shoot me."" ""When I see him starting crying [those] things, I really feel bad for him,"" said Sohail. ""I say, oh man, this is something different."" Sohail made the man pledge never to rob anybody ever again, then gave the man $40 and a loaf bread. Sohail, who is from Pakistan, said the man then wanted to be a Muslim like him, so he recited an Islamic oath and gave the would-be robber the name Nawaz Sharif Zardari. Sohail went to get some milk, but when he returned the man had fled with the money and food. Both Mohammad Sohail and Suffolk County Police have no idea who the man is. After the May incident, Sohail explained that he will ""absolutely not"" be pressing charges, though police are still investigating the case. Over the past six months, Sohail's story of sympathy and kindness has inspired many across the country. The Shirley Express store has received numerous letters of admiration. ""No person has ever moved my spirit the way you did. From your biggest admirer,"" one letter says. ""Great men are capable of great acts. You are a great American,"" another reads. He has also received several checks with such messages for ""a couple hundred dollars"" in total, says Sohail. He has made a point to give this money ""to the people"" by offering free bagels, rolls and coffee in his store every night after 9 o'clock. But the envelope that arrived on Wednesday came as a surprise. Postmarked November 11 without a return address, it enclosed a $50 bill and a note apparently from the would-be robber. The typed letter begins, ""You change My Life (sic),"" and goes on to say that the man is sorry for his actions six months ago. ""At the time I had No money No food on my table No Job, and nothing for my family. I know that it was wrong, but I had know (sic) choice. I needed to feed My family. When You had That gun to my head I was 100% that I was going to die,"" reads the letter. The letter says Sohail's acts inspired him to become a ""True Muslim"" and that his life has changed dramatically. ""I'm very happy that somebody got to change his life,"" Sohail said. ""If he is a maybe criminal, maybe is not anymore. So now he is a good person in this community and I'm very glad for that. He's staying out of trouble, he's not in a jail, he's taking care of his family.""

"(CNN) -- Today's world increasingly challenges us to think differently about value and money. How important is your reputation? Does it have an impact on your finances? What is the currency of reputation and is it transferable or exchangeable? How is reputation created? Reputation is co-created by individuals having experiences. Looking for a great Italian restaurant for dinner tonight? Search Yelp reviews and see what people who have already dined at a place have to say about it. Want to know what it's like to work with a potential hire? Read their LinkedIn referrals. Wondering whether or not other people are happy with a product you're about to buy? Amazon reviews will tell you. You've probably even shared your own experiences with something you enjoyed or warned others about a less-than-positive experience. Your FICO score in the United States measures your credit risk, which is really credit reputation, based on your behavior. Reputation is crucial for the new economics of the 'Sharing Economy' Reputation is a requirement of the sharing economy. For Airbnb hosts and Uber and Lyft drivers, positive ratings are paramount to their success. It might seem crazy to stay at a stranger's house, but on Airbnb host reviews facilitate trust among strangers. Your AirBnB, Yelp and eBay reviews have immense values outside their immediate platforms. Even though these reputation systems have been created for the specific company -- imagine how powerful it would be to have your reputation in one place. Uber and Lyft are both independent operator ride-sharing platforms. Both companies facilitate the connection between driver and passenger. Drivers must be reviewed and approved before giving rides through their system. In a move to gain more drivers and compete with Lyft, Uber reportedly offered bonuses to tempt already-approved Lyft drivers to the Uber platform. In some cases, it was apparently easier for a new driver to go through the Lyft approval process and then switch companies, than it was to apply directly to Uber. Reputation and the future . Reputation will become an increasingly visible part of our everyday transactions. While we will create reputation on individual platforms, there will be an increasing demand for fluid exchange of reputation and ratings from one system to another. We'll see tools to aggregate your reputation in one place. We may even see reputation system APIs developed to enable the transfer of your reputation to new platforms. Picture this: four friends having dinner in a restaurant in the not-too-distant future. After the meal, they pay using a ""Smart Check,"" using integrated mobile payments, credit cards and private coins. As part of the Smart Check experience, diners can rate their experience immediately -- everything from individual dishes, the service, and even the restaurant itself. Or how about this -- it's the year 2020 and a woman is searching for a motorcycle at an online classified site. As part of her search results, the seller's reputation is shown. This makes it easy to decide which seller to deal with. Beyond these scenarios, expect to see more fluid exchange of reputation between their original systems -- akin to monetary exchanges. We'll see more of personal reputation integrated in person-to-person transactions, which will enable deeper transactions in the resource sharing economy.

"(CNN) -- Toni Nadal is used to letting his famous nephew do the talking with his tennis racket -- and it sounds like it should stay that way. The uncle and long-time coach to 14-time grand slam champion Rafa Nadal is in hot water after serving up some controversial comments on Spain's new Davis Cup captain, Gala Leon Garcia. Garcia, who was announced as successor to Carlos Moya earlier this week, is the first female to captain Spain's men's team. She is the fifth woman to coach a Davis Cup side, according to the International Tennis Federation. But Nadal thinks appointing the 40-year-old -- whose highest ranking as a player was 27th -- could pose problems, not least in the locker room. ""In no way am I sexist,"" Nadal told Spanish radio station Cadena SER on Tuesday. ""You could brand me old-fashioned in seeing problems about having to share a dressing room with a woman, but to go from there to talking about sexism ... Would I be OK with peeing in front of a woman? No way. That in any case might be old-fashioned."" Comfort breaks aren't the only issue, according to Nadal. ""A woman is just as capable as a man, but men's and women's tennis are different sports,"" he argued. ""I know nothing about the hours and training systems for women's tennis. I don't even know who the best players are. I doubt Gala Leon knows the (men's) world number 40 ..."" Nadal, 53, was responding after his initial comments on the subject aired on Monday caused a bit of a stir. In a interview with on RNE, Spain's national radio station, Nadal initially suggested it ""might be easier for the captain to be a man,"" before addressing the issue of the locker room for the first time. ""I believe she doesn't know the players, at least Rafael, and there is a logistical difficulty that is difficult to solve, because in the Davis Cup a lot of time is spent in locker rooms without much clothing and with a woman it would always be weird."" But some players who may play under Garcia appear unfazed by the prospect. ""I don't think the fact she is a woman affects anything,"" doubles specialist Marc Lopez said, Spanish newspaper El Pais reported. ""The players have to accept it, to be united, to play, win and go up to the World Group,"" the 32-year-old added. ""There are several rooms ... it's not essential that she is there where you're having a shower. It will be a bit different, but I don't think whether she can or can't be there all the time will influence the development of her work."" Britain's Andy Murray, who appointed former women's world No. 1 Amelie Mauresmo as his coach in June, was supportive of Garcia's appointment. Murray's recent tweet about Scottish independence might have been controversial but few would have disagreed with his views on the vote of confidence in Garcia by Spain's Davis Cup bosses. ""Congrats to Gala Leon Garcia for becoming first female Spanish Davis cup captain today... hopefully first of many!"" Murray tweeted. Spain has dominated the Davis Cup in the early 21st century, winning the team tournament five times since 2000, but has struggled in recent times. In September, Spain was relegated from the World Group for the first time since 1996 after losing 3-1 to Brazil. The wrist injury that kept Rafa Nadal out of the U.S. Open also precluded his involvement in Spain's defeat in Sao Paulo, but the world No. 2 is expected to return to action at next week's China Open in Beijing.","Toni Nadal queries appointment of Gala Leon Garcia as Spain's Davis Cup team captain .

"(CNN) -- Lenny Dykstra, the former New York Mets outfielder who became a successful self-taught investor, was sentenced Monday to 6 1/2 months in federal custody following bankruptcy fraud and other federal charges, authorities announced Monday. Dykstra, 49, faced 20 years in prison but prosecutors recommended 2 1/2 years following his guilty plea to three felony counts -- bankruptcy fraud, concealment of assets and money laundering, according to U.S. Attorney spokesman Thom Mrozek. Dykstra is already serving a three-year state prison sentence after pleading no contest in July to grand theft auto in a separate case. The federal indictment stemmed from a bankruptcy case that Dykstra filed on July 7, 2009. Dykstra was accused of removing, destroying and selling property that was part of the bankruptcy estate without the permission of the bankruptcy trustee. In the bankruptcy filing, Dykstra had listed assets of $24.6 million and overall debts of $37.1 million. Among the assets listed were two residences: a Ventura County mansion in Lake Sherwood Estates he had purchased from hockey legend Wayne Gretzky valued at $18.5 million, and a home in Westlake Village that he estimated was worth $5.4 million. During his financial turmoil, Dykstra's personal property became part of the bankruptcy estate that would be used to pay off creditors. In his guilty plea in July, Dykstra specifically admitted he committed bankruptcy fraud by lying about whether he had taken and sold items from his $18 million Sherwood mansion after creditors seized the property. Dykstra also admitted that there were at least 10 creditors who were victims of his crimes, and those victims each lost between $200,000 and $400,000. Dykstra, who was nicknamed ""Nails"" for his all-out playing style, was a key member of the New York Mets team that won the 1986 World Series. By the time he retired after 12 seasons, he had earned at least $36.5 million while a major leaguer, according to Baseball-Reference.com. As a self-taught financial analyst, Dykstra proclaimed himself a financial guru and began writing a stock-picking website column. His prominence soared as a sports celebrity, entrepreneur and popular guest on numerous financial news broadcasts. In 2008, Dykstra began publishing the Players Club, a glossy financial advice magazine exclusively for pro athletes to help them with wealth management and investment banking. Former baseball star makes plea deal in auto thefts . But Dykstra seemed to lose control of his extravagant jet-setting lifestyle during the housing bust. When Dykstra filed for bankruptcy in 2009, his only income was a $5,700 monthly pension from Major League Baseball, records show. As part of the federal sentence, U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson ordered Dykstra to perform 500 hours of community service and pay $200,000 in restitution. He also was sentenced earlier this year to nine months in jail after pleading no contest to charged of indecent exposure to women he met through Craigslist.","Former Mets star amassed fortune playing baseball and investing in stocks .

"(CNN) -- The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, set off a media kerfuffle this month when he spoke about his next reincarnation. Not a man afraid to surprise people, he told two German journalists that he didn't see a need for there to be more Dalai Lamas in the future. The German newspaper concluded that this meant he was not planning to return as a reincarnation. A French news agency announced that there would be no more Tibetan spiritual leaders. The Dalai Lama's office in India protested that he had been misquoted. Eventually, people began to listen to the original interview, where it was noticed that the Dalai Lama had clearly said ""I hope and pray that I will return."" End of palpitations for his loyal followers and Tibetan nationalists, who very much want him to come back. In fact, the Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising by Tibetans against Chinese rule, has often spoken about major change in the institution he embodies. He's said that there might be no more Dalai Lamas, that the next one could be elected rather than discovered, that it would be good if she were a woman, and even that he might not be the actual Dalai Lama anyway. But these are always marked as forms of speculation. His formal position on this question is quite clear. In 2011, in a rare ""gal che'i bka' yig"" or ""Important Proclamation"", he declared that he will make a decision on the future of the Dalai Lama lineage in around 2024 after consulting with other high lamas and the Tibetan public. If there is to be a successor, he announced, it will either be a child identified as a reincarnation after his death, or a person recognized as an ""emanation,"" chosen by him while he is still alive. And, he added, ""I shall leave clear written instructions"" -- presumably to help journalists and others get the story right. Future . There are practical reasons behind the Dalai Lama's efforts to prepare people for systemic change. Reincarnation as a succession system can produce highly effective charismatic leaders, but it has a structural flaw: it takes several years for a new child to be found and identified, and then another 15 years or more before the successor can take up the work of leadership. In addition, the system is famously prone to interference, corruption, and power struggles, not to mention ridicule: In the 1870s, according to the scholar Melvyn Goldstein, a Lhasa street song had the refrain ""Her Excellency Mrs Doring's ass is black with soot,"" in honor of a famous aristocrat who tried to entice a future Dalai Lama into her womb by burning incense under it. The Dalai Lama's decision three years ago to hand the running of his exile government over to an elected leader was partly designed to remedy these problems. But even without any official position, he still remains the most influential figure in the Tibetan world, and no-one has yet come up with a credible solution to the Tibetan-China dispute that does not depend on him. But there have been no official talks between the two sides for four years. President Xi Jinping is making his first trip to India since taking power, but at 79 years old, the Dalai Lama needs to push China urgently to resume dialogue with his representatives. He knows that China is determined to appoint the next Dalai Lama -- it passed a government regulation in 2007 declaring that henceforth only it is allowed to permit a lama to reincarnate. Hinting that he might not return is a reminder by the Dalai Lama to Beijing that time is running out if it wants to avoid a lengthy dispute once he dies. Imperial response . If the Dalai Lama's aim was to goad Beijing into a response, it worked. In one of history's more bizarre instances of role reversal, China's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman reprimanded the Dalai Lama for telling the Germans he might not return and called on him to respect the practice of reincarnation. ""China follows a policy of freedom of religion and belief,"" she said, ""and this naturally includes having to respect and protect the ways of passing on Tibetan Buddhism."" This apparently doesn't include the Dalai Lama's ways of passing it on, because, it was explained, he ""has ulterior motives, and is seeking to distort and negate history, which is damaging to the normal order of Tibetan Buddhism."" The spokeswoman was right that history is a good place to turn to for solutions to this dispute. As she went on to say, China's rulers in the past issued titles to previous Dalai Lamas. But the details are important: Emperors only did that in some cases, they didn't try to interfere as to who was chosen, and the lamas held their titles whether or not they received imperial endorsement. Even as late as the mid-1990s, the Communist Party's practice was somewhat similar: They left decisions regarding reincarnations to local lamas and their followers and just rubber-stamped the choice once it was made. In the last two decades that Beijing has reverted to trying to control every detail of Tibetan religion, and at the same time blame all setbacks on the Dalai Lama. Neither of these approaches reflects Chinese history or custom towards Tibet. The lessons of the past would let Tibetans decide for themselves how to implement traditions, which Beijing could then confirm if it felt it needed to. The Dalai Lama's apparently offhand remarks to the German journalists and the Chinese put-down were thus a form of diplomatic push-pull in public. For that to ever lead to a solution, Beijing will need to think more about respect than about control, and the Dalai Lama will need to reassure Beijing about his intentions. Until that happens, expect more cryptic exchanges between the two via the world's media.","Dalai Lama's comments about his next reincarnation set off a media kerfuffle .

"Washington (CNN)  -- Anita Kramer had no idea that a 72-inch water main in her Maryland neighborhood was a ticking time bomb that was about to flood her home and ruin many of her most cherished possessions. In the wake of the water main break, Kramer's basement kitchen was a mess. Appliances were covered in dirt, as was the floor. Dark water and mold stains marked the baseboards and walls.   ""It's not the money value of what you lost,"" she said about the pipe burst. ""You put your heart into doing something ... the memories you lose -- it was a hard experience."" Kramer's disaster was just one of an average 700 water main breaks nationwide that experts say occur each day. They warn that this is the latest sign of an aging water delivery infrastructure that results in property loss, inconvenience, and threats to public health. The nation's drinking water system is so troubled, the American Society of Civil Engineers gave it a grade of D minus, in its 2009 Report Card of America's Infrastructure. ""Anytime you're breaking the seal of the system that brings water into your homes and apartments, you're risking contamination from bacteria and viruses,"" said Eric Goldstein of the Natural Resources Defense Council. He blamed infrastructure for a 2008 salmonella outbreak that sickened more than 250 people in Alamosa, Colorado. ""And that's just the tip of the iceberg,"" he said. Each day, leaking pipes account for an estimated 7 billion gallons of water, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. Much of this is blamed on age. A large part of the U.S. water delivery system dates back to the years shortly after World War II. ""Now it's time to replace that system and we've got to make those investments or we'll suffer the consequences,"" said Goldstein. To get an idea of how old the nation's water pipes are, 30% of pipes in systems that deliver water to more than 100,000 people are between 40 and 80 years old, according to the EPA. About 10% of pipes in those systems are older. But as they say, timing is everything. The aging infrastructure threat also comes in the wake of a recession, when politicians are struggling to maintain state and federal budgets. Also, water systems must compete with needs for other underground systems, such as communications networks. When crews dig to fix broken water pipes, ""there's now Verizon lines that didn't used to be there, cable lines, fiber lines, electrical lines,"" said District of Columbia water general manager George Hawkins. ""So much has been added to the underworld, that each one of the these fixes is getting more and more complicated to get done properly."" The nation's capital, Hawkins said, averages about one water pipe break each day. How much would it cost to fix? Every year, according to the EPA, the estimated price tag for repairing the nation's water infrastructure rises. The best guess at a total cost over the next 20 years has skyrocketed from about $198 billion in 1999 to the latest estimate -- $335 billion. ""We also need a national political leadership that understands the extraordinary significance and importance of this investment and why it matters to them and why it will pay us back,"" said Hawkins. ""Conservative or liberal does not matter."" So how did things get so complicated? Through the 1970s most of the cost of building sewage plants and drinking water systems was paid for by Washington, said Goldstein. Federal leaders ""understood what a national priority this is,"" he said. ""You can't have jobs, you can't have businesses, you can't have hotels, homes, if this infrastructure isn't in place."" During the past couple of decades federal money for water systems has been cut significantly, he said. Economic stimulus legislation in 2009 was a ""drop in the bucket,"" said Goldstein, who said about $10 billion was aimed at U.S. water infrastructure projects -- out of $787 billion in total stimulus. Government funding of community water systems may be partially to blame for the crumbling water infrastructure, said Randal O'Toole, senior analyst for the Cato Institute policy think tank. ""The money should come from user fees,"" said O'Toole. ""All the costs of construction and maintenance might be borne by users out of annual or monthly fees."" To keep prices down, O'Toole suggested privatizing community water utilities. ""In the 19th century, almost every major American city had private water companies,"" said O'Toole. ""And then we had this wave of socialization where the government took everything over and mismanaged it so the quality of tap water is lower and costs are higher.""","U.S. averages 700 water main breaks daily, say experts .

"(CNN) -- The Bush and Obama administrations' extraordinary program of targeted killing has resulted in the deaths of as many as 4,400 people to date. Books such as Daniel Klaidman's ""Kill or Capture"" and David E. Sanger's ""Confront and Conceal"" are appearing thick and fast, focusing on the program and particularly on the use of drones to carry it out. The belated scrutiny is welcome. Yet it still fails to critically assess the essential question: Is this killing occurring in war? Both Presidents Bush and Obama have attempted to justify thousands of drone attacks as part of a ""war"" or ""armed conflict."" But is that correct? The question must be answered in terms of international law. When the United States kills people in foreign, sovereign states, the world looks to international law for the standard of justification. In war, enemy fighters may be killed under a standard of reasonable necessity; outside war, authorities are far more restricted in their right to resort to lethal force. Independent scholars confirm that many drone attacks are occurring outside war zones. These experts know the legal definition of war, and they understand why it is important to know it: Above all, protecting human rights is different in war than from protecting them in peace. News: Pakistan spy agency chief to tell CIA: End drone strikes; ID targets for us to attack . Admittedly, this dual standard for justifiable killing makes the law protecting the right to life more complicated than the law protecting other fundamental rights. Torture, for example, is absolutely prohibited in international law at all times, in war and peace. The law on killing is different. The human right to life codified in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the United States is a party, prohibits the ""arbitrary"" deprivation of life. It does not prohibit absolutely all taking of life. The military may use lethal force against enemy fighters during an armed conflict if the use of force meets the requirements of military necessity, and if it will not have a disproportionate impact on civilian lives and property. Countries may lawfully initiate armed conflict in self-defense if the state is the victim of a significant armed attack, as long as the self-defense is carried out against the state responsible for the armed attack. President Bush declared a ""global war on terror"" after 9/11 to, presumably, gain the advantage of more relaxed rules on killing and detention. Some of the same lawyers who tried to develop legal cover for the use of torture produced an even flimsier analysis of why the entire world was a war zone, so that the president could authorize killing and detention of individuals worldwide. Lawyers in both the Bush and Obama administrations have reportedly prepared memos that according to the media assert the CIA may lawfully conduct so-called ""targeted killings"" of the ""war on terror"" without violating President Reagan's ban on assassination. Legality seems to turn in this analysis on the president personally approving a ""kill list."" In November 2002, the first killings occurred under this ""global war"" assertion. Six people, including a 23-year-old American, were killed by Hellfire missiles in Yemen fired from CIA-operated drones based in Djibouti. The UN special rapporteur for extra-judicial killing condemned the attack as an arbitrary deprivation of the right to life, but it would take over six years and a change of party in the White House before human rights advocates, international law scholars, moral philosophers, theologians, and others would begin to focus on targeted killing as they had focused on the use of torture. Why has it taken so long to focus on so many questionable deaths? As already indicated, the law is more complicated on killing than on torture. To make the legal argument against targeted killing requires sophisticated knowledge of a broader range of international law than is involved in defending a human right such as the right to be free from torture. Also, the Bush administration carried out fewer targeted killings: Of the 336 attacks as of July 2012 in Pakistan, 284 have occurred under Obama. Bush officials were better able, therefore, to suppress discussion. Also, human rights advocates had their hands full with the more visible problems of the Bush era: torture, Guantanamo Bay and military commissions. A number of them then joined the Obama administration; rather than condemn targeted killing as the violation of international law that it is, some former critics are defending it, presumably as part of their job. Opinion: Civilian casualties plummet in drone strikes . The job of the International Law Association is to report on international law in a scholarly and objective fashion. The ILA has had a Committee on the Use of Force for decades. From 2005 to 2010, when I was its chair, the 18-member committee, including members from five continents, undertook to produce a report on how ""war"" is legally defined. That report assesses hundreds of violent incidents over a period of 65 years. It concludes that under international law, war or armed conflict exists only when there is intense inter-group fighting by organized armed groups. These are objectively verifiable criteria that cannot be fabricated by politicians. The International Committee of the Red Cross recently invoked them with respect to the violence in Syria. The situation in Syria became a civil ""war"" when organized armed groups were fighting with intensity of some duration. Targeted killing with drones in Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan have generally violated the right to life because the United States is rarely part of any armed conflict in those places. The human right to life that applies is the right that applies in peace. Complete coverage of drones on CNN's Security Clearance blog . Today, the United States is engaged in armed conflict only in Afghanistan. To lawfully resort to military force elsewhere requires that the country where the United States is attacking has first attacked the United States (such as Afghanistan in 2001), the U.N. Security Council has authorized the resort to force (Libya in 2011) or a government in effective control credibly requests assistance in a civil war (Afghanistan since 2002).

"(CNN) -- When it comes to animals, it seems people like to watch just about anything give birth. That includes an Airville, Pennsylvania, horse named Stormy. It's been over two weeks since Stormy's owner, Jodie Otte, flipped on a streaming webcam inside the horse's stable so she and her 14-year-old daughter wouldn't miss the birth. But soon there were thousands of eyes watching Stormy's every move over the Internet, waiting for her foal to arrive. The cream and white mare, who gave birth to a filly early Tuesday -- days past her due date -- has drawn the attention of horse enthusiasts, parents and children around the world. Stormy's live webcam feed is hosted on Mare Stare, a site devoted to hosting webcam videos that feature horses giving birth and show foals standing, eating and playing for the very first time. Otte says the first day the 18-year-old horse's webcam went live, it got more than 10,000 hits on Mare Stare. A friend of Otte's posted a screenshot from the webcam on CNN iReport, where it in turn got 18,000 views. Man leaves $1,000 tip for dog's surgery . Otte, an accountant and photographer who lives in nearby Norrisville, Maryland, said she and her close friends all understand the humor and slight absurdity in Stormy's unexpected popularity. ""It's nuts. If my feed goes down people call me at work,"" she said. ""I have no idea why people are so into Stormy, but I think it's the miracle of birth,"" Otte said. Sandra Armenteros, a close friend and photography colleague of Otte's who shared the story on iReport, has been closely tracking the horse's rise to stardom. ""The first international fans came from Canada and Australia, where we have colleagues. After that, it really took off. The world is literally watching this horse."" One family that eagerly awaited Stormy's delivery was the Bielawski family in Goshen, New York. Jamie Bielawski, another friend of Otte's, home-schools her four daughters, ages 7 to 11. She started showing her girls Stormy's webcam feed after Otte opened the webcam up to the public. Photos: Animals in the snow . ""I wanted the girls to experience a horse be born,"" she said Tuesday. ""A lot of kids today go to Walmart and see a chicken come from a package and that it comes from Perdue, but I want my kids to understand the environment and animals and what animals go through."" She has made the webcam a learning experience for her girls, teaching them about horse anatomy and the science behind pregnancy. ""When they wake up they don't say, 'Has the foal been born yet?' They ask, 'Is the sac showing yet? Are the hooves showing?' They know the process of a horse's birth,"" she said. Her 9-year-old daughter, Andie, loves watching Stormy with her sisters on their smartphone, and they'll pass it around to see how the mare is doing. ""It is cool watching an animal give birth,"" Andie said. ""I am excited to see what the baby will look like. I hope it happens soon."" Stormy's foal took its time to leave the womb, which made some viewers impatient. ""I stayed up till 4 a.m. watching last night! So tired right now! The royal baby wasn't this anticipated,"" Gemma Reeve of London wrote on Otte's Facebook page, which has pictures of Stormy with her foal, a filly. Cooling off in the dog days of summer . Another commenter said the webcam feed was becoming an endless loop. ""This is like the movie 'Groundhog Day.' We might all start to lose it like Bill Murray soon,"" Kelly Barclay wrote. Some people blamed the worldwide exposure for Stormy's delay in delivery. On Mare Stare's Facebook page, one commenter wrote, ""Poor mare is holding back on foaling because there are way too many people hanging out around her."" This isn't the first time an animal's health has gripped the attention of thousands of Internet fans.

"Editor's note: CNN contributor Bob Greene is a best-selling author whose current book is ""When We Get to Surf City: A Journey Through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll, Friendship, and Dreams."" Bob Greene says that when an illness threatens, we realize the vital role of medical researchers. (CNN) -- These are times when the cult of celebrity seems especially empty, when our national love affair with multimillion-dollar shortstops and with beautiful actresses whose flawless faces are enough to guarantee huge box-office weekends feels devoid of meaning. Right now, as the eventual path of the swine flu emergency remains uncertain, the world is beginning to turn its pleading eyes in the direction of men and women whose names and faces we don't even know. They are the men and women who, wearing lab coats in medical and scientific facilities, are working -- as they do every day -- toward the conquest of disease. The wider world seldom gives them a thought until suddenly we realize that we need them. Until abruptly, in the midst of our constant cultural obeisance to flashiness and surface glamour, we are forced to stop and recognize: . We need help. Sickness is upon us, and there are conflicting reports on its potential severity. Our political leaders say not to panic because it may turn out to be relatively mild, but in the absence of definitive facts the words sound somehow hollow. There is no vaccine. There may not be a cure for all cases. The disease, in many ways, seems to hold all the cards. Times like these don't come along very often. When they do, it is probably a good idea to pause and reflect upon the quiet work done every day by those men and women in the laboratories. There were two men, now dead, who, toward the end of their lives, could pass through any airport in the country without being recognized. They saved the world's children: saying those words is not much of an exaggeration. Yet, by the time they were old men, they were less applauded than the average NBA forward or prime-time television make-believe cop. But talk about the definition of heroism. In the early 1950s the world was in utter terror because a relentless, paralyzing virus was spreading and turning into the cruelest of epidemics. In hospitals across the United States, children were confined to iron lungs because polio had robbed them of the power to breathe on their own. Parents were fearful of letting their sons and daughters play outdoors or swim in public pools, yet the caution wasn't helping. The disease was winning. In separate American laboratories, two men working separately -- Dr. Jonas Salk and Dr. Albert Sabin -- were determined to defeat the polio virus, to end the heartbreak. Salk developed the first, injectable polio vaccine; Sabin developed an oral vaccine that would eventually supplant it. Years later, as they were entering the winter of their lives, I sought both of them to speak about what it was like to be working, with the clock ticking, against such a disease. ""I never thought it couldn't be done,"" Salk told me. ""Yes, of course there were doubters. But I didn't pay attention to anybody."" There is self-confidence, and then there is self-confidence. Growing up, Salk was not the kind of boy who often heard cheers. As one biographical sketch of him put it: ""To his schoolmates Salk was a person of little importance. A thin, small-boned child, untalented at games and not gifted in class, he was tolerated but not sought after."" Yet he was there when the time of reckoning arrived, when the world needed someone to come through. ""You ask me what persuades a man that something is doable? Your self persuades you that something is doable,"" Salk said. Why, of all the doctors in the world, did it fall upon him to finally stop polio in its tracks? ""I didn't think I was the person appointed to do this,"" Salk said. ""I was simply granted the opportunity to help. We do not all see the world in the same way. There are those of us who see it in terms of solvable problems. If you have a problem that can be solved, then it will be solved."" And the frustrations that came with trying, on deadline -- in every sense of that word -- to stop a crippling virus? ""You're not on a golf course,"" Salk said. ""You don't say to yourself, 'Today's the day I'm going to break par.' What you do is have a continuing dialogue with nature. You ask questions in the form of experiments. And you get answers. Yes or no. Yes or no. Yes or no. And then you use those answers to ask your next question, and you keep doing it until you have the ultimate answer."" Sabin was looking for the answer at the same time. ""You had an epidemic involving thousands upon thousands of children,"" Sabin said. ""There was obviously a great need, and when there is a need like that, you've got to keep working even when you have no idea what the outcome is going to be."" Despondency, he said, was always lurking over his shoulder. ""There were many times when not only did my colleagues tell me it couldn't be done,"" he said, ""they told me to throw the whole thing down the rathole. And I confess to wondering at times whether they might not be right. ""But I kept at it. I kept asking myself, 'What do I have to do? What is the next step?'. . .In the middle of the night you often wake up with an idea. You have a notebook by your bed so you can write these things down,so that they're not lost in the morning. ""The fear. The fear! You never lost sight of the human side of what you were doing. You were driven on by the knowledge that there was human misery, and that you could use your knowledge to help eliminate it."" Jonas Salk died in 1995 at the age of 80; Albert Sabin died in 1993 at the age of 86. But right now, there are men and women at work in laboratories, men and women whose names we do not yet know. Suddenly we are depending on them. Perhaps they are feeling exhausted, or overwhelmed. I can still hear Dr. Sabin's voice: . ""There is a line -- I believe it is by Sir Francis Drake -- that a superior officer of mine during World War II quoted to me. I shall never forget it: 'Grant us to know that it is not the beginning, but the continuing of the same until it is thoroughly finished, that yieldeth the true glory.'""

"(CNN) -- What was a somber mood following convicted cop killer Troy Davis' execution Wednesday night turned to disgust and outrage by morning. Casey Anthony was a trending topic Thursday because so many people had taken to Twitter to express their dismay over Anthony being deemed innocent in the death of her daughter while Davis is executed. ""Casey Anthony is offered a book deal, Troy Davis is only offered his last meal. Wake up America, our justice system is screwed,"" came a tweet from the handle JamesKlynn. Another, from TRizzleComedy, read, ""If the Troy Davis situation has taught us anything today, its that Casey Anthony should've been black."" A jury found Anthony not guilty of murder in July, whereas a jury and several judges on appeal have determined that Davis killed Savannah, Georgia, police officer Mark MacPhail in 1989. Spencer Lawton, Davis' prosecutor, has said the case withstood every legal challenge but couldn't win the battle of public opinion. Race has been a major factor in people's perception of the case, with many claiming Davis was railroaded because he was black. It also has raised questions about the fairness of the death penalty and whether it is more often applied to African-Americans than whites. While assertions that the U.S. executes more blacks than whites are incorrect -- the country has executed 263 more white people than black people since the death penalty's 1976 reinstatement -- inequalities exist when a murder is interracial. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, 15 white defendants have been executed for the murder of black victims, but 246 African-Americans have been executed for killing whites. It's just one of many factors that have Davis supporters and death penalty opponents -- often one and the same -- demanding that capital punishment be re-examined in this country. Former President Jimmy Carter, who along with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Pope Benedict XVI was among the most influential voices calling for clemency, said as much in his statement after Davis' lethal injection. ""If one of our fellow citizens can be executed with so much doubt surrounding his guilt, then the death penalty system in our country is unjust and outdated. We hope this tragedy will spur us as a nation toward the total rejection of capital punishment,"" Carter wrote. Certainly, the death penalty is an issue for which American support has flagged and spiked in the decades since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstituted it, but Americans have largely supported it since the 1930s, according to Gallup. The only exception, according to the polling agency, is 1966, when 47% of Americans said they opposed it, compared with 42% who backed it. Since the country began performing executions again, critics have been heavily outnumbered, with opposition never topping 32%, Gallup says. Support jumped to 80% -- compared with 16% against -- in 1994, and a poll last year showed a 64-29 split, with 6% expressing no opinion, Gallup reported. Some of those who favor executions as a criminal deterrent flocked to CNN to post their thoughts on Davis' death. ""Justice served,"" wrote dplandy, while SuperSlim32 wrote, ""But he was a good guy when he wasn't pistol whipping people or shooting them in the face."" The latter is a reference to a jury also finding Davis guilty of two aggravated assault charges: that he shot a man outside a pool party in Savannah before striking a homeless man with his pistol. It was the pistol-whipping that prompted MacPhail to respond to the Burger King parking lot where he was killed. Some CNN commenters defended the police work and prosecution that led to Davis' conviction and execution. One, fitat50, even said, ""The reason some people care about him is because they are sheep."" Added DTiger901, ""How about you just read the facts concerning the case...like that there were 34 witnesses against him..some of whom knew him before the cold blooded murder then identified him. Oh wait, you would never take the time to read the case you just want to jump on the 'he's innocent bandwagon.' "" But some death penalty supporters, like commenter marciavolk, said there was too much doubt to administer the ultimate punishment. The commenter further said that the death penalty is ""administered arbitrarily"" and that the ""long-standing discrimination against minorities in the south (yeah it's still there)"" played a role in the decision to execute Davis. ""We will never know if Troy Davis was or was not guilty of the crimes he was charged with and that alone should have prevented him from being executed,"" marciavolk wrote. Another commenter, jangar, took issue with the evidence in the case, which has been in question since seven of nine witnesses recanted or changed their original testimony from the 1991 trial. As Amnesty International and others have pointed out, Davis' supporters also have problems with the lack of physical evidence and the investigation's failure to produce the .38-caliber pistol used in the slaying. ""As we have seen over the years eye-witness testimony a lot of times is unreliable,"" jangar wrote. ""People say they saw something, convince themselves they really did see something, and then determine they could have been mistaken; but with physical evidence -- gun, body, video tape -- the evidence is there in front of you and can be tested for DNA."" The divergence of sentiments regarding Davis' death was apparent around the globe. While right-wing legal analyst and author Ann Coulter wrote a Thursday article headlined ""Cop Killer is Media's Latest Baby Seal,"" the NAACP slammed the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles' refusal to intervene. ""There is too much doubt to proceed with an execution. No amount of deliberation will change the fact that the case against Mr. Davis has too many holes,"" President Ben Jealous wrote. The European Union, the French Foreign Ministry and Germany's junior minister for human rights joined Jealous in denouncing the execution, with the EU saying that America must abolish capital punishment ""to protect human dignity."" In the U.S., protests were not limited to Jackson, Georgia, where the state has been electrocuting or lethally injecting death row inmates since 1983. In Washington, more than a dozen people were arrested outside the White House during a protest organized by Howard University. Matt Tapie, 32, a CNN iReporter from Alexandria, Virginia, and doctorate candidate at Catholic University, said he joined the demonstrators there. He was busy writing his dissertation Wednesday but said he knew he had to participate. He said he was appalled by the final outcome. ""We can see how much further we have to go in a country where we have an African-American president ... but an African-American in Georgia can be executed,"" he said. In Chicago, David Manning, 31, who had not been following the case, was taking photographs in the city when he ran across forlorn protesters in ""I Am Troy Davis"" T-shirts leaving a protest in Daley Plaza after the execution. ""What struck me was the looks on their faces as they walked away,"" the iReporter said. ""They looked very frustrated and down.""","Many claim race played a major role in decision to refuse clemency for Troy Davis .

"(CNN) -- In many ways, Musab Al-Jamal makes for an unassuming rebel. His mission is seemingly innocuous. He merely wants to educate the swarms of college-aged Syrian refugees who have been forced to abandon their studies while fleeing Syria. ""The universities in Syria are basically like prisons for students,"" says Al-Jamal. ""They capture or arrest anyone who opposes the regime. On the other hand, universities outside the country often don't accept Syrian students, or the students can't pay the fees or speak the local language."" To some, it may seem like access to higher education is hardly a priority for the 2.5 million refugees that have fled Syria since the conflict started three years ago. To Al-Jamal and his fellow academics, however, it is a seminal component in one day rebuilding a broken country. ""If (the students who left their studies) come back to Syria ignorant and illiterate, they won't be able to help their country,"" he says. A former law professor from Damascus University, Al-Jamal joined other faculty ousted from the ravaged country to start offering lectures to students in liberated regions inside Syria, and in neighboring countries. In 2013, he set up the Free Syrian University, an academic institution housed in an apartment building in Reyhanli, a Turkish town near the Syrian border. It offers 13 majors, including law, psychology and business. The university is mainly funded by Al-Jamal himself, and a host of academic volunteers donating their time and expertise to the cause (Al-Jamal gives them a one-time payment of $1,500 when they sign up). Any student with the means contributes $280 per semester for their education. ""The amount is mainly symbolic,"" admits Al-Jamal. ""It barely covers 10% of expenses."" It's difficult to discern how many Syrians have had to abandon their studies since the conflict started, though, according to Keith Watenpaugh, an associate professor at the University of California, Davis, and the co-author of a study on Syria's refugee university students in Jordan, the number likely exceeds 100,000. ""Our major concern is that the longer this conflict goes on, the more you're creating a lost generation of college students,"" he says. 'Studying is holy' Today, Syria's universities -- like many of the country's social institutions -- are, essentially, collapsing. Watenpaugh estimates they're operating at 50% capacity, hampered by security issues, fleeing faculty, and broken-down infrastructure. Often, he notes, students have to cross battle lines just to attend classes. Male students -- who were once exempt from military service -- are now pressured into it. For those reasons, there is little impetus for those inside the country to continue their schooling. It's a marked change from how education was treated in recent decades. ""I think something that is often lost on people who are only coming to think about Sryia post-conflict is how important education was as a place where different minorities and genders mixed. Syria was a place in which education could be accessed by anyone who received the requisite score on an exam,"" says Adrienne Fricke, a human rights consultant and co-author of Watenpaugh's study. ""There's long been a deep commitment to education, and it's not just window dressing. Historically providing educational access was considered one of the things the Ba'ath party did really well."" For those students forced to give up their schooling, their commitment to higher learning hasn't diminished, even if their opportunities to pursue it have. On a research trip to Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan last April, Watenpaugh recalls meeting a group of female engineering students who smuggled their computers out of the country. ""We asked them how supportive their parents were, and if they would let them go abroad to study. They all answered yes. One woman said, 'in our house, studying is holy.'"" Overcoming obstacles? The challenges facing those who want to continue their education are fierce. ""They range from the prosaic, like not having a transcript, or maybe just having a photocopied one, to the substantive, like having to choose between tuition and taking care of family,"" says Watenpaugh. Neighboring countries don't always make it easy. Jordan, for instance, is hostile to refugee institutions that risk becoming permanent. In Turkey, there's the added barrier of language. On top of everything else, space is limited, both at foreign universities, and at the Free Syrian University, which can accommodate little more than 800 students -- a fact that keeps Al-Jamal awake at night. ""I regret that I'm not able to accept the whole Syrian student body, but we don't have the capabilities. We could only do that if we had more funding,"" he says. Furthermore, the refugee population, of both students and faculty, is disparate, with many still stuck in Syria. To remedy this, Al-Jamal offers lessons via Skype, Facebook and email. Interestingly, many of Syria's fragmented student population seem to have a singular focus, according to Fricke: returning home one day. She says this is evidenced by the fact that courses at the Free Syrian University are taught in Arabic, not Turkish. She also cites the fact that several thousand Syrian refugees in opposition-held areas of Syria and in neighboring countries rallied to take the high school exit exams based on the revised 2011 Syrian curriculum. According to Fricke, several hundred students chose to take the exit exams recognized by the Syrian opposition government in exile in Libya. ""The primary reason to sit for Syrian exams outside of Syria is because you think you can go back and use them there, especially when it is not clear who outside of Syria will recognize the results,"" says Fricke.

"(CNN) -- It's called a document dump. In this case, 175 pages of contractors' internal updates on the beleaguered HealthCare.gov website were blasted out Wednesday night by Rep. Darryl Issa's Republican-led House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. You can read it all online.

Related: Obamacare launch may have been worse than first reported . 1. Low-tech options failed too . In the first weeks of the Obamacare sign-up, the two low-tech options for Americans -- the call center and paper applications -- struggled and sometimes froze. An October 8 entry about the number of paper forms turned in at that point simply said ""500 applications ... but can't process any because of log-in and other issues."" By October 16, some 3,000 paper applications were in the processing center but only ""81 have been successfully entered."" A tough decision emerged: Should navigators -- those who help people sign up -- recommend that folks leave the slow website and send in a paper form? Or would that matter? Contractors wrote they were waiting on the Department of Health and Human Services to decide. By October 15, contractors were recommending the paper applications, documents show. Meanwhile, the call center was getting high marks for low wait times and professional operators, but an October 3 note reads: ""50% of call center calls have issues."" The problem was with a technical interface to check people's identities. Four days later, a more basic issue: ""Our call center reps can't see their screens,"" wrote an unnamed consultant. In response, the Department of Health and Human Services told CNN that these are contractor notes that only depict the state of the website in its first days. ""We have made significant progress,"" said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters. Related: 4 Obamacare myths: Both sides get it wrong . 2. It's all about the 834s . In a document full of figures and consultant-speak, one number stands out: 834. That's the code for the final step in the HealthCare.gov process, when all the data entered is sent to the insurance company a user has chosen. It sets up the actual insurance policy and hands off responsibility to the company or organization running that plan. But from the start, that data was not transferring correctly. ""834 issue - Raised here as well - issuers not receiving 834s that they should be getting,"" a contractor wrote on October 3. At one point no one could track whether the final 834 data entered by individuals was actually the same as the 834 data going out to insurers. Related: GOP focuses on overall Obamacare troubles, not just website . 3. A small group of contractors was key . Reading these pages feels almost voyeuristic. It's a bit like hovering in the back of the main conference room for HealthCare.gov. Problems are listed, tasks to respond to are handed out crisply and clearly. And from the back of the room, you notice something. Those tasks go to a small core group of top coordinators, representing different companies and pieces of the process. The documents refer to those generally on a first-name basis, but not that many names appear. Two dozen or so people -- Carlos, Abigail, Joy, Beth, Milan, Sandeep, John, Meg at CGI, Devon, Lourdes, Gina and others -- had a lot of work on their plates.

As the documents move on and issues are tackled one by one, sweeping problems continue to appear. October 9: ""A new problem in the system has been identified: for about 30% of the 70,000 applicants, the system has skipped applicants through 'events' that are required to complete the application.""

The program recorded each spouse as ""unmarried,"" not just an identity issue but a major data issue for insurers. • For weeks, programmers fought a problem that initially blocked and later snagged naturalized citizens who needed verification from the Department of Homeland Security. • Contractors spent almost two weeks sorting out how to handle weight loss surgery and whether insurance companies need to include that in all policies. • In mid-October, the tool to estimate potential premiums was misreading ages, recording each person as having an age range, rather than a definite age.

"(CNN) -- A swarm of poisonous spiders has wreaked havoc in a remote town in northeast India, scaring its inhabitants and possibly killing two people. According to a report Sunday in The Times of India, a large number of spiders descended on the town of Sadiya in Assam as a local festival came to end on May 8 and sparked panic as residents tried to avoid the swarm. The report said that scores of people later visited the town's hospital with spider bites and a middle-aged man and a teenage boy died after being bitten by the spiders. The incident alarmed local officials who told residents to stay indoors and considered spraying the town with insecticide, the report said. Jintu Gogoi told The Times he felt excruciating pain and nausea after being bitten by one of the spiders and his finger was black and swollen. However, the attack has puzzled spider experts. Last month, LR Saikia and a team of researchers from Dibrugarh University visited the town to investigate what had happened. Saikia told CNN that he believed the man may have died from a snake bite, while the boy may not have suffered any bite at all. ""The evidence that we gathered does not support the claim that they died after being bitten by spiders,"" Saikia said. Saikia added that the man's relatives appeared to have taken him to traditional spiritual healers instead of qualified doctors when symptoms appeared. He confirmed that about 12 people have visited hospitals in the area recently, complaining of spider bites. ""Only two of them were confirmed bitten by spiders. But they were ordinary spiders,"" Saikia said. Investigators drew their conclusions from questioning relatives of the two dead people about the type of bite marks and symptoms, Saikia said. Some 20 spiders resembling tarantulas from the incident were handed over to investigators during their week-long stay. Tarantulas indigenous to the region are not known to be fatally venomous, but about five of the recovered spiders are currently undergoing tests. When asked if spiders were likely to have swarmed the town of just under 1,000 people, Saikia said, ""This is just a story ... based on rumors.""

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- At the conclusion of one of China's most high-profile criminal cases, the verdict and sentencing of Gu Kailai did not surprise many observers. The guilty verdict had been widely expected, as Gu had confessed, during her one-day trial earlier this month, that she and an aide poisoned British businessman Neil Heywood. The high-powered wife of deposed Chinese politician Bo Xilai had blamed a ""mental breakdown"" for her actions. In the end Gu escaped with her life after receiving a suspended death sentence, though she'll likely be jailed for life. Her aide, Zhang Xiaojun, also was found guilty Monday in Heywood's death and sentenced to nine years in prison. The British embassy in Beijing issued a statement saying it did not want the death penalty applied in the case. ""We welcome the fact that the Chinese authorities have investigated the death of Neil Heywood, and tried those they identified as responsible,"" it said. ""We consistently made clear to the Chinese authorities that we wanted to see the trials in this case conform to international human rights standards and for the death penalty not to be applied."" But others believe the verdict was a forgone conclusion. Ahead of the trial, Donald Clarke, professor at George Washington University Law School and writer of the Chinese Law Prof Blog, wrote in an opinion piece: ""Most China-watchers assume that proceedings in this case have been tightly controlled to ensure that only the officially approved narrative emerges. ""They assume that the verdict was decided in Beijing before the opening gavel sounded, and that the proceedings were merely a performance for the benefit of the public, a kind of judicial Shakespeare-in-the-park, but without the drama."" Discussions of the Bo Xilai and Gu Kailai were blocked on Sina Weibo, China's popular microblogging site. But Chinese netizens discussed the verdict, alluding to the political saga and voicing skepticism. ""As was expected, they've had a deal earlier,"" wrote user buzaishiwonaishijidu. Weibo user sunshinecn2011 wrote, ""Delayed death penalty!! And it will turn into a life imprisonment, and then into fixed-term imprisonment, and after several years, it is happy life again."" Some focused on the differences in capital punishment between ordinary citizens and political elites. One user, Ke Luomu, posted that the death penalty was ""a special offer only for ordinary people."" In China, non-violent offenders, such as drug smugglers and food safety violators, can be sentenced to death. According to Amnesty International, China is believed to carry out the death penalty more than the rest of the world combined. ""China is believed to have executed thousands in 2010 but continues to maintain its secrecy over its use of the death penalty,"" according to the Amnesty report. ""China used the death penalty in 2010 against thousands of people for a wide range of crimes that include non-violent offenses and after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards."" The most popular comments on CNN's story about Gu carried similar themes. ""China executes thousands of people every year, including those convicted of crimes like corruption and drug trafficking. And yet this woman, found guilty of a cold-blooded homicide, is spared. I guess being married to a party official -- even a fallen one -- does have its privileges,"" wrote one user called Babalawo. Another CNN commenter questioned the severity of Gu's sentence compared with dissidents in the country. ""Li Wangyang convicted for taking part in Tiananmen Square protest sentenced to 22 years jail... Liu Xiaobo (nobel peace prize winner) convicted of ' Inciting subversion of state power ' for writing part of charter 08 sentenced to 11 years jail. And the list goes on... Way to demonstrate China's rule of law?? So people with independent ideas or thoughts are viewed as more of a threat that a cold-blooded murderer?""

"Beijing (CNN) -- Five suspects have been detained in Monday's deadly crash in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, which has been identified as a terrorist attack, Beijing police said Wednesday. The attack -- in which five people died and dozens were hurt -- was ""carefully planned, organized and premeditated,"" police said on their official Weibo account online. Working with police in northwest China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, Beijing police captured the suspects, a spokesman for the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau said. The spokesman, who was not named, said Usmen Hasan; his mother, Kuwanhan Reyim; and his wife, Gulkiz Gini, drove a jeep bearing a Xinjiang license plate into a crowd in the famed square at noon on Monday, killing two people and injuring another 40. Authorities had earlier put the number of injured at 38. The jeep then crashed into a guardrail of Jinshui Bridge across the moat of the Forbidden City. All three of the jeep's occupants died when they set gasoline afire, the spokesman said. The other two fatalities were tourists; a woman from the Philippines and a Chinese man. Police found gasoline, two knives and steel sticks ""as well as a flag with extremist religious content"" in the jeep, the police posting said. In addition, authorities found knives and a ""jihad"" flag in the temporary residence of the five detained suspects, it added. Tensions between Han Chinese and the largely Muslim Uyghurs have sometimes turned violent. A spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, a diaspora group, said Wednesday it was not clear that Uyghurs played any role. ""Every time something like this happens, authorities usually point fingers at Uyghurs,"" Alim Seytoff said. ""The notice should not be taken as the evidence of Uyghur involvement in the incident."" Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong's Center for China Studies, said the incident would be considered a loss of face for Beijing's leaders, especially if it turns out to be related to Uyghur separatism. ""It was close to the Zhongnanhai party headquarters and, in terms of timing, it's on the eve of the plenary session of the Chinese Communist Party, so they don't want these rumors and speculation,"" he said. Earlier this month, Chinese police said they had arrested 139 people in Xinjiang for spreading religious extremism online. The arrests came in the wake of riots that left 35 people dead. Chinese media outlets that reported Monday's incident stuck to the bare-bones details published by China's state run Xinhua news agency.

"(CNN) -- When 60,000 tinkerers arrive at the New York Hall of Science this weekend for World Maker Faire New York, kids will see original action figures designed on a 3-D printer, homemade race cars, robots and a sewing machine turned into a music box. Teachers will see a chance to reimagine U.S. science education. Parents should see a chance to replace the usual after-school and summer routines with activities that captivate kids in positive ways. I see a way to get kids to choose tinkering over TV. Based on 16 years of hearing pitches about the next great thing in education, what jumps out is that demand from young people -- not the education industry's desire to supply something -- is driving the maker movement. High-profile Maker Faire events are the leading edge. A layer or two beneath, in church basements, children's museums and public libraries dubbed ""makerspaces"" -- part high-tech shop class and part Google hangout -- kids are showing up. It is this demand from kids like Raven Hoston-Turner, who was ""super bored"" before her uncle told her about the Mt. Elliott Makerspace in Detroit, that is fueling the maker movement. The New York Hall of Science is part of network of disruptive leaders figuring out how to take this burst of maker interest and use it to improve science education. In a new book, ""Design Make Play: Growing the Next Generation of STEM Innovators,"" editors Margaret Honey and David Kanter of the Hall of Science describe how traditional classroom approaches have suffocated science. Schools caught up in the standardized testing sweepstakes tend to reduce classroom time for science. When schools do teach science, too often they are ""telling students about science"" -- and drilling for memorization -- instead of engaging them. Elementary students receive science education for less than three hours a week. These same kids are watching TV nearly 30 hours per week. One way to activate student learning, as professor Sugata Mitra has shown through his famous Hole-in-the-Wall experiments, is to give kids the right resources and some motivating content and then get out of the way. As with Mitra's notion of ""minimally invasive education,"" young people are taking it upon themselves to decide what to make. Preteens such as Quin Etnyre and Sylvia Todd  are delivering classes and producing online shows for peers and adults who want to produce things with their own hands. Thanks to innovative Pittsburgh foundations that launched the Kids + Creativity Network  in 2007, the region is aligning science instruction in schools with the kinds of activities kids are doing on their own time. The aim was to set learning on fire, says Greg Behr, executive director of Pittsburgh's Grable Foundation. Instead of picking off one or two strong projects to support, Grable invested in building a network. Now, more than 100 groups are pulling in the same direction. Jane Werner, executive director of the Children's Museum of Pittsburgh, built out a 3,000-square-foot makerspace, what it calls MakeSHOP, and is creating an additional 5,000-square-foot MakeSHOP for kids age 10 and up. ""Museums can be labs for education reform,"" Werner says. ""No one can fail at a museum. Why not experiment with education reform at a museum?"" The Elizabeth Forward School District, south of Pittsburgh, is integrating the maker movement into the core of its education mission. The district is ""remaking education,"" transforming traditional classrooms and the library into interactive digital learning labs. ""It helped me learn more, actually,"" says Alyssa, a junior. This is what Dale Dougherty, one of the maker movement's founding fathers, wanted all along. ""What I'm really interested in is an alternative way of engaging kids and getting them into science and technology,"" Dougherty said. Dougherty is CEO of Maker Media, founder of MAKE magazine, Maker Faire and the Maker Education Initiative. This summer, the Maker Education Initiative launched Maker Corps, embedding 106 college students and young professionals from science and technology fields in 34 summer youth programs across the country, including the Pittsburgh children's museum. The initiative expects to have 1,000 corps members working with kids by 2015. In 2007, at the same time the Kids + Creativity Network emerged, a Carnegie Foundation commission set in motion an education reform movement that included 26 states working together on Next Generation Science Standards. State by state, education officials are now deciding whether to adopt the standards. The question hanging out there is whether the maker movement can help U.S. students move up the international rankings of science and math performance. ""Everyone is crossing their fingers and hoping there is this connection to be made,"" says Kanter. ""Even though it's hard to prove, we need to prove it."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Bare.","John Bare says New York's Maker Faire highlights opportunity for education .
He says teaching science to kids can be reimagined by teaching how to make things .
He argues that it's a way to get kids to choose tinkering over watching television .

"(CNN) -- They say in Brazil that football is second only to breathing in importance. On Tuesday, 200 million people in the World Cup host nation had their breath stolen away from them in a dazzling, dizzying display of scoring by the No. 2 team in the world, Germany. No one could have predicted a 7-1 scoreline. That's something from qualifying when a big fish hosts a minnow. It's not the result of a match between the top powers of the sport. Here's a look at some of the record-setting numbers that came from the rout of all routs: . 1. They were in it -- for 10 minutes . You'd have to be almost 100 years old to have been in attendance for the last time Brazil was thumped this badly. At least we think it was Brazil. It certainly didn't look like the product of a nation that has won five World Cups. The funny thing is Brazil was pretty good for the first 10 minutes. They pressed the Germans, mostly kept the ball in the German half. But Germany scored in the 11th minute when Thomas Mueller was left so alone he could have set up a grill in the penalty area and made steaks for everyone. And then the Germans made a meal of the Brazilian defense, stuck in first gear, while the Germans were zipping both ball and strikers artfully through the confused Brazilians. A tearful David Luiz apologized to his countrymen. ""I just wanted to see my people smile. We all know how important it was for me to see all of Brazil be happy, at least because of football,"" the defender said. 2. Step aside, Ronaldo . It was a triple disappointment for Brazil on Tuesday. Not only was the Selecao beaten badly, but famed goal scorer Ronaldo was bumped off the top of the all-time World Cup goal scoring list. German striker Miroslav Klose scored his team's second goal, giving him 16 in World Cup matches, one more than Ronaldo. ""If you've scored the most goals in the history of the World Cup, you've had to earn it. He's still playing at the highest level and scoring goals,"" German coach Joachim Low said. A more inexperienced player might not have scored. Klose's first shot was saved by a sprawling Brazil keeper. The 36-year-old pounced on the rebound and knocked it into the goal. And there was more disappointment. Germany now also lays claim to most goals by one nation in its World Cup history -- 223. In second, Brazil at 220. 3. That sure did escalate quickly . Brazil survived the first knockdown. But like a boxer sensing he can knock his opponent out with a flurry of well-targeted body blows, Germany unleashed hell on Brazil midway through the first half. Minute 23 and 24. Bam. Bam. Minute 26. Bam. Minute 29. Meet the canvas. It was 5-0 before the first half hour. Germany scored a quartet in six minutes. You don't even do that in training. ""We couldn't react to going behind. We got disorganized and panicked after the first goal and then it all went wrong for us,"" Brazil coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said. 4. Where's the defense? You think semifinal, and you imagine two teams playing cautiously, worried to give up a first goal that would doom them. Of the previous six semifinals, four of them had ended 1-0. Another was 0-0 after 90 minutes and didn't see a goal until Minute 119. Not these guys. They went forward with spirit . And it ended with a scoreline from the early days of the World Cup. Germany appeared content to cruise after holding a 5-0 halftime lead, but the Brazilian defense was so lame, the Europeans went ahead and sent two more in to claim another couple of records. They became the first team to score seven goals in a semifinal and to hold the largest margin of victory in such a game. 5. By the way, you guys get one more . Don't pack away the boots just yet, lads. You still have to play in everyone's (very least) favorite contest -- the third-place match. What do you get if you win that, a gift certificate for dinner for two at Rio's best steakhouse? Can you imagine what the scene will be like if Argentina loses to the Netherlands and has to play its archrival in what is usually meaningless match? Heck, we'd even watch this game for a change.","Brazil was feeling pretty good after 10 minutes .
Then the defense faltered and let in a goal .
That wasn't so terrible -- until things really fell apart just a few minutes later .
Germany set many records and broke many Brazilian hearts ."
"(CNN) -- A man who roasted his pet dog to enjoy as a meal with his family and friends escaped prosecution after authorities in New Zealand determined the animal was killed humanely. Auckland SPCA officers found the charred body of a Staffordshire terrier cooking in this barbecue pit. ""We were in a dilemma at seeing something we were fairly upset about -- but being in a position of being able to do absolutely nothing about it,"" said Garth Halliday, of the Auckland Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, on Monday. The SPCA -- which investigates acts of animal cruelty and presses charges -- responded to the house in Mangere, south of Auckland. There, officers found the charred body of a Staffordshire terrier cooking in a barbecue pit.  Watch why owner made decision » . ""They had had the dog for a while, but the man told us his wife was getting tired of the dog. He was becoming a pest,"" Halliday said. ""They decided to get rid of him. But instead of bringing him to the SPCA -- which we recommend -- they decided to have a meal, and cook and eat him."" The family is from Tonga where eating a dog is not uncommon, Halliday said. ""He didn't think he was doing anything wrong,"" he said. Is eating dog meat acceptable? Sound Off below . The incident occurred in February. For the next few months, the SPCA looked into whether the man ought to be charged for the killing. Over the weekend, the organization decided it couldn't because the animal had been killed humanely. The man, Halliday said, struck the dog in the head with a hammer, rendering it unconscious. He then slit its throat. ""That is the normal way -- if one can use that word -- that animals are killed all over the world,"" Halliday said. And under New Zealand's Animal Welfare Act, it is legal to kill an animal if it is slaughtered swiftly and painlessly. Dr Malakai Koloamatangi, a Tongan cultural expert from the University of Canterbury, told CNN affiliate TVNZ that dog meat is a delicacy enjoyed mostly by young men in his homeland. Still, the case infuriated and repulsed many New Zealanders. ""It's appalling,"" said Gracie Williams of Auckland. ""As an animal lover, I am sickened. The law needs to be changed."" Auckland Mayor John Banks, an animal rights activist, told reporters that rather than a new law, what is needed is better education of local customs. In the end, the SPCA closed the case without charges. ""We talked to the people. We told them that although it's not against the law, it is against the general culture of the country to actually kill and eat your own pet dog,"" Halliday said.","Man had roasted his pet dog to enjoy as a meal with his family and friends .

"(CNN) -- A brain-eating amoeba that lurks in fresh water has prompted warnings from Kansas officials after it killed a 9-year-old girl. Hally Yust was an avid water skier and spent the past few weeks swimming in several bodies of fresh water. She died last week from Naegleria fowleri, a brain-eating parasite that lives in warm, standing water. At Hally's funeral Monday, her family wore matching T-shirts with the logo of her water-skiing club, CNN affiliate WDAF said. Relatives honored the young athlete by announcing the Hally Yust Women's Basketball Scholarship at Kansas State University. ""Our precious daughter, Hally, loved life and part of her great joy was spending time playing in the water,"" her family said in a statement. ""Her life was taken by a rare amoeba organism that grows in many different fresh water settings. We want you to know this tragic event is very, very rare, and this is not something to become fearful about."" 'It just causes destruction' While Naegleria fowleri infections are rare, they can have devastating effects. ""The amoeba ... finds itself way back in our noses and then can work its way into our central nervous system, around our brains,"" said Dr. William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University Medical Center. ""And once it's there, it just causes destruction."" Symptoms usually show up five days after infection, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment said. In addition to a severe headache, fever, nausea and vomiting, Naegleria fowleri infections often cause death. More frequent in summer . The cases are often reported in the summer, when more swimmers take a dip in fresh water. Last summer, 12-year-old Zachary Reyna of Florida became infected after he went knee-boarding in fresh water near his home. He later died. Also last summer, Kali Hardig of Arkansas went for a swim and was infected by the parasite. Despite incredible odds against her, Kali survived. Over the past 50 years, about 130 Naegleria fowleri infections have been reported. Of those, only three people -- including Kali -- have survived. While humans can get infected swimming in fresh water, people cannot get infected from drinking water contaminated with the amoeba, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. How to protect yourself . The extreme rarity and randomness of infections can make it difficult to predict where they might occur. ""It is unknown why certain persons become infected with (Naegleria fowleri) while millions of others exposed to warm recreational fresh waters do not, including those who were swimming with people who became infected,"" the CDC said. The Kansas health department advises swimmers to use nose plugs when swimming in fresh water. It also suggests not stirring up the sediment at the bottom of shallow freshwater areas and keeping your head above the water in hot springs and other untreated thermal waters. But Naegleria fowleri is far from the biggest danger in summertime water activities. While 34 people were infected with the amoeba in the U.S. between 2004 and 2013, there were more than 34,000 drowning deaths in the United States between 2001 and 2010, the CDC said.","9-year-old Hally Yust died after contracting Naegleria fowleri .

"London, England (CNN) -- From the original celebrity endorser King Henry VIII to modern-day superstars such as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, the humble football boot has come a long way. Britain's notorious wife-beheading royal paid four shillings -- the equivalent of $1,350 in today's money -- for his custom-made leather pair that were in an inventory of his wardrobe when he died in 1547. By comparison, Nike's new Mercurial Vapor Superfly II is the most expensive boot on the modern retail market, coming in at around $400. Henry VIII's boots would have been sturdy models made from tough leather to cope with the violent, no-rules, all-in-brawl approach to the game of the 16th century, a far cry from the streamlined and lightweight shoes designed for today's game. ""We have a revolutionary technology which has a stud that adapts to different pitch conditions,"" Nike design director Andy Caine told CNN. ""This will make the fastest player even faster whatever the pitch conditions might be. For a modern footballer who's really fast, this is really going to change his game."" The birth of boot-making giants . From workers knocking about in brutal steel-caps, the evolution of boots really kicked off in the late 1880s when nailed-in leather studs helped with traction in muddy fields. In 1948, a falling-out between the two German siblings behind the Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory led to the creation of Adidas and Puma -- the two most influential boot makers until the emergence of Nike in the 1980s. Both companies laid claim to the invention of the screw-in synthetic stud. Adolf (""Adi"") Dassler's company said his firm's innovation helped Germany win the 1954 World Cup when treacherously wet weather struck before the final against Hungary, but brother Rudolph insisted Puma's Super Atom boot featured interchangeable studs years previously. Two decades later, Puma struck an important blow by signing up the world's greatest player, Pele, for $125,000, according to a book by Dutch author Barbara Smit. At the opening game of the 1970 World Cup, the Brazil legend asked the referee to delay starting the match so he could tie up his laces -- meaning valuable exposure for Puma as the world's television cameras focused in on the player's feet, Smit wrote in ""Three Stripes Versus Puma."" Pele's Puma King range was also worn in the 1980s by Argentina superstar Diego Maradona, giving the company an association with two of the best players to have graced the sport, says Alan Spurgeon of specialist Web site www.Footy-Boots.com. Enter the Predator . But Adidas consolidated their position at the top of the boot market thanks to a much lesser-known player. Craig Johnston, born in South Africa and raised in Australia, made his name with English club Liverpool in the 1980s. After retiring at the relatively young age of 27 to look after his ill sister, Johnston came up with the novel idea of adding rubber patches to the outside of boots, which boosted control of the ball and gave added swerve when kicking it. ""I was coaching kids in Australia and I was telling them that they had to grip and bite into the ball like a table tennis bat to swerve it. 'That's fine Mr Johnston,' they said, 'but our boots are made of leather and not rubber, it's raining and they are slippery,' "" he told Britain's Design Museum Web site. ""I went home and took the rubber off a table tennis bat and stuck it on my boots with super glue. Immediately I went outside again and kicked the ball, I could hear a squeak when the rubber engaged with the polyurethane of the ball."" The result, after years of development, was the Predator. Launched in 1994, it has been worn by superstar names such as Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham -- both of whom had customized versions. Johnston, ironically, has recently been a critic of modern boots, saying they contribute to injuries suffered by players. ""People say that the boots don't provide enough protection. In fact, the opposite is true,"" he told FootyBoots in 2009. ""The problem is that the boots are so well made there is no give at all in the materials -- especially the cheaper synthetics. ""The pitches are now so well-maintained and even woven with synthetic materials that the players' studs engage like they should do, but they don't release enough, causing injury. Also, the studs are far too long and give far too much grip."" A new major player in the market . The next most significant boot was Nike's Mercurial Vapor, Spurgeon said, launched in 1998 with the endorsement of Brazilian World Cup winner Ronaldo. That range's popularity is expected to continue with the Superfly II, worn by Portugal's Real Madrid superstar Cristiano Ronaldo -- the planet's most expensive player at $130 million -- at the World Cup in South Africa. Caine said the design took a painstaking three years. ""We really started from scratch on this boot,"" he said. ""It's a long process. Every change you make, you have to make a sample then you have to test it on the pitch, test it in a lab, and make sure it provides a benefit."" The process starts with a small core team who focus on what needs improving from the previous boot, Caine said, gathering input from players and seeking out the latest technical innovations. ""Once you get onto the manufacturing side there's obviously larger development teams that come into it,"" he said. ""A lot of people touch it through its life cycle, but there's quite a small core team who work on the real essence of the design and what it's about."" While Caine is proud of the Superfly's new adaptable retraction system, which can change and extend automatically, Adidas have also unleashed an innovative new product before the World Cup -- even daring to revamp the traditional three-stripe design in a boot that changes color in different light. The AdiZero is the lightest football boot on the market, Spurgeon says, with 2009 world player of the year Lionel Messi's F50 spearheading the range. ""It's the fastest and lightest football shoe that we've ever created,"" Adidas senior product manager for footwear Aubry Dolan told CNN. ""We've talked to the players, professionals and amateurs, and their message was very simple: make me faster. ""The goal was simple, the challenge was very difficult. Never before have so many players felt, touched, tested, seen and thought about the product."" Who rules the roost? The leading companies are coy about releasing boot market figures, but Spurgeon believes Adidas is a clear leader from Nike -- last year the firm claimed it had a 50 percent share in North America and Germany. United States-based Nike, however, is regarded the No. 1 sportswear company, he said. And it may be team shirts and balls, rather than boots, which prove to be the biggest money-earner at the World Cup, according to Germany-based marketing consultancy SPORT+MARKT. ""As the sale of boots is still the core business, both companies are trying hard to sign the world's best football players to endorse their products,"" consultant Stephanus Tekle told CNN. ""However, although boots are the right tool to promote the reliability and the technology of the brands, in terms of sales the World Cup shows a different trend. ""During the event, fans tend to show commitment to their own national teams by purchasing the official jersey and the official ball rather than the boots of their favorite football players. This is probably the most profitable line of business during the World Cup for both Adidas and Nike."" New avenues: The Internet . Adidas has guaranteed maximum exposure in South Africa by buying up exclusive sponsorship rights, forcing Nike to continue the more innovative tactics it started with 2006's ""Joga Bonito"" social networking-style Web site. ""Now Nike is trying to pursue a long-term strategy: no more single campaigns but the activation of more comprehensive marketing, especially via the Internet,"" Tekle said. ""For instance, Nike is deeply involved in CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) activities with the latest campaign, ""Lace Up, Save Lives,"" endorsed by important athletes. The aim is to lend more credibility and reliability to the brand. ""The Internet is soon going to be a major resource for the kit suppliers more and more, and new innovative campaigns should be expected on the web.""","The first recorded football boot belonged to Britain's King Henry VIII almost 500 years ago .

"(CNN) -- When Qatar won the bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup there was much pomp and pageantry in the tiny Persian Gulf state. Ever since then, however, the successful bid has been dogged by controversy. Issues relating to the feasibility of playing in scorching summer temperatures, the conditions of migrant workers building World Cup infrastructure and allegations of bribery and corruption have all been raised. The latest are reports from the UK's Sunday Times newspaper claiming a Qatari official paid more than $5 million to secure support for his country's bid. That prompted some of FIFA's main partners -- who are believed to pay around $180 million in sponsorships -- like Adidas and Sony to voice their concerns. ""We expect these allegations to be investigated appropriately, and continue to expect FIFA to adhere to its principles of integrity, ethics and fair play across all aspects of its operations,"" Sony said in a statement. An independent FIFA investigator is looking into the claims and his findings are expected in July. Qatar says they are cooperating in the probe and that it won the bid fairly. But the debate has now raised questions about whether Qatar could lose the 2022 tournament. Some like UEFA boss, Michel Platini, believe a re-vote is necessary if corruption accusations are proven. As a result, doubt has been cast on whether the country should continue its preparations. Work on the first stadium has already begun and the government has earmarked much of this year's $62 billion budget for World Cup infrastructure spending. Without the tournament, some building plans could slow down. ""The decline in construction activities is going to have an impact on overall GDP growth,"" said Farouk Soussa, chief economist for the Middle East at Citigroup Global Markets. ""If you look long term, the bigger risk is the loss of brand Qatar."" ""Qatar has ambitions to be the regional hub for congress, finance, tourism, etc. The world cup was an integral part of that plan,"" Soussa added. But Qatari officials say plans will go ahead. ""First we are confident that the world cup will be in Qatar in 2022. Second nothing will stop, everything will go forward in fast steps,"" said Rashid bin Ali Al-Mansoori, CEO of the Qatar Stock Exchange. ""As we saw in Qatar there are so many projects that started even before the announcement of winning the World Cup ... the hospital, the metro, the stadium, the airports, the new ports, the Lusail cities."" ""All these are, you know, for the generations to come. It's not only for one event,"" Al-Mansoori added. Still, the uncertainty sent jitters through Qatar's financial markets after the initial Sunday Times report emerged. Roughly $5 billion was wiped off the main stock exchange in the first two days, although some of those losses were later made back. Yet despite the significant impact of these financial shocks, economists point out the country still has its enormous gas wealth to fall back on. It remains the world largest exporter of liquefied natural gas, a fact that's not expected to change any time soon. ""Qatar's cost of extraction is much, much lower than all these new emerging sources are so Qatar always has a cost advantage in terms of providing gas to the market,"" said Soussa. ""The other thing is that of course Qatar has long term contracts in place that are very aggressive in tying in 20, 30 year contracts, so Its market share is relatively stable,"" he added. Whether this could change for better or worse if the Gulf state loses the right to host the 2022 World Cup, however, remains to be seen.","Corruption allegations have been made regarding Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup .

"Kolmanskop, Namibia (CNN) -- Vast and inhospitable, the Namib Desert in south west Africa is a land of ghosts. Along a notorious stretch of shoreline known as the Skeleton Coast lie the wrecks of ships stranded in the morning seafogs. Venture inland and you'll encounter even more spectral scenes: one of Africa's most famous ghost towns -- and even ""ghost horses."" Considered the world's oldest desert, the Namib has been dry for an estimated 55 million years. Stretching for hundreds of kilometers along Namibia's Atlantic coastline, its infamously hostile terrain has made Namibia one of the world's most sparsely populated countries. Yet amid this unforgiving landscape is evidence of once thriving human settlement. Kolmanskop -- Afrikaans for ""Coleman's Hill"" -- was once a diamond-mining boom town, complete with a grand ballroom, casino and skittle alley. Today it is an eerie ghost settlement, its sand-logged buildings slowly being reclaimed by the dunes. Named after Johnny Coleman, a man who abandoned his ox wagon there during a sandstorm, the area was the center of a diamond boom a century ago. In 1908, an African railway worker named Zacharias Lewala was shoveling sand from the tracks when he struck a glittering diamond. The ensuing rush brought a wave of European fortune hunters to the region, then part of a colony known as German South West Africa. With their newfound wealth, the settlers set about building a German-style village amid the dunes, complete with amenities such as a hospital with a rare X-ray machine, and a tram. Read also: The Namibian women who dress like Victorians . ""Life was hard,"" said Kolmanskop tour guide Christo Biewenga, but made tolerable by the fact ""they were organized in this town."" During its heyday in the 1920s, Kolmanskop's population consisted of about 300 European adults and 40 of their children, supported by 800 local workers. Read also: Real-life 'Lion Kings' But when new diamond deposits were discovered in less extreme conditions further south, the fortune seekers drifted away. When the hospital closed its doors in 1956, the last remaining settlers left shortly afterward. Today, as a monument to the settlement's distinctive history, Kolmanskop is a popular tourist destination, although a permit is required to enter. This is because the site sits within the Sperrgebiet -- a ""prohibited zone"" declared by German authorities on the discovery of the diamond deposits. Although South West Africa was occupied by South Africa in 1915, and Namibia emerged as an independent state in 1990, diamond mining remains a lucrative concern and the area remains a restricted region under the control of Namdeb Diamond Corporation. James Alexander is a geologist for Namdeb, a joint venture between the Namibian government and diamond mining company De Beers. He said the early miners ""took the easy ones, the ones on top."" ""They would glisten in the dunes in the light of the moon,"" he said. ""Now we have to blast them out of the ground because the ground has cement in it. So it's harder and expensive, but there's still a lot out there... There's 400 million (carats) sitting somewhere."" But Kolmanskop is not the only ghost of the Namib. Just as iconic a symbol of the area is the hardy population of 150 or so wild horses, who have adapted to be able to go without water for longer periods than domestic horses, surviving for generations on the desert's fringe. Read also: Mali's treasure at risk from uprising . Horses are not native to southern Africa, and the horses' origins have long been shrouded in mystery. According to Piet Swiegers, manager of the nearby Klein-Aus Vista lodge, the most likely theory is that they were German and South African military horses abandoned in the chaos of the First World War. ""There was a water point close by,"" he said. ""That's why the horses survived all these years."" It is also thought the restricted human access to the region helped their survival, sparing the the feral animals from being caught or hunted. For generations, the horses existed largely out of sight of locals. ""They were known as the ghost horses,"" said Swiegers. ""We hardly saw them."" But in recent decades their habitat has been reclassified as part of the Namib-Naukluft National Park, Africa's largest game reserve, bringing them into greater contact with humans. This has raised the question of if and how humans should support the horses to keep their numbers at a sustainable level. Experts have settled on a policy of limiting intervention, but providing some support, especially in times of hardship -- which has helped to bring people a little closer to these ghosts of the desert. ""The behavior of the horses changed because they got used to people,"" said Swiegers. ""They don't fear man because man feeds them in dry times.""","Today a ghost town, Namibia's Kolmanskop was once a booming diamond village .
During its peak in the 1920s, it was home to about 340 Europeans and 800 locals .

"(CNN) -- When I heard last month that the Nigerian Film and Video Censors Board, headquartered in Abuja, had indicated that it would be unable to issue certification for ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" in time for the film's release date, I naturally assumed, at first, that what we were faced with was nothing more sinister than another instance of the typical, if frustrating, culture of wilful incompetence that we'd grappled with during the making of the film -- while shooting the film in Nigeria two years ago, there were times when we felt ensnared in impenetrable jungles of red tape, when we would be given the go-head by one arm of the government only to find our path blocked by the other arm. I had no reason to assume that there might be anything more to it than that. I had no reason to assume, for instance, that the inability of the board to issue the film with a certificate might actually be a clumsy, heavy-handed ban in all but name. After all, when the movie had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last autumn, amongst the entourage of Nigerians who flew in to Toronto for the occasion was Patricia Bala, director-general of the Nigerian censorship board. Bala had arrived in Toronto -- I was told -- with several of her colleagues from the censor's office. I know for a fact that they watched the movie. I do not know for a fact that they all liked it. I cannot say if any one of them stood up when, as the end credits rolled, the audience rose and gave the film three standing ovations. But I do know that Bala was gracious enough to tell us after the screening how much she loved the movie. At no point did she express any reservations about the contents of the film. It is now nearly eight months since Bala and her board first saw the movie in Toronto and a few weeks since she and her board have failed to issue ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" the certification that it needs -- that the law requires it obtains before it can be shown in cinemas in Nigeria. In those several days I've been assailed -- on Twitter, Facebook, and by email -- with rumors, innuendos, half-truths, and downright lies, disseminated sometimes directly from the censorship board (they have issued at least one press statement), about why ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" still hasn't been issued with a ratings certificate. The board claims that is has not banned the film but certain aspects of it ""have some unresolved issues which have to be sorted out in accordance with the law and laid down regulations."" It has been rumored that FilmOne, the Nigerian distributors of ""Half of a Yellow Sun,"" might have been late in submitting the film for certification. Not true. Most films that are screened in Nigerian cinemas are shown to the censor only a day or two before the films open to the paying public. In documentations that have been shown to me, there are instances even of movies being shown to the censor days after the movies had officially opened to the public. ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" was scheduled to open on April 25. It was submitted to the censorship board at least two weeks earlier. I've also heard tell that the censorship board's inability to make a decision about a ratings certificate for my film has been brought upon it because of a sudden concern that a movie that depicts scenes from the Biafra war might provoke ""tribal violence"" in a country that has in recent months been besieged with terrorist bombings and profoundly shaken by the abduction of over 200 school girls by Boko Haram. Biyi Bandele: Making movies to tell Africa's real stories . Since the Toronto premiere those many months ago, I've seen ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" at other film festivals in all corners of the globe. And Nigerians being the ubiquitous people that we are have been present in the audiences -- quite often in great numbers -- at each of these festivals. I am yet to meet a single Nigerian who has seen the film who came out of the cinema thinking that they had just seen a film that would incite anyone to violence. If anything, more than once, I've been accosted by cinema-goers -- some Nigerian, but really, people of all races -- who have been profoundly moved by the experience of watching the film. The refrain I've heard from them is, war is nasty, isn't it. Whether or not the film eventually gets a ratings certificate in Nigeria, ""Half of a Yellow Sun"" will be seen by millions of Nigerians. The question is: will they be allowed to see it in their local cinemas and on legally acquired DVDs or will they be forced to watch it on pirate DVDs and through illegal downloads? If the biggest film that's ever been made in Nigeria is available to Nigerians only in bootleg form, the censorship board will be doing to the Nigerian film industry what Boko Haram is trying to do to Nigeria: drive a stake through its heart. I sincerely hope they both fail. READ THIS: Thandie Newton, typhoid and a tale of civil war . READ THIS: Making movies to tell Africa's real stories .

"Gaza City (CNN) -- It's the hardest question in Gaza. In the twilight hours of Saturday, when the people of Gaza were breaking the daily Ramadan fast, fireballs illuminated the night sky. The Israeli military was intensifying its assault on Gaza militants in the Shaja'ia neighborhood near Gaza City. The battle had only just begun. As dawn broke Sunday, some barefoot, many looking dazed and haggard flooded from their smoldering neighborhood. Thousands walked along sidewalks, packed into cars, and piled onto donkey carts with only what they could carry: Some clothing, a bit of food. Most just had clothes on their backs. When CNN put this question to one Shaja'ia resident, with his family in tow, he broke into tears. ""Where are you going? I just don't know,"" he replied. Nearby explosions prodded the family forward into the unknown. A barrage of rockets . Gaza militants respond with a barrage of rockets. Another fleeing family waited for a car to ferry them to safety, but one member was missing. ""My mother refused to leave,"" said Sameh Grega. ""She told me to leave her to die, but I will try to go back."" A temporary cease-fire later gave a CNN crew a glimpse of the inferno being fled. For many of those able to make it out, their destination will be the United Nations schools that have been turned into centers for those displaced. By Sunday afternoon, at least 81,000 people had arrived at 61 U.N. schools, and the number was likely to rise. It's the largest number of internally displaced Gazans since Israel pulled out of the coastal strip in 2005. A human surge found its way to the UN-run Rimal Girls School. The classrooms overflowed with civilians moving quickly without direction around the compound. The schoolyard is also a place for the latest news from home. One man found out his brother had been killed. No information yet about other members of his family. When word came that the shelter was full, rumors of a nearby school with space sent a stampede of families off again into the unknown. More than 60 killed . For hundreds of Shaja'ia's residents, safety never came. The lucky ones received a ride to a hospital. The Ministry of Health put the neighborhood wounded at more than 400. More than 60 were killed. ""There are more women and children this time around and the doctors are shocked and depressed,"" said Samantah Maurin with international aid group Doctors Without Borders. Maurin pointed to the lack of medical supplies which she describes as ""chronic and becoming more acute."" Officials at the hospital braced for an influx of injuries they know will come from Shaja'ia. ""Many people are underground,"" said Dr. Nassar El Tatar, general manager of Shifa Hospital. ""We could not reach those people to extract them and there are surely dead people and wounded people and others will die if we can't get to them."" To retrieve those stuck in Shaja'ia, the International Committee of the Red Cross called for a ceasefire. For a moment the guns fall silent over Shaja'ia. Pleas for help . Entering the densely populated neighborhood of roughly 100,000 residents, a CNN crew found a woman pleading for help. ""My son is in the house,"" said Amira Hillis. ""He's wounded. I called the Red Cross, I called for an ambulance but no one came. Can you help?"" On one street, a twisted pile of metal lay on the side of the road. Only the burned frame of a steering wheel revealed that it was any type of vehicle at all. In front of it was another ambulance -- its windows blasted out and its back door ajar. Bandages spilled into the rubble-strewn street. Debris was everywhere. Every window was shattered. Glass, pavement, and leaves mixed with gasoline. Snapped power and telephone lines hung from crooked poles. The smell of death mingled with the fumes of fuel. Paramedics rushed one motionless body away on a stretcher. A steady stream of ambulances rushed in and out of the shattered neighborhood, sirens wailing. A sense of urgency . A sense of urgency gripped the remaining fleeing residents who refused to stop long enough to talk. They were on edge, alert for the presence of any nearby Israeli soldiers. A local journalist whispered, ""Don't stay long. It's not safe here."" He saw two men armed with AK-47 assault rifles slink away with purpose. The four-hour truce was shaky at best and at one point, it was said to have collapsed. It ultimately was extended until 5:30 p.m. Bassam, a young father holding his 1-year-old daughter, Hala, said he was going to take his family to a nearby U.N. school. But a man interrupted. ""It's full, It's full,"" he shouted. Bassam, like many others, then had to ask himself Gaza's toughest question, where would he go? Netanyahu: Israel seeks 'sustainable quiet' with Gaza .

"(CNN) -- A Canadian woman who said actor Alec Baldwin promised her ""omelets every morning"" for the rest of her life after a sexual encounter was found guilty Thursday of stalking and harassing the ""30 Rock"" star. A judge sentenced Genevieve Sabourin, 41, to 210 days in jail for the five counts, as well as for violating a protection order and for a contempt of court ruling issued after her repeated outbursts in court. The three-day trial in a New York City court included tearful testimony from Baldwin, who denied he had a romantic relationship with Sabourin as she claimed. The judge also issued a protection order prohibiting the stalker from contacting Baldwin and his wife, Hilaria Baldwin, in any way for five years. ""Now that it's finally over, we feel safe, relieved and happy to move forward,"" Halaria Baldwin said in a statement after the verdict. ""We're grateful to assistant district attorney Zachary Stendig, the judge and everyone who supported us and helped provide us with peace of mind."" Sabourin is a Canadian actress who met Baldwin in 2002 during a movie production, according to testimony. He was married to actress Kim Basinger at the time, so Sabourin didn't call the number he slipped to her, she testified. Promises of endless breakfasts, woman says . But nearly a decade later, Baldwin took her to a Broadway play and dinner in Manhattan, she testified. The date ended the next morning, after they had sex in her hotel room and he made romantic promises, Sabourin testified. ""I make the best omelets in the world, and I'd be happy to make you omelets every morning for the rest of your life,"" she quoted the actor as saying. But Baldwin testified they were never a romantic couple and she only imagined their relationship. ""You're lying!"" Sabourin shouted at the actor in the courtroom. Her repeated interruptions during testimony eventually drew a contempt of court ruling, which added 30 days to her sentence. Sabourin was arrested by New York Police after an April 8, 2012, attempt to visit the actor at his Manhattan apartment building. Hilaria Baldwin, who was then engaged to him, told the doorman that Sabourin was a stalker and that she would call police, the building doorman testified. Sabourin called Hilaria a prostitute and another derogatory term before leaving the building, the doorman said. Seeking 'closure,' not stalking, she says . Sabourin cried at one point in her testimony, complaining how everyone finds their love, as companions, but that she now knows she made the wrong choice with Baldwin. The incidents of stalking were attempts at finding ""closure,"" she said. She sent him numerous e-mails and voicemails along the way. CNN obtained copies of the e-mails. ""I am less than 10 minutes away from you tonight. Say 'I do' to me,"" one e-mail says. In another e-mail, she said she was ready to get married. ""I need to start my new life with my new name ... in my new country, help my newly husband, you!"" In another e-mail, she admits defeat. ""I may have lost all the battles to win your heart over in the past two years, but I've learn (sic) so much,"" it says. Wiping away tears as he testified, Baldwin said Sabourin's stalking made him anxious and worried for his safety. She showed up unannounced at his New York home on the day he proposed to his now-wife, the actor said. Days later, she allegedly crashed an event the actor was hosting at New York City`s Lincoln Center. Baldwin has admitted they had dinner once in 2010, but said that was it. They met through a mutual friend, he said. Both Baldwin and Sabourin worked on the 2002 flop ""The Adventures of Pluto Nash."" Baldwin has also appeared in numerous other movies, including ""It's Complicated,"" ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" and ""Along Came Polly."" His past is checkered with various conflicts, including an infamous berating of his then-young daughter Ireland in 2007 as a ""rude, thoughtless little pig,"" a run in with American Airlines over his playing Words with Friends on a flight, and various scuffles with paparazzi. Unlike the actor, who didn't say a word about the case to reporters, Sabourin basked in the media spotlight. She grinned widely as she shared her side of the story with a group of reporters. ""I'm not gonna take a reduced plea for a crime I have not committed,"" she said before the verdict and sentencing. Sabourin has been arrested several times, including late last year for violating a court order by allegedly sending a series of tweets to Baldwin and his wife. Lawyer: She told the truth . Her lawyer, Todd Spodek, called her ""a wonderful human being"" when speaking to reporters after the trial. Sabourin never intended to ""harass, annoy, alarm, stalk, violate an order of protection,"" Spodek said. ""Her intent was clear, that she wanted closure from this relationship,"" Spodek said. ""And, unfortunately, the judge didn't follow my logic, but I stand by it, and I believe that was the case."" He said she ""absolutely"" told the truth when she testified that she was romantic with Baldwin and had sex during a 2011 date. ""I think she testified truthfully, candidly, and I think the judge believed her,"" Spodak said. ""It's just that even if they did have a relationship, it doesn't mean it's a defense to the crime."" After she is released from jail -- which her lawyer estimates will be in about five months -- Sabourin plans to return to Canada ""and pursue acting, and you know, the film industry and the entertainment industry there, the lawyer said. CNN's Jane Caffrey, Nichelle Turner and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Now that it's finally over, we feel safe, relieved and happy,"" Hilaria Baldwin says .

"Kinshasa, DRC (CNN) -- Kinshasa hasn't had an easy time of it. A decade ago, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo was a broken city, ravaged by years of war and infighting. Of late, however, Kinshasa has witnessed a resurgence, with many expatriated Congolese returning to build a new city. ""When I came back, people thought I was crazy. ""[They would ask], 'why would you go into a country where there is war? Where nothing is working? Why not stay in the States and make your life?'"" says Joss Ilunga Dijimba, who returned to Kinshasa in 1996 after studying in America. Today, Dijimba runs his own eponymous business, manufacturing plastic bottles for the pharmaceutical industry. ""In the USA, everything has been done -- everything. In Congo, there is still a way to make things right. I am a Congolese. If I'm not going to make it, who's going to?"" In agreement is Olivier Ndombasi, who always planned on building his fortune in his homeland. Like his elder brothers, he studied abroad in the hope of bringing back knowledge that could improve the family business: groceries. His father's small store has now turned into a supermarket franchise called Peloustore, with four locations and more on the way. ""It's very exciting to be able to do things in a new environment, and do things you didn't think you'd be able to do,"" says Ndombasi. ""The challenge is great, but it's very exciting."" Many agree that there are obstacles, but returnees often cite the exhilaration of starting with a clean slate. ""Come to Kinshasa, you unlearn what you thought you knew. You take your MBA book, your business plan, put it in your pocket and start from scratch,"" says Alain Yav, who 12 years ago founded Pygma Group, a holding company that has interests in communication and construction. Pygma also produces one of the country's most popular television shows: Beauty Queen. Though the journey has been long, and there are still large portions of the country's population living below the poverty line (70.5% in 2011, according African Economic Outlook), Yav says Kinshasa is starting to reap economic benefits. ""When you are working really hard, at some time, you stop believing. But I think we are lucky, because we are seeing it's progressing. Not just us, not just our company, not just our industry, but we are seeing things move forward in every direction,"" he says. To prove the point, Kinshasa also seems to be experiencing a construction boom. Buildings are going up at a ferocious rate. One of the largest -- and most controversial -- projects is La Cite du Fleuve (River City), a floating-island complex that is expected to include thousands of flats, hotels and shopping centers. ""Everywhere [you look], you can see new buildings and lots of construction,"" says Didier M'Pambia, who set up Optimum, one of the larger PR firms in the city. M'Pambia also publishes Optimum Magazine, a glossy pan-African business quarterly aimed at giving the Congolese diaspora information about their home country. ""It's not a Congolese magazine; it's a magazine at the same level of other magazines produced in the United States, Europe or South Africa,"" says M'Pambia. ""We don't have to be ashamed that we are in Africa. You have to be proud to be Africa and to show your personality. As Congolese, we have to be the first people involved in our development,"" he says.","Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic of Congo, is experiencing a construction boom .

"(CNN) -- Let the flapless among us take heart. ""Flappy Bird,"" the now defunct mobile sensation, will one day rise like a phoenix and fling itself awkwardly into an app store near you. Dong Nguyen, the creator of the infuriatingly addictive and deceptively difficult mobile game confirmed as much early Wednesday on Twitter. Responding to a tweet Dong sent last month, a follower directly asked if he plans to ever make the game available again. ""Yes,"" Nguyen replied. ""But not soon."" That's an about-face from last month, when Nguyen, in a rare interview, told Forbes that ""Flappy Bird"" was ""gone forever."" Originally released last May, ""Flappy Bird"" had largely languished before a surge in popularity, starting around December, that would see it become the most downloaded app in both Apple's App Store and the Google Play store for Android devices. At the time of its demise, ""Flappy Bird"" had an average four-star rating from more than 543,000 reviews in the Apple App Store and 228,000 on Android. Many of the reviews were lengthy, tongue-in-cheek tales of time lost, marriages ended and people going cuckoo after playing the game. At the time, Nguyen said he was afraid that what he'd intended to be a simple pastime had gotten out of control and become ""addictive"" to some users. The Vietnamese developer, who has stayed largely out of the spotlight, had also come under intense scrutiny, with some accusing him (without evidence, it should be noted) of using bots to artificially inflate the game's app-store rankings. People who had already downloaded the app didn't lose it, but those who hadn't were out of luck. And so, we wait. In the mean time, Dot Gears, Nguyen's studio, has two other games available for download -- ""Shuriken Block"" and ""Super Ball Juggling."" And he promises more to come -- probably before we see ""Flappy Bird"" again. Or you could just busy yourself with one of the multitude of ""Flappy Bird"" clones, which continue to flood app stores at insane rates.","'Flappy Bird' creator say game will come back to app stores .

"(CNN) -- The death of a Google executive on a yacht is raising new questions about the death of a nightclub owner on the other side of the country -- because of the possible role an alleged prostitute played in each case. Alix Catherine Tichelman, 26, appeared in court Wednesday in Santa Cruz, California, where she faces a series of charges in the death of Forrest Timothy Hayes, 51. The married father of five was found dead in November on his 50-foot yacht. Authorities say Tichelman gave him an injection of heroin and then, as he began to die, she sipped her wine, gathered her belongings, and walked away. She has not entered a plea. Two months before Hayes died, Dean Riopelle, whom Tichelman identified online as her boyfriend, died at his home in Milton, Georgia. Tichelman was there at the time, and she called 911. ""Her story was: She was in the shower, heard a large crash, and then found him unconscious on the floor,"" Capt. Shawn McCarty of Milton police told CNN Thursday. ""I think my boyfriend overdosed or something, he, like, he won't respond,"" she said in the brief call, shortly before hanging up. The dispatcher called Tichelman back. Asked why she thought it was an overdose, Tichelman responded, ""Because there's nothing else it could be."" Asked whether it was accidental or intentional, she replied, ""definitely accidental."" He was taking painkillers and ""drinking a lot too,"" she said. The call cut off. The dispatcher tried at least twice more, but the phone rang and went to voicemail. The medical examiner ruled Riopelle's death an accidental overdose from heroin and alcohol. ""At the time, we never thought anything different,"" McCarty said. Riopelle owned the Masquerade Nightclub in Atlanta and played in a local band. A former band mate doubts Riopelle overdosed. ""There is no way that guy did heroin, no freaking way,"" Allen Vine told CNN affiliate KRON. Vine said he met Tichelman shortly after Riopelle started dating her. ""He was in no shape or form, any kind of user for heroin or drugs or anything,"" Vine said. ""He was health conscious."" Now authorities are taking a new look at that death ""to make sure there's nothing (else) to it,"" McCarty said. Tichelman also was arrested last year in Atlanta and charged with battery and false report of a crime. The details of that incident were unclear. Death of Google Glass executive . Hayes, 51, had an ""ongoing prostitution relationship"" with Tichelman, authorities say. Online, Tichelman has boasted of having more than 200 client relationships. Security footage from Hayes' yacht shows her administer the injection and what happened afterward, as he was dying, police say. ""Rather than provide first aid or call 911, Ms. Tichelman proceeds to gather her belongings including the heroin and needles,"" the police statement reads, adding that Tichelman stepped over Hayes' body several times. The video also shows Tichelman leaving the boat and then reaching back to lower a blind, concealing the victim's body from outside view, police say. How heroin kills you . At court Wednesday in Santa Cruz, she was charged with manslaughter, administering heroin to another person, administering bodily harm, moving heroin across county lines, possession of heroin, destroying or concealing evidence, and prostitution. A public defender asked that her arraignment be postponed until July 16. Police came across Tichelman in the course of investigating the death of Hayes, a Google executive who, reports say, worked on the Google Glass project, among others. Authorities became concerned that she planned to leave the state, so detectives posing as a potential client lured her to an ""upscale location"" for a July 4 session costing $1,000. She was arrested when she arrived. Google did not return messages seeking comment. Apple, where reports say Hayes previously worked, declined comment. ""I was really devastated when I heard about it,"" Todd Zion, who worked at Google for a short time under Hayes, told The San Francisco Chronicle. ""He was a great boss. I never had a chance to thank him."" 'Nice to talk with someone about killing sprees' Tichelman describes herself as a model, makeup artist and writer on what appears to be her Facebook page. It says she formerly worked at Larry Flynt's Hustler Club and studied journalism at Georgia State University in Atlanta. ""It's really nice to talk with someone about killing sprees and murdering people in cold blood...and they love it too,"" a June 28 post on the page reads. ""No judgement (sic). Yay! F**k all of that positivity bullsh**. Take a look around you. Life is hard and then you die."" The profile includes numerous modeling shots of Tichelman, some of them in provocative poses.

"Beijing (CNN) -- Hold the shark's fin soup. Cancel the elaborate pre-Chinese New Year parties. Those are some of the new directives from Beijing now being relayed to government officials across China. ""We used to get together for a big banquet before the New Year holidays,"" a local official told me last week. ""No more. Even in obligatory official banquets, we are also banned from serving dishes like sharks fin, bird's nest and all that stuff."" And who is telling you that, I inquired. ""The Number One,"" he replied, nodding his head. In the past four decades that I've lived and worked in China, dining has always been a big part of my social and professional activities. In China, like anywhere, one of the best ways to know people and conduct business is to share a meal. I have enjoyed sharing luscious -- and not necessarily expensive -- meals with Chinese friends and associates. I particularly love dumplings, Peking duck and spicy Sichuanese food. I have also eaten and drunk my way through many of the government's traditional 12-course banquets, which sometimes left me dyspeptic and dizzy. In that sense, at least, it's good news that Beijing is slashing the bureaucrat's entertainment budget and scaling back on ostentatious banquet binges. It's about time. But not all in China are pleased. Many restaurants, shops, spas and recreation centers that have largely banked on government-sponsored spending sprees -- especially during holidays -- are hurting badly. ""Our business is down this year,"" Tony Chang, a Beijing restauranteur, told me. ""Many of our usual customers from government agencies have canceled their Chinese New Year banquets. We're down by nearly half."" Wang Lisheng, an employee at a ""recreation village"" in suburban Beijing, recalled receiving over 30 groups of customers from state-owned enterprises in January last year. As of last month they have only had a few individual customers. ""What has been affected is not just the food business,"" wrote the Southern Weekly newspaper in a commentary entitled ""The Disappearing Evening Banquet."" ""The banquet has created a complete chain, and all the other related industries will be affected if the banquet shrinks."" But some do not think the changes will be lasting. ""This is what officials usually do after they take up office,"" wrote a micro-blogger on Weibo, China's micro-blogging site. ""The society will relapse in three years, and then those officials will be even more greedy and corrupt to compensate for what they lost. Famished wolves will never become vegetarians."" This, analysts say, may be just a ""new guard, new policy"" scenario. ""Xin guan shang ren san ba huo,"" a new broom sweeps clean, so says the the Chinese saying. Since Xi Jinping, 59, took over as the paramount leader of China in November, he has rolled out a raft of decrees aimed at changing the leaders' ""working style."" ""Compared with their predecessors, the new leaders seem to show more sophistication, confidence and ambition,"" said Wenfang Tang, a political science professor at the University of Iowa. ""They want to give unscripted speeches and hold shorter meetings. They call for the realization of 'the Chinese dream' or China's renaissance."" Xi has pledged to curb ostentatious displays among officials. Last week he ordered a ban on television advertisements selling bling. He has also banned the unnecessary use of red carpets and banners during meetings. He has even threatened to scrap sacrosanct perks, like the road-clogging motorcades and traffic controls arranged for leaders. ""Such a working style must first start with the members of the Politburo,"" read a statement of the Politburo, the Communist Party's top policy-making body, issued just two weeks after Xi's ascension. ""If you want people to do something, then do it yourself first; if you don't want somebody to do something, then certainly do not do it yourself."" Analysts say the statement reflected Xi's desire to win back trust in the government. The recent cost-cutting reforms, analysts say, are meant to remind officials to stick to business and cut back on the perks. ""Xi's directive to officials to improve their work style and decrease their pomp and privileges is a challenge to the system, resonating with public anger and giving voice to public frustration,"" said China analyst and author Robert Lawrence Kuhn. The list of public grievances is long, including rampant graft and corruption, environmental degradation and the growing gap between the rich and the poor. China this week approved sweeping income distribution reforms to make state-owned enterprises and the rich pay more in taxes. The government pledged to double the average real income of urban and rural residents by 2020 from the 2010 level. Many Chinese cities are poised to increase workers' minimum wage -- in southern Guangdong province, as much as 14% starting in May -- to put more disposable income into the hands of more Chinese. The goal: to boost domestic consumption and narrow the gap between the rich and the poor. Will Xi's gambit work, and will it last? It's too early to say. Still, analysts give Xi credit for trying. ""For Xi to do so much so quickly to differentiate the new generation of leaders from the previous one is quite startling, unprecedented in a one-party political system that claims no-surprise, long-term continuity as a virtue,"" explained Kuhn. He says Xi has no choice but to back change. ""Reform is change, and change is risk,"" he explained. ""But in China now, perhaps for the first time, the risk of not reforming is higher than the risk of reforming. Xi Jinping knows this."" Wang Bo contributed to this report.","New leader Xi Jinping rolls out decrees aimed at changing officials' working style .

"(CNN) -- The flashing of flesh in several Gulf states may just have got a little harder after efforts were launched to ban bikinis and get visitors to cover up. In Qatar, a campaign using posters and social media is encouraging expats to wear modest clothing in public, while in Kuwait, lawmakers have reportedly called for some swimwear to be outlawed. Brochures distributed by the ""Reflect Your Respect"" campaign tell expats: ""If you're in Qatar you're one of us. Help us preserve Qatar's culture and values, please dress modestly in public places by covering from shoulders to knees."" Posters identify as inappropriate sleeveless dresses, exposed midriffs, tank tops on men and women and skirts or shorts above the knee. Women are notified that ""leggings are not pants."" The campaign has taken to Twitter and Instagram to drive home its message and also reportedly intends to dispatch female volunteers to hand out leaflets in public. The campaign's organizers were not immediately available for comment. Breach of morality . Clothing advice is nothing new in Qatar. Its tourism authority advises on its website that ""men and women should dress modestly as a courtesy to both Qataris and Muslims... Tops should cover the shoulders and upper arms, and skirts or shorts should fall to or below the knee."" The new campaign points out that anyone residing or visiting the country is subjected to Qatari laws that are widely considered to prohibit immodest attire as a breach of morality. Most Qataris dress conservatively according to Islamic custom. Women wear flowing black robes called abayas while men wear white robes called thawbs. However, Qataris account for a small proportion of the population -- approximately 85% of the country's two million residents are expats. Attempts to implement a strict dress code could impact on visitors as Qatar gears up to host the 2022 World Cup. Reaction on social media was mixed. ""Appreciate the dress code campaign by @reflect_respect as being done respectfully and tastefully and for both genders,"" said a tweet by Fadi El Hage . ""Respect is through actions not what you wear,"" tweeted Sindhu Nair. Bathers targeted . Motte Christian's reaction was more tongue-in-cheek, tweeting ""I'm looking forward to see footballer wearing pants during football world cup 2022."" All the Gulf countries, which are socially conservative and have large expatriate populations, advise foreigners to dress modestly although it is rarely enshrined in law. Saudi Arabia is the only Arab country that requires women to wear abayas and cover their hair in public. Last year the United Arab Emirates witnessed a similar social media campaign to encourage visitors to dress modestly. Meanwhile, in Kuwait, officials are reportedly seeking to target bathers. A committee dealing with ""tackling bad social behavior"" has approved a proposal to ban ""nudity"" of women at all swimming pools, public places and in hotels, according to the English-language Kuwait Times. Hamdan Al-Azemi, an Islamist lawmaker who heads the committee, did not specify what was meant by ""nudity"" but the newspaper reports that the term includes wearing bikinis and ""revealing or improper dress."" The proposal needs to be approved by parliament and ratified by the Kuwaiti government before being enshrined into law. Are these shorts too short?

"Slaviansk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Do a series of photos of gun-toting men wearing green uniforms prove Russian forces are operating in eastern Ukraine? Ukrainian officials point to the pictures in a dossier obtained Monday by CNN, arguing that the images show Russian ""sabotage-reconnaissance groups"" acting in Ukrainian towns. The images, Ukrainian officials say, prove organized Russian activity in the region. CNN cannot independently confirm the photographs, some of which were first published in The New York Times. The dossier shows what Ukrainian officials say are images of well-equipped gunmen in eastern Ukraine who look similar to photographs of Russian forces taken in Crimea, Russia and during Russia's 2008 invasion of Georgia. Last week, Ukrainian security officials told CNN they had arrested a Russian military officer and a woman Ukrainian officials said is a Russian intelligence agent. Moscow has disavowed involvement in the takeover of government buildings in eastern Ukraine or other acts by often-masked pro-Russian gunmen. But the photos, accepted as genuine by the Obama administration, appeared to lend credence to allegations by Ukrainian officials that Russian forces have been dispatched in eastern Ukraine to provoke a military confrontation. If genuine, the photos also back up Western leaders who have claimed Russia's involvement. Last week, NATO commander Gen. Philip Breedlove wrote on the alliance's blog that what pro-Russian groups have described as an organic uprising is in reality a ""well-planned and organized"" military operation orchestrated by Moscow. ""There has been broad unity in the international community about the connection between Russia and some of the armed militants in eastern Ukraine, and the photos presented by the Ukrainians last week only further confirm this, which is why U.S. officials have continued to make that case,"" State Department spokesman Jen Psaki told CNN on Monday. The question of whether Russia is involved in the unrest roiling eastern Ukraine is crucial as European observers try to enforce an agreement reached last week to lower tensions in the region by organizing the withdrawal of forces from government buildings and other facilities. Officials who brokered the deal in Geneva said they hoped it would ease tensions. But there were some signs Monday that tensions are mounting. Residents told CNN that armed militants seized the police station in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, late Monday. The police station had been stormed on April 12 before being handed back to local officials two days later. Amateur video from the scene shows masked, armed men escorting the local police chief to a car after seizing the building. The video, in addition to the photos released by Ukrainian officials, seemed to show that at least some forces in Ukraine show no sign of backing down. Ukraine provided the photos to those observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, according to the briefing dossier obtained by CNN's Elise Labott. One image shows a gunman with a long beard during an assault on a police station in Kramatorsk who appears similar to a Russian special forces member photographed during the Russian invasion of Georgia. Another shows gunmen photographed occupying administrative buildings in Slaviansk who appear similar to men pictured in what Ukrainian officials described as a ""family photo"" of a Russian sabotage and reconnaissance unit. Natacha Rajakovic, deputy spokeswoman for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, declined to comment on the images and referred questions to Ukrainian authorities. Ukrainians maintain that Russian involvement in the east is widespread. CNN has heard Russian accents among the ""men in green,"" as they are known, well armed and uniformed groups who have appeared in towns like Slaviansk and Kramatorsk. One told CNN he had come up from Crimea. But CNN has not seen any evidence that these men are operating under orders from the Kremlin. Russia's Foreign Minister scoffed at the accusations, saying that Kiev and its patrons, the United States and the European Union, are trying to blame his country for everything. Slaviansk's self-declared mayor, a former military man himself, says the explanation is simple: He put out an appeal to his old comrades. ""When I called on my friends, practically all of whom are ex military, they came to our rescue, not only from Russia but also from Belarus, Kazakhstan and Moldova,"" he said. But on Monday, he insisted there are no active duty Russian soldiers in his town. Diplomatic efforts . The government of acting Ukrainian President Oleksandr Turchynov has talked tough but done little to curb pro-Russian activities in the east, possibly afraid that a crackdown could send Russian forces across the border. The occupation of buildings continued in about a dozen towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. International monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe met Monday with pro-Russian leaders in Slaviansk, but no breakthroughs were reported. The monitors were called for in the agreement among Russia, the United States and the European Union last week that was meant to reduce tensions in the region, which while part of Ukraine has long looked toward Russia for cultural and economic ties. In three towns, pro-Russian protesters and militants have made it clear to CNN they have no intention of moving until the ""illegal"" government in Kiev also moves out of official buildings. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov echoed those sentiments Monday, saying that Ukrainian officials were not implementing the agreement negotiated in Geneva, Switzerland. ""On the contrary, not a single step has been taken by those who have seized power in Kiev to eliminate the reasons of this deep crisis inside Ukraine,"" he said. Russia has said before that it holds no sway over pro-Russian protesters and militants. Geoffrey Pyatt, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, told CNN's Candy Crowley on Sunday that he has seen progress. He had just met with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Deshchytsia and the ambassador who heads the OSCE's special monitoring mission, along with his European Union and Russian counterparts. ""I think we all reaffirmed today in this setting our collective commitment to trying to make the Geneva framework a success,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""There are obviously some real challenges at this point,"" including the violence in Slaviansk. ""But we also believe that there has been some progress. I'm seeing reports this morning that at least one of these (occupied) government buildings now has a Ukrainian flag flying over it,"" he said. ""And the OSCE has monitors on the ground who are reaching out, engaging with local political elites, seeing if there's a way to de-escalate the crisis."" There is ""no military solution"" to the crisis, Pyatt said. ""It has to be solved through diplomacy."" Biden visits Kiev . Meanwhile, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden arrived Monday in Kiev to discuss the situation in eastern Ukraine and deliver a new aid package aimed at shoring up the Ukrainian government. The bundle includes new economic and energy aid as well as governance assistance, a senior administration official told reporters in a background briefing Monday. It's likely to sit well with Ukrainian leaders struggling to keep their country going amid widespread financial problems and a growing showdown with Russia over that country's annexation of Crimea and troubles in Ukraine's pro-Russian east. On the streets of Kiev, ordinary citizens said they know there's only so much the United States can do. Some said they'd like to see the U.S. send troops. ""Our army is very bad. Maybe the U.S. can give us some military help,"" one Ukrainian said. But others say that's too much, even with pro-Russian forces occupying government buildings in the east and thousands of Russian troops massed along the Ukrainian border. ""I think we want consultations, but no American troops,"" another Ukrainian citizen told CNN. U.S. officials have ruled out the possibility of deploying U.S. forces to Ukraine. But some U.S. lawmakers have argued that the United States should send weapons. That wouldn't help the situation and might make it worse, U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Monday. It won't take sending weapons, Rhodes said, to send a message to Russia. ""We've signaled how we can escalate our sanctions,"" he said. ""In the long run, if Russia runs this play, they're going to lose a lot."" Speaking to CNN from Kiev on Monday, Rep. Ed Royce said the United States needs to do more to reduce Ukraine's reliance on natural gas and oil from Russia by exporting fuel there from the United States. ""What has put Putin in the driver's seat over here is the fact that he controls oil and gas. He's got a monopoly on it,"" the California Republican said. ""And that would be something we could upset."" Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said last week that the United States, however, will continue its beefed-up presence in Poland because of the crisis. Among fellow members of NATO, Poland has expressed particular concern about Russian plans in Ukraine. The Defense Department is also sending some nonlethal aid to Ukrainian security forces, including medical supplies, helmets, shelters and water purification equipment. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Tim Lister, Elena Sandyrev, Phil Black, Alla Eshchenko, Elaine Ly and Lena Kashkarova contributed to this report.","NEW: Residents say armed militants seized the police station in Kramatorsk, Ukraine .

"(CNN) -- Prince George isn't your average one year old. He started walking before he was one. Oh, and, he's going to be king -- of 16 countries. I had to remind myself occasionally of that latter fact as I stood outside the hospital in London where he was born... for a week before his arrival. It went against my journalistic instinct to report on a story that hadn't happened yet but if I didn't appear regularly on air, giving an update about what hadn't happened, then the assumption was that it had and rumors would start which I would have to come back on air to refute. If you can't beat them, join them. When ""the royal baby"" did emerge, there was a collective sense of relief and excitement among the assembled media. He was already one of the biggest stars in the world and we didn't even know his name. Before we knew it he was whisked away, with his father in the driving seat, to Kensington Palace. Soon he was in the Middleton family home in Berkshire, southern England, where Kate had spent much of her pregnancy. It's safe, private, protected. The Cambridges wanted to keep George's world small and intimate in those early days so that mother, father and baby could bond. To satisfy intense media interest, they released an official photo. It wasn't taken by a professional outsider who would burst the bubble -- rather it was a family snap taken by George's grandfather, Michael Middleton. I met William during that first fortnight and he was exhausted and elated, the hallmarks of a hands-on dad. The duke always tries to do things himself if he can. He doesn't like fuss. It may have gone against royal tradition but it wasn't intentional. We didn't see George again for another three months when he appeared bright eyed and wriggling in his father's arms for his christening at St. James Palace. It was all about the cheeks. After the service, he had his first professional photo shoot with celebrity photographer Jason Bell. ""He didn't start screaming,"" Bell recalls. ""You know, he giggled away and put his arms up ... I was astonished, that having done the pictures, the level of interest here. ""I had a really weird moment where, straight after shooting the christening pictures, I was doing a job in Colorado and I changed planes in Denver. And I walked through the airport, and it was like that 'Being John Malkovich' poster where everyone in the airport was reading 'People' magazine and this picture on the cover, and this picture was like staring at me everywhere. It was just really strange moment, when you're like 'Wow this picture is like everywhere.'"" When George was eight months old, Bell was brought back in and took another picture of the family ahead of their tour in April to New Zealand and Australia. He chose a shot of them sitting at a window in Kensington Palace. ""I went back and he was a little boy now, not a baby,"" says bell. ""He was crawling around, and you know, they grow up so quick!"" George was growing fast. In New Zealand a special playdate was convened for George with local youngsters of the same age. His size became apparent as he towered over all but one of his Kiwi counterparts. In a distinctly un-regal moment he grabbed a toy block from another baby who cried. Her parents are still hoping that they will stay in touch. The young prince appeared again in Sydney during a trip to the zoo. George was pulling himself up on the sides of a bilby enclosure and started walking shortly after he got back to the UK. The latest set of pictures, released to mark his birthday this week, show George on a day out at the Natural History Museum in London. It could be any toddler's day out. And it's this normality that's the running theme throughout his first year in pictures. He's not normal. His parents know that but they're protecting him for as long as they can.","Prince George was born on July 22 2013 amid intense media attention .

"(InStyle) -- Life is full of reasons to smile, but expressing joy can cause lines to form around your eyes and mouth. Luckily, you don't have to grin and bear it. Read on for tips to keep creases at bay and make skin look smoother and younger . Naomi Watts confidently flashes her radiant smile. Why wrinkles form . 1. Decreased volume . Over time, skin loses fat and produces less hyaluronic acid, a substance that retains moisture. As a result, mature skin is thinner and drier than young skin. ""Like a helium balloon the day after a party,"" says Beverly Hills dermatologist Mark Rubin, ""when skin is not filled to the same degree, you'll see crinkling on the surface."" Minimize the effects . Apply moisturizer to temporarily rehydrate (and plump up) the skin. For more help, try filler injections. 2. Loss of elasticity . As skin ages, the collagen and elastin fibers in the dermis break down, reducing skin's ability to ""snap back"" from smiles and other facial expressions. Exposure to sunlight accelerates this process, especially UVA rays, which penetrate deeper into the skin than UVB rays. Minimize the effects . Wear broad-spectrum sunblock (look for such ingredients as Mexoryl, Helioplex and avobenzone), and apply an antioxidant cream daily. To build collagen, try products with vitamin A, peptides or growth hormones. 3. Repetitive motion . Dynamic movements that cause the skin to repeatedly crease in the same place, such as smiling, will wear down the underlying tissue in that specific spot, creating a line that remains after muscles relax. Minimize the effects . Smiling is essential, but you can limit other motions that deepen crow's-feet. For example, wear sunglasses to keep from squinting in bright light. For the most dramatic results, consider Botox. Expert help for smile lines . For fast results, consider in-office procedures for trouble spots. 1. Injectable fillers . Collagen and hyaluronic acid fillers (like Restylane) can be injected directly into wrinkles to restore volume loss. Collagen is thin and more viscous, making it easier to apply under thin eye skin. By contrast, hyaluronic acid, which is denser and lasts longer, is better suited for filling the nasolabial area (the lines from mouth to nose). Primary area of use: Crow's feet and nasolabial folds . Costs: Collagen: $250--$550 per area; hyaluronic acid: $300--$850 per area . Lasts: Collagen: 3--4 months; hyaluronic acid: 6--12 months . Downtime: Swelling can last 1--2 days; some slight redness. Risks: Bumpiness and bruising . Our experience: These deep injections hurt, but our tester saw immediate improvement in nasolabial folds. She had no swelling. Insider tip: If you get a bump, massage the area within 24 hours to smooth it out. 2. Botox . Botulinum toxin, aka Botox, ""relaxes the muscles, so when you smile, the skin won't crinkle up in the area around your eyes,"" says Michigan dermatologist D'Anne Kleinsmith. Limiting repetitive movements prevents the formation of wrinkles in those areas and lessens the appearance of existing lines. Primary area of use: Forehead, brow lines and crow's-feet COST $200--$500 per area . Lasts: Approximately 3--4 months . Downtime: Virtually none, but slight swelling (that looks like a welt) may last a few hours following the injection. Risks: Drooping of the eyelid or brow (rare) Our experience: Slightly painful. It takes three to four days for dynamic wrinkles (that appear when you make facial expressions) to disappear. Insider tip: Avoid blood thinners such as ibuprofen or aspirin before treatment; they increase the risk of bruising. At-home treatments . Use topical products to look better today -- and tomorrow. Instant fix . ""Anything you can do to hydrate your skin softens the appearance of fine lines,"" says dermatologist Susan Weinkle of Bradenton, Florida. For spot treatment of wrinkles, a product with a thick, cushiony feel fills in cracks better than a thinner cream or serum. Try: Estée Lauder Perfectionist Correcting Concentrate for Deeper Facial Lines/Wrinkles. Long-term help . Nothing will turn back the clock or erase damage caused by sunbathing, but you can stimulate the production of new collagen to bolster the skin's thickness and firmness. Look for products with retinol (like Clinique) or peptides (like Olay). Try: Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream or Clinique Zero Gravity Repairwear Lift. E-mail to a friend .

"Fort Worth, Texas (CNN) -- A wrenching court fight -- about who is alive, who is dead and how the presence of a fetus changes the equation -- came to an end Sunday when a brain-dead, pregnant Texas woman was taken off a ventilator. The devices that had kept Marlise Munoz's heart and lungs working for two months were switched off about 11:30 a.m. Sunday, her family's attorneys announced. ""May Marlise Munoz finally rest in peace, and her family find the strength to complete what has been an unbearably long and arduous journey,"" the lawyers, Heather King and Jessica Janicek, said in a written statement. Munoz was 14 weeks pregnant with the couple's second child when her husband found her unconscious on their kitchen floor November 26. Though doctors had pronounced her brain dead and her family had said she did not want to have machines keep her body alive, officials at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth had said state law required them to maintain life-sustaining treatment for a pregnant patient. Attorneys: Fetus was 'distinctly abnormal' Sunday's announcement came two days after a judge in Fort Worth ordered the hospital to remove any artificial means of life support from Munoz by 5 p.m. Monday. Earlier Sunday, the hospital said it intended to comply with that order. ""The past eight weeks have been difficult for the Munoz family, the caregivers and the entire Tarrant County community, which found itself involved in a sad situation,"" a hospital statement said. ""JPS Health Network has followed what we believed were the demands of a state statute."" The hospital acknowledged Friday that Munoz, 33, had been brain dead since November 28 and that the fetus she carried was not viable. Her husband, Erick Munoz, had argued that sustaining her body artificially amounted to ""the cruel and obscene mutilation of a deceased body"" against her wishes and those of her family. Marlise Munoz didn't leave any written directives regarding end-of-life care, but her husband and other family members said she had told them she didn't want machines to keep her blood pumping. The ethics of life support . In an affidavit filed Thursday in court, Erick Munoz said little to him was recognizable about his wife. Her bones crack when her stiff limbs move. Her usual scent has been replaced by the ""smell of death."" And her once lively eyes have become ""soulless."" The hospital's position drew support from demonstrators outside the hospital, some of whom held signs last week that read ""God stands for life"" and ""Praying for Baby Munoz and family."" But others countered with placards bearing messages like ""Let Marlise rest in peace"" and ""Respect Marlise's wishes.""

"(CNN) -- What happens to the bar of soap you barely used the last time you checked into a hotel room? Most certainly it's gone to waste at the end of each day. This was a shocking revelation for Ugandan humanitarian and social entrepreneur Derreck Kayongo during his first stay in a U.S. hotel in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the early 1990s. ""When i checked into the hotel, there were 3 bars of soap - there was body soap, hand soap and face soap and that did not include the shampoos - and so for me that was a new experience, I was thinking to my self, ""why do they have soap for every part of their bodies?"" Kayongo recalls. ""Now, my goodness, why would you throw away such a resource?"" The striking realization stayed with Kayongo, a Ugandan native who spent much of his childhood as a refugee in Kenya, and prompted him years later to create the Global Soap Project. The non-profit organization reprocesses used soaps from hotels around the United States and turns them into new bars for impoverished nations such as Uganda, Kenya, Haiti and Swaziland. Kayongo says an estimated 2.6 million bars of soap are discarded every day from hotels in the United States -- collecting such an enormous amount of soap, he notes, can help poor countries fight disease and combat child mortality by improving access to basic sanitation. ""We have more than two million kids that die every year to lower respiratory diseases like diarrhea,"" says Kayongo. ""If you are able to put a bar of soap in every child's hand, you are able to reduce infectious diseases like diarrhea and things like typhoid and cholera by 40%. ""So the intervention became immediate for me and that's when I thought we have a solution for kids in Africa, Latin America, Asia that die every year."" Based in Atlanta, Kayongo started the Global Soap Project in 2009 by going door to door, pitching his lifesaving idea to local hotels. So far, some 300 hotels across the United States have joined Kayongo's cause, enabling him and his team to reprocess thousands of soap bars and ship them to 18 developing countries. The recycled soap is only released for shipment once a sample is tested for pathogens and deemed safe by a third-party laboratory. The Global Soap Project then works with partner organizations to ship and distribute the soap directly to people who need it for free. Last summer, Kayongo personally delivered 5,000 bars to Kenya Relief, Brittney's Home of Grace orphanage. ""When I took the soap to the orphans and they smelled the bar of soap, ah, you could see the joy -- those little messages of hope is what people need when they are between a rock and a hard place,"" he says. The son of a soap maker, Kayongo has experienced what it is like to live in tough conditions. His happy early childhood in the 1970s was suddenly brought to an end after Uganda's President Idi Amin waged war against Tanzania. Kayongo and his parents soon fled to neighboring Kenya to escape the horrors of conflict and witnessed first hand the struggle to survive without access to basic necessities. ""When you have come from a home that you knew, you're used to your food, your friends...to move from that to become a nobody and to literally be called a refugee is as dramatic as it gets."" He got a new chance in life through education, first in Nairobi and then in the United States. Today, he runs the Global Soap Project from a warehouse in Atlanta, with the help of volunteers from all across the United States, determined to improve the quality of lives in the developing world. ""When I was a refugee, a pen pal letter was all I needed to get through the day,"" he recalls. ""If the bar of soap is going to help them get through the day then good, but our final goal is to change behavior and make sure they wash up and to stop diseases like diarrhea from infecting people and killing people -- that is our ultimate goal, we have yet to achieve that."" Last year, Kayongo was a top 10 finalist for the CNN Hero of the Year award. The recognition, he says, has boosted the popularity of the Global Soap Project, helping him and his team to promote the cause for better sanitation. ""We are seeing an up tick of the number of hotels that are registering with us,"" he says. ""We are seeing a lot of volunteers coming to work with us, so there is a lot of traffic happening right now for us and that is going to help us make more soap."" Despite all the success, Kayongo is determined to continue dedicating time and effort in his cause. He says his goal for this year is to make a million bars of soap. ""If you want to do big things and you want to bring big change then you have to be able to give in a big way,"" he says. ""It's important to understand what this is about -- people coming together globally to connect the dots. ""So I say 'travel, use the soap' because that soap goes eventually to help refugees, orphans. This is not about Africa per se, it's about the collective good as humans to solve problems and that's what we are trying to do.""","Derreck Kayongo is the creator of the Global Soap Project .

"(CNN) -- She's got nerves of steel, golf talent beyond her tender years, and a precocious flair for eye-catching fashion: 11-year-old Lucy Li, the youngest qualifier in U.S. Women's Open history, looked entirely at home as she teed-off at Pinehurst No. 2. Despite a three bad holes in North Carolina, which meant she finished her round with an eight-over-par 78, Li impressed onlookers with a composed round that saw her bounce back quickly from disappointing shots. She left the course smiling, having followed up two double-bogeys and a triple-bogey with assured play -- including birdies at the first and fifth. ""It was great,"" Li told reporters Thursday. ""What I was so happy about in my round, (was that) after I got doubles and triples, I was able to get it back. And I got a lot of pars after that."" Heading into the tournament, Li said her only ambition was to ""have fun and play the best I can."" But the California native can also count growing experience in her time at Pinehurst, not least how to deal with the perilous course -- which hosted the men's U.S. Open last week. ""It's tough,"" said Li. ""You miss the ball by three feet and it could be like a two- or three-shot difference. ""You could hit it three feet more right and you'd be putting this far away for birdie. Or you could be in the bunker and struggling for a bogey."" Tour pros had raised doubts about whether the child amateur -- still wearing braces and standing on a box to address the media after her opening round -- should be subjected to the pressure and expectation of such a big professional event. ""When I found out she qualified, I said, 'Well, where does she go from here? You qualify for an Open at 11, what do you do next?' "" asked world No. 1 Stacy Lewis on Wednesday. The 29-year-old added: ""If it was my kid, I wouldn't let her play in the U.S. Open qualifier at 11, but that's just me."" Pressure seemed to be the least of Li's worries as she chatted with the older members of her playing group and feasted on an ice cream during the post-round press conference. ""She is so mature for her age,"" said 23-year-old Jessica Wallace, who played with Li and Catherine O'Donnell -- the latter also shot 78. ""There were times when I felt more immature than she is. Catherine and I had fun talking to her. She's so mature, it's like talking to another 23-year-old."" Li became officially the youngest player to qualify after securing her place at an event at Half Moon Bay Golf Club near her home in California. She beats fellow American Lexi Thompson, who qualified for the 2007 Open aged 12, to become the youngest qualifier. But Li is not the youngest to compete at the tournament -- Beverley Klass competed in 1967, without having to qualify, aged just 10. While Canadian Wallace carded 74 to be on course to make the halfway cut, seven shots behind first-round leader Lewis, Li and O'Donnell were outside the projected top-60 ahead of their second rounds Friday. And there wasn't a fairytale end for Li -- she missed the weekend rounds after carding another 78 on Friday, laced with more highs and lows as she tied for 120th in the 154-player field. ""I'm really happy with how I bounced back from the big numbers,"" said Li, who again had to stand on a box to reach the microphone at her press conference Friday. ""Just be patient and not care about what happened, just go to the next shot and hit it like nothing, like it's the first shot."" Her caddy Bryan Bush added: ""She proved that she deserved to be here. Her play spoke for itself. ""It was never about score,"" he said. ""She was here for the experience and the opportunity to play with the best players in the world. She proved that she can."" The weekend attention switched from one child prodigy to a former one, as Michelle Wie claimed a three-shot lead from Thompson. The 24-year-old Wie also came to prominence at a young age but is still seeking her first major title. She birdied the last two holes to move clear of 19-year-old Thompson, who at 16 was the youngest winner of an LPGA event until that record was taken by Lydia Ko in 2012. New Zealand's Ko, now 17, fired 71 to move up the leaderboard and make the cut, being tied for 29th. World No. 1 Stacy Lewis dropped from the opening-round lead to a tie for third after a 73 which left the American four shots behind compatriot Wie.","Lucy Li, 11, becomes the youngest qualifier to play in U.S. Women's Open history .

"(CNN) -- Jenson Button may have hit out at Lewis Hamilton after Sunday's German Grand Prix, but he admitted to overreacting following the former teammates' collision at Hockenheim. Hamilton started the race 20th on the grid, having crashed out in qualifying with a brake problem, but fought his way back to claim a third-place finish, behind winner and fellow Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg and runner-up Valtteri Bottas. Hamilton's drive, though, was halted after he damaged his front wing when attempting to pass Button's McLaren on lap 30. The collision left Button -- who finished eighth -- frustrated, with the Briton pointing out that Hamilton also caught Williams' Valtteri Bottas in the closing stages of the race. ""I don't think I'm the only person he drove into. It's strange when the car is much quicker; you wouldn't think he'd get into such fights,"" Button told reporters afterwards. However, after having time to review the race later that night, Button was keen to stress that his criticism in the heat of the moment had been unfair on his former McLaren teammate. Hamilton himself had earlier offered an apology for his part in the incident, although he believed Button was allowing him to overtake. ""It was really tough to get through the pack safely and I had a bit of a collision with Jenson,"" Hamilton said on the podium. ""I honestly thought he was opening the door to let me pass -- he's been a bit like that in the last race, for example -- but it was my bad judgment."" Hamilton is now 14 points behind Mercedes teammate Rosberg at the top of the drivers' standings after the German won his home race. Hamilton was quick to praise his title rival and colleague and the 29-year-old is relishing the challenge of trying to land his second world championship title, six years on from his maiden success.","Jenson Button said he ""overreacted"" after criticising Lewis Hamilton .

After he lost his sight, he says, he ""never thought"" he'd be able to do something like skiing again. Less than two years later, he is accomplishing a feat he never dreamed possible. ""You know when you're blinded, you don't know what life is. You don't know what's out there,"" Castro said. Castro and nine other Iraqi vets blinded in the Iraq war were in Sun Valley for the Sun Valley Adaptive Sports program last month. The program is offered to anyone with disabilities, but there is a special program for veterans wounded in Iraq.  Watch blind vets learn to ski » . Most who come to the weeklong program, offered in both winter and summer, have lost limbs or suffered head injuries. This is the first time that a group of visually impaired vets have taken part in the snow sport camp. ""We want them to do things they've never tried before or try things again that they used to do,"" says Tom Iselin, the executive director of the program. ""A lot of these guys come from Special Forces. They are used to being pushed. Because they are used to being pushed and they want to be pushed, they want to exceed the limitations that society has placed on them."" The goal is to give the wounded vets ""courage and hope, so that they can take that back -- those skills -- to improve their relationships,"" Iselin says. According to the Blinded Veterans Association, more than 100 service members have been blinded in Iraq and another 247 lost sight in one eye. The organization says more eyes are saved in this war due to the increased response time to care for the wounded. In World War II, it took an average of 36 to 48 hours before a wounded soldier underwent eye surgery. Today, the average is less than an hour, according to the Blinded Veterans Association. In Castro's case, he was providing sniper support for fellow soldiers in Yusufiya, Iraq, in September 2006. Suddenly the whine of a mortar echoed above him. It landed five feet from Castro and exploded. His jaw was crushed, his arm broken and his lung collapsed. Two fellow soldiers were killed in the attack. The blast pulverized Castro's left eye and after surgery failed to save his remaining eye, Castro was blind. It takes a big leap of faith for someone who is blind to ski, snowboard or even ice skate for the first time. It's all about trust, says John Crabtree, another of the blinded veterans in Idaho. Crabtree tried ice skating for the first time and found the key was ""the trust that you put into those that are helping you instruct you."" ""The challenge is to concentrate on what they're telling me."" A senior naval petty officer who specialized in explosive ordinance, Crabtree was blinded by shrapnel from a makeshift bomb in Anbar province on February 12, 2006. He was asking a fellow sailor across the room for a tool when the blast went off. The sailor, Nicholas Wilson, was killed in the explosion. Crabtree says it's been a struggle to get back to this point, but he wants to be independent again. ""On top of that, I think I can speak for everyone else -- we're glad to be alive,"" he says. The service members can bring their spouses or a close family member as part of the therapy. Marshell Crabtree says her husband's family is amazed that he's trying all the winter sports. ""They're excited about John and everything he is experiencing and doing and breaking all the rules. It's just really exciting watching him,"" she says. On the ice, Crabtree struggles to get the hang of it. ""I figured because I can ski pretty well, I'd rip it up but, man, I just don't know about this,"" he says. His skating instructor Lacy Marsh encourages him, ""Once you find your balance, you find you can glide a little farther."" Back on the slopes, instructor Jim McCabe leads Castro from the lift. ""Follow my voice"" he tells him. By the third day, Castro accomplished what he set out to do: He got off the lift and skied down the hill without falling. ""It's been 16 months,"" he says ""and slowly I've come to learn the things I'm able to do visually impaired -- all the things that are out there, people that are willing to help and willing to put up programs like this one to motivate you and get you off the couch and get you to be an active person in society."" Watching how the veterans progress never fails to move Iselin. ""We want them to leave with a huge smile and when they leave say, 'Wow, that's the most fun I've had in years!'""

"(CNN) -- A trio of middle school rockers has just unlocked a major record deal. The Brooklyn metal band Unlocking the Truth has signed a $1.7 million recording contract with Sony. The deal commits Sony to producing two of the band's albums, as long as the first album sells more than 250,000 units. The three musicians -- guitarist Malcolm Brickhouse, 13; bassist Alec Atkins, 13; and drummer Jarad Dawkins, 12 -- will be paid $60,000 upfront for their first LP and could earn a $325,000 advance on their second. With Sony having the option to extend their contract for three more albums, Unlocking the Truth could earn $1.7 million. The major label love is just one part of a stellar two years for the group. After getting their first big break in 2012 during Amateur Night at New York City's Apollo Theater, a YouTube clip of them playing in Times Square went viral in 2013. In June, Unlocking the Truth opened for Guns N' Roses -- and that was after happily crowdsurfing during a set at the Coachella music festival in April. ""Deep down, they know they are inspiring kids. They know they've done it and in their own way,"" the band's manager, Alan Sacks, said. ""They know they're representing a lot. It's beyond African-American performers. They're iconic for the whole world -- for kids doing whatever you want and if you put your mind to it you can do it -- as long as you have the talent, the motivation, the concentration and the patience."" The trio is performing with the 2014 Vans Warped Tour, opening for Queens of the Stone Age, and plans to start recording in about four weeks. ""What started out as play dates went to Times Square and now this. It's been one great thing after another,"" Jarad's mother, Tabatha Dawkins, told the New York Daily News. Of the record deal, she added, ""It's so exciting. We're jumping over the moon."" The three metalheads aren't leaving behind school for music. Tabatha Dawkins said they'll be entering the eighth grade at different schools in Brooklyn next school year and that education is still the top priority. In fact, Sony will pay out-of-pocket costs for academic tutors for each musician when they are unable to attend school. ""Schoolwork comes first,"" Tabatha Dawkins told the New York paper. ""If their schoolwork is not done, they don't play."" CNN's Allie Malloy contributed to this report.","Middle school band Unlocking the Truth has signed a major record deal .

"(CNN) -- America's top defense officials left open the possibility of targeting ISIS fighters in Syria, saying during a news briefing Thursday that it was not enough to just hit the extremist group in Iraq. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stopped short of calling for U.S. military action in eastern Syria, an ISIS stronghold. ""Can they be defeated without addressing that part of the organization that resides in Syria? The answer is no,"" Dempsey said during the briefing at the Pentagon. Repeatedly pushed by reporters about whether that meant operations against ISIS in Syria, Hagel said, ""We're looking at all options."" While it's unclear what those options may be, Hagel said the United States is ""very clear-eyed"" about ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State but also is known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. ""They are beyond just a terrorist group. They marry ideology, a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess,"" Hagel said. ""This is beyond anything we have seen, and we must prepare for everything. And the only way you do that is that you take a cold, steely hard look at it and get ready."" Speaking at a town hall meeting in Arizona, Republican Sen. John McCain, who has advocated for strikes against ISIS in Syria, said the extremists were ""an enemy that must be defeated. Not stopped, but defeated."" ""It is a cancer which has spread throughout that region and can spread into Europe and into the United States of America,"" McCain said. His phrase echoed the term President Barack Obama used Wednesday to describe the terrorist group. Hagel offered his condolences to the family of American journalist James Foley, whose execution at the hands of ISIS was captured on video and posted online this week as a warning to the United States. The group threatened the life of another American hostage, believed to be journalist Steven Sotloff, if the United States did not end its airstrikes in Iraq. The threat has done little to curb U.S. military operations in Iraq. On Thursday, American warplanes pounded ISIS targets near Mosul Dam, where Iraqi forces have been battling to retake control of the area. A total of six airstrikes hit ISIS positions, according to the Defense Department. The strikes destroyed or damaged three ISIS Humvees, one ISIS vehicle and multiple locations where improvised explosives had been placed, the U.S. military said. Obama ordered targeted airstrikes in Iraq this month to protect U.S. personnel and facilities as well as minorities being brutalized by ISIS. Since August 8, the U.S. military has carried out 90 airstrikes, 57 of them in support of Iraqi forces near the Mosul Dam, according to the Defense Department. Mosul Dam is the largest in the country, and Iraqi and U.S. officials fear that a breach in the dam would threaten the lives of millions of Iraqis who live downstream in Mosul and Baghdad. U.S. airstrikes played a role helping Kurdish and Iraqi forces retake control of the dam, pushing back ISIS militants who seized it. With the dam clear of ISIS fighters, Iraqi forces are expanding their area of control, the Defense Department said. The fighting and efforts by ISIS militants to take over towns in northern Iraq have forced as many as 1.2 million Iraqis from their homes so far this year, according to UNHCR estimates. On Thursday, Kurdistan's regional government praised the assistance provided by the United States and the international community. ""We are grateful to the men and women of the American armed forces who have carried out these decisive attacks against the terrorist forces of ISIS,"" said a statement from the regional government. Nechirvan Barzani, the prime minister of the regional government, described the beheading of Foley as ""a horrendous act committed with utter disregard for human life."" ""Like Mr. Foley, several hundred innocent members of the Yazidi and Christian communities have been killed in the same manner,"" Barzani said in a statement Thursday. ""There is no way to overstate the extent of this inhumanity, and it illustrates the true, dark nature of the terrorists that we are confronting."" Also Thursday, a third French aid flight headed to Irbil, according to the French foreign ministry. The aid includes 21 metric tons of food, tents, medical supplies and other basic necessities. France has delivered 58 metric tons of aid since it started its humanitarian flights on August 15, the ministry said. What will it take to beat ISIS militants?

"(CNN) -- Rebecca Privitera desperately wanted to lose the excess weight she had carried around her entire life. In 2010, she had the opportunity to do it when her employer organized a company weight loss challenge. But when she lined up to weigh in, Privitera realized the scale wouldn't hold her 381-pound frame. ""They wanted me to go down to shipping and receiving and get on the shipping scale,"" she says. She refused. However embarrassing this moment was, it wasn't enough to prompt Privitera to change. A couple of months later, in early 2011, the Cabot, Arkansas, native was put on bed rest because her blood pressure was too high. Doctors gave her three blood pressure medications and an anti-depressant. Read Rebecca Privitera's story on CNN iReport . ""I was out of work for about four weeks,"" Privitera remembers. ""They were afraid I was going to have a stroke."" Before going on bed rest, she had bought a wedding dress. By the time the dress came in, it was too tight to wear. Privitera had to have a second dress specially made overseas. Instead of a dream night, Privitera's wedding in April 2011 felt like a nightmare. ""I was hot and a sweaty mess,"" she says. ""I was so overweight and so uncomfortable. I was miserable. I couldn't stand it."" A few weeks after her wedding, Privitera's new mother-in-law asked her to join her in a 5-kilometer run. It took her an hour and 14 minutes to complete. ""My body was physically hurting; I didn't want to do it anymore,"" she says. ""I hit rock bottom."" Father's nursing home inspires son to lose weight . After the race, Privitera and her husband, Justin, had an honest conversation. He told her they couldn't afford weight loss surgery or food supplement programs, and she would have to lose weight the old-fashioned way. She agreed and embarked on a journey to lose more than 200 pounds in just over two years. Her first step was to get active. Privitera invested in cardio DVDs and started working out at home. She felt too embarrassed to go to a gym and felt that personal training was too expensive. ""The videos showed results that gave me hope, so I gave it a shot,"" she says. In the beginning, she was losing 10 to 12 pounds a month. She posted her results on Facebook and the overwhelming response from her friends and family pushed her to continue exercising. After losing about 65 pounds, Privitera started to modify her eating habits. She started looking up calorie counts for meals before going out to eat in order to make smarter choices at restaurants. She also began to create healthier versions of meals at home using better ingredients. Privitera was obese her entire life. Her parents divorced when she was 12 years old. Her mother worked two jobs and struggled to make ends meet. ""A lot of our food choices came out of a paper bag -- I lived on fast food,"" she remembers. There were days during her high school years when she would eat McDonalds for breakfast, lunch and dinner. She recalls being able to eat an entire half-gallon of mint chocolate-chip ice cream in one night. She was a 16-year-old who weighed more than 300 pounds and developed a blood clot in her leg. Even with this serious medical issue, she still made poor nutrition choices and her weight continued to balloon into adulthood. 'From Fatman to Ironman;' Dad loses 135 pounds . Now, more than two years into her weight-loss journey, Privitera is incorporating new foods into her diet. ""I've followed meal plans with food like quinoa and asparagus,"" she says. ""Until recently, I had never had Brussels sprouts before."" Privitera approaches this journey as exactly that -- a journey. She allows herself to indulge once in a while, reminding herself if she wants something she can eat it, just not all the time. Instead of focusing on calorie restriction, she focuses on eating reasonable portions of healthy foods. ""You have to balance it out,"" she says. ""You can't extreme diet for the rest of your life."" She credits her success to the support of her husband and family, but also to the community of people around her. The majority of her 211-pound loss has come from exercise done right inside her home. She has used programs such as TurboFire and Beachbody, and is now on her fourth round of P90X. She's developed friendships and found accountability partners in the people who use the online message boards for these at-home programs. Privitera works out six days a week, taking Sunday off, and spends anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours a day exercising. She has been able to avoid any physical setbacks by training safely and not over-exerting herself. She has continued to use home videos because it keeps her from making excuses to miss workouts. ""I hate being pressed for time,"" she says. ""Working out at home, I get up and get started."" She has faced a lot of mental road blocks that nearly made her give up. During these times she has had to rely on people like her mother-in-law to tell her that she has what it takes to keep going and accomplish her goals. Her motivators have inspired Privitera to become a motivator for others. Privitera says she has helped other women lose a combined 200 pounds by motivating them on Facebook, Instagram and through online communities like the ones she uses. She also regularly teaches a cardio-kickboxing class at a local community center. About a month ago, she spoke to a class of high school students. She told them that overweight teenagers can make small choices now that will make a world of a difference in their lives. ""One young lady shared that she eats two double cheeseburgers, medium fries, a medium Sprite and three cookies from McDonalds every single night,"" Privitera recalls. ""She had no idea how many calories and how much fat there was in it."" Her weight loss success has inspired the people closest to her. Privitera's husband has started his own program and lost 35 pounds. She says this experience has brought them closer together. ""My husband sees that I have a real passion,"" she says. Justin says he's mostly surprised by her new attitude. ""She is more positive, upbeat and always looking on the bright side of things,"" he says. ""It inspires me every day to do better. I'm very lucky to have a wife like her."" Privitera set out to complete 13 races in 2013, including three 10Ks. Her 13th race of the year was in late October and it was a big one: her first half-marathon. She completed the race with her mother-in-law by her side the entire time. Unlike their first race together, this time she wanted to do it and not give up. ""I cried after I finished this half-marathon,"" she says. ""You look for that moment when you cry and think, 'I've done something that some people cannot do.' "" No magic bullet for keeping off the pounds .","Rebecca Privitera lost 211 pounds in just over two years .

"(EW.com) -- After a Friday night showdown that heavily tipped the scales in favor of the survival-horror thriller ""The Purge: Anarchy,"" ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" came back strong this weekend to take the No. 1 spot at the box office. The ""Apes"" sequel, starring motion-capture master Andy Serkis as the hyper-evolved higher primate named Caesar, collected $36 million for the weekend, according to Sunday estimates. Meanwhile, ""The Purge: Anarchy,"" a follow-up to last year's nightmare-inducer about a 12-hour period when no crime is illegal, garnered only $28.3 million. ""The Purge"" wasn't entirely beloved by its terror-craving audience, getting only a B from the polling firm Cinemascoreâ€”compared to the A-minus received by ""Apes."" So-so word-of-mouth may have led to the Saturday stumble. It's still a terrific opening for the Universal horror movie, which cost only $9 million to make (compared to an estimated $170 million budget for the ""Apes"" film, which has earned back only $138 million domestically so far.) The winner there is obvious. Mark Romanek in talks to direct 'Shining' prequel . ""Apes"" is off to a strong start after only two weeks, however, and if it can maintain that it will stand as one of the stronger films of summer. For a while on Friday, it seemed ""Purge"" would take not just the spoils but the title as well. The movie earned $13 million from Friday night showings, compared to ""Apes'"" lackluster $10.4 million, a 62 percent drop from its opening night a week before. But ""Apes"" rallied big time on Saturday, earning $14.8 million to ""Purge's"" $9.5 million, which was a 27 percent drop from its opening night. The writing was on the wall: the ""Apes"" had it. The No. 3 slot went to ""Planes: Fire & Rescue,"" a DisneyToon Studios sequel to last year's family comedy about adventurous airplanes, spun-off from Pixar's ""Cars"" universe. With only $18 million -- $4 mil less than the first ""Planes"" -- that's a pretty bad stall for a family movie in the middle of summer. It's low Friday gross of $6.3 million seemed like it may simply have been a reflection that not many adults turned out on opening night for kiddie fare. But then ""Fire & Rescue"" didn't do much better during family-friendly matinee hours of Saturday, earning $6.6 million. The Cinemascore rating was an A, so those who did turn out enjoyed what they saw. The same can't be said for Cameron Diaz and Jason Segel's ""Sex Tape,"" which nabbed a dismal C-plus Cinemascore, and opened in fourth place with only $15 million. Diaz had been on a comedy hot-streak lately, and this raunchy slapstick about a couple trying to prevent their friends and family from seeing an accidentally-uploaded boudoir video seemed like it would be primed to continue the trend. Critical Mass: Is this a 'Sex Tape' you'd pay to see? But there was no ""Bad Teacher"" here. Just bad. Critics were cruel, and audiences didn't disagree. ""Director Jake Kasdan, who also helmed 'Bad Teacher' ... doesn't quite seem to know what tone he's going for, and the last half of the movie veers wildly between crude hard-R comedy and warm-hearted teachable moments. Blessedly, it's also short,"" wrote EW's Leah Greenblatt. In limited release, Zach Braff's partially Kickstarter-donation-funded ""Wish I Was Here"" opened in 68 theaters and earned $495,000 for a relatively strong $7,300 per screen. ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" director Michel Gondry's whimsical French dramedy ""Mood Indigo"" collected $25,100 in two locations, for an average of 12,550 per screen. The philosophical sci-fi saga ""I Origins"" earned $28,700 in four locations, for an average of $7,175, while ""Persecuted,"" a paranoid thriller about a preacher framed for murder, straddled the wide-release/limited-release framework by launching in 736 theaters, but earning only $959,000, or $1,300 per screen.

"(CNN) -- Earlier this month, Jakarta governor Joko Widodo, who is universally known by his nickname Jokowi, claimed victory in Indonesia's presidential election -- though official results have yet to come out. Jokowi is a transformative figure -- often referred to as Indonesia's Barack Obama. He'll be Indonesia's first president from outside of Jakarta's traditional elite, and has already shaken up the routine of Indonesian politics by refusing to promise cabinet seats to other parties in exchange for their support in his election. If he is confirmed as the winner then he'll have received a mandate from the people of Indonesia to deliver both greater and more inclusive economic growth by transforming the country's unwieldy bureaucracy. His opponent, retired General Prabowo Subianto, has refused to concede. Prabowo has every right to wait for the official tally, due by July 22, and to challenge the result in the Constitutional Court, which must rule on any challenges by August 24. But Jokowi's lead in the quick counts -- a representative sample of the initial tabulations conducted on polling day at 2,000 polling stations around Indonesia -- seems unassailable. Barring any subterfuge in the counting or subversion of the judicial process, Jokowi will be sworn in as the seventh president of the Republic of Indonesia on October 20. Lacking experience . But while Jokowi's rise could transform Indonesian politics, his agenda when it comes to foreign affairs is much more modest. As a former furniture exporter, he has no prior experience in foreign or security affairs. Perhaps because of that, he has promised to continue many of the policies of incumbent President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who came into office with far more experience as an army general educated in the United States. In Yudhoyono's first term, Indonesia cemented its position in the G-20 and led important climate change negotiations in Bali. In his second term, it chaired two important regional meetings, the East Asia Summit and the APEC Forum, at a time of increased friction between China and Southeast Asian states. Yet despite Indonesia's de facto role as a leader of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Yudhoyono left much of the heavy lifting to his talented foreign ministers, Hasan Wirajuda and Marty Natalegawa. Look for Jokowi to do the same by appointing a protÃ©gÃ© of Wirajuda to the post. One area where we may see greater emphasis under the Jokowi administration is Indonesian advocacy of global Islamic causes. During a presidential debate on foreign policy in June, Jokowi announced that he would seek to establish an Indonesian embassy in ""Palestinian-controlled territory,"" and seek greater recognition for its government abroad. Smear campaign . Jokowi made this promise against the backdrop of an alleged smear campaign against him by shadowy forces connected to his opponent that portrayed him as a Christian of Chinese descent, a description unlikely to help a bid to become the head of state in the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation. For the same reason, Jokowi spent the three-day quiet period between the end of the campaign and voting on election day on a pilgrimage to Mecca, which the Indonesian press covered extensively. No one should interpret Jokowi's interest in Palestinian statehood as an indication that Indonesia will aggressively push Islamic causes, or that Jokowi will make the kind of perorations on these issues that made former Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed infamous in the West. Indonesia has always quietly advocated for the Palestinian cause. Establishing an embassy would take that advocacy to a new level, and is in line with a broader global trend toward acceptance of Palestinian statehood before a peace agreement can be concluded with Israel. Jokowi's interest in the Middle East could prove useful, however, to confronting a growing security challenge as Indonesian jihadists return from fighting in Syria and Iraq, radicalized by their experience and interested in continuing the fight back home. Indonesia's foreign ministry estimates at least 50 Indonesian jihadists have gone to fight in Syria, leading many analysts to conclude the number is likely much higher. If Jokowi can use his greater exertions on behalf of the Palestinian cause to lobby Arab governments to help intercept Indonesian fighters returning to the archipelago, and to demonstrate that his government has not ignored the plight of their coreligionists in the Middle East, he could diminish the risk of violence back home.","Jokowi has claimed victory in Indonesia's presidential vote -- though official results have still to come .

"(CNN) -- The tragic fate of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, believed shot down by a missile in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 on board, has cast a new light on the series of gambles Russian President Vladimir Putin embarked on in late February. At that time, Putin sent military intelligence troops in unmarked uniforms to take control of the southern Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. Three weeks later, Russia annexed the region. As Russian-speaking Ukrainians farther north in Donetsk and Luhansk stormed administrative buildings, demanding independence from Kiev, Russian intelligence officers started slipping across the border to help organize the militias. In subsequent months, Moscow supplied the separatist guerrillas with artillery, tanks and anti-aircraft weapons. Putin's goal appeared to be to pressure Ukraine's leaders to negotiate with the Russia-backed rebels and offer constitutional autonomy to the country's eastern regions. Intimidated by the superiority of the Russian army, Kiev -- it seemed -- would have to buckle under. This strategy was failing even before the Malaysia Airlines tragedy. Soon after his election last May, Ukraine's new President, Petro Poroshenko, launched a determined military campaign to crush the separatist guerrillas. Although he might have been willing to negotiate with Putin, he showed no inclination to talk to the swashbuckling Russian desperadoes on the ground. The success Poroshenko's operation was having explains why recently Moscow reportedly supplied its proxies with at least one radar-guided Buk missile system that could destroy Ukrainian military planes flying at high altitudes. Such missiles also had the range to hit the commercial airliners that continued to cross the conflict zone. While the facts about who shot down Flight MH-17 can only be settled by a full investigation, Ukraine's government has said it has ""compelling evidence"" that a Russian-supplied battery, manned by Russian operatives, fired the missile. 'Moment of truth' for Putin . Suddenly, the risks inherent in Putin's gamble are glaringly obvious. By supplying weapons to the rebel militias, with their strange mix of intelligence agents, local thugs and trigger-happy Russian volunteers, Putin made himself a hostage to their brutish blundering. On Saturday, some of these ""freedom fighters,"" apparently drunk, were said to be manhandling the corpses, while barring OSCE observers from the crash site. All must now await the results of the international investigation. If it concludes that the plane was shot down by rebels using a Russian-supplied missile -- or, worse still, by Russians themselves -- the pressure on Putin will become intense. The West, led by President Barack Obama, will demand that he cut off support to the rebels once and for all and seal the border. If Putin does not do so, tougher economic penalties are almost certain. Already, the latest round of U.S. sanctions, announced on July 17, surprised observers by their severity. They targeted the third and fourth largest Russian banks -- VEB and Gazprombank -- as well as the energy companies Rosneft and Novatek, which are associated with the Putin cronies Igor Sechin and Gennady Timchenko. Putin will, thus, have two options, both dangerous for his regime. He could reject the conclusions of the international investigation and stand by the separatists. This would result in serious damage to the Russian economy from sanctions that might now target whole sectors such as banking or energy. Such measures would send the economy -- already forecast by the IMF to grow just 0.2% this year -- into a painful recession. At the same time, the Kremlin would find itself more internationally isolated than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Not just the U.S. and Britain, but many other countries that were previously friendly or neutral would start to treat Putin as a pariah. And Putin would have to worry that his protÃ©gÃ©s across the border might commit some new atrocity, provoking the world into even tougher countermeasures. Opinion: How MH17 disaster backs Russia's Putin into a corner . Putin's second option would be to accept the report's conclusions and cut off supply lines to the rebels. But that could create significant problems for him at home. To those informed about the conflict by Russian state-controlled television, such a turnaround would be bewildering. A relentless barrage of propaganda has convinced many Russians that their co-ethnics in Donetsk and Luhansk are being massacred by troops commanded by a fascist regime in Kiev. For Putin to bow to international pressure and abandon his former charges would look like cowardice. Such a betrayal could quickly squelch the post-Crimea euphoria. From the start, the Kremlin's strategy in Ukraine has aimed in part at consolidating domestic support. As the economy stagnates, Putin has sought to replace growth and prosperity as a basis for popularity with anti-Western nationalism and conservative values. In the past, xenophobic nationalists have been among the least favorable toward Putin. His current astronomical ratings -- 86% in the latest Levada Center poll -- suggest at least some temporary success in winning them over. Were he to abandon the anti-Kiev insurgents, Putin could kiss such support goodbye. Moreover, were he to admit that Russian-backed rebels fired the missile, the credibility of Russian state-controlled television would suffer. The main channels have pushed a variety of conspiracy theories, including one in which the Ukrainian military shot down the plane, mistaking it for the jet flying Putin home from the BRICS summit in Brazil. Should Putin disavow such theories and endorse the Western version, his propagandists would look like liars. It remains possible that the investigation will fail to reach any strong conclusions, leaving Putin some wiggle room. But at this point interpretations completely exonerating Russia are few and far between. ""War,"" wrote Clausewitz, ""is the province of chance."" The danger that a covert military operation could get out of hand should have been clear all along. For 14 years, Putin proceeded cautiously in international affairs, weighing expected costs and benefits before taking action. His decision to invade Crimea was so uncharacteristically risky -- with such large potential costs and short-lived benefits -- that it took many observers by surprise. Now, unless some new unexpected event turns up to rescue him, Putin faces an unappealing dilemma. Either way, the risks are high. Having gambled his way into trouble, he now has little choice but to roll the dice again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Daniel Treisman.","Daniel Treisman: Putin took a big risk when he annexed Crimea, backed Ukraine separatists .

"(CNN) -- From Airbnb to GasBuddy to shopkick, lots of apps and websites help consumers save money. But how do we spend less on technology itself -- that digital drug we can't seem to get enough of? How can we save money on electronic gadgets and services ... so that we can buy more gadgets? Here are 10 ways to stretch your tech budget this year: . 1. Employ smart strips. Surge protectors have saved countless gadgets from being electrocuted over the years. But new ones like Take Charge's Power Saver Smart Strip are even better because they save money on your monthly power bill by killing standby power (aka vampire or phantom power) that most electronics consume even when turned off. In my case, after installing two smart strips (one in my office, the other on the entertainment center), I've saved at least $10 per month on my power bill since August -- more than enough to justify the $30 cost of each. 2. Buy less computer (or data). Processing power, bandwidth and chipsets used to mean a lot when deciding on a computer or Internet provider. But most computers and data plans today are really fast. Even when they're not, software developers have made perceptible gains in making gadgets and data feel faster than they really are. So instead of paying for a top-of-the-line machine, blazingly fast speeds or unlimited data, consider a lower-powered but still functional alternative. You'd be surprised how many people are buying too much computer or data for their needs. 3. See gadgets as assets. This is what I call my perpetual technology fund. It works like this: Two or three times a year, I identify gadgets, handhelds, old phones, laptops and gaming devices I no longer use (follow the dust) and/or have no intention of using over the next 12 months. The ones with value that I choose not to give away, I'll resell on Craigslist, eBay, or similar classifieds like Gazelle.com. In some cases, you can expect several hundred dollars in ""returns,"" which, of course, can then be used to subsidize your next tech purchase. 4. Cut cable TV (and buy your own cable modem). Like many tips on my list, this one, too, requires additional effort, but the savings can be immeasurable. First, stop renting a cable or internet modem if you haven't already. They cost less than $50 on average and quickly recoup the $5/month leasing fee. Next, see if you can find your favorite shows and programs on streaming websites such as Netflix, Amazon and Hulu. You may have to make a few sacrifices, but $100 a month in savings ain't a bad consolation prize. 5. Use freeware as often as you can. After paying hundreds of dollars for accounting software over the years, I recently switched to a free online service. It does everything my old software did at no additional cost. And there are a lot of other freemium software products to help you do what you need for less (or nothing). So get clicky with Google and see what's out there. 6. Avoid extended warranties. I know a lot of people get peace of mind when buying extended warranties on pricey TVs, smartphones and other gadgets. But the fact remains, according to numerous consumer reports, that extended warranties cost more money on average than what they might eventually save in the unlikely event your gadget breaks beyond its default warranty. This has certainly been the case with me. I've had stuff covered under warranty. Most of my tech survives without problem. And I've had a few devices out of warranty that I paid for. But overall, I've saved a lot more than I would have paying for extended warranties. My free accounting software says so! 7. Consider refurbished gadgets. Contrary to popular myth, refurbished electronics are often as good as new. For example, my friend just bought a beautiful MacBook for hundreds less than it would have cost new. It came in a new box. Smelled new. Featured those protective stickers that are always fun to pull off. And was really shiny. Even better, it's still under warranty. 8. Buy cheap digital cables. Most digital cables are created equal. I say most because I've had a cheapo digital cable go out on me. But I was only out a few dollars. And most of the knockoff digital cables I've bought -- including HDMI, iPhone cables, audio cables, etc. -- are still going strong after several years. Together, they've helped me pocket hundreds of dollars in savings (which I use to buy more tech). 9. Buy online. Before you roll your eyes and let out a big old ""duh,"" remember that shopping online often requires additional patience before seeing significant savings. For example, if you need an item right away and opt for expedited (and costly) shipping, you might be better off to buy at retail. Free shipping can take more than a week in some cases. But there are good deals out there. And even if you don't end up buying online, you should research prices there first before stepping into a brick-and-mortar store. 10. Buy smart rechargeables. Rechargeable batteries have come a long way over the last decade. In fact, batteries such as Sanyo's Eneloops now pack more than enough juice to power all your electronics. These ain't your father's rechargeable batteries, so start buying and start saving.","Blake Snow offers these 10 ways to help stretch your tech budget this year .

"(CNN) -- As a teenager who basically lives at Disney World, Lily Mock has been on virtually every ride at the Florida amusement park. But no ride has been as surprising as the monorail from Magic Kingdom to Epcot center. A power outage Sunday evening forced the evacuation of about 120 passengers from the monorail, Disney spokeswoman Jacquee Wahler said. She said weather caused the power outage, but it did not appear a lightning strike was responsible. Lily said the sky was filled with dark clouds when she, her parents and siblings boarded the monorail around 6 p.m. ""When we sat there, we heard a lot of thunder and saw a few bolts of lightning,"" the 15-year-old said. Suddenly, with the monorail about 30 feet in the air, the train came to a halt. ""It wasn't a jolting stop, but it did stop really fast -- the monorail glided to a stop,"" Lily said. Without the air conditioner running, the train car got pretty hot over the next 90 minutes. As they waited for firefighters to help them off, the stranded visitors passed the time by chatting with each other and messaging friends. No one seemed to panic, Lily said. Firefighters later managed to pop open the top hatch of the train car -- but opted to escort passengers out through the doors, using a lift. That actually disappointed Lily. ""I kind of wanted to go through the top, I thought it'd be fun,"" she said. Despite the mishap, Lily said she'll definitely be back -- especially after getting free passes for the inconvenience. And for a teen who visits Disney World at least three times a year, the experience was actually pretty cool. ""I just kept saying this is the most exclusive ride, having to evacuate the monorail,"" Lily said. Her mother, Melissa Mock, has been visiting Disney World since she was 8 years old. She describes the family as a bunch of ""Disney-philes"" and didn't mind the surprise at all. ""It was the single most exciting thing that's happened to us since we've been visiting in 30 years,"" she said. Six Flags coaster car derails, 4 injured .

"(CNN) -- An American journalist held in Syria by Islamist rebels for close to two years was released Sunday. Peter Theo Curtis, 45, is believed to have been captured in October 2012 and held by al-Nusra Front, a Syrian rebel group with ties to al Qaeda. ""My heart is full at the extraordinary, dedicated, incredible people, too many to name individually, who have become my friends and have tirelessly helped us over these many months,"" said Curtis' mother, Nancy Curtis. ""Please know that we will be eternally grateful."" The United Nations said Curtis was handed over to U.N. peacekeepers in the Golan Heights, which is under Israeli government control, and was given a medical checkup. White House national security adviser Susan Rice said Curtis was safe, no longer in Syria and expected to be reunited with his family shortly. He was on his way to Tel Aviv, according to a senior administration official. Nancy Curtis spoke to her son briefly by phone Sunday. ""He sounded so happy and excited to be free,"" she said. He told her ""I can't believe they let me out."" His cousin Viva Hardigg said, ""We've heard that his health appears good. That was very encouraging."" The United States was not involved in negotiations for his release but was aware of private efforts to secure the release, two U.S. law enforcement officials said. It's not known whether any ransom was paid, the officials said. Curtis' release comes just five days after ISIS militants released a video of one of its militants beheading American journalist James Foley. ""Particularly after a week marked by unspeakable tragedy, we are all relieved and grateful knowing that Theo Curtis is coming home after so much time held in the clutches of (al-Nusra Front),"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a statement. When asked about the death of James Foley, an American journalist killed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria last week, Nancy Curtis began to weep. ""I feel so bad for their family. Diane (Foley's mother) has become a good friend of mine, and I'm just so heartbroken for their loss."" Author and journalist . CNN obtained two videos that appear to have been recorded during the late stages of Curtis' captivity. In one, a gun is pointed at his head, and Curtis speaks rapidly, as if under duress. He gives his name and the date and says he is a journalist from Boston. Curtis is an author and freelance reporter who writes under the name Theo Padnos. He contributed articles about the Middle East to various publications, including the New Republic, The Huffington Post and the London Review of Books. He has also published two books: ""My Life Had Stood a Loaded Gun,"" a memoir about teaching literature to young offenders at a correctional facility in Vermont, and ""Undercover Muslim: A Journey into Yemen,"" which investigates Islamic extremism. He was born in Atlanta and graduated from Middlebury College in Vermont. Curtis holds a doctorate in comparative literature from the University of Massachusetts and is fluent in French and Arabic, according to a statement from his family. He also speaks German and Russian. ""Theo has a deep concern and regard for the people of Syria,"" his mother said, ""which is why he returned during the war. He wanted to help others and to give meaning and to bear witness to their struggles. ""I am very fortunate that I do not have to tell his whole story. He eventually will be able to do so himself."" President Barack Obama has been briefed on Curtis' release and ""shares in the joy and relief that we all feel now that Theo is out of Syria and safe,"" said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. ""But we continue to hold in our thoughts and prayers the Americans who remain in captivity in Syria -- and we will continue to use all of the tools at our disposal to see that the remaining American hostages are freed."" Former cellmate speaks . In August, CNN spoke to Curtis' former cellmate in Syria, Matthew Schrier. They were locked up together in six prisons before Schrier broke free by climbing through a window. ""I took apart the screen, pushed the sandbags aside, and I got stuck, around my waist, so I had to reach in. I unbuckled my pants, and as soon as I unbuckled my pants I shot right out,"" Schrier said. Curtis wasn't as lucky. He got stuck. Schrier said he tried to get Curtis out, but he simply didn't fit, and so Schrier left, promising to get help. ""It was one of the hardest things I ever had to do,"" Schrier said. ""It's hard to move on, because he's still there. You know, it hasn't ended yet 100%,"" he said then. ""I'm not going to have closure until he's home."" Fears heightened for Western hostages .

"(CNN) -- Michael Jackson was one of the most famous people in the world. Yet for all his global fame, the man himself was shrouded in mystery. Michael Jackson in 2001, during the time period he was recording conversations with Shmuley Boteach. Now some of that mystery has been peeled away. Jackson recorded about 30 hours of deeply personal thoughts with his friend and spiritual adviser, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, between August 2000 and April 2001. The results are the basis of a new book, ""The Michael Jackson Tapes: A Tragic Icon Reveals His Soul in Intimate Conversation."" Boteach joined CNN's Larry King in an interview aired Monday night that painted the pop star as a lonely, injured soul who craved adoration and love but was too damaged to find it. Boteach's recordings also revealed Jackson's relationships with various family members and celebrities -- some of which were warm, others tense and others painful and dysfunctional. When Jackson was recording his tapes, Madonna was not held in high esteem. ""She is not a nice person,"" Jackson told Boteach. Jackson revealed how he and Madonna had bickered about where they would socialize. ""Madonna laid the law down to me before we went out. [She said] I am not going to Disneyland, OK? That's out,"" Jackson said. ""I said, 'I didn't ask to go to Disneyland.' She said, 'We are going to the restaurant. And afterwards, we are going to a strip bar.' ""I said, 'I am not going to a strip bar, where they cross dress. ... I am not going to there. If that's how it is, forget this whole thing. ... Afterwards, she wrote some mean things about me in the press. And I wrote that she is a nasty witch, after I was so kind to her,"" Jackson said. King asked Boteach whether Jackson's opinion might have moderated on Madonna, especially in light of her warm comments at his memorial service. ""Well, let's be very fair to Madonna,"" Boteach said. ""These comments by Michael were said about his experiences with Madonna years and years ago, when she had an extremely testy public image. She was the Material Girl, the bad girl. And I think Michael was reacting to that."" Jackson had much more loving things to say about celebrity pal Brooke Shields and ex-wife Lisa Marie Presley. ""[Brooke] was one of the loves of my life. I think she loved me as much as I loved her,"" Jackson said. ""You know, we dated a lot."" Jackson went on to describe his first meeting with Shields and how thrilled he was that the woman whose picture was up on his walls invited him to a party after the Academy Awards. ""So we get to the after-party, she comes up to me and she goes, 'Will you dance with me?"" and I went, 'Yes, I will dance with you.' So we went on the dance floor and we danced,"" Jackson said. ""And, man, we exchanged numbers and ...  I was up all night singing, spinning around in my room, just so happy, you know. It was great."" Boteach said Jackson simultaneously held women in reverence and awe yet harbored deep suspicions about their motivations and his perceived their use of sexuality to achieve their goals. Those feelings didn't extend to Presley, however. Boteach played one of his conversations on this subject for King: . Jackson: ""Women can do some things that make guys very unhappy. I see it with my brothers. I see my brothers crying in tears and pulling the grass out of the lawn out of frustration because of their wives."" Boteach: ""Do you think all their wives were interested more in their success than in them?"" Jackson: ""Absolutely. They were after their money. That's why I said to myself, 'I'll never be married.' I held out the longest. I stayed at home until I was 27, 28."" Boteach: ""What was part of the attraction to Lisa Marie? That she had her own money? She had her own fame. You knew it wasn't about any of that."" Jackson: ""Absolutely. She didn't take a penny, didn't want anything."" Jackson also talked on the tapes about his complicated relationships with his parents, especially his father, Joe Jackson. Jackson described physical abuse at the hands of his father, including being stripped and oiled down before beatings with a iron cord. ""He would just whip you all over your face, your back, everywhere,"" Jackson told Boteach. ""I would just give up, like there was nothing I could do, you know. And I hated him for it. I hated him."" In a recent appearance on ""Larry King Live,"" Joe Jackson denied ever physically abusing Michael. Jackson also told Boteach that he and his sister Janet, as children, would pretend that their father was dead and make a game of how they'd react to his death. Michael said he'd ask Janet to picture their father in a coffin, and would ask her if that made her sad. She would repeatedly say it wouldn't, Michael said. Yet there was more to the father-son relationship. Michael also said he gave a lot of credit to his father for his entertainment success and always held out hope for reconciliation and a loving relationship. Boteach recalled one conversation he overheard when Michael called his father on the phone: . ""I'm going to tell the world how you were responsible for my success. You taught me. You were a great manager,"" he recalls Jackson telling his father. ""You taught me how to perform. You inspired me. You motivated me."" Boteach said that complicated relationship was at the root of many of Michael Jackson's problems and his obsession about children. ""I'm not here to judge Joe Jackson.  He was raising nine children,"" Boteach told King. ""But there can be no question that the devastating illustration given by Michael explains so much of his brokenness. Michael shared this, holding a tape recorder to his mouth, because he wanted the world to judge him more charitably."" Boteach said he ultimately broke off his relationship with the singer because he felt like Jackson was going down a self-destructive path and didn't want Boteach's advice or help. The tapes also revealed other fascinating glimpses of the singer's psyche and thoughts: . • In one of the most stunning exchanges, Jackson suggests that he could have transformed Adolf Hitler's heart if he could have had an hour alone with the Nazi dictator. • On then-meteoric Britney Spears: ""I don't believe that she'll have any great longevity in the public eye because she doesn't understand the power of mystery."" • On his first girlfriend, Tatum O'Neal: ""When I held Tatum's hand ... it was the most magical thing. It was better than kissing her."" • On being at the deathbed of Ryan White, the young boy who tugged at the nation's heart during his struggle with AIDS: ""I took care of him. He stayed at my house. ... I said, 'Ryan, I promise to you I would do something in your honor on my next album. I will create a song for you. I will sing it. I want the world to know who you are.' I did ""Gone Too Soon."" That was for him."" • On his regard for children: ""I would throw in the towel if it weren't for children and babies, you know. ... I've said it before, if it wasn't for children, I would choose death. I mean that with all my heart."" Despite the break in his relationship with Jackson, Boteach said he had high regard for the singer and the lessons they both learned during their sessions. ""The way I feel right now. I could cry right now listening to his voice again. You know ... Michael was trying to share with the world that our culture thinks somehow that fame and fortune are an acceptable substitute for love and affection,"" Boteach said. ""But Michael discovered that these are empty gifts that leave you bereft.""","Jackson's former spiritual adviser, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, appears on ""Larry King""

"(CNN) -- In the summer of 1989, Nickelodeon debuted its first scripted sitcom, which followed an Arizona dude ranch owner and the teens he employed for the summer. A lovably goofy concept even then, ""Hey Dude"" ran for 65 episodes and ultimately helped define Nick's programming for the next 25 years. It's since become a cult classic that would find new life on the Internet and on DVD, with reruns still getting airtime. Cast and crew members of the beloved comedy reunited in honor of the show's 25th anniversary in Austin, Texas, for the third annual ATX Television Festival. It marked the first time the group had sat down together since the show wrapped filming in 1991. The ""Hey Dude"" gang sat down with both fans and reporters for an afternoon of questions, anecdotes and memories. David Lascher, who portrayed lovable troublemaker Ted McGriff, said he was taken aback when he saw his cast mates. ""It's so nice to see everybody. It's just a flood of amazing memories,"" he says. ""Everyone looks great, seems happy. I can't believe it's been so long."" Christine Taylor, who played bubbly girl-next-door Melody Hanson, said her kids played in the same gym class as Lascher's at one point, but it has been difficult to keep in contact with everyone. ""Some of us did stay in touch, but it was back in the day when we all left, and we didn't have e-mail addresses,"" she says. ""If you moved and you weren't responsible with your address book, you lost touch."" Series writer Alan Goodman went on to write and produce 1990s Nick hits ""Clarissa Explains It All"" and ""The Mystery Files of Shelby Woo,"" and opens up about why ""Hey Dude"" remains close to the hearts of everyone involved. ""None of us had any experience at all before this,"" Goodman said, ""so it's something we all do remember fondly."" Taylor said some memories of the show's aesthetics continue to make her cringe -- especially when it comes to the wardrobe. ""I don't even think that was cool then! I don't remember pleated khaki shorts belted with a shirt and a bolero being cool -- even for people who lived on a dude ranch,"" she says. But Debrah Kalman, who co-starred as ranch mother figure Lucy, said she took some of the costumes home after the show wrapped and wears them to this day. The youngest star, Josh Tygiel, got the role of the skateboarding Buddy after responding to an open call notice in a local Tucson newspaper. Tygiel lived at home during the show's filming, but as Taylor recalls, the rest of the cast were in much closer quarters. ""Being away from home, we bonded very quickly. We were at the Ramada Inn, and then we upgraded to the Radisson Suites."" There were two major absences from the reunion: Kelly Brown, who portrayed strong-minded rich girl Brad Taylor, and Joe Torres, who played the easy-going Danny. Brown had to pull out at the last minute due to a family emergency -- and no one in the group is still in contact with Torres or clued in to his whereabouts. ""We don't really know,"" Goodman said. ""We just know the same rumors that everybody else knows that reads the Internet. There was a rumor he died, there was a rumor he was selling cars in New Jersey, but I don't know if anybody has confirmed any of these things. He's been hard to find."" Taylor and Torres visited the former Bar None Dude Ranch set in Tucson together a year or two after the show wrapped. Although not as run-down as it appears in a recently uploaded fan visit, Taylor said it was depressing nonetheless. ""It was really sad. It was all still standing, but it just all looked decrepit. Pieces were taken, everything was stripped down."" The cast members now have children of their own, and have had a variety of experiences introducing ""Hey Dude"" to a new generation. ""A few years ago, somebody contacted me and said they're rerunning all the episodes, so I DVR'd them for my children,"" says Lascher. ""My oldest, who was probably like 8 at the time, really loved it. She totally was into it!"" It wasn't quite the same positive reaction for Jonathan Galkin, who joined the show as series regular Jake Decker in Season 3. ""I bought the DVDs and showed them to my children, but their eyes glazed over,"" recalls Galkin. ""They did not think it was funny."" The cast and crew are mostly in agreement a reboot of the series doesn't sound like a good idea, with or without the original characters. For Taylor, ""Hey Dude"" worked so well in part because of the time it aired. ""Nowadays, a reboot would be so different. There's something very simple about the show,"" she says. ""It was just these kids on a dude ranch navigating their way through these simple issues. I don't think it would be cool to see Brad and Melody texting each other or Instagram-ing each other!"" Show writer Lisa Melamed says ""Hey Dude"" is still the most asked-about credit on her rÃ©sumÃ©, despite later work on critical favorites like ""Party of Five"" and ""Sisters."" ""I've actually had people come up to me over the last few years ... and say things like, 'You shaped my childhood.' It's an amazing thing to hear!"" Of all the times people have recognized her from the show, Taylor said, one instance stands out. ""The year I was marrying my husband [actor/director Ben Stiller], we're at a party, and this sort of L.A., blonde type comes up to me and says, 'Oh my god! Melody from ""Hey Dude"".' And I said, 'Oh my god, you know ""Hey Dude""?' And she said, 'Yeah. I'm Paris Hilton.' And that was the first time I met Paris Hilton.""

"London, England (CNN) -- A new budget airline backed by easyJet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou will soon take to the African skies, promising to bring low-cost flights to millions of people in the continent. Dubbed Fastjet, the no-frills carrier is expected to launch in three to four months, aiming to cash in on Africa's robust economic growth and a growing appetite for travel by its burgeoning middle class. The move comes after Haji-Ioannou's easyGroup teamed up earlier this month with pan-African conglomerate Lonrho to create the low-cost carrier. Lonhro, owner of budget airline Fly540, has agreed to sell its aviation business to investment firm Rubicon Diversified Investments, in which easyGroup will hold a 5% stake. The new business will start operations using Lonrho existing network in Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania and Angola, before expanding to more markets in the future. ""These four countries are currently experiencing great GDP growth, along with oil and gas discoveries and developments,"" says Ed Winter, chief executive of Fastjet. ""We believe that the time is absolutely right to change Fly540 into a much bigger airline based on the low-cost model which has been successful in every other part of the world,"" adds Winter, who is easyJet's former chief operating officer. The business, which will still be majority-owned by Lonrho, has set a target of carrying around 12 million passengers per year, ""which creates an airline of roughly 40 aircraft,"" according to Richard Blakesley, Fastjet's finance director. The low-cost carrier expects to offer average fares of $70-80 before tax, which could fall to as much as $15-20 when booked early. ""That price will absolutely democratize air travel, totally changing the way people are traveling in Africa,"" says Winter. Fastjet executives say they hope to tap Africa's rather underdeveloped aviation network, offering an affordable alternative in a transport environment largely dominated by difficult terrains, long bus journeys and poor infrastructure. Read more: Africa's daily commuting grind . Haji-Ioannou, who set up easyJet in the mid-1990s, has described Africa as ""the aviation industry's last frontier."" ""Past experience shows by halving fares, a successful low-cost carrier can encourage those people, who have never previously traveled by air, to fly. For Africa, with its densely populated cities separated by great distances -- this means a potential new market of millions,"" he said after the reverse takeover by Lonhro. In 2011, low-cost carriers occupied 9% of the African market, suggesting that there is a large potential for further development and growth, says aviation expert Linden Birns. He notes, however, that the big challenge for airlines is breaking into cross-border flights and launching intra-African routes. ""At the moment access to markets on a transnational basis is governed by a set of bilateral air transport agreements,"" says Birns, founder of South Africa-based aviation consultancy Plane Talking. ""Under those agreements, governments stipulate who's allowed to fly and how many flights. That really keeps a lid on things -- if you can break through those barriers and introduce competition then we should see some pretty rapid growth happening in the market."" Aircraft manufacturer Airbus has forecast Africa traffic to expand by about 6.5% per annum between 2011-2020 and by 4.9% between 2021-2030, for a 20-year growth rate of 5.7%. This compares with a 4.8% increase in demand on a worldwide basis over the next 20 years. ""It's no secret that Africa represents a massively untapped market,"" says Birns. ""If we look at where growth is happening in the world, Africa is certainly up there."" Birns says that as Africa's cities get more populated and as demand for business is growing, the expansion of the low-cost model should revolutionize the continent's air transport in the same way that it did in North America, Europe and now in Asia. ""More people will be able to trade, more people will be able to do their tourism and it should be a good economic driver,"" he says. See also: Is Africa world's next manufacturing hub? Fastjet's foray into the African market comes amid a tumultuous time for aviation industry in the continent -- earlier this month, a plane crash in Lagos, Nigeria, killed all 153 people aboard. Winter says Fastjet will raise the bar on safety and security, operating ""as though it was an European airline."" ""There's no reason why Africans shouldn't be just as safe and secure as in an European airline and we will follow those sort of procedures,"" he says. ""Now, that adds a bit cost to our operation but to my mind all of those costs are actually worthwhile to provide a safe and secure airline."" Looking ahead, Winter says the biggest challenge for Fastjet is dealing with lack of airport infrastructure, as well as high taxes imposed by governments and rocketing fuel duties. ""What we're hoping is that governments will realize that by allowing these tax levels to come down to more normal levels, we will be able to do most markets and their total revenue will actually increase,"" he says. But despite the challenges, Winter says he is ""incredibly excited"" about the venture, saying that there isn't a better time to enter the African market. ""Five years ago it just wasn't that level of GDP growth, the spread of wealth amongst the population and the level of investment,"" he says, ""Whereas now I think all those factors come to play and now it's exactly the right time to do this.""","EasyJet founder Stelios Haji-Ioannou has joined forces with Lonhro to launch Fastjet .

"(CNN) -- Hundreds of flights to and from eastern China were canceled or delayed Monday and state media warned that more disruptions should be expected in the next few weeks. Around 200 flights were canceled at Shanghai's two airports -- Pudong and Hongqiao -- which are among the country's busiest airline hubs. Another 120 flights were delayed for more than two hours. Flights departing from other eastern Chinese cities' airports, including Nanjing and Hangzhou, were also affected. Officials and airlines have shed little light on the reasons for the disruptions. Local officials cited ""air traffic restrictions"" while Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines said ""the airspace was occupied,"" according to the Shanghai Daily newspaper. Neither source has elaborated on their comments. ""Among situations for air traffic restrictions being imposed are when military maneuvers are taking place,"" the newspaper added. CCTV, the state television channel, shared on its Weibo account -- China's equivalent of Twitter -- a widely circulated memo, originally published on a Chinese flight crew blog, that said the civil aviation authority has requested airlines to reduce flights by 25% in eastern China. 12 airports affected . ""The following 12 airports will experience massive delays for 26 days! Fliers, bring snacks and water!"" the CCTV post said. ""From July 20 to August 15, operations of these airports -- including Shanghai Hongqiao, Shanghai Pudong, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Hefei, Jinan, Wuxi, Ningbo, Qingdao, Lianyungang, Zhengzhou and Wuhan -- will be affected by high-frequency exercises conducted by another party. All airlines are requested to reduce flights by 25% and fliers are expected to face delays."" Officials at the Civil Aviation Administration of China declined to comment when approached by CNN. This is the second large-scale air traffic disruption in China in the last two weeks. More than 100 flights were canceled or delayed on July 14 in Shanghai. Two Internet users have been held by police for allegedly fabricating and circulating ""anti-corruption-related"" claims, according to Hong Kong newspaper South China Morning Post. The Internet users claimed the disruption was due to the arrest of a high-ranking government official trying to flee the country. Another 37 people were reprimanded in the crackdown against Internet ""rumor mongers,"" according to SCMP. China's air traffic woes continue . Lengthy flight delays are common in China. The country's largest airports, serving the mega-cities of Shanghai and Beijing, suffer some of the worst flight delays in the world. In June 2013, Beijing's Capital International Airport hit the bottom of a list of the world's most delayed airports, according to U.S.-based air travel information service FlightStats. Just 18.3% of flights from the airport left on time during that month and around 42% of flights suffered delays of 45 minutes or longer. Second worst on the list was Shanghai's Hongqiao, where just 24% of flights departed on time. Overly cautious air traffic control and airspace restrictions for civilian aircraft are two of the reasons for these delays, but flights are also affected by thick smog and once, an unidentified flying object (UFO). Maggie Hiufu Wong and Steven Jiang contributed to this report.","Authorities shed little light on why hundreds of flights were canceled or delayed yesterday in China .

"New York (CNN) -- Thousands of protesters rallied Saturday on a New York street where Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, died after a white police officer put him in a chokehold, sparking national outrage just weeks before Michael Brown was shot to death by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The two cases thrust into the forefront the issues of law enforcement's use of deadly or life-threatening force and police relations with the communities they are sworn to serve. On Saturday, as former classmates at the Normandy High School football game in Ferguson held a moment of silence for Brown and the local NAACP led a march calling for justice, demonstrators gathered more than 900 miles away on the Staten Island street where Garner died. The ""We Will Not Go Back March"" was led by the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network, whose members also participated in demonstrations in Ferguson. At times, the Missouri protests erupted into looting and clashes with law enforcement officers. Organizers said thousands participated in the New York march and rally -- during which no arrests were reported. ""I have seven grandsons,"" said a marcher who identified herself only as Diane and said Eric Garner was her friend and neighbor. ""I don't want what happened to Eric and Michael Brown to happen to them."" The march started on the street where the 43-year-old, 350-pound Garner crumbled after being placed in a chokehold during a confrontation with the police for allegedly selling cigarettes illegally. It proceeded to the office of the county district attorney, where a grand jury is to consider evidence in the death. ""We are here looking for justice,"" Staten Island resident Kim Jenkins said. Demonstrators carried signs with messages such as ""Justice for Eric Garner,"" ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Hold Killer Cops Accountable."" Speakers cited a litany of names of men and woman who died at the hands of police throughout the country. The marchers included members of New York labor unions and local politicians. Kadiatou Diallo recalled the day her unarmed 22-year-old son Amadou who was killed in February 1999 in a hail of 41 bullets fired by four police officers in the Bronx. He was struck 19 times. Before the rally, she met relatives of Eric Garner, including his wife. ""It is not a black and white,"" Diallo told the crowd. ""We are not against the police, the NYPD or the police nationwide. It is about wrong. ... We have to stop this. Too many tears. Too many victims."" Former New York Gov. David Paterson told demonstrators: ""We will not stop until somebody goes to jail."" During his fatal police encounter, Garner raised both hands in the air and told the officers not to touch him. Seconds later, a video shows an officer behind him grab him in a chokehold and pull him to the sidewalk, rolling him onto his stomach. ""I can't breathe! I can't breathe!"" Garner said repeatedly, his cries muffled into the pavement. The cause of Garner's death was ""compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police,"" said Julie Bolcer, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office. The death was ruled a homicide. Acute and chronic bronchial asthma, obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease were listed as contributing factors in a controversial death that fueled anti-police demonstrations and calls for a federal charges against the officer. The video showed Garner lying on the ground motionless after he was taken down. An asthmatic and father of six, Garner was later declared dead at a nearby hospital. Officer Daniel Pantaleo, who is seen on the video choking Garner, was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation, the New York Police Department said. A second police officer was placed on desk duty. The chokehold is prohibited by the NYPD. Two EMTs and two paramedics also were suspended without pay, according to Erika Hellstrom, vice president of development at Richmond University Medical Center. Police Commissioner William Bratton ordered an extensive review of the NYPD's training procedures after Garner's death. The U.S. Justice Department has said it is monitoring the investigation. If local prosecutors decline to file criminal charges, the department could conduct an investigation into whether the victim's civil rights were violated.

"(CNN) -- First birthdays are often a big deal. And when you're a giant panda cub -- such as Bao Bao, at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington -- they are even bigger. The adorable 44 -pound cub celebrated turning 1 on Saturday with a special frozen cake and cheers from her fans. The cake, made by the zoo's nutrition department, contained Bao Bao's favorite fruits, including apples and pears, packed in ice. It was decorated with flower-shaped ornaments carved from carrots and sweet potatoes and topped off with a large number ""1."" Bao Bao, whose name means ""precious"" and is one of 42 surviving cubs born last year in human care, approached the ice cake with suspicion, but in no time licked it with apparent delight. A representative from the Chinese embassy was on hand, while the panda's fans were encouraged to tweet birthday wishes using #BaoBaobday. According to the zoo, Bao Bao was born after a precisely-timed artificial insemination performed by the panda team in Washington and scientists from the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong, Sichuan Province. Bao Bao's parents were born at the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda. They were later loaned to the National Zoo through an agreement with the China Wildlife Conservation Association. As to their little girl, she won't celebrate many more birthdays in the United States. After she turns 4, Bao Bao will go to China to enter the breeding program there for giant pandas.","Bao Bao is a giant panda cub at at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington .

"Editor's note: Penn Jillette -- the larger, louder half of Penn & Teller -- is a magician, comedian, actor, author and producer. Penn Jillette says counterintuitive actions sometimes work -- and other times fail spectacularly. (CNN) -- Counterintuitive action makes a fellow feel smart. When I first got my driver's license, I took my old Ford Falcon into the Greenfield Public High School parking lot when it was freshly covered with fresh powder on top of wet slippery Western Massachusetts snow and ice. I turned fast, gunned it and lost control of the car in a skid. I turned into the skid and instantly gained control of my car. Telling someone to turn into a skid, that's crazy talk. It seems so wrong, but my Dad knew it worked. Dad suggested I do it over and over in the parking lot, so I would conquer my intuition to be ready when a real emergency arose on a real road. Counterintuitive actions prove we can trust real knowledge and do the opposite of what we feel makes sense. I'm a fire-eater. There is some technique to fire-eating, but most of the practice goes into learning that one's mouth is wet enough, most of the heat goes up enough, and cutting the oxygen leg off the fire triangle (it's now a fire tetrahedron, but I learned fire-eating a long time ago) with one's mouth really does put the fire out. It took watching a professional whom I trusted do it -- a lot of trust and a lot of practice -- before my first reaction, when my mouth started to burn from the lit torch in my mouth, was to put the torch deeper in my mouth, close my mouth around the torch and put it out. Handling fire seems like a superpower. There are whole seminars and self-help jive centered on fire-walking, which is hustled as ""mind over matter,"" or ""empowerment"" but is really just counterintuitive physics. As long as the fire walk is set up right and you keep moving, you can even hope and pray to be burned, while yelling counter-self-help slogans such as ""I do not have any power to do this"" and ""universe, please burn my little piggies,"" and you'll be fine. Whether it's fire walking or knowing that the Earth is round, everyone seems to dig counterintuitive thinking. Many dig it when our president explains we're going to spend our way out of debt. That's way against all the intuition we've developed in our adult lives. Spending our way out of debt doesn't work often, does it? It's crazy talk. Didn't a lot of people try that spending out of debt thing? I live in Vegas, and I see people by the side of the road with cardboard signs who seem like they might have tried that spending their way out of debt thing. Or maybe they tried the all too intuitive ""crack will make me feel healthy again"" thing. I don't know. Didn't lots of people try piling up debt on credit cards and buying houses they couldn't afford in hopes of solving all their financial problems? I've tried spending more than I was going to earn (remember, I was carny trash, that's why I know how to eat fire), and it way didn't work. Spending more money than I had to spend put me more in debt, just like my silly intuition warned me. President Obama is so damn smart. He just drips smart. He clearly understands stuff that we could never understand. He's trustworthy. If Obama were teaching fire-eating, we would all learn fast. If he told you that the burns would be minor and the fire would go out when you closed your mouth, you'd believe him. If I weren't twice his weight, I'd fall back with my eyes closed into his caring arms in one of those cheesy '70s church trust exercises. He could talk me into anything. Obama tells us that we can spend our way out of debt. He tells us that even though the government had control over the banks and did nothing to stop the bad that's going on, if we give them more control over more other bank-like things, then they can make sure bad stuff doesn't happen ever again. He says we can get out of all those big wars President Bush caused by sending more troops into Afghanistan. And I don't know. I really don't know. I trusted my Dad that turning into a skid would work. I trusted my carny mentor, Doc Swan, that closing my mouth around a burning torch would put it out. They were right. Maybe the United States borrowing more money than I could imagine in a billion years with a billion computers and a billion monkeys typing on them, will get us out of financial trouble. I really don't know. It's certainly true that many counterintuitive things are true, and when you have the guts to do something counterintuitive that works, it's really cool. It's a superpower under our yellow sun. But there are some things that are just intuitive. Did you know, that if you're going 100 mph, directly at a very, very thick, reinforced concrete wall, and you speed up, so you're accelerating right when you hit the wall that the accident you have is going to be much worse than if you'd jammed on the brakes as soon as you saw the wall at the end of the street? Did you know that? It's exactly what everything you know and feel would tell you, and it's exactly true. Most times when you're driving, or playing with fire, or handling money, the thing that makes sense to you is also true. I way hope we're turning into a skid and not accelerating into a concrete wall. Note: Reading this article does not give you the information you need to really eat fire, fire walk or even turn into a skid. Do not try any of it. You really need a trained professional to teach you, and most important you need to sign something that says Penn Jillette and CNN are not in any way responsible for your inevitable injuries. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Penn Jillette.","Penn Jillette: If you're on ice, turning into a skid can help avoid a crash .

"(CNN) -- Bon Temps is out of time. Of course, in many ways, the strange Louisiana hamlet of HBO's ""True Blood"" has been for ages. It's an old, ghostly community removed from nearby Shreveport by murky woods and two-lane blacktop, a world away from more earthly concerns. (HBO, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) But now it's really out of time. The seventh and final season of the vampire drama begins Sunday night. ""True Blood"" started with the conceit that vampires already lived among us, but they'd kept their existence secret until a product called TruBlood -- an artificial plasma -- allowed them to ""come out of the coffin."" Waitress Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin), a telepath, falls in love with vampire Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), and suddenly humans and vampires find out a lot more about each other. Creator Alan Ball was attracted to the material, based on Charlaine Harris' series of novels, because of the issues that could be explored through the different types of beings. ""The books are so rich, and (Harris) opens so many doors,"" he told CNN in 2008, just prior to the show's premiere. ""If it's just a story device with fangs, I'm not that interested."" He turned over the production reins after the fifth season. Mark Hudis handled a chunk of season six and then was replaced by Brian Buckner. Over the years, the show grew incredibly complex. Shape-shifters, werewolves and other supernatural visitors showed up in Bon Temps. The series branched out to peripheral characters who appeared and disappeared with little explanation. The community divided into factions pitting the undead against the humans -- and against one another. The sex was graphic; so was the violence. Now that the show's conclusion beckons, here are a few items to watch for: . 1. Concentration. Buckner told TV Guide that a lot of story branches have been sawed off. ""The hope is ... that by putting all of our characters essentially into one story, now it's Bon Temps vs. the world, the characters people love will get more screen time because these stories don't have separate demands,"" he said. ""We just get to tell a simpler story and then experience them through our characters."" 2. The future of Hepatitis V. The virus that infected TruBlood -- and got into the vampires' systems -- had no cure at the end of season six. Will a solution be found, or will it devastate the community? Vampires want more blood -- or they'll die. That can't be good for anybody. 3. Don't mess with Bill -- or Eric. Compton's transformation into Billith took off in the sixth season -- but where do you go after you partake of the vampire god's blood? In Compton's case, you lose much of your power. On the other hand, he could use a little more compassion. As for Eric Northman (Alexander Skarsgard), the old vampire sheriff may not be completely dead, Buckner said. ""We've obviously promised a 'Where is Eric?' story and it would feel incredibly cheap to deliver the goods right away,"" he told TV Guide. ""We sent Pam (Kristin Bauer van Straten) off in search of him and if she were to find him right away, we would be doing a disservice to ourselves and to the audience."" But will he appear nude again? Skarsgard doesn't mind. ""He's Swedish,"" Buckner told TV Guide. ""There was no discussion whatsoever."" 4. The coming of war. Louisiana's now very ex-governor, Truman Burrell (Arliss Howard), was no friend to the vampires. (In fact, you might say he lost his head over the situation.) But the anger he felt is shared by many fearful humans. There are many who would just as soon see the vampires return to the underground -- or be vanquished completely. 5. The role of Sam. Bar owner Sam Merlotte (Sam Trammell) may have given up his restaurant, but he's now mayor of Bon Temps -- and he's making a play for Sookie, too. Author Harris paired the two in a book, and it didn't go over well with fans, but on TV the story could be different. Either way, in real life Paquin is still firmly paired up with Moyer -- they've been married for nearly four years.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday granted a request to delay enforcement of an appeals court ruling that overturned Virginia's same-sex marriage ban. That means gay and lesbian couples cannot legally wed in the state for now. The Richmond-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit last month struck down Virginia's voter-approved ban, following what other state and federal judges have done in the past year when finding such laws to be unconstitutional. The high court in coming weeks or months will announce whether it will have the final word, and accept pending petitions from one or more various states, including Virginia, to review their bans on same-sex marriage. A binding ruling from the justices on the constitutional issues would be one of the most contentious and closely watched from the Supreme Court in recent years, and could apply to all 31 current states that forbid same-sex marriage. Judges hear four states defend same-sex marriage bans . Virginia's situation was somewhat unique since the state's governor and attorney general have refused to defend the ban in court. That left the court clerk in Prince William County-- a suburb of Washington -- to ask the high court for temporary legal relief. Lawyers for the clerk applauded the Supreme Court's intervention. ""Virginians deserve an orderly and fair resolution to the question of whether they will remain free to preserve marriage as the union of a man and a woman in their laws,"" said Byron Babione, senior counsel of the Alliance Defending Freedom. ""The Supreme Court acted wisely in restraining the lower court from implementing a ruling of this magnitude before the high court has a chance to decide the issue."" But Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring also supported postponing any same-sex marriages until the issue is fully settled. ""Although it is painful to keep Virginia's same-sex couples and their children waiting any longer to enjoy the rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment, the rule of law requires that this court be afforded the time needed to settle the question,"" said Herring. The appeals ruling covered marriage laws in those states within the court's jurisdiction: Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Only Maryland has legalized same-sex marriage. The divided three-judge panel had concluded that same-sex marriage ""makes some people deeply uncomfortable. However, inertia and apprehension are not legitimate bases for denying same-sex couples due process and equal protection of the laws."" Gay rights groups urged swift action from the justices. ""This Supreme Court's stay of yet another freedom to marry ruling underscores the urgency of the court's granting a full review and bringing the country to national resolution by next year,"" said Evan Wolfson, president of Freedom to Marry. ""It is time for the Supreme Court to affirm what more than thirty courts have held in the past year: marriage discrimination violates the Constitution, harms families, and is unworthy of America."" The Virginia prohibition has effectively been in place since Colonial days, but only incorporated into the state's constitution in 2006. Elton John: Jesus would support same-sex marriage . The appeals decision continued a near-unbroken string of state and federal court victories nationwide in the past year, giving marriage-equality supporters unbridled encouragement that their ultimate goal will be achieved: striking all laws limiting the rights of homosexuals to wed. The issue has been moving swiftly in the judicial front. A federal appeals court on August 6 heard arguments in same-sex marriage bans in four states: Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, and Tennessee. A ruling is due by year's end. A separate appeals court early next month will hear two other Western states defend current prohibitions: Idaho and Nevada. , and Oregon. Same-sex marriage is legal in 19 U.S states plus the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington state. The challenge to Virginia's ban was brought by several plaintiffs, including Timothy Bostic and Tony London of Norfolk.","Supreme Court stays enforcement of decision overturning Virginia gay marriage ban .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Beverly Hills police want Justin Bieber to ""take the bull by the horns"" and tone down his house parties. Neighbors called police several times over the weekend to complain about the noise coming from the young singer's condo, a police spokesman said Tuesday. Bieber hasn't been charged with disturbing the peace because officers did not witness excessive noise, but residents could make a citizen's arrest, Sgt. Max Subin said. ""If they want to pursue that and we feel it's proper to accept it, it would be evaluated,"" he said. Justin Bieber pleads no contest in egging case, gets probation . Bieber moved into a Beverly Hills condo this summer after selling the Calabasas, California, mansion where he notoriously clashed with neighbors.

"Gaza City (CNN) -- The Israeli military launched a ground operation into Gaza late Thursday and called an extra 18,000 reservists into the conflict with Hamas. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon ordered the ground action to destroy tunnels from Gaza into Israeli territory, according to a statement from Netanyahu's media adviser. Thirteen Hamas militants used a tunnel earlier Thursday to launch an attempted attack in Sufa, near an Israeli kibbutz, but were stopped by Israeli soldiers, the Israel Defense Forces reported. CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Mark Regev, Netanyahu's spokesman, whether Israel planned to occupy Gaza for a long time. Regev didn't answer directly, but said Israel's goals are to ""diminish"" the Hamas military force and to show Hamas it cannot attack Israel with impunity. ""We have hit Hamas hard, and we will continue to hit Hamas hard,"" the Israel Defense Forces tweeted. Hamas immediately condemned the Israeli operation. Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum told CNN that ""the beginning of the Israeli ground invasion of Gaza is a dangerous step with unknown consequences. Israel will pay a heavy price for it."" Later, appearing on Aqsa TV, Barhoum said, ""the resistance will confront the Israeli ground invasion and will defend the people of Gaza."" He said Hamas military forces are ""far stronger"" than in 2009 and 2012, when Hamas and Israel clashed. Militants are prepared to capture Israel soldiers and use them to trade for some of 5,000 prisoners in Israeli jails, Barhoum said. CNN's Palestinian security sources said Israeli tanks have reached Abu Holeh and that Israeli troops are clashing with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters along the Kissufim road. Abu Holeh is about in the center of Gaza, said CNN reporter Ben Wedeman. If Israeli forces go from there to the sea they can split Gaza as they did during the 2009 ground operation, Wedeman said. Wedeman said Israeli forces struck near a mosque in Gaza City's Zaitoun neighborhood, which has been pounded since start of bombing, with many casualties reported. Gaza hospital struck . Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, said Israeli bombs hit Wafa Hospital in Gaza while four patients were inside. Seventeen others had evacuated, he said. The long-awaited ground operation follows one of the worst nights of fighting since the war began. That fighting began after a temporary cease-fire ended earlier in the day. The Gaza Health Ministry said seven children were killed in three hours on Thursday. Before the incursion, the IDF dropped leaflets in 14 areas of Gaza, urging residents to temporarily leave their homes. CNN reporter Ian Lee described the action: ""Periodic fire balls illuminate the sky over Gaza. We see rockets screech toward the sky. Minutes later we see an intercepting missile rise from the iron dome, reducing the rocket into confetti of light and fire. ""We've seen red tracer rounds fly across the horizon. The repetitive thud of naval guns echoes throughout the coastal strip."" A 4-year-old girl was killed in an Israeli airstrike near the customs building in Khan Younis, Palestinian medical and security sources said, and another airstrike killed a 29-year-old man east of Khan Younis. Aqsa TV reported that an Israeli was killed and another injured in shelling of Ashkelon and that seven Israeli soldiers were injured in an attack on a military location. Aqsa TV also reported that Israeli gunboats near Beit Lahiya north of Gaza strip, fired at the homes of residents. Palestinian medical and security sources say 246 people have been killed in Gaza and more than 1,850 injured. Israel says one of its citizens has died. Cairo talks . The region has many depressing precedents when it comes to violence. In recent decades, Palestinians launched two armed uprisings against Israel, known as Intifadas, that each went on for years. In late 2008 and early 2009, Israel carried out airstrikes and then a ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians. In November 2012, the two sides fought a bloody eight-day conflict that ended in a cease-fire. Egypt, which as been trying to broker a cease-fire, said Thursday, ""If Hamas had accepted the truce Palestinian lives could have been saved."" Earlier, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Arab League Secretary-General Nabil Al-Arabi held talks in Cairo aimed at reaching a cease-fire agreement. An Israeli delegation also attended, leaving after several hours, the state-run al-Ahram news agency reported. ""I expect that we will reach an agreement very soon; the efforts of a cease-fire is to stop the bloodshed, killing and destruction in Gaza,"" said Nabil Shaath, an Abbas adviser and member of the central committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization. He said negotiators were focusing on stopping bloodshed above all else. He said they would later discuss Hamas demands, including opening Gaza border crossings and freeing prisoners whose exit from jail was negotiated in exchange for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. ""These are all legitimate demands by Hamas, but the priority is for an immediate cease-fire,"" Shaath said. Hamas leaders had rejected an earlier Egyptian cease-fire proposal, saying they had not been consulted on the deal and complaining that it did not address their broader demands. Egypt is playing a large role in the talks despite its distrust of Hamas. Like Israel, Egypt considers Hamas a terror organization because of the group's roots in the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt's military-led government banned after the country's 2013 coup. Temporary cease-fire . During Thursday's temporary cease-fire, Gaza banks opened for the first time in 10 days. Residents poured into the streets. Red Cross officials visited hospitals and damaged houses to assess medical needs, and worked with local officials to fix water pipelines. Some work was also done to repair power lines, the United Nations said. At least 10 to 15 trucks entered Gaza through the Karem Shalom border crossing once it opened at 1 p.m. (6 a.m. ET), according to Ra'ed Fatooh, the Palestinian official in charge of the crossing in Gaza. Goods were limited to medical supplies and basic foodstuffs such as rice, sugar, oil, canned food, flour and other basic goods, he said. Gaza crisis: Who's who in Hamas . Deaths on Gaza beach . Fallout continued from the deaths the day before of four cousins ages 9 to 11 who died in an Israeli military strike on a Gaza beach. The results of a preliminary investigation suggests the deaths were the result of a ""a tragic misidentification of the target,"" Regev told CNN. ""We didn't want to kill those four boys. That was not our intention,"" Regev said. ""I'd even say the opposite is true. Had we known that that missile was aimed at four young men like that we would have not sent the missile."" A Hamas official called the killings a ""war crime."" ""Those children were not firing rockets, they were just playing,"" Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zhuri told reporters Wednesday. Regev, however, said a legitimate Hamas target was nearby, highlighting what he called a ""complex combat environment"" in crowded Gaza City and surrounding areas. Israeli officials say militants often use mosques, schools and other crowded places to hide rockets and other weapons. Israeli military's 'knock on roof' warnings criticized by rights groups . War-scarred Gaza medical crews also in harm's way . Opinion: A smart way out of the Gaza confrontation . CNN's Ben Wedeman reported from Gaza City, and CNN's Ralph Ellis and Michael Pearson reported and wrote from Atlanta. CNN's Ali Younes, Jethro Mullen, Samira Abdelaziz, Kareem Khadder, Tim Lister, Ian Lee, Diana Magnay, Samira Said, Michael Schwartz, Salma Abdelaziz and Tal Heinrich also contributed to this report.","IDF: ""We have hit Hamas hard, and we will continue to hit Hamas hard""

"(The Frisky) -- Over the weekend, while dining with George Clooney in Italy, Elisabetta Canalis waved her hand in the air, showing off a bauble on her ring finger. Fellow diners, and naturally the paparazzi, thought the item on her finger was an engagement ring. Which made everyone assume that George had popped the question. But George's rep says that is not the case-and that it was a napkin ring Elisabetta had put on her finger as a joke. Hilarious? So was this a joke or is Clooney's camp trying to cover for him? It's hard to say, but several other celebrities have claimed engagement rumors were sparked by misunderstandings. And let's just say that a few of them walked down the aisle in secret shortly thereafter. The Frisky: Oops! 11 celebs with super-short marriages . A ""swell"" proposal Back in March, Miranda Kerr was spotted with some bling on her ring finger. But she swore she and Orlando weren't engaged. ""No, we're not engaged. You can't always believe everything you read,"" she said to the press. ""We were in Cannes at the film festival and it was so hot that my fingers were swelling. I was wearing it on that finger because that's the only one it would fit on. It was totally an innocent thing."" They got hitched in secret four months later. Just saying. The Frisky: 5 celeb siblings with really weird careers . A token from Tyra's past Last summer, rumors spread that Tyra Banks was wearing a diamond on her ring finger, and that she was engaged to her long-time beau, John Utendahl. But her spokesperson said that wasn't the case. ""Tyra is not engaged-it's her high school ring and she wears it almost every day."" The two have yet to tie the knot, so maybe the ring really does say ""Class of 1993."" The Frisky: Angelina Jolie and 9 other stars who played Marilyn Monroe . ""Vaughniston"" denied, denied, denied In 2006, everyone was yapping that Vince Vaughn had proposed to Jennifer Aniston on a tropical vacation. Jen herself squashed the rumors. ""I'm not engaged and I don't have a ring and I haven't been proposed to. Normally we don't even acknowledge these things because they're endless, at this point. The thing that got me was that I was getting phone calls from Greece! My Aunt Mary in Greece is getting accused of lying! ... Okay, so you're on a romantic location. You've got the beach, you've got the sunset, but no, no, you're going to wait for an airplane ride?"" She has a point. This one obviously never panned out. ScarJo spotted scouting dresses In February 2008, Scarlett Johansson was spotted stopping by Monique Lhuiller's bridal shop in L.A. with her sister and mom. Which naturally sparked rumors that she was planning a wedding with Ryan Reynolds. Her rep was quick to deny the story, saying, ""A family member is getting married, not [Scarlett]. She is not engaged."" Less than a year later, she and Ryan married in a secret ceremony in Canada. Katy Perry and 7 other celebs who have crashed prom . A rocker's promise Last month, Bret Michaels' on-again, off-again girlfriend was spotted wearing a ring. Bret went out of his way to explain that they aren't rushing to the altar. ""No. We are not engaged yet. It's a work in progress,"" he said. ""What happened is she has a beautiful promise ring. A promise ring, a friendship ring with benefits. So, it's-that's what we call it."" I believe him just because I can hear the fear of commitment in his voice. Model's ring is from a ""friend"" Bar Rafaeli was caught wearing an engagement ring a few months back. She said, ""No, there wasn't [a proposal].

"Washington (CNN) -- A strong earthquake in Virginia shut down a nearby nuclear power plant Tuesday afternoon and sent out seismic waves felt by millions from Georgia to northern New England. Three aftershocks were reported by Tuesday evening. No major injuries or extensive damage were reported after the 5.8-magnitude earthquake, which struck about 40 miles northwest of Richmond. The quake prompted evacuations of office buildings and the precautionary closing of monuments in the nation's capital. A surge in calls by cell-phone users after the event affected service in many areas, federal officials said. Aftershocks of magnitude 2.8 and 2.2 were recorded later in the afternoon, followed by one of 4.2 just after 8 p.m. ET, officials said. More aftershocks are possible in the coming weeks. ""It's one of the largest that we've had there,"" U.S. Geological Survey seismologist Lucy Jones said of the quake. Most federal buildings in Washington had reopened by late Tuesday afternoon, but officials were taking all precautions before giving the all-clear to some of its most iconic structures. The U.S. Capitol was cleared for employees to come back to get their belongings, but inspectors asked people to limit their time inside the building while engineers continue to work around the complex. A helicopter inspected the Washington Monument, and it was found to be structurally sound, the National Park Service said. But a secondary inspection revealed cracking in the stones at the top of the monument. Structural engineers on Wednesday will determine the best way to repair the monument before it is reopened, the agency said. The grounds have been reopened except for an area about 100 feet outside the plaza. U.S. Park Police spokesman David Schlosser said to his eye, the monument was ""clearly not leaning. It's standing tall and proud."" The Lincoln and Jefferson memorials reopened Tuesday evening. Witnesses reported a number of buildings were evacuated as far away as North Carolina and New York, where a 5.8 earthquake struck in 1944. The quake, which was recorded at 1:51 p.m., was shallow -- just 3.7 miles deep -- and located 88 miles southwest of Washington near the town of Mineral, Virginia. The magnitude was initially reported as 5.8, then revised to 5.9, and then revised again back to 5.8. With so many on the East Coast unaccustomed to earthquakes, many people were left wondering whether all that rumbling could have been caused by a truck, helicopter, an explosion or some other force. Kate Duddy was in an office building elevator in Manhattan, alone, when the shaking started. ""I have never felt a quake before. It was scary having no idea what the cause was,"" she said. ""I felt the vibrations and the elevator stopped for a period of about five minutes."" The earthquake triggered the automatic shutdown of a nuclear power plant less than 20 miles from the epicenter after it lost electricity. The quake signaled ""unusual events"" at 12 other nuclear facilities across the East Coast and Michigan, U.S. authorities reported. Dominion Virginia Power said both reactors at its North Anna plant shut down after the first tremors. Reidelbach said the plant vented steam, but there was no release of radioactive material. Dan Stoddard, senior vice president of nuclear operations for Dominion, said there was no damage to the spent fuel pool. Officials were restoring full power to the site, which was operating on diesel generators. Stoddard said that might happen by late Tuesday, but that was before the evening aftershock. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission was monitoring the plant. Relatively minor damage was reported in a few Virginia counties, including Louisa, nearest to the epicenter. Several school buildings had damage, as did town hall buildings, Louisa County spokeswoman Amanda Reidelbach told CNN. An unspecified number of minor injuries were reported in the county. Desi Fleming, a resident of Mineral in Louisa County, said the quake arrived with a rumbling ""that sounded like a train coming to a stop."" It knocked down two chimneys on the converted 1900-vintage home that now houses her parcel-shipping business. Tuesday's incident occurred in a known seismic zone in central Virginia, said Dave Russ of the U.S. Geological Survey. But the strength of the earthquake was a bit surprising. A 5.9 event occurred in 1897 near Blacksburg, he said. At Washington's National Cathedral, spokesman Richard Weinberg said three 5- to 8-foot pinnacles had broken from the central tower. He said stone masons and engineers would assess the damage, which also included other pieces that broke and fell on the surrounding lawn. The building was evacuated and closed to the public. Wayne Clough, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, said the national museum's landmark castle on the Mall had cracks in interior walls. There was no immediate indication of structural damage, but the 150-year-old building will need closer examination, he said. ""You want to do an inspection to be sure about that,"" Clough said. Clough, who's also an earthquake engineer, said the geography of the Eastern Seaboard helped transmit the shock from the Carolinas to New England. The underlying bedrock is largely a solid sheet, ""so you get a lot more travel out of earthquake waves than you would in California,"" he said. Those waves extended to downtown New York, where court buildings were evacuated. ""I was trying to figure out what was going on, like everyone else,"" said Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, who said he had been through many earthquakes when he lived in California. Mayor Michael Bloomberg said at an afternoon news conference that the earthquake was felt ""across the five boroughs"" of the city, but there were no reports of injuries and ""virtually no reports of damage."" The quake was also reported to have been felt on the island of Martha's Vineyard, where President Barack Obama was playing golf. He did not feel the earthquake, according to the White House. The earthquake slowed but didn't halt major transportation services. Service at major airports throughout the region was disrupted, but all were reported to have resumed normal operations about 75 minutes after the earthquake struck. At John F. Kennedy International Airport and Newark-Liberty International Airport, control towers were evacuated, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said. Amtrak on Tuesday evening said service between Washington and Baltimore had returned to normal speeds following inspections. In Spotsylvania, Virginia, Tish Walker said she was spooked and staying outside for the moment. ""I used to live in California, so I know shaking and this felt big,"" she said. ""I grabbed my dog and raced outside; my first thought is always that the furnace might explode or a cabinet crashes down on top of us."" CNN's Vito Maggiolo, Chris Lawrence, Susan Candiotti, Dan Lothian, Joe Sutton, Jim Acosta, Larry Shaughnessy, Matt Smith, Sarah Aarthun, Carol Cratty, Phil Gast, Brian Todd, Dana Ford, Catherine Shoichet and Tom Watkins contributed to this report.","NEW: Amtrak says service operating normally between Washington and Baltimore .

"(CNN) -- Willie Nelson is the latest act to cancel a concert at Orlando's SeaWorld in the wake of CNN's ""Blackfish"" documentary. The legendary country singer's decision comes after the Canadian rock band Barenaked Ladies pulled the plug on their show at the Florida theme park. As with the Barenaked Ladies decision, Nelson's cancellation may have been a response to an online petition started by fans on Change.org. ""As a fan who respects his activism for animals, the environment, and other good causes, I find this very disappointing,"" Danielle Legg of Amherst, New York, wrote in her petition. ""If you've seen the documentary Blackfish, you know why it's so surprising. Please tell Willie Nelson you do not want him to support SeaWorld's animal cruelty."" The petition gathered 9,000 signatures. SeaWorld spokesman Nick Gollattscheck confirmed Nelson's decision not to sing at SeaWorld, but he cited reasons other than the documentary and petition. ""Due to scheduling conflicts, Willie Nelson will not be appearing at SeaWorld Orlando's Bands, Brew & BBQ event in 2014,"" Gollattscheck said in a statement e-mailed to CNN Thursday night. Nelson and his representatives did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. When the Barenaked Ladies nixed their plans to play at SeaWorld last week, they explained that it was a decision made after viewing ""Blackfish."" ""This is a complicated issue, and we don't claim to understand all of it, but we don't feel comfortable proceeding with the gig at this time,"" the band said on a Facebook post. ""The Seaworld folks have been gracious, and extended us invitations to the park to learn more about what they do, and how they do it."" SeaWorld responds to questions about captive orcas, 'Blackfish' film . A park spokesman told CNN that the Barenaked Ladies show had been taken off the theme park's concert schedule. The decision to cancel the band's performance came two days after drummer Tyler Stewart posted a tweet saying the group is ""looking at options"" after viewing the documentary. The documentary -- which first aired on CNN in October -- tells the story of the SeaWorld trainer who was killed in 2010 by an orca named Tilikum. Fans launched an online petition asking the Barenaked Ladies to cancel. The group had just announced it would perform at SeaWorld's Orlando park on February 15 during its ""Bands, Brew & BBQ"" events. Mike Garrett of St. Catharines, Ontario, posted the petition on Change.org asking band members to watch ""Blackfish"" and ""learn how SeaWorld and other captive display facilities such as Marineland in Niagara Falls have for decades exploited marine mammals solely for profit."" Garrett said he was ""disappointed"" when he heard the group was scheduled to play there ""in light of all the horrific information we're learning."" ""I'm hoping to grab the band's attention on this issue and ask them, on behalf of all their animal-loving fans, to reconsider performing there,"" Garrett wrote. His petition gained more than 9,200 signatures. It worked. ""We here at Barenaked Ladies have made a decision based on what we feel. It's not about money, or petitions, or press... But it is about our fans,"" the band said November 27. ""We listen to them, and they're important to us."" The park's website does not list Barenaked Ladies on the schedule. February 15 and four other weekend dates just say ""Coming Soon."" Acts that are still listed on the calendar include Cheap Trick, REO Speedwagon, Martina McBride, 38 Special, Justin Moore and Scotty McCreery.

"(CNN) -- All good things must come to an end. Or in the case of HBO's hit series, ""True Blood,"" all bad things must meet the true death. After seven dark and twisted seasons of the drama, based on Charlaine Harris' ""Southern Vampire Mysteries,"" fans of the show -- referred to as ""Trubies"" -- must say their final goodbyes to Sookie (Anna Paquin), Bill (Stephen Moyer), Eric (Alexander Skarsgård) and the rest of the supernatural creatures of Bon Temps this Sunday. While some fans have argued the show's quality has declined over the years, it doesn't mean people have stopped watching. Here are the storylines we're absolutely dying to have wrapped up in the final episode: . Will there be a true cure to Hep-V? Hepatitis-V, a disease that infects both humans and vampires and is lethal to the latter, has been the main plot point of season seven. At first, the disease caused bloodsuckers to lose their minds and eat humans at an alarming rate. Midway through the season it began to transform and just weakened the vampires until eventually they withered away. Yes, Sarah Newlin's blood contains the cure to Hep-V, but only a select few actually know this -- and Mr. Gus of the Yakonomo Corporation (Will Yun Lee) wants to keep it that way. Instead of releasing the real cure to the world, he has teamed up with Eric and Pam (Kristin Bauer van Straten) to synthesize a partial antidote. That way, infected vampires will need to take the medicine regularly without ever being fully cured. Smart business move, but no doubt morally corrupt. Newlin (Anna Camp) has spent the last few episodes held captive, but will she finally escape in the series finale? Or will Eric and Pam turn on Gus and release the cure to the world? Could this maker-progeny duo actually make an ethical decision that doesn't also benefit them financially? Only time will tell. But as tensions rise between Gus and Eric, fans can definitely expect a showdown. Especially now that Sookie is in Gus' crosshairs. And everyone knows when it comes to Sookie, Eric does not mess around. Will our favorite non-vampires find happiness? Characters such as Sam (Sam Trammell), Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis) and Arlene (Carrie Preston) may not have a thirst for blood, but they certainly find themselves in consistent danger. So who makes it out (emotionally) alive? Things are looking pretty good for resident shape-shifter Sam Merlotte. He hasn't been at the forefront of the action much this year, spending most of his time ignoring his mayoral duties in lieu of protecting his pregnant girlfriend, Nicole (Jurnee Smollett-Bell). He even agreed to her demand that they move to raise their unborn child in a safe place. Sam's gotten the short end of the stick throughout the series, so here's hoping he finally gets that happy ending he deserves. Lafayette has also suffered a lot of loss, but, like Sam, life is starting to turn around. Everyone's favorite cross-dressing fry cook might have even found love --with Jessica's boyfriend, James (Nathan Parsons). Lafayette is a fan favorite and the writers will most likely allow him to ride off into the sunset with this dreamy guitarist. Then there's Arlene. The fiery, redheaded waitress, now owner of Bellefleur's Bar and Grill, has suffered the loss of two men in her life: former fiancé Rene, who turned out to be a psychopathic murderer and was killed by Sookie; and war veteran Terry Bellefleur, who made her happy but was then killed by a hit man. Tough break. But through it all Arlene has been a survivor, always coming out on top. And it looks like she may find love once again -- this time with ancient vampire Keith (Riley Smith), who is absolutely smitten with her. But who wouldn't be? Will Jason actually be able to keep his pants on? For seven seasons, Jason (Ryan Kwanten) has been in trouble dozens of times, all because he is unable to control himself when it comes to members of the opposite sex -- including Amy (Lizzy Caplan), Sarah Newlin, Crystal (Lindsay Pulsipher), Jessica (Deborah Ann Woll) and Violet (Karolina Wydra). The relationships' ends have often been messy -- physically so. But now that Jessica and Hoyt (Jim Parrack) have finally rekindled their romance (rejoice!), this is the perfect time for Jason to re-evaluate his life choices. While most fans may cry at the thought of a celibate Jason Stackhouse, it may be for the greater good of Bon Temps that he keep his pants on for at least a little while. Of course, no one says he has to keep his shirt on for the finale. This is ""True Blood,"" after all. Who will meet the true death? Current ""True Blood"" show runner Brian Buckner, who replaced original creator Alan Ball, promised there would be game-changing deaths in the final season, and he wasn't kidding. Within the first minute of the opening episode, Tara Thornton (Rutina Wesley) was staked and killed by a Hep-V-infected vampire. The death happened off-screen, too -- talk about a cold exit. A few episodes later, Sookie's werewolf boyfriend, Alcide (Joe Manganiello), got the ax as well. He died while protecting Sookie, a common theme in the series. But ever since those deaths it has been unusually tame. Which prompts the question, who will bite it in the series finale? The obvious choice going in would be Bill Compton. Infected with the Hep-V virus (at an alarming rate due to Sookie's faerie blood), he refused to drink from Sarah Newlin and cure himself, stating that he had accepted his fate to die. He claims he is making this decision in an attempt to save Sookie from his own ""darkness."" Kind of seems like an anti-climactic way for his character to go out, though. Early predictions from fans had Eric Northman as a main contender to die -- and it seemed likely with him contracting the Hep-V virus early in the final season. But now that he's sampled from the fountain of Sarah Newlin, he is officially cured. Could this be a ploy to fool viewers into thinking he is safe? It seems rather fitting for his character to go out in a blaze of glory. And what about Sookie Stackhouse? Yes, she is the show's main character, but crazier things have happened. Besides, some would argue she is partially responsible for all of the terrible things to befall the town of Bon Temps, so maybe a death would be satisfying to some fans. Besides, no one has put themselves in more dangerous situations in the seven-season run than Sookie. That girl cannot keep herself out of trouble. Who will Sookie choose? ""True Blood"" began with a love story, and the question still lingers: Who will our heroine, Sookie Stackhouse, end up with? First there was Bill Compton, Sookie's primary love interest. They broke up occasionally, but Sookie always found her way back to him. (Possibly because actors Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer are married in real life.) Then there was Eric Northman. Fangirls everywhere squealed when they got together. But while their chemistry was magnetic, they spent more time against one another than actually coupled. There was also Warlow (Robert Kazinsky), because who wouldn't fall in love with a faerie vampire who is responsible for murdering your parents and hunting you over the years? And then the doomed relationship with Alcide, the gorgeous werewolf who never stood a chance. Based on this season, it appears Sookie will end up with Bill. They have spent the majority of the year rekindling their original romance. Sookie has made it very clear that all she wants is for Bill to live. But the idea of Bill still being alive at the end of this season is looking less and less likely. That would leave Eric, which would certainly please the fans. But if it only happens by default after Bill dies, does that cheapen their relationship? Here's a thought -- maybe Sookie should end up alone. It's almost unheard of in a vampire love story, but something that might need to happen for fans to finally respect her. Each season she has put herself in danger over her inability to stay away from particular men. Maybe she will finally make the right choice, pack up her bags, and leave Bon Temps for good. It would be a bold move and sure to anger many fans, but hey -- at least it would be a surprise. Goodbyes suck, but hopefully this one won't.

"Madrid (CNN) -- Spain's best-known judge, Baltasar Garzon, went on trial Tuesday in Madrid for the second time in two weeks, accused of abusing his judicial authority during his investigation of human rights abuses under the former dictatorship of Spain's Francisco Franco. A seven-judge panel at Spain's Supreme Court is hearing the case, a week after a different seven-judge panel at the same court conducted the first trial against Garzon, for allegedly abusing his judicial authority in a financial corruption case. Garzon, 56, was suspended from his post in 2010, pending these trials. If convicted, he would not go to jail but could lose his right permanently to be a judge in Spain. Many observers said the second trial is the most important against Garzon, who became known internationally in 1998 when he sought the extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who was in a London hospital. Garzon accused him of the murder of Spaniards in Chile and crimes of genocide. Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch said the trial against Garzon for his Franco investigation ""is the first time in a consolidated democracy"" and in the European Union that a judge ""is indicted for investigating human rights abuses."" ""Garzon is being tried for trying to apply in Spain the same principles he applied internationally. A democracy needs judges who aren't afraid,"" Brody told a news conference in Madrid on Monday, flanked by other international observers who are attending the trial. In both cases, state prosecutors have asked that all charges be dropped. But under Spanish law, a private prosecution is also allowed and it is the lawyers for these parties that are pressing the charges against Garzon. Last week's trial in the so-called Gurtel financial and political corruption case lasted three days and the seven-judge panel must now determine a verdict. In the case Tuesday involving the Franco regime, a small civil servants union called Manos Limpias, or Clean Hands, brought charges against Garzon, saying he ignored a 1977 amnesty law approved in Spanish parliament, two years after Franco's death. ""Parliament unanimously approved the amnesty law. Judge Baltasar Garzon takes a stance as if they're crazy. What does he think? That he's better than them?"" said Miguel Bernard, leader of Manos Limpias. Bernard denies critics' charges that his group is a tiny far-right front, but he told CNN he was proud to receive an honor just last month from the Francisco Franco Foundation. Garzon said in May 2010, at the time of his suspension from his post as investigating magistrate at the National Court, ""I face this calmly, with the tranquility of knowing that I am innocent of these charges."" Franco's military uprising in 1936 triggered the three-year Spanish Civil War. The war ended when Franco's forces emerged victorious over Republican and leftist fighters. Franco's dictatorship continued until his death in 1975. Mass graves from the regime are still being unearthed. Just outside the courtroom on Tuesday before the proceedings began, Garzon told CNN he is ""okay"" as he heads into this second trial. He talked with his lawyers and supporters, smiled broadly and appeared relaxed. Outside the courthouse, several hundred people demonstrated in favor of Garzon, a far larger crowd than at the start of last week's trial. Inside the ornate 18th-century Supreme Court building, various people, still looking for the remains of their relatives in mass graves from the Franco regime, filed into the courtroom, right next to Bernard of Manos Limpias. But the two opposing groups apparently did not recognize each other, and there were no apparent verbal exchanges. The trial opened with preliminary issues, in which Garzon's defense lawyer called for the case to be thrown out. Among the questions was whether a case like this could go forward when not the state prosecutor but only a private prosecution is bringing the charges. In the financial corruption case that Garzon was investigating, and which still has ongoing trials against defendants in various parts of Spain, Garzon ordered electronic surveillance against some defendants being held in jail, and some of their conversations were with their lawyers. These lawyers later filed charges against Garzon, saying he had overstepped his judicial authority in ordering the wiretaps on their conversations in prison and also violated their constitutional rights. During the trial, Garzon said his orders did not breach their attorney-client privilege and that the electronic surveillance was supported by prosecutors. It was done, Garzon said, on suspicion that the defendants in the corruption scandal were engaged in money laundering, even while they were in preventative prison. Lawyers for the financial corruption defendants called on the court to clearly delimit how far a judge could go in investigating alleged crimes. Garzon spent 22 years as an investigating magistrate at the National Court, which handles cases of terrorism and other delicate cases. He has investigated the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, the Basque terrorist group ETA, and drug traffickers. At times in the past, Garzon has been considered a darling of the Spanish right or the Spanish left, depending on the cases he was investigating. His critics say he is too flamboyant and grandstands in front of the cameras. Since his suspension in 2010, Garzon has been working as a legal adviser outside of Spain on human rights cases and judicial issues, including in Latin America. A third case against Garzon, for alleged judicial improprieties linked to his organization of some courses at New York University that had major Spanish corporations as sponsors, is still in the investigation phase and no trial date has been set. In that case as well, Spanish prosecutors have not pressed charges but a private prosecution has.","Spain's best-known judge is on trial for the second time in two weeks .

"(CNN) -- When I was launching Vogue China nine years ago, one of the key elements I was determined to introduce was a regular column dedicated to promoting and supporting Chinese design talents. We were the first fashion magazine to do this on a regular basis, but it was not easy. There really weren't many people whose designs could hold up alongside all the international brands we featured. Nowadays, we are overwhelmed with design talent, both from emerging independent designers and from domestic Chinese fashion brands, and very often, we wish we had more space to feature more of them. We started off lending a platform in the magazine for young local designers. But gradually, we started developing various initiatives beyond the magazine in order to promote their designs and widen their scope of influence. For example, the Vogue Talents Corner in collaboration with thecorner.com.cn in December 2011 and the CFDA x Vogue Fashion Fund, launched in 2012, which allows Chinese designers to gain first-hand insight into the business and retail side of fashion in the New York offices of leading companies like Theory and Michael Kors. Whilst we were mostly focusing on independent designers, gradually, I began noticing that many Chinese fashion brands were taking an increasingly international approach to the way they run their business. They had long been power players in the retail market here, but perhaps lacked the industry know-how of how to operate like an international fashion house, without samples, appropriate PR and a streamlined brand image. We started off by doing a feature on four major brands in our September 2011 issue and I was intrigued by the fascinating stories of their owners, who had all grown up in a society without fashion, but who were now relaying it to the masses with great commercial success. From then on, we have witnessed a growing maturity amongst these brands and their new season designs are often featured within the magazine. See who else has been on Talk Asia . More recently, we are so proud to see those such as Uma Wang, Masha Ma and Huishan Zhang thriving on the international stage, as they show on schedule at Milan, Paris and London fashion week. In terms of design style and business acumen, this new generation is possessed of incredible confidence and industry awareness, and are a lot less naïve than the earlier designers. Many of them were educated at design schools abroad, where they learnt to operate within the industry, both abroad and in China. Their success is also an example of the seismic shift which is happening in the Chinese consumer market as people are moving beyond the logo-ed products, with a preference for more rarefied but discreet things. In this process, they are turning more and more towards Chinese designers, who they feel offer products more tailored to Chinese tastes and aesthetics than some of the international brands. Compare the fashion choices of the first ladies of America and China . The growth of this market is witnessed by the rising number of buyer's boutiques who specialize in Chinese designers in Shanghai and Beijing, and increasingly spreading to other cities like Guangzhou, Chengdu and Changsha. I don't think the 'made in China' label defines Chinese designers today. Many designers split their design and production between overseas and China. This is a natural process borne out of financial, quality and logistical considerations. Maybe a certain Italian fabric suits their design better, or maybe in some cases Chinese craftsmanship is better. We live in a world which is getting smaller and smaller, and if for example, a German brand can produce in Italy without losing their identity, then I don't see how it is any different for Chinese designers. It is up to each designer to determine which production methods are best suited for them. Sexy, skintight, sophisticated: How the cheongsma has survived a century . Of course, these young designers, like young talents everywhere else in the world, are also facing many challenges. A major one is how to create a brand that is really unique and stands out among the countless other designers and brands that are crowding the markets around the world already. They have to answer the question of ""why does the world need another designer?"" not just for one season but consistently throughout years. The internet, whilst making some things easier, is also posing other challenges. A new idea does not remain new for long in this digital age. Execution, delivery and efficiency are just as important as novel ideas. Chinese designers need, like young designers all over the world, to learn to move beyond the derivative influence of previous designers and stand up for themselves. Despite these challenges, I have confidence that in this, as in everything else in China, change will come much faster than most people expect. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author, Angelica Cheung.","Angelica Cheung is editor-in-chief for Vogue China .

"(CNN) -- It was one of the worst genocides since the Nazi era. The brutal Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia in 1975 and terrorized the population for four years, killing more than one million people. One of its infamous leaders died Thursday, escaping judgment for war crimes at the hands of a U.N. tribunal. Ieng Sary passed away in the capital Phnom Penh at age 87, the United Nations-backed court for Cambodia said. He was the foreign minister under, and the brother-in-law-of, Khmer Rouge dictator Pol Pot. On Tuesday, he was hospitalized for stomach pains. The Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia -- the U.N.-backed court -- will establish the cause of death before releasing his body to his family. Ieng Sary's death leaves just two defendants facing judgment by the tribunal. His wife, Ieng Thirith, was excluded from the case after she was deemed unfit to stand trial in September 2012. But charges of torture and murder will continue against the remaining defendants -- former nominal head of state Khieu Samphan and former prime minister Nuon Chea. Proceedings halted . Following Ieng Sary's death, Amnesty International asked the court to continue with its proceedings without delay. ""The news of Ieng Sary's death will be difficult for the victims of the Khmer Rouge crimes who have waited so long for justice,"" said Rupert Abbott of the human rights group. The court has faced criticism that it has proceeded too slowly with the trial. The defendants are more than 77 years old, and more of them could die before facing judgment. On Tuesday, proceedings came to a grinding halt after local staffers walked out, saying they will not return until they are paid wages owed by the cash-strapped court for the last three months. A bloody period . Pol Pot came to power as a communist revolutionary after toppling the U.S. backed government in Phnom Penh, when American troops left the region in 1975 at the end of the Vietnam war. For the next four years, the communist Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot was blamed for the deaths of some 1.7 million people through torture, execution, hard labor and starvation. Pol Pot's rule became known as the era of the killing fields when cities were emptied and residents slaughtered. A Vietnamese invasion in 1979 forced the Khmer Rouge to retreat back to the jungle. The dictator died in 1998 before the tribunal's existence and never faced trial. Double jeopardy? The Vietnamese who invaded Cambodia quickly put Ieng Sary on trial and convicted him in absentia in 1979. When he defected from what remained of the broken Khmer Rouge regime in 1996, the Cambodian king pardoned him. The defense for Ieng Sary once argued that the case against him should be dismissed on grounds of double jeopardy -- a defendant cannot be tried twice for the same crime. The court considered the motion. CNN's Sara Sidner contributed to this report .","He escapes justice for alleged genocide .

"(CNN) -- What do you tell a worried parent when their concerns are confirmed, that their child has been diagnosed with a food allergy? I'm in this position regularly as I work with families who are receiving this often unexpected news for the first time. Unfortunately, food and skin allergies are becoming increasingly more common in American children, according to a recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. I'm also a parent who was on the receiving end of this food allergy diagnosis regarding my own child. Admittedly, it was difficult to hear. I had my fingers crossed as I braced and prepared for the news. Nonetheless, it was still a huge blow. Our allergist was particularly kind as he informed me that my child was allergic to both peanuts and tree nuts, reminding me, ""Mom, you are not to blame."" Of course I knew this, but it was helpful to be reminded that afternoon. You may even come to depend on your allergist as a friend. These food allergy evaluations are really a partnership, and more is involved in the diagnosis than doing a quick and easy test. Understanding the types of reactions your child has to certain foods, the timing of eating the food in relationship to these reactions, your child's personal history and the family history: all of these components are critical to helping develop a successful food allergy survival lifestyle. I also have personal experience with food allergies. A lifetime, actually. I was born severely allergic to fish. Three decades ago, when I was a young person, the outlook on food allergy within the community at large was vastly different than it is now. Food allergy and anaphylaxis were not recognized as a major public health concern; the education and advocacy that surrounds this issue today simply didn't exist. Instead, food allergies were considered vague and very mysterious, and hardly anyone was prepared for allergic reactions to foods. There were no safety guidelines in any restaurants, and many ignorantly thought that severely food allergic people were ""hysterical"" or that they simply didn't like a certain food. Epinephrine injectors were thought to be primarily used to treat bee stings. I made countless visits to emergency rooms, wondering if I would make it. No one thought to have me carry an auto-injector or rescue medication at all, and so each and every allergic reaction spiraled out of control. I was forever covered with itchy eczema patches. I developed wheezing. I almost died too many times to count. Because of my history, I was determined with my daughter's diagnosis to provide a ""normalized"" and non-panicked environment where the allergy doesn't define her and there is ample awareness and support. Here's what I do when a parent comes to me: First, I just listen. I take in their experience of challenges, the hurdles at school and at birthday parties, the scorn and disbelief from some, and ultimately their worst fears. Next, we take action: I remind parents that food allergies are a proven source of stress, and I'm completely honest that the early adjustment period can be extremely difficult. I reinforce, though, that what might seem like a huge amount of work in the beginning quickly becomes familiar and easier. Currently, there is no cure for food allergies, so early recognition and management of allergic reactions are important measures to prevent serious health consequences. Strict avoidance is by far the most effective means of surviving successfully with this medical condition. It's important for a parent to ensure that your household is allergy-safe for kids. Once a doctor has confirmed your child has a food allergy, you should immediately clear every item he or she can't eat from your pantry, refrigerator and freezer. It's also a good idea to thoroughly clean and sanitize your cooking utensils, oven, stovetop and cookware. Why? Keeping unsafe items out of your food storage and preparation areas will reduce opportunities for cross-contamination. Cross-contamination is the cooking or serving of different foods with the same utensils and surfaces. Food allergens can be transferred via unwashed hands or utensils, preparation surfaces, fryer vats and even garnishes. Also, be certain to carefully check soaps, lotions, cosmetics and toiletries for potentially allergenic items, because they can easily end up on little hands and mouths. Don't assume that friends and family will remember to avoid reaction-causing foods after you've told them about your child's allergy. They don't live with your child's food allergy every single day and aren't in the habit of checking every label every time. You may need to remind them every once in a while, and in the meantime, teach your child that when they're unsure about a food, they need to say, ""No, thank you!"" until everyone is used to the food allergy diagnosis. As parents are learning more about the child's allergic reaction symptoms, I suggest they bring family members or caretakers to doctor appointments. That can be vital in getting everyone onto the same page. Above all else: I remind parents to always keep allergy medications nearby and up to date. Both over-the-counter antihistamines and prescribed epinephrine auto-injectors have an expiration date, after which their effectiveness diminishes. At first, this allergy diagnosis can feel insurmountable. You think everything will be dramatically restricted, but day-to-day family life can still be wonderful and ""normal"" once you adjust to the little steps involved in protecting your family member from certain foods.","CDC: Food allergies are on the rise in American children .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, Apple is expected to unveil the newest version of its iPad with all of the breathless hype that typically attends the consumer-tech juggernaut's public events. But some folks, many of them Apple customers and self-described fanboys and fangirls, aren't celebrating. Instead, they're calling on the company to shore up human rights concerns by manufacturing an ""ethical iPad 3."" The creator of a campaign asking Apple to ensure safer conditions for workers at the Chinese plants that make its products is asking supporters to take to Facebook on Wednesday, posting pleas to Apple on the iTunes Facebook page. Last month, Mark Shields, a self-described ""Apple person,"" started a petition on Change.org. The petition has more than 241,000 signatures and asks, among other things, for Apple to create a worker-protection strategy around the release of new products such as the anticipated new iPad. Worker-rights groups say that Foxconn, the Chinese manufacturer that produces products for Apple and other tech companies, has a stringent, militaristic culture of surveillance and obedience. It's a culture that labor groups say contributed to a slew of suicides in 2010 at the company's Shenzhen plant -- prompting Foxconn to install nets in an effort to prevent employees from jumping -- as well as worker injuries and even deaths. ""Many of the people who have signed Mark's petition have expressed concern that without a strategy to prevent forced overtime, impossible production quotas and worker injury, that worker abuse, accidents, and even death may increase around the release of the iPad 3,"" said Amanda Kloer, campaign director at Change.org. ""Mark hopes that if Apple customers ask the company about how the iPad 3 was made, Apple will respond to his request for a worker protection strategy for new product releases."" Shields was traveling Tuesday and not able to be reached for comment. Contacted by CNN on Tuesday, Apple did not have any comment. In a statement to CNN last month, Apple said it cares about all of the workers in its worldwide supply chain. ""We insist that our suppliers provide safe working conditions, treat workers with dignity and respect and use environmentally responsible manufacturing processes wherever Apple products are made,"" the company said. ""Our suppliers must live up to these requirements if they want to keep doing business with Apple."" After a wave of publicity last month that included a CNN interview with a Foxconn worker, Foxconn announced it had given workers a pay increase and was allowing an international labor-rights group to visit one of its facilities. Kloer said Shields has never gotten a response from Apple about creating a worker protection strategy, even though he was promised one by the manager at a Washington, D.C., Apple store where he delivered the petition. Shields and Kloer are asking supporters on Wednesday to post on the iTunes page on Facebook ""asking for an ethical iPad 3."" Apple has not officially said what Wednesday's announcement will be, but all speculation centers on a new iPad. Many reports suggest it may actually be called the iPad HD to showcase a new, high-resolution display screen.","Apple protesters are calling for Facebook campaign on Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Are younger people more likely to embrace their sexual identity? That's the implication of findings from a recent large Gallup survey. The survey, which asked 120,000 American adults whether they identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, found that 6.4% of people aged 18 to 29 said they were LGBT: about three times more than people over age 65. But do results like these indicate that younger adults are more likely to be LGBT, or are they simply more likely to acknowledge it? It's probably the latter, say my colleagues. ""These numbers might reflect a generational change in social acceptance for LGBT identities,"" said psychotherapist Jean Malpas, director of the Gender and Family Project at the New York-based Ackerman Institute for the Family. ""Today's youth and young adults, at least in some communities, are gradually more comfortable being open about their sexual and gender identities."" Another potential reason for the increase in self-identified LGBT youth is the influence of a new generation of parents who embody a positive attitude and wouldn't have it any other way. ""Today's millennial parents are more than just accepting of their children's sexual identity. They're comfortable and embracing of it, too,"" said Ron Taffel, psychologist and author of the book ""Childhood Unbound."" ""They want to actively support and engage their children through communication about all aspects of their lives."" Hate your body? 4 ways to get your sex life back . Research, including this survey, also suggests that young women may be more likely than men to identify as bisexual. ""The pattern across surveys is that men are more likely to identify as gay, whereas women are more likely to identify as bisexual,"" explained social psychologist Justin Lehmiller. ""We don't know exactly why this is, but many psychologists believe it results from women's sexuality being somewhat more 'flexible' or 'fluid' and men's sexuality being somewhat more 'fixed.' "" Many other young people are eschewing traditional descriptors for sexuality and gender completely. ""There's been a lot of work done on how LGBT youth is more and more frequently rejecting labels altogether, blurring the lines between sexual orientation and gender, creating new labels and identifying as gender-queer, gender-fluid or pansexual, to name a few,"" said sex therapist Margie Nichols. ""The very term 'LGBT' is too confining now, which is why I prefer the term Gender and Sexual Diversity, or GSD."" That term could also include the 1% of people who identify as asexual, which means they aren't sexually attracted to anyone. ""While we're creating space for a variety of sexual identities, we also need to create space for non-sexual identities,"" said college sex educator Emily Nagoski. Are you 'normal' in bed? Indeed, many of the experts I spoke to expressed frustration that Gallup and other surveys limit the options from which a respondent can choose. ""The terms lesbian, gay and bisexual just don't capture all sexual minority identities,"" Lehmiller said. Nichols agrees. ""These studies are missing a tremendous opportunity by not including an 'other' category. It's a shame, because the 'other' category is the wave of the future."" Separate from sexual identity is gender identity. While not addressed in the Gallup survey, experts say, this distinction is increasingly important, particularly for today's youth. ""Gender nonconforming expression and identity are different from sexual orientation,"" Malpas explained. ""Sexual orientation is about who you are attracted to and who you fall in love with. Gender expression and identity refer to the gender you feel comfortable expressing and identifying with, which might or might not be aligned with the biological sex you were assigned at birth."" As transgender and gender-nonconforming children and teens become more visible, both in communities and in the media, parents are less likely to dismiss them. ""Only a decade ago, a parent would have probably answered 'stop saying silly things' to a 6-year-old son who insisted on being a girl,"" Malpas added. ""Today, the same parent will stop and think about the transgender children they've seen on TV or in magazines and may more readily inquire with professionals and other parents."" More than just stop and think, they'll also hopefully want to talk. Says Taffel, who specializes in breaking through to teens, ""Open communication is a primary value for today's parents, much more so than setting limits and rules, and the spirit of open communication trumps the content of any conversation."" What to do after an affair . While it's important not to confuse gender and sexual identity, parents can take a similar approach in discussing them with their kids. ""Of course, you should reassure the child of your love, but you'll also want to find ways to expose your child to others like him or her so the child doesn't feel different or alone,"" Nichols suggested. ""Allow yourself to experience mixed or negative feelings if you have them, and consider joining a support group. You've also got to be prepared to be your child's advocate with schools, neighbors and community activities."" I find the survey results very encouraging, as they indicate not just a shift of differences in human sexuality toward the mainstream but also suggest that the future is promising for people who don't fit into ""the norm."" ""We're evolving, culturally, beyond the need to impose rules on who's allowed to do what with their genitals and their hearts,"" Nagoski said. ""This new generation of young people understands that love is love, that people are people and that the freedom to experience joy and mutually consensual pleasure is a birthright.""","A survey shows youths are more likely to identify as LBGT .
The numbers may reflect a generational change in social acceptance, experts say .

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama may be a risk averse president focused more on the middle class as his legacy than on the Middle East. But ISIS' advances against Irbil (where there are U.S. troops and diplomats) and its brutality against the Yazidis and Christians gave him no choice but to become more risk ready. But we should be under no illusion that targeted airstrikes against ISIS and humanitarian assistance to besieged minorities means a transformation in the President's views about Iraq, a slippery slope to military intervention, or the beginning of a new save the Middle East campaign. Obama is likely to remain a very cautious, risk-averse president. And here's why. The 'extricator-in-chief' Barack Obama's own political legitimacy is intertwined with a commitment to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan and Iraq, the two longest and among the most profitless wars in American history. This is both a campaign promise and one about which the President feels very strongly. He knows he can't fix Iraq and if there is a red line in his world view that won't turn pink, it is his opposition to redeploying American forces back into Iraq at any significant level. He is in this regard the extricator-in-chief determined to get the United States out of old wars and not into new ones. That, combined with Obama's wariness about using military force in an open-ended conflict without clear purpose and his aversion to appearing to take the Shia side, particularly one identified with Nuri al-Maliki, a prime minister who has lost the confidence of the vast majority of the Iraqi public, should serve as a brake against an expansive mission creep. The Libya precedent . The President's risk aversion will be strengthened by the way things turned out in Libya. There, in 2010, in an effort to prevent Moammar Gadhafi's forces from killing thousands of civilians in Benghazi, the United States and France mobilized a coalition backed by the United Nations, the Arab League and NATO. Despite action by all these formidable forces, it took an eight-month effort by NATO to facilitate the opposition's efforts to overthrow the Libyan dictator. More important, today Libya is a mess riven by tribal and regional rivalries. And to boot, for the first time since 1988, a U.S. ambassador was killed in a terrorist attack in Benghazi. Obama knows that there are clear limits to what he can do in Iraq and that even a much more ambitious commitment will not produce results. On the contrary, it will lead to a trap in which the United States is likely to become ensnared. If you couldn't fix Iraq in a decade of effort, $25 billion to support the Iraqi military and a trillion dollars or more to prop up the Iraqi government, you're not going to fix it now. 800+ days and counting . Governing is about choosing, particularly as a President watches the sands run through the hourglass in a second term. It may well be that Obama's clock has run out with respect to new domestic initiatives. The really tough issues -- dealing with a grand bargain on tax increases and entitlement reform and climate change -- are probably beyond his capacity to realize. Even immigration reform will likely be a bridge too far. He may well find himself suffering significant losses in the House and perhaps even the loss of the Senate in the November 2014 midterms. Obama could well complete his second term with his major accomplishments being realized in his first. That said, he has no intention of having his remaining less than 1,000 days be consumed with an Iraq war he can't win or with a legacy that will be compared to his predecessor George W. Bush, who took America into Iraq in 2003. Those prospects will virtually ensure a determined effort to keep the Iraq venture limited. If possible, he will share with other nations the humanitarian dimension so the United States doesn't have to bear the sole responsibility. One thing is clear. While Barack Obama acted quickly this time around to protect Americans and alleviate the suffering of threatened minority groups, he has no intention of becoming the Lone Ranger of Iraq. Not even George W. Bush was prepared to do that. ISIS: A threat to the United States? Last year, there were 17,891 global fatalities due to terrorism. Of that number, 16 were Americans. Terrorism from ISIS or anyone else is not right now a strategic threat to the continental United States. It is to our allies, however, particularly in Jordan. And it could become a threat to us, too. With millions of dollars, stolen passports and foreign fighters, ISIS could if it chose make a bid not just to strike at the so-called near enemy (Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia) but at the far enemy, too (the United States). ISIS has its hands full at the moment. Striking ISIS could well provide it with an added incentive to strike back at U.S. targets in the region and over time at America. ISIS' bold threat today that its flag will one day fly over the White House is sheer delusion. But it means that this vicious group could direct its attention at the United States. Indeed, an attack against the United States or its assets in the region would clearly be the one trigger that could impel the President to do now what he clearly wants to avoid: launch a major military campaign to strike at ISIS in Iraq and Syria. What's the endgame? The biggest challenge for the President is that limited strikes against ISIS targets may protect Americans, buck up the Kurds, and perhaps defuse the current threat to the Yazidi minority on the mountaintop. But they cannot put Iraq back together again, save all persecuted minorities from ISIS brutality or help create a new political contract among Iraqi Kurds, Muslims and Shia. Iraq is likely to continue to bleed and we can't stop that. The President was right to act and may well be called on to do so again. Indeed, we can't rule out the possibility that he would send in more special forces. He can try to enlist other nations, work with America's regional allies, and push for internal reconciliation among Iraqi politicians. But he's also right to be cautious and realistic about what he can really accomplish. We cannot save Iraq from itself or from its neighbors, particularly Iran, whose vision for Iraq is much different than ours. This was a bridge too far when George W. Bush tried to cross it in 2003. And it remains one to this day.","President Obama orders U.S. military strikes in Iraq, humanitarian assistance .

"(CNN) -- Less than a decade after Radiohead offered up ""In Rainbows"" with a pay-what-you-want model, the group's frontman, Thom Yorke, is now selling a surprise new album via BitTorrent. The record, ""Tomorrow's Modern Boxes,"" is available now at the pay-gated cost of $6. A video for the album's first track ""A Brain in a Bottle,"" which expands on the haunting vocals and glitchy electronic music of Yorke's 2006 debut album ""The Eraser,"" is available for free. A link to buy the record on vinyl is also included. A step-by-step guide explains how to get the record. Thom Yorke Talks Radiohead, Atoms for Peace With Daniel Craig . The singer said in a joint statement with his Atoms for Peace collaborator, producer Nigel Godrich, that he hoped it would help regain control of file sharing. ""It's an experiment to see if the mechanics of the system are something that the general public can get its head around,"" they said. ""If it works well, it could be an effective way of handing some control of Internet commerce back to people who are creating the work, enabling those people who make either music, video or any other kind of digital content to sell it themselves [and] bypassing the self-elected gatekeepers. ""If it works, anyone can do this exactly as we have done,"" Yorke and Godrich continued. ""The torrent mechanism does not require any server uploading or hosting costs or 'cloud' malarkey. It's a self-contained embeddable shop front. The network not only carries the traffic, it also hosts the file. The file is in the network."" In this model, the music publisher covers transaction fees, while BitTorrent takes 10 percent after that. The artist is then able to keep any data about its fans -- impressions, downloads, stream info, email addresses -- and they're allowed to publish in any format. A BitTorrent press release compares this to models where online distributors take 40 percent of payment and keep all associated info.

"(CNN) -- The fighting among Shiite militias and government troops in Basra is a glimpse of Iraq's future, and pivotal cleric Muqtada al-Sadr is in deep trouble, according to two CNN correspondents and a CNN military analyst. Mehdi Army fighters wear masks during clashes in the southern Iraqi city of Basra on Wednesday. The fiery religious leader has a loyal following in Baghdad's Sadr City neighborhood and other enclaves thanks to generous social programs, but his political movement, his Mehdi Army militia and the cease-fire al-Sadr recently extended are no match for Iranian intrigue, according to CNN's experts. ""Al-Sadr is involved in a very complicated relationship with the Iranians,"" said CNN Baghdad correspondent Michael Ware. ""The Iranians do provide funding and support for his militia, yet at the same time they're trying to rein him in and get him to adopt a certain political agenda, which from time to time he resists."" Ware said Iran wants to use al-Sadr's populist base to advance its agenda in Iraq. ""However, they don't want to see him get too big for his boots or to rise to a position where they can no longer have sway over him."" Iran has weakened al-Sadr by encouraging dissension within his Mehdi Army and backing hardliners -- known as the Special Groups -- who break away and keep up the fight against the U.S. occupation, Ware said. ""Iran's very good at putting pressure on you, forcing you to split, and anything that squeezes out the side, Iran picks up and turns into hardline factions,"" Ware said. ""That's exactly what's happened to Muqtada. He's had purge after purge after purge of belligerent commanders, and they've all been swept up by Iran. ""And now the most lethal attacks on U.S. forces, the most coordinated attacks on U.S. forces, the most daring attacks on U.S. forces in the country are committed by Iranian-backed breakaway elements of Muqtada's militia faction.""  Learn more about the Mehdi Army and other key players in Basra » . The violence in Basra -- which has spread to Shiite areas throughout the country, including Baghdad -- is a kind of fighting Americans are unaccustomed to seeing, said retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Donald Sheppard, CNN's senior military analyst.  Watch the violence multiply » . ""This is intra-Shia. This is not Sunni vs. Shia, this is not civil war, this is not sectarian violence, it's intra-Shia politics for control of the government,"" he said. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is trying to hold together his political alliance -- an alliance that includes the political wings of the militias he's fighting, Sheppard said. ""If this alliance breaks apart because of the fighting, you've got chaos within the Parliament,"" Sheppard said.  Watch Sheppard assess the military situation » . So far, al-Sadr has resisted the temptation to end the Mehdi Army cease-fire, which, combined with the simultaneous increase in U.S. forces last year, had brought a sharp reduction in violence. If the truce ends, ""the success of the surge is going to be hugely in doubt,"" said CNN International correspondent Michael Holmes. ""I've always said, yes the surge has reduced violence in Baghdad, but you have to put it in context: Why has it reduced the violence, and what else has happened? ""It's a lot like squeezing a balloon, as a general told me: You squeeze it in Baghdad, it pops out elsewhere. Where you've seen a lot of the militiamen go, a lot of the insurgents go, is to the south and mainly to the north, which is why you're seeing a lot of action up in Mosul."" And the Mehdi Army and Badr Brigades -- the principal combatants in the Basra region -- are hardly the only militias at arms in Iraq. Indeed there are dozens, each with its own political, social, religious and military agenda, Ware noted.  Watch Ware look ahead to a post-American Iraq » . ""What worries me the most is all of the good work that we've done with the surge, spreading higher levels of security throughout Iraq, the people slowly gaining confidence in their own security forces -- that could all break down,"" Sheppard said. ""It could all break down because of Basra, it could break down because al-Sadr basically ends the truce and fighting starts all over the country in the Shia areas. ""This is very, very serious and it could all go wrong for the United States as we try to extricate ourselves. It could go wrong in many, many ways and cause everything to come apart there."" But Holmes suggested there's a chance al-Maliki and Iraq will survive this crisis. ""This could be a good test of Nuri al-Maliki and the security forces. They're going to have to stand up at some point; maybe this is a time to see how they do."" Ware doubts the security forces can prevent a meltdown. ""This is a window into the future of Iraq after the American withdrawal,"" Ware said. ""What many people suggest is that we're looking at a situation that will be akin to Lebanon in the 1980s, with vicious, well-armed militia proxy wars where all the factions are supported by one foreign sponsor or another. ""But this will be Lebanon on steroids."" E-mail to a friend .","CNN analysts assess what Basra fighting says about Iraq's future .

"(CNN) -- A chemical found in many sodas may be dangerous to your health, Consumer Reports says. And no, it's not sugar (this time). The golden-brown color of many soft drinks comes with a dose of the chemical 4-methylimidazole, or 4-MeI. On U.S. product labels it appears simply as ""caramel coloring."" Those who say the chemical may possibly cause cancer include the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer and the state of California, which now limits manufacturers to 29 micrograms of exposure for the average consumer per day. Foods exceeding that limit have to carry a warning label that reads: ""WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer."" But when Consumer Reports purchased sodas in California and had them analyzed by a lab, it found that one 12-ounce serving of Pepsi One or Malta Goya exceeded the levels permitted without a warning label. Ten other brands tested by the group did meet the California standard, which is estimated to limit the risk of cancer from 4-MeI to one case in every 100,000 lifetimes of daily exposure. ""We are concerned about both the levels of 4-MeI we found in many of the soft drinks tested and the variations observed among brands, especially given the widespread consumption of these types of beverages,"" said Dr. Urvashi Rangan, a Consumer Reports toxicologist, in a statement. ""There is no reason why consumers need to be exposed to this avoidable and unnecessary risk that can stem from coloring food and beverages brown."" The Food and Drug Administration does not set federal limits on 4-MeI in food, and the data gathered by Consumer Reports show that in some cases consumers outside California are drinking a slightly different ingredient. For example, Pepsi One purchased by the group in December in New York contains four times as much 4-MeI as the same product bought that same month in California. What is clean eating? Currently the FDA has no reason to believe that 4-Mel poses a health risk to consumers at the levels found in foods with caramel coloring, agency spokeswoman Juli Putnam told CNN in an e-mail. The government agency is testing a variety of food and beverages with the chemical and reviewing safety data to determine if any regulatory action needs to be taken, she said. Consumers interested in more information on 4-Mel can check out the FDA's FAQ page. In a statement to Consumer Reports, PepsiCo Inc. said data indicate that the average person consumes less than one-third a can of diet soda per day; therefore, its product meets the California standard, even if a complete serving exceeds that limit. In addition to new federal standards, Consumer Reports is calling on the FDA to ""require labeling of specific caramel colors in the ingredient lists of food where it is added, so consumers can make informed choices."" ""First and foremost, consumers can rest assured that our industry's beverages are safe,"" the American Beverage Association said in a statement. ""Contrary to the conclusions of Consumer Reports, FDA has noted there is no reason at all for any health concerns, a position supported by regulatory agencies around the world. ""However, the companies that make caramel coloring for our members' soft drinks are now producing it to contain less 4-MeI, and nationwide use of this new caramel coloring is underway.""

"Editor's note: Actress and producer Didi Conn played Frenchy in the films ""Grease"" and ""Grease 2"" and is a celebrity spokesperson for the advocacy organization Autism Speaks. April 2 is World Autism Awareness Day. Didi Conn says she struggled to come to terms with her son Danny's autism. (CNN) -- When anything is wrong with your child, your first instinct is to make it better. Diagnose the situation, find the answer to the problem and take your child's pain away. But with autism, that takes quite a lot of doing. Right after our son Danny celebrated his second birthday, he started to have increasingly lengthy and violent tantrums, usually initiated by his extraordinary sensitivity to sound. At the slightest provocation -- telephone ring, doorbell, a blow dryer, blender -- he would begin to scream, hold his ears and throw himself down on the ground. We went right to our pediatrician, who was not alarmed, gave him a routine hearing test, and basically said, ""He's 2, you've heard of the ""terrible 2s."" This was 1994, and the classic signs of autism were not as publicized, and therefore as recognizable, as they are today. Then, a few months later, Danny began to wake up screaming two or three times a night. It would go on for hours, and there was nothing my husband or I could do. Since Danny was so sensitive to sound, he began to stop responding to us as a way of protecting himself from the pain. Feeling helpless and exhausted, we brought him to Dr. Isabelle Rapin, the head of pediatric neurology at the Albert Einstein School of Medicine. The diagnosis was PDDNOS: Pervasive Development Disorder Not Otherwise Specified. We learned that ""autism"" is an umbrella term for five spectrum disorders. After three more visits with  Rapin, Danny was diagnosed as a high-functioning child on the autistic spectrum, and she recommended we take him to The Therapeutic Nursery at the Jewish Community Center on the Palisades in Tenafly, New Jersey. The school was run by Rapin's colleague, Dr. Doris Allen. When a child is out of control, he or she needs you, the parent, to make them feel safe. So we were taught to sit behind Danny and hold him close with legs and arms wrapped around him, to become his backbone until the tantrum ran its course. When a child throws a tantrum, he throws himself on Mother Earth. I wanted Danny to throw himself on me and let me take care of him. But it was not to play out that way. I became the Queen of Denial. I wouldn't believe there was something ""wrong"" with my son. Can you imagine waking up two three times a night, every night, with your child for 12 years? I knew I had to change myself, become somehow bigger, larger, stronger, able to envelop him, subdue him, keep him safe; but, instead I went in the opposite direction. The shock of his diagnosis found me shrinking, hiding, disappearing, guilty and overprotective. I would not take any jobs. I would never leave him alone. What if he set the house on fire? I took Danny to try every therapy known at the time: excising sugar, wheat or gluten from his diet, acupuncture, massage, psychic healers, trips to Toronto, Canada, to The Listening Centre for auditory integration. I was told to see what interested him and develop those interests as a way in. For a few years, he obsessively loved daisies; so we planted daisies everywhere. Later, his most obsessive interest became pets, especially dogs. Now it seems like we've been to every pet store in every state and country and we have a bird, two cats, two dogs, five fish and a tortoise. I learned that early intervention with the appropriate therapy and a supportive family and a loving community will help your child reach his or her potential -- and that is the most important thing. We all want our children to be the best they can be; and one of the blessings of having an autistic child is that you notice every little achievement, and it becomes cause for celebration. In our case, there was yet another special reward from having an autistic child. Five years ago, I was approached by a television executive to develop an animated musical series for children. We have recently finished the pilot for Didi Lightful, and it centers around a little girl of that name who loves pets of all kinds and lives in a house full of them (her father is a vet). Of course, the prime inspiration for her character and adventures was and is Danny. Not only that, among Didi Lightful's neighborhood friends is the first autistic child in a fictional series of this kind. One day, as I was speaking to another mother of a disabled child, I said our secret weapon against this disease is to do all we can without any expectation of results. MUMS the word! MUMS: Mothers Unite for Miracles! And I do have so many miracles to report and so many miracle workers who made them happen. They include his relatives, doctors, therapists and teachers. This includes his Applied Behavior Analysis Hebrew teacher, Eve Rosenstock. For two years, she prepared Danny for his bar mitzvah -- yes, his full bar mitzvah for 100 people in a big temple. Thanks also go to two schools that have helped him greatly: Devereux Millwood Learning Center and his current program at Tappan Zee High School. Since decision-making is difficult for Danny, choosing ""what to be"" on Halloween is always an exasperating time and high on the IT (Inciting Tantrum) list. This year, for the first time, Danny was positive he wanted to be a pirate. We went to the Party Store and picked out a perfect pirate costume, eye patch and attachable parrot included. Danny was excited and I held my breath as we waited on a long line to check out, hoping that he wouldn't change his mind. And he didn't! That is, until we got into the car and he blurted out, ""I don't want to be a pirate! I hate pirates! Pirates are stupid! I want to be a witch!"" My mind races: Did I force this choice on him? I pull the car over. I take several deep breaths. I say, ""Danny look at me. I had a happy face all day and now look at me. Do I look happy?"" He turns his head in my direction and glances over to me. ""No, no,"" he says. ""That's right, you are upsetting me, Danny."" Then he says, ""Upsetting is a bad word for U!"" And then in a flash, I say, ""What is a good word for U?"" Before I can come up with one, Danny says, ""United, United is a good word for U!"" This is a miracle. ""Yes!"" I say, ""United is a perfect word for U!"" I burst out in tears. The spell is broken! Two miracles just occurred: . There was no tantrum, and Danny saw I was unhappy and realized the cause of it was his behavior. Yes, Danny! The opposite of Upset is United! We are United! Last summer, Danny and I went to visit our angel and his long-time therapist, Terese, at her home in Maine. It was raining as we drove down a dirt road on our way to a friend's farm. Danny was looking intently out the window at the fields and pastures we were passing, and he said quietly, ""I can see all of God's paintings. Thank you God for all the blessings I like."" And I thank you too, God, for the blessing of my beautiful, innocent son. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Didi Conn.","Didi Conn says she tried to deny the seriousness of her son's struggle with autism .

"(CNN) -- Imagine going in for a cancer screening, and the technician turns to you and says, ""We're finished, but if I push this button over here, the machine can detect even smaller cancers. But here's the hitch: You have to pay $700 if you want me to push this button."" ""You'd be enraged,"" says Ellen Matloff, director of cancer genetic counseling at Yale University Cancer Center. ""You'd want to know why you have to pay extra to push that button. Why didn't they just do it right the first time?"" Doctors and genetic counselors interviewed by CNN say that Myriad Genetics in Utah is doing something very similar with tests that determine if a woman has a potentially dangerous genetic abnormality linked to breast cancers. Most breast cancers do not seem to be genetic. Instead, they're the result of cells gone wild for no apparent reason. However, some women get breast cancer because a bad gene runs in their families. When testing shows that a woman carries such a gene, she has a much higher chance of getting breast cancer. These women usually then get more frequent MRIs, ultrasounds and mammograms to detect a cancer, and sometimes even choose to remove their breasts to prevent a cancer from growing in the first place. Myriad owns the patent on breast cancer genes and so is the only company that can test for them. It offers one test that catches most, but not all, abnormalities, and then charges nearly all patients $700 for a second test that catches the rest. If a woman can't afford the $700 fee, she may miss an abnormality, which could mean the difference between life and death. ""What Myriad's doing -- charging extra for this test -- is really sleazy,"" Matloff says. ""They're collecting blood money off my patients."" Myriad defends the $700 charge for its second test, called BART, even though many patients can't afford it and insurance won't pay for it. ""The BART test is based on different and separate technology,"" Rebecca Chambers, a Myriad spokeswoman, wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""[It's] based on a sophisticated new technology developed exclusively by Myriad."" She added that Myriad is trying to persuade insurance companies to pay for the test and that it offers financial assistance to patients who meet certain criteria, and monthly interest-free payments to those why do owe the $700 fee. ""Myriad's mission is to improve the patient's quality of life and to save lives,"" she added in the e-mail. Understanding the furor . To understand the anger and bitterness that patients, doctors and genetic counselors harbor toward Myriad, it's important to know the basics of genetic testing. In 1996, Myriad offered its first test for breast cancer genetic abnormalities. Known as the BRCA test, it's been revolutionary and has saved countless lives: If the test reveals that a woman has a genetic abnormality, it means she has a very high chance of getting breast cancer in the future, and some women then opt to remove their breasts as a pre-emptive strike against cancer. Women who test positive for BRCA also sometimes opt to have their ovaries removed, since having a breast cancer gene abnormality gives them a higher-than-normal chance of getting ovarian cancer as well. ""Genetic testing has been a godsend for so many women,"" Matloff says. Myriad calls its test the Comprehensive BRACAnalysis, but it soon became clear that it wasn't truly comprehensive. It did not catch all genetic abnormalities linked to cancer, and so in 2006, the company began selling BART, the newer test that catches genetic defects that the original test misses. Doctors and counselors expected Myriad to offer BART as part of its original test, but instead the company offers it separately and charges nearly everyone $700 to take it. ""This is so irresponsible of Myriad,"" says Molly Klein, director of genetic counseling at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta. She and other genetic counselors have been fighting to get Myriad to stop the $700 charge. They say they worry that women who tested negative under the first test feel assured that they don't have a bad gene when in fact they might, and wouldn't know they're at increased risk for getting breast cancer. Klein and other genetic counselors say that when Myriad came up with an improvement in its colon cancer test, it wrapped it into its original screening at one price. The counselors say they think Myriad handled the breast cancer test differently, charging a separate fee, because it has no competition. ""From a business perspective, I guess I understand why Myriad is doing what they're doing, because this is a good chunk of money for them,"" says Kristen Shannon, the senior genetic counselor at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center. ""But I feel really strongly that Myriad is doing the wrong thing."" ""That accusation is incorrect,"" Chambers wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""I'm so angry"" For Eileen Kelly and Kathleen Maxian, money wasn't the issue. The two sisters were stunned three years ago when Kelly was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 40. They breathed a sigh of relief when Kelly tested negative for the BRCA gene using Myriad's original test. This meant Kelly's cancer was a fluke, and not something her sister or other relatives needed to worry about. Then two years later, at the age of 47, Maxian found out she had ovarian cancer. Surgeons removed her ovaries and found the cancer had spread to her abdomen. After chemotherapy, the cancer came back a year later. ""I told my surgeon my sister had genetic testing, but it came back negative,"" Maxian says. ""My surgeon just hung her head down and shook it back and forth. I was like, 'What? How weird is that?' "" The surgeon told Maxian that her sister's test might have been incomplete. She instructed Maxian to ask her sister, who lives in Atlanta, to find out if she'd received the second test, BART, in addition to the original breast cancer genetic test. Kelly found out she had not had not received BART. She went back to Piedmont Hospital to have it done, and the test was positive. Maxian and her father then had BART, and it turns out that they, too, carry a genetic abnormality. Women who have genetic abnormalities like Maxian's have a 50% to 85% chance of getting breast cancer, and a 10% to 40% chance of getting ovarian cancer. She says that if her sister had had BART from the beginning, she also would have taken the test, and the positive result would have made her remove her breasts and ovaries ""in a minute."" ""If BART had been done from the beginning, it could have saved Kathleen from getting ovarian cancer,"" says Dr. Nefertiti duPont, Maxian's surgeon at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York. ""It could have prevented my cancer, or at least caught it early,"" Maxian adds. ""Now my cancer is so advanced, I have only a 20% chance of being alive five years from now. I'm so angry."" Klein, the genetic counselor at Piedmont Hospital, says she never mentioned BART to Kelly, nor to most of the women who came in for testing at that time. She says information from Myriad led her to believe that BART mutations were extremely rare among women like Kelly without an extremely strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer. When some women do have a very strong family history, Myriad will do a BART analysis for free as part of its original test, and has spent $20 million on these tests. ""We were left with the impression that BART wasn't necessary for families like Eileen's,"" Klein says. ""It just didn't seem urgent."" But over time, it's become clear that Myriad might have been wrong about who needs BART testing, counselors say. Several studies, such as one done by Shannon at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, show that a substantial number of women had BART mutations even without a very strong family history. Now, Klein and others offer BART to all their patients, but many can't do it because of the cost. ""This is all really frustrating,"" Klein says. ""We know we're missing women out there with BART mutations because they can't afford to pay. If you miss just one BART mutation, that woman could be in danger, and so could her mother, her sisters and her other relatives."" ""It's heartbreaking,"" says Mollie Hutton, Maxian's genetic counselor at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute. ""It's so sad that now Kathleen is fighting for her life when something could have been done to avoid it. It's just crappy."" Chambers, the Myriad spokeswoman, says studies show ""less than one percent of all women tested"" have a BART mutation. What to do when you get breast cancer genetic testing . If you're about to get breast cancer genetic testing, specifically ask if you'll receive BART testing. If you've had breast cancer genetic testing, don't assume you received the BART test. Also, don't assume that the place where you had the testing will get back in touch with you to let you know about BART. CNN contacted four genetic testing centers, each of which did something different: One center quickly contacted all patients to tell them about BART; another contacted only patients they considered high risk; the third contacted patients three years after BART became available; and the fourth still hasn't contacted patients to tell them about BART. Genetic counselors recommend that you call the place where you had testing every year or so to see if there have been any improvements in the test. Most women will have to decide whether they want to spend $700 to get BART testing. Eileen Kelly wishes she'd had the opportunity to spend that money. ""I'm so mad at Myriad. It's even hard just to talk about it,"" Kelly says, starting to cry. ""A test could have put the information in our hands that could have prevented my sister's cancer. It's frustrating and really hard to comprehend."" Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","Myriad Genetics owns the patent on breast cancer genes .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Marion ""Suge"" Knight was arrested Wednesday in Los Angeles on a misdemeanor traffic violation and an outstanding warrant, police said. The arrest occurred about 12:30 a.m., and the rap music mogul was taken to the Los Angeles County Jail, where he was held on $20,000 bail, said Officer Cleon Joseph, who did not have details about the warrant or the violation. The 48-year-old music mogul has had previous run-ins with the law. In February 2012, Las Vegas police stopped Knight, who was driving a black Bentley, and said they found less than an ounce of marijuana in the vehicle. He was ticketed for making an unsafe lane change. In December 2010, Knight was arrested at a suburban Los Angeles outdoor shopping mall for failing to appear in court on a traffic violation. At the time, the co-founder of Death Row Records had a warrant issued for failure to appear in court. Knight rose to fame and fortune after founding his record label in 1991 and signing artists who included Snoop Doggy Dogg (who now goes by the name Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was in Las Vegas with Shakur in 1996 when the rapper was shot to death. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time, along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others, contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006.","Knight is being held on $20,000 bail at the Los Angeles County Jail .

"(CNN) -- The Christian Science Monitor recently reported that Mitt Romney's former political advisers are adamantly denying rumors that their boss might run for the presidency in 2016. ""I take Mitt at his absolute word,"" said Ron Kaufman. ""He's not running."" Whether or not Romney wants to run, or if his family is comfortable with his doing so, will be up to them. But should he decide to put his hat in the ring, it's not crazy to think that Romney would be able to end up at the top of the Republican ticket in 2016. Most pundits believed that his political career had come to an end following his loss to President Obama in 2012. But a sympathetic portrayal in a Netflix documentary, entitled ""Mitt,"" combined with his fund-raising for midterm candidates in the 2014 elections, has generated considerable buzz. The odds are obviously not great. Republicans would naturally be jittery about selecting a candidate who couldn't make it through the primaries in 2008 and then crashed and burned against Obama. While many Republicans were sure that Obama should be a one-term president -- another Jimmy Carter, in their minds -- the Democrats devastated Romney as a candidate who only cared about the rich and who had no inner core. So how could someone recover from this kind of loss? How could Romney end up as the next Republican nominee? If he were interested in running, Romney could take some comfort from the fact that some political losers have been able to rebuild themselves. Richard Nixon seemed like he would vanish into political thin air after losing to John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election and then losing to Pat Brown in the California gubernatorial election in 1962. ""You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore,"" he said after losing. That turned out to be incorrect, not because Nixon vanished from politics but because he came back stronger than ever in 1968. After building his reputation as a statesman and playing a key role in helping Republicans in the 1966 midterm campaign, Nixon defeated Hubert Humphrey to become president in 1968. Ronald Reagan, after coming close to defeating President Gerald Ford in the 1976 Republican primaries, spent the next four years expanding his audience and refining his message through his weekly radio shows. He became the front-runner in 1980 and beat Carter to become president. Like Nixon in 1966, Romney has been proving his worth on the campaign trail in 2014. He is the ""man in demand."" Romney ""is the most prominent and engaged elder statesman the GOP has on the national stage right now,"" one Republican consultant told CNN, watching how the former presidential candidate has been a star at fund-raising events. While a number of figures in the Republican Party are clearly preparing to jump into the presidential race, each of them is flawed. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky espouses a kind of libertarianism that doesn't sit well with most of the party. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie might rebuild his career, but ""bridgegate"" has greatly tarnished his reputation. Wisconsin Republican Scott Walker has a scandal of his own. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida is untested on the national stage and will try to run as the ""immigrant"" candidate in a party that has stood by a very hardline position on immigration. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has to contend with the Bush name in an electorate that still harbors negative feelings about his brother's time in the White House. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, who is becoming the most plausible candidate, is too closely associated with the right wing of his party and comes from a caucus of House Republicans who rank incredibly low in the polls. Despite all the animosity that emerged toward Romney's wealth and his record on economic issues, the fact is that Romney's preference for strong deregulatory and regressive policies fits very comfortably with the major thrust of the party. Since Reagan's presidency in the 1980s, the heart of GOP policies has not been about social and cultural issues, but rather about aiming to weaken the regulatory arm of the government over the economy. On these issues, Romney has impeccable credentials. As a result, Romney will still hold considerable appeal among major donors and conservative activists, like the Koch brothers, as the candidate who will aggressively pursue their core agenda. The money and endorsements can go a long way. It is not that difficult to see how the nation might witness a presidential campaign in 2016 that includes Mitt Romney. Whether he would be able to take on Hillary Clinton or some of the other potential Democratic nominees remains unclear. But speculation that he might end up as the person the GOP turns to is not that out of the bounds of reason.","Mitt Romney's former advisers are denying rumors that he might run for presidency in 2016 .

"(CNN) -- Hamas is pushing a different tactic in its conflict with Israel, urging Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas to go before the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israeli leaders for war crimes. The idea of pursuing an investigation into Israel by the international body is not new, but Hamas said on Saturday that it, too, has signed a document supporting such a move. ""Hamas has signed a document demanding Abu Mazen (Mahmoud Abbas) go to the International Criminal Court to prosecute Israeli leaders as war criminals for massacres they committed against our people,"" Hamas spokesman and senior official Izzat al-Risheq said on Twitter. The support from Hamas is significant because it could come at a cost to the group itself. An investigation into war crimes could expose Hamas for its own violations. Abbas, speaking in Cairo, said that all Palestinian factions would need to support such a bid before making the decision to go to the ICC. The Palestinians are not currently under the jurisdiction of the ICC, but would be if they sign the court's Rome Statute, the treaty that established the court. Back in May, a group of 17 human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, signed a letter to Abbas encouraging him to join the ICC. The United States and Israel, among some other nations, have pressured Abbas not to take this step, arguing that it would harm peace talks. Hamas' announcement comes a day after one of the group's leaders admitted that its militants were responsible for the abduction of three Israeli teens in the West Bank in June. Hamas Political Bureau member Saleh Aruri added that the kidnappers did not tell their leaders about the action. The kidnappings were not approved by Hamas leadership or its military wing, he said, stressing that this acknowledgment does not equate to a claim of responsibility. ""We at Hamas head command were not aware of this mission; we found out later,"" Hamas said in a statement Saturday. ""We at Hamas political command do not know anything about the kidnapping; all information we have is from the Israeli investigation. But if this is true, this mission is considered self defense against the Israeli occupation."" The three teens were later found dead. Since then, violence has flared in the region. The violence continued Saturday, as rockets fired from Gaza landed in Israel. The rocket alerts in Israeli communities near Gaza were continuous. The Hamas rocket attacks struck in the same area where a 4-year-old boy was killed Friday. Israel claimed that the mortar that killed the boy was launched from a school operated by the United Nations. On Saturday, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency said that Israel retracted that statement. The agency criticized Israeli media for repeating the claim without checking with them first. ""UNRWA deplores the killing of all children during this conflict, including the killing of the four-year-old Israeli child yesterday and the hundreds of Palestinian children killed since the start of the current fighting,"" the agency said in a statement. ""We call on all parties to ensure protection and care of children affected by armed conflict, in accordance with their obligations under international law."" Also on Saturday, Al Aqsa, a TV station run by Hamas, reported that Israeli gunboats sank a Palestinian fishing vessel off the Port of Gaza. A rocket from Lebanon struck an open area east of the town of Akko in northern Israel, though it wasn't clear who was responsible or if it had anything to do with Israel's fight with Hamas. No injuries or damage were reported, said Israeli Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner. Six decades of war . Gaza's zoo animals caught in crossfire . Israelis jailed for refusing to serve .

"(CNN) -- For parents in Somalia, giving their children immunizations is not a choice. In a country enduring more than 20 years of conflict, Somalia is home to one of the highest child mortality rates in the world, with one in five Somali children dying before their 5th birthday, aid agencies say -- in many instances, from diseases that could be prevented by vaccines. Yet for some equally loving parents in the developed world, the messages surrounding childhood vaccination have become muddied. Some communities in areas previously considered disease-free are now falling below the levels of ""herd immunity"" required to protect against diseases such as measles, whooping cough and mumps. This week, in Swansea, Wales, the local public health agency announced that 886 people have been diagnosed with measles in an epidemic that started in November. The outbreak has been attributed to low measles, mumps and rubella immunization rates. One man's death has been linked to the measles virus, while 80 people have been hospitalized. In 2011, six people in France died as a result of a measles epidemic that neared 15,000 confirmed cases, according to the World Health Organization. In 2010, a whooping cough outbreak, resulting from pockets of under-vaccinated people in California, resulted in 10 deaths, according to the California Department of Public Health. Nine of these were infants were too young to be vaccinated. ""We are extremely concerned about what's happening in some parts of the developed world,"" said Jos Vandelaer, chief of immunization at UNICEF, one of the groups helping vaccination efforts in Somalia. ""In the developing world, many people don't even get the chance to be immunized. Health systems are not strong enough to take the vaccine to every child despite the fact that their parents want it."" Parents with real fears . Measles, whooping cough and Hib (haemophilus influenzae type B), along with many other childhood diseases, can be deadly, but they are vaccine-preventable. Measles alone killed more than 150,000 people globally in 2011, according to WHO. Measles is also highly infectious, with one carrier likely to pass on the virus to between 14 and 18 other susceptible people, said Dr. Matthew Snape of the Oxford Vaccine Group in the pediatrics department at the University of Oxford, England. Despite the severity of these diseases, some parents in the developed world choose not to immunize their children and accept the risks. ""Studies show that it is the upper middle class, well-educated Caucasian parents who are shunning vaccines,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ""They have generally gone to graduate school, are in positions of management and are used to being in control."" A study released this month by the National Health Performance Authority in Australia reflected this trend. A number of affluent Sydney suburbs were identified as regions where low levels of immunity have put entire communities at risk from these diseases. The reasons behind parents' decisions are complex. Part of the problem is lingering doubts around vaccine safety that were compounded by a retracted 1998 study linking the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine with autism. Although declared an ""elaborate fraud"" by the British Medical Journal, it raised questions about the safety of immunization in the minds of many parents. These doubts then were spread worldwide on the Internet and in the media by anti-vaccination groups and some celebrities. ""If you want to scare yourself about vaccines, it's not that hard,"" Offit said. ""Just turn on your computer."" For such parents, the perceived risks of vaccination outweigh the risks they associate with disease. Vaccine-autism connection debunked again . In Australia, where vaccination is not mandatory, the anti-vaccination Australian Vaccination Network website says parents need to make an informed choice. The site offers links to articles and parental accounts of the potential side effects of many vaccines. A UNICEF working paper released this week to coincide with World Vaccination Week has tracked the rise of anti-vaccination sentiment in Eastern and Central Europe and concludes that poorly managed immunization campaigns in some countries have also contributed to the problem. Concerned parents in the affected countries are taking to blogs and Facebook, discussing their mistrust of vaccines and government programs, questioning the involvement of pharmaceutical companies and often recommending alternative medicine. A March survey conducted by the U.S. organization Public Policy Polling showed that 20% of Americans believe there is a link between childhood vaccines and autism, and a further 34% were not sure. Diseases long forgotten in the developed world . While there are some risks associated with vaccines, they are mostly minor, such as pain at the vaccine site or low-grade fever, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A serious allergic reaction is rare and usually reported in less than one out of 1 million doses, the agency reported. ""Hundreds of millions of children every year are vaccinated, and the number of side effects we see is minimal,"" UNICEF's Vandelaer said. ""The anti-vaccine groups focus on the potential side effects, not on the real side effects."" On the question of autism, numerous studies conducted over the past decade have all demonstrated there is no scientific link between vaccines and autism. With so much conflicting information readily available to parents, Dr. Dina Pfeifer, program manager for vaccine-preventable diseases and immunization for WHO's Europe office, said she believes the decision of whether to immunize children has become so fraught that many parents choose to do nothing at all. ""They have a difficulty dealing with the amount of information for and against (vaccination) on the Internet, and out of this confusion they are failing to recognize the risks of the disease,"" she said. Another factor driving parents' decision not to vaccinate is the security that comes with herd vaccination, as rates of immunization for many diseases remain above 92% for the population. But Europe's recent battle with measles demonstrates the problems under-vaccinated populations can pose, especially with older children. ""Europe had 100,000 cases of measles from 2009 to 2012, and that shows how prevalent the pockets of un-immunized populations are in that area,"" Pfeifer said. ""Almost 50% of those cases were older than 10 years of age, and the older you are when you contract measles, the more severe the course of the disease."" Another factor of these pockets is their affluence; these parents tend to be the ones able to afford overseas travel. In 2008, a 7-year-old U.S. boy whose parents chose not to immunize him against measles traveled with his family to Switzerland. He caught the virus and returned to San Diego, unknowingly exposing 839 people to the disease and infecting 11 unvaccinated children, according to the journal Pediatrics. In Europe and the United States, parents and most people under 45 have never seen the effects of diseases such as measles, diphtheria or polio. ""The fear factor (among parents in the developed world) is missing now -- the knowledge of what's on the other side if you don't have vaccinations,"" said Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, known as GAVI Alliance. The lack of knowledge of these diseases is also a problem among younger doctors and pediatricians, who may not be able to identify the signs, resulting in misdiagnoses. ""There is a lot of value in case-based learning, but it is difficult to learn how to recognize these diseases if you haven't seen them before,"" said WHO's Pfeifer. In contrast, most parents in the developing world, in places such as Somalia, have seen family members suffer, be maimed or die from such diseases, health advocates said. Education and motivation . To address the problem, Berkley prescribes localized programs in countries to supplement the already high overall levels of immunization. Other physicians are supporters of parental education and want to ensure parents feel free to ask as many questions of their doctors and health care workers. Dr. Steve Hambleton of the Australian Medical Association said further motivation may be necessary. ""When you incentivize the parents in a meaningful way, whether it be financial or with other incentives, you can make an enormous difference in vaccination uptake,"" he said. Berkley, a doctor who specializes in epidemiology and global health, said he has seen the devastating effects of vaccine-preventable diseases in war-torn countries and refugee camps. Berkley said he wished he could take some parents in the developed world ""on a tour, show them how horrible it is. Show them the illness that occurs out of these viruses."" ""We've brought down child mortality dramatically with these vaccination campaigns and we are making dramatic progress, but the challenge is getting people to understand what the world was like before this.""","Childhood vaccination has become muddied for some parents in developed world .

"(CNN) -- One of the World Cup's most exciting players has joined Real Madrid. James Rodriguez -- Colombia's star man at Brazil 2014 and winner of the Golden Boot -- penned a six-year contract with the reigning European champion after his transfer from Monaco was completed in a reported $121 million deal. The 23-year-old midfielder's six goals and two assists at the World Cup had heads turning at all the big clubs, but Real was destined to get its man after Rodriguez told Spanish sports newspaper Marca that he dreamed of playing for ""Los Blancos."" ""It's really flattering to know that a club of Real Madrid's stature is interested in me. It'd be a dream to join the club of my dreams,"" Rodriguez said. ""Would I jump at the chance to go to Real? No doubt about it, my answer is a resounding yes,"" he added. It was then only a matter of time before Real Madrid came knocking on Monaco's door. Rodriguez joined Monaco last year for a fee of $60.8 million and scored 10 goals in 38 appearances as the French club finished runner-up to Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1. Former Monaco chief executive and technical director Tor-Kristian Karlsen, who has regularly scouted players from Latin America, says Rodriguez is right up there with the world's best. ""He's possibly the best playmaker in the world at present,"" Karlsen told CNN in June. Rodriguez even caught the attention of NBA star and avid football fan LeBron James. ""Man watching this Colombia game I think I have my new favorite player in the World Cup! Obviously his name help that out #Biased"" LeBron tweeted. The 10-time European champion has always aimed to buy the world's top players, and Rodriguez certainly fits the mold following his exploits at Brazil 2014, where he scored the goal of the tournament against Uruguay. His innate ability to pick a pass and his willingness to attack with speed and control make him an exciting prospect for a Real Madrid team intent on playing a counter-attacking style of football. After beating Atletico Madrid in the Champions League final last season, Real Madrid will want to ensure it keeps up its trophy-winning ways. Rodriguez follows World Cup winner Toni Kroos to the Bernabeu -- the Germany midfielder was bought for a reported $34 million from Bayern Munich last week.","World Cup Golden Boot winner James Rodriguez joins Real Madrid on six-year contract .

"(CNN) -- At an age when most pensioners are winding down their lives, Fauja Singh began a new one. In his late 80s, and feeling ""more dead than alive"" following the loss of his wife and one of his sons, he took up marathon running. Now 102, he has become an unlikely celebrity despite a birth defect that prevented him being able to walk until the age of five. ""Running showed me kindness and brought me back to life by making me forget all my traumas and sorrows,"" he told CNN's Human to Hero series. ""When I took up running, it was like meeting God himself. I have been running ever since."" With his distinctive flowing grey beard and the traditional Sikh headgear that has earned him the nickname ""the Turbaned Tornado,"" Singh has been a star entrant at marathons all over the world. It is a far cry from his humble upbringing in India, which despite its village tranquillity was also a test for the young Singh -- who was unable to walk until he was five due to weakness in his legs. ""It took me another five years to gain strength and become strong. By age 10 I was living a normal life,"" he recalls. While many older people suffer bodily deterioration, Singh said tests done when he was 94 showed his left leg had the bone density of a 35-year-old and his right leg that of a 25-year-old. ""My response was, I knew my left leg was weak,"" he smiles. As he says later: ""Life is a waste without humor -- living is all about happiness and laughter."" More medical tests done when he was 99 ""showed that I was a man of 40 years of age."" Singh grew up in a village in the Jalandhar district of the north-western Punjab state along with his four brothers and sisters and their parents. ""One doesn't know about life's complexities at that age. Whatever means one has always seems to be enough,"" he said. ""Life was good because we had land and animals ... there was no stress."" Singh now lives in London, the UK's bustling capital city, having finally made it his home in the 1990s after several trips to Britain. ""After my wife died and when I suffered another tragedy -- the loss of my son -- I came here for two years but I didn't like it as my mind was still in India. Eventually I had to come to terms with it,"" he said. ""Then I took up running -- eventually I was able to overcome my sadness."" Singh started out competing over shorter distances -- from 100 meters up -- but was convinced to try for the 26 miles and 385 yards that makes up a marathon. ""I had run a 20K but I couldn't tell the difference between a kilometer and a mile -- I thought I had done 20 miles so I thought I could do the other six quite easily,"" he said. ""Then I met Harmander (Singh, his longtime coach and mentor), he trained me in a couple of months to run the full distance -- and then I was 89 years old."" Singh's fastest time is the five hours and 40 minutes he took to run the 2003 Toronto Waterfront Marathon at the age of 92. Eight years later he returned to the Canadian event to become the first marathon centenarian, this time clocking more than eight hours. It was not accepted by Guinness World Records' rule-keepers due to his lack of a birth certificate, although he did produce a letter from Britain's Queen Elizabeth congratulating him on his 100th birthday. Just days earlier he had set five world records for his age group in the space of a few hours in events from 100m to 5,000m at a Masters meeting in Toronto. As well as soothing his soul, running has also brought Singh unexpected fame -- he appeared in an Adidas advertising campaign along with soccer superstar David Beckham and boxing legend Muhammad Ali in 2004. ""I was really, really happy as I didn't even know who these people were before that,"" he said. Most of Singh's marathons were charity fundraisers, in line with his Sikh beliefs. ""There are two noble things in life: one to do charity and other to look after your body,"" he said. ""This includes the high principles outlined by my religion, to earn an honest living and to share your means with those less fortunate. ""I am inspired by honest people who don't cheat others. To me the famous are those who are kind to fellow human beings and dedicate their life to charity."" And it is religion that helps him keep going when he hits the dreaded ""wall"" during a race -- he experiences the transcendental effect of such exercise that was so eloquently documented by Japanese author Haruki Murakami in his book ""What I Talk About When I Talk About Running."" ""The first part of the run is when I am quite cheerful; my heart is singing a song and dancing seeing the different colors of life,"" Singh said. ""When I get really tired, I start chanting God's name: 'Waheguru, Waheguru.' ""Running also makes people more spiritually aware and in-tune with their inner self. A retired marathon runner will still retain all these qualities."" And having become the world's oldest marathon runner, Singh is indeed now retired. His final race was the 10-kilometer event ahead of February's Hong Kong marathon, after which he took the advice of his family and Harmander Singh. ""I have retired because given my age, my body has deteriorated a bit, but retirement hasn't slowed me down,"" he said. ""I lead a very active and healthy life. I walk for three to four hours a day, play with kids and do all my day-to-day chores myself. I might have continued to run for another year but I realized I had to eventually retire one day."" A strict vegetarian (he appeared in a campaign by animal rights group PETA) Singh describes himself as ""an illiterate person"" -- this interview was translated from Punjabi with the help of his coach. While he lives a simple life -- in bed by 10 p.m. after relaxing listening to Punjabi radio, and up again by 6 a.m. -- he does admit to one guilty pleasure: shopping. ""Though I am an old man now, I am still very particular about my personal style. I love shopping for suits and shoes -- I keep looking for the latest and best available,"" Singh said. ""I don't have many expenses but I do spend often on new suits and shoes even though I have a lot of them."" Running shoes, in particular, remind him of the happiness he has discovered. ""I am very fond of my running shoes, I absolutely love them. I wear them for pleasure. I can't imagine my life without them.""","Fauja Singh was the first 100-year-old to ever run a marathon .

"(CNN) -- Several University of Notre Dame students, including four football players, are being investigated over academic fraud allegations, the university said. Notre Dame Director of Athletics Jack Swarbrick confirmed Friday that the football players are wide receiver DaVaris Daniels, defensive back KeiVarae Russell, defensive lineman Ishaq Williams and linebacker Kendall Moore. The four will be held out of practice and upcoming game action until the investigation is complete. ""Integrity is at the heart of our mission and academic misconduct will not be tolerated at Notre Dame,"" university President the Rev. John I. Jenkins said in a statement. ""If the suspected improprieties are proven, we will use the experience to reinforce among our students the importance of honesty in all that they do. We are also examining ways of better conveying to students that they can avail themselves of legitimate academic assistance without resorting to cheating."" Notre Dame said in the statement it has evidence that students had submitted papers and homework that had been written for them by others. The university said this was detected at the end of the summer session and referred to the compliance office in athletics on July 29. NCAA discussing how it deals with academic fraud . The school said if it determines that the football players were engaged in improprieties during past competition, it will vacate any victories in which those players participated. It notified the NCAA on Friday morning of the potential violations. At a Friday news conference, Jenkins said, ""It will take as long as it takes"" to complete the investigation, but he wouldn't give an estimated timetable. He said he was not prepared to say how many students were involved. ""We'll go as quickly as we can, but our emphasis will be on thoroughness,"" Jenkins said. Swarbrick and Jenkins said head football coach Brian Kelly and his staff have been cooperating in the investigation. Jenkins added that there is no evidence that Kelly or his assistant coaches knew about the potential academic fraud. ""We have great confidence in Brian and his staff,"" Jenkins said. Swarbrick told Kelly of the investigation on Thursday. ""For me, my emotions were shock and disappointment,"" Kelly told reporters Saturday. ""I feel for the four young men."" The coach won't be involved in the investigation. He also didn't have a lot of information about the accusations, he said. The team suited up and practiced in South Bend, Indiana. A knot of fans watched from the stands. ""I will be on the outside looking in, as it relates to this process,"" Kelly said of the investigation. ""I've got a job to do, and I have another 100 players that I have to be concerned with."" The students and student-athletes involved in the investigation will remain enrolled until the investigation is complete. ""The University is committed to thorough resolution of this matter, consistent with its commitment to academic integrity and adherence to NCAA rules,"" Jenkins said. CNN reached out to Notre Dame athletic department officials in an attempt to get statements from the football players, but the university did not immediately respond. This isn't the first time a member of the Irish football team has been linked to alleged academic improprieties. Quarterback Everett Golson, a key member of the Irish team that went undefeated in the 2012 regular season and lost the BCS national championship game to Alabama, was dismissed from the school in May 2013 for what he called ""poor academic judgment."" He was suspended for the fall semester. At the time, Golson did not release details on what led to his suspension. Golson has since returned to Notre Dame and regained the Irish starting quarterback job earlier this week. He is not implicated in this academic fraud investigation.

"(CNN) -- Pakistan and India exchanged fire near the border in the disputed Kashmir region early Saturday, killing at least two people from each country. The Indian paramilitary border security force said Pakistani forces fired shots and mortar rounds near the border, killing a father and his 8-year-old son, and injuring four others, including a trooper. A spokesman for the security force called the action from the Pakistani side ""unprovoked."" The Pakistani military said an intermittent exchange of fire continues between the countries. It accused Indian troops of ""unprovoked"" opening fire on the working boundary near Sialkot, killing two civilians -- a woman and a 60-year-old man. The two nuclear-armed countries agreed to a bilateral ceasefire in November 2003. But while it has held well, it has suffered breaches since last year. The latest round of violence has triggered the dislocation of more than 1,000 border residents, an Indian official said. Kashmir has been in the throes of separatist violence since 1989; officials say it has claimed 42,000 lives, but rights groups and nongovernmental organizations put the number at twice that. Talks called off . The latest bloodshed comes amid recent diplomatic tensions. India called off talks planned for Monday with Islamabad after Pakistan's New Delhi-based high commissioner, Abdul Basit, invited Kashmiri separatist leaders for consultations ahead of the summit. The New Delhi foreign secretary told Basit ""in clear and unambiguous terms, that Pakistan's continued efforts to interfere in India's internal affairs were unacceptable,"" India's External Affairs Ministry said in a statement. ""The meetings with these so-called leaders of the Hurriyat undermines the constructive diplomatic engagement initiated by Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi in May on his very first day in office,"" the ministry said. But Pakistan said in a statement it is a ""longstanding practice"" to meet with Kashmiri leaders before India-Pakistani talks are held. ""The Indian decision is a setback to the efforts by our leadership to promote good neighborly relations with India. The prime minister of Pakistan has clearly articulated the vision of peace for development,"" the statement said. ""It seems a knee-jerk reaction,"" said Mirwaiz Moulvi Umar Farooq, a moderate Kashmiri separatist leader. ""We have been meeting the Pakistani officials, including the country's New Delhi-based high commissioner, for the past 20 years. I don't know what happened today. It is a backward step."" He said the move is short-sighted. ""The decision lacks political maturity and cannot be termed as far-sighted,"" he said. 'Not a good development' Hardline separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani described the decision as unfortunate, saying it proved that ""New Delhi was never serious to resolve Kashmir peacefully."" Even mainstream political parties have expressed dismay at the cancellation of the talks. ""It is not a good development. The separatists have been meeting Pakistani officials. They even met the then-Pakistan president, Pervez Musharraf,"" said Ali Mohammad Sagar, a senior ruling National Conference leader and minister. During his visit to Indian-administered Kashmir this month, Modi condemned ""the continued proxy war by neighboring Pakistan."" Addressing army officers and soldiers in the frontier Ladakh region bordering China and Pakistan, Modi said that ""the neighboring country has lost the strength to fight a conventional war but continues to engage in the proxy war of terrorism."" Modi's criticism of Islamabad came against in the backdrop of reported ceasefire violations by Pakistani troops on the border and increased militant attacks in Kashmir.

"(CNN) -- Paint, wine and noodles -- three things which won't help Manchester United on the football pitch, but are helping swell the club's bank balance. While Louis van Gaal's team lost its opening English Premier League game of the 2013-14 season to Swansea, some consolation for United is being provided by its innovative sponsorship deals and partnerships with companies around the globe. The Old Trafford team's strategy of capitalizing on its worldwide appeal by targeting localized sponsorships and partnerships has generated $42.6 million (â‚¬32m) across 38 separate deals. It's a strategy that began six years ago when United signed a deal with Diageo's Smirnoff vodka brand as its ""responsible drinking partner"" in Asia-Pacific. In Malaysia, TM is its official telecommunications partner, while in Saudi Arabia it's STC -- and the list is growing. United is now generating over 350% more revenue through these type of deals than its nearest challenger Barcelona, according to a report published by sports market research company Repucom, though in comparison to television revenue the income from these deals is still relatively small. Having started in the 2013-2014 season , the Premier League's current three-year television deal is worth $9.4 billion -- $5.7 billion for domestic rights, the rest for overseas. By way of comparison 84 localized sponsorship deals accounted for over â‚¬54m ($72m) in income for 20 top European clubs In the 2013-14 season. Even so, other top clubs are upping their game, with Barcelona appointing Tecate as its official beer in Mexico, while United's archrival Liverpool has ComeOn! as official betting partner in Scandinavia. United's neighbor Manchester City, recently sanctioned by UEFA for breaching Financial Fair Play rules, is acutely aware of the need to raise additional sponsorship income and did six deals -- including one with Saigon Hanoi Bank as its official debit card partner in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. ""Whilst broadcast rights remain the biggest income stream for clubs in Europe, commercial activities are the second largest contributor, accounting for 29% of all revenues made. Identifying new ways to increase the value of these deals is incredibly important,"" Repucom's football expert Andrew Walsh told CNN. United's efforts to capitalize on its global following gathered pace after the late Malcolm Glazer and his family took control of the club in 2005. The Glazers, who already owned an NFL franchise, quickly realized the potential for established brands to become associated with the success of the EPL club under former manager Alex Ferguson . Back then, most clubs' principal sponsor had its name emblazoned across the teams' strip, and it remains a key source of income. General Motors will be paying United $80 million per season for seven years to have the Chevrolet logo displayed on the kit, but the marketing operation now extends across some unlikely areas. Casillero Del Diablo is United's official wine, there's an official medical partner -- Toshiba Medical Systems -- and even an official noodle partner, Nissin Food Groups. Underneath these overarching global deals come the local and regional partners, with the Asia-Pacific region the most fertile. But other territories offer great potential for further exploitation, and the growing popularity of football in North America is a case in point. ""Markets such as the U.S. pose as a great opportunity for these clubs too in developing this trend, as leagues such as the Premier League become more influential in North America,"" said Walsh. Astute marketeers are also keeping in touch with the latest developments in social media, where individual fan loyalty can be tapped, again with a local offer. ""Increasingly, companies are focusing more on the individual consumer, not just a general population, tailoring products and services to better suit the end user,"" added Walsh. ""The trend we are seeing with Europe's top football clubs illustrates that perfectly through the way they segment their commercial assets for specific, localized markets and in turn, that market's fan base."" But for the strategy to be fully exploited, it's necessary for the clubs to achieve success on the pitch, so for United the season ahead under van Gaal is crucial. David Moyes' reign was abruptly cut short by the Glazers as results failed to meet expectation, with United finishing seventh in the EPL and failing to win a trophy other than the preseason FA Community Shield. Van Gaal is charged with restoring the club's fortunes to ensure the cash keeps coming in from commercial activities but will also be hoping that his transfer budget reflects that continuing success story. So as United looks to raise funds for player purchases, it won't stop at noodles and wine.","Manchester United leads the way in localized sponsorship deals .

"(CNN) -- President Obama was crying. Not choked up, not somewhat emotional. He was crying. It was a startling sight -- after years of watching the man known for his coolness under pressure, for his analytic detachment -- to see him suddenly wearing his heart on his rolled up sleeve. What happened? What made the president â€” ""No Drama Obama,"" ""President Spock"" -- suddenly crack? It happened Wednesday, the day after he won re-election, when he stood before the staff at his Chicago campaign headquarters to thank them for the work that helped make his victory possible. ""What you guys have done,"" he said, ""means that the work that I'm doing is important."" His right index finger quickly wiped away tears as they streamed down his cheek. Perhaps Obama felt emotionally overpowered by what awaits him even before he finishes his first term. The country is careering toward the ""fiscal cliff,"" which really is the wrong term. It's more a fiscal suicide (fiscacide?) if the government irresponsibly pushes the country into a self-inflicted recession, complete with a renewed rise in unemployment. Without an agreement with Republicans, Americans, including Obama supporters weeping with him in that room, will face higher taxes and across-the-board spending cuts. Martin: Why voter suppression fueled black turnout . There's more to get choked up about on the fiscal front. Even with an agreement, Obama will preside over higher taxes and spending cuts in months and years to come. Maybe thoughts about the economy brought to mind the crisis in Europe, America's economic, political and diplomatic soul mate, where a fiscal crisis will not relent; where protesters continue taking to the streets in Greece, Spain and elsewhere, and where European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi just said there are few signs of recovery and there is not much more the bank can do to help Greece. A European unraveling would be terrible news for America. But that's probably not what made him cry. Maybe he was thinking about other matter beyond U.S. shores, considering what awaits the people of Afghanistan, particularly the women there, when U.S. forces leave. Maybe he was thinking about what to do in Syria, where the killing continues unabated and refugees are fleeing by the thousands. Or was he thinking about the intensifying confrontation with Iran? Just last week, Iranian fighter jets fired on an unarmed U.S drone flying over the Persian Gulf. On Monday, the head of the U.N.'s nuclear agency said Iran is not cooperating with an investigation on possible nuclear weapons work, after the agency reported ""credible evidence"" of Iran's efforts to build a ""nuclear explosive device."" LZ: Obama's critics, repudiated at last . Maybe Obama was crying tears of joy. Maybe he was crying because of what winning re-election means. Maybe he was savoring the realization that election to a second term means the American people, however divided their vote, have given a seal of approval to his presidency; that if he had lost this election, he might have gone down in history as a failed president, rejected by voters after they gave him that first chance to prove himself. Perhaps it was the knowledge that he will have another four years to pursue his agenda; or his new hope that this time around, there's a chance, however faint, that Republicans and Democrats will find a way to work together. That would bring the entire country to tears. Opinion: My generation showed up . Or maybe Obama worried about the perils of a second term, when other presidents have found the political landscape littered with scandals, often caused by overconfidence among their own staff, by entrenched officials spending too much time at their jobs, growing arrogant after getting used to power. It's more likely, however, that he was moved precisely by what he was saying, by the thought that he was inspiring a new generation, that all the hard work was not in vain. That watching his eager, overjoyed supporters, he felt, as he told them, ""that the work that I had done in running for office had come full circle,"" and the weight of history, the knowledge that his impact will transcend him, gradually made its way from his mind to his heart. But no, I believe it was something else. I think Obama cried because he was exhausted, physically and emotionally, and that exhaustion broke through the emotional barriers he has built since he was a child. He gave us the clues to the origins of his coolness in the pages of his memoir ""Dreams from My Father."" ""People were satisfied so long as you were courteous and smiled and made no sudden moves,"" he wrote. ""They were more than satisfied; they were relieved -- such a pleasant surprise to find a well-mannered young black man who didn't seem angry all the time."" Obama learned to keep calm; to conceal his emotions. But four years in the White House, months of presidential campaigning, the final stretch of competing in an election whose outcome was in doubt until the very end, it takes its toll. It caused a small shift in that thick earthen dam, a tiny leak. And that's where the emotions trickled out. That's where the sense of gratitude, the sense of history, the stress over what he has faced over half a decade -- as president and as a candidate the first time around -- finally broke through. And what we saw, after all that, was a brief, if startling display of presidential emotion. It was a rare display, but now Obama may not find it possible to completely rebuild that fractured dam. I expect the next four years we will see a more emotive president. Now the secret of Obama's emotions may not remain hidden in the safety of the East Wing, where only his family can see it. Obama's re-election allows him to show his human side with less trepidation. Decades of self-control won't fade away. But the president has shown himself and the majority of voters said they liked what they saw. Obama II will remain cool, but he will allow himself to become less emotionally detached. After all, even Mr. Spock cried sometimes. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: It was startling to see Obama get emotional in talk to campaign workers .
She says there are many woes he faces: looming ""fiscal cliff,"" Iran, Syria, the Europe crisis .
She says maybe tears of joy? But no, it's likely exhaustion finally broke through his facade .

"(CNN) -- As a first-grade teacher, Julie Miller is exposed to a horrifying number of germs on a daily basis. ""I've been thrown up on; they sneeze and cough on me. And lost teeth are a real big thing for first-graders,"" said Miller, who teaches at Spring Hills Elementary in the suburbs of Chicago. ""They're so cute and unaware, though. They'll have boogers hanging out of their nose and will be talking to you and not think anything of it. Some teachers flip out, but I tell my students, 'Go get a Kleenex and wash your hands.' When they sneeze, I teach them to do it into their elbows. They learn eventually."" On average, elementary school children get eight to 12 colds or cases of the flu each school year, according to the CDC. For the older kids, it is about half that. Teachers and parents commonly refer to it as the Back-to-School Plague. But there are simple ways to keep your kids healthy. Miller, who is getting her son Justin ready to go to kindergarten, isn't worried. ""I've taught my kids healthy habits; I'm sure they'll be fine,"" Miller said. She makes sure they get plenty of sleep, exercise regularly and eat healthy food. She's taught her children to wash their hands often, and she's hooked antibacterial gels on their backpacks for when they can't. ""I'm not a germaphobe like some of my colleagues who have put antibacterial lotion all over the place: their cars, their classrooms,"" Miller said. ""I do feel like some germs are OK."" Danger zones . Germ candy stores: that's what Dr. Harley Rotbart, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Colorado and author of the book ""Germ Proof Your Kids,"" calls schools. ""It is stunning how many times kids touch their faces and then touch other kids,"" Rotbart said. ""This is a very touchy-feely demographic, and that's how we share germs. ... And the little ones don't have the same exposure to germs that we do, so until their immune systems get built up, they get sick."" Schools are full of ""hot zones"" for germs, Rotbart says. ""Most people think that's the bathroom, but it really isn't. Those get regularly cleaned."" If he had to rank the germiest places in school, No. 1 would be the drinking fountain. It's germier than the toilet seat, he says, but ""doesn't get disinfected as much."" Plus, it's the perfect spot for kids to ingest these microorganisms as they put their mouths on the stream of water -- or right on the fountain itself. Rotbart suggests teaching students to run the water a little first and then drink. Or better yet, children should bring their own water bottles to school and not share them with anyone. Cafeteria trays are another germ hot zone. ""Those don't get wiped down nearly as well,"" he said, recommending that kids bring the tray to their table and then use hand sanitizer before they pick up their food. ""There is a real delicate balance though; we don't want to make kids paranoid,"" Rotbart said. ""We need to be prudent. Germs for people who are healthy really aren't a big deal."" Staying healthy . Rotbart tells parents to make sure their children get enough rest. School-age children should get get 10 to 11 hours of sleep every night, according to the CDC. Sleep deprivation lowers the immune system's ability to fight off infection. Exercise, Rotbart says, is another effective way to keep kids healthy. He suggests a daily dose of 40 minutes of running-around time, even in the winter. If it's cold, children need to keep their jackets zipped and hats on their heads. ""Your mother was right: Studies have shown that people who do bundle up against the cold are less likely to catch colds later on in the year,"" Rotbart said. Your child's diet also plays an important role in warding off illness. Foods rich in vitamin C (PDF) don't keep colds away altogether, but they can shorten the length of a cold. And make sure little Johnny or Julie gets a flu shot early in the season. In order to stop germs from ever entering the body, hand-washing is key. Every year, Miller invites a nurse to teach her first graders the proper techniques. ""I've got a bathroom with a poster about hand-washing right in my classroom, and if I don't hear them wash their hands -- even if I'm in the middle of a lesson and the principal is doing my evaluation -- I stop what I'm doing and say, 'Wash your hands,' "" Miller said. ""It's that important."" Judy Harrison, a foods and nutrition professor at the University of Georgia, says studies she's conducted show that most kids don't know how to wash their hands properly (only 28% knew the right method). Properly washed hands cut down on gastrointestinal problems, as well as the cold and flu. Harrison designed the ""Wash Your Paws, Georgia!"" (PDF) hand-washing initiative. ""I teach them to sing 'happy birthday' to yourself twice to make sure they wash for at least 20 seconds,"" Harrison said. She also teaches them to clean between their fingers and around their fingernails and to use a clean paper towel or a hot air dryer to dry off. A lot of people think hand sanitizer is better, she says, but really, washing with soap and water is the most effective way to eliminate germs. ""My kids are obsessed with hand sanitizer,"" said Amy Falcone, a seventh-grade science teacher who teaches at Wood Dale Junior High in the suburbs of Chicago. ""It's a part of the school supply list we send home for kids to bring, along with Kleenex. I'd prefer they wash their hands, but I know it will do in a pinch."" Falcone used to think the ""school plague"" was more of an elementary school thing, but with increasing pressure to get good grades, some older students do come to school sick. And that gets others sick. ""I've never been a sickly person, but I did catch strep throat about three years ago,"" Falcone said. ""I've never had it in my entire life, but I had it. Got rid of it. Got it again."" Falcone's been teaching for more than 20 years. She's noticed that some of the newer teachers are getting sick more often. ""When you are new, you are killing yourself to impress, and some young teachers really do forget to take care of themselves,"" Falcone said. She advises new teachers to make sure they keep up with their own healthy habits. ""Eat healthy, get sleep, do whatever you do to reduce stress."" Falcone coaches her school's Girls on the Run program. It helps her and her students decompress, as well as stay in shape. ""That's especially important for me as a teacher. I can't really miss school,"" she said. ""I've got kids lined up at my door every morning. I need to be there for them. Staying healthy is totally doable.""","CDC: Elementary kids get eight to 12 colds or cases of the flu every school year .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- A man using a metal detector in a rural English field has uncovered the largest Anglo-Saxon gold hoard ever found -- an ""unprecedented"" treasure that sheds new light on history, archaeologists said Thursday. A gold strip with a Biblical inscription was among the 1,500 pieces unearthed in an English field. The hoard includes 5 kilograms (11 pounds) of gold and 2.5 kilograms (5.5 pounds) of silver. That is more than three times the amount of gold found at Sutton Hoo, one of Britain's most important Anglo-Saxon sites, said the local council in Staffordshire where the latest haul was found. It's an ""incredible collection of material -- absolutely unprecedented,"" said Kevin Leahy, an archaeologist with the Portable Antiquities Scheme, a voluntary group that records finds made by members of the public. ""We've moved into new ground with this material."" Because the find is so large and important, experts haven't been able to say yet how much it is worth. They hope to make a valuation within 13 months, Staffordshire Council said. Watch report on discovered treasure » . The hoard was discovered in July by Englishman Terry Herbert, who was using a metal detector he bought more than a decade ago in a jumble sale for only a few pounds (dollars). He belongs to a local metal detecting club in Staffordshire and was just out enjoying his hobby when he made the find. There was so much gold at the site that Herbert said he was soon seeing it in his sleep. ""Imagine you're at home and somebody just keeps putting money through your letterbox. That's what it was like,"" Herbert told Britain's Press Association. ""As soon as I closed my eyes I saw gold patterns. I didn't think it was ever going to end."" Herbert found 500 items before he called in experts, who then found a further 800 articles in the soil. Officials aren't saying exactly where the gold was found, other than to say it was in Staffordshire, in north-central England. ""Pieces were just literally sat at the top of the soil, at the grass,"" said Ian Wykes, of the county council. He said the hoard had been unearthed by recent plowing. Most of the pieces appear to date from the 7th century, though experts can't agree on when the hoard first entered the ground, Staffordshire Council said. The pieces are almost all war gear, Leahy said. There are very few dress fittings and no feminine dress fittings; there are only two gold buckles, and they were probably used for harness armor, he said. Sword hilt fittings and pieces of helmets, all elaborately decorated, are among the more remarkable finds. ""The quantity of gold is amazing but, more importantly, the craftsmanship is consummate,"" Leahy said. ""This was the very best that the Anglo-Saxon metalworkers could do, and they were very good. Tiny garnets were cut to shape and set in a mass of cells to give a rich, glowing effect; it is stunning."" The items belonged to the elite -- aristocracy or royalty, he said, though it's not clear who the original or final owners were, why they buried it, or when. ""It looks like a collection of trophies, but it is impossible to say if the hoard was the spoils from a single battle or a long and highly successful military career,"" he said. More work will help determine how the hoard came to be buried in the field, Leahy said. Many of the objects are inlaid with garnets, which Leahy called ""stunning"" and ""as good as it gets."" The filigree on the items is ""incredible,"" he said. Some are decorated in an Anglo-Saxon style consisting of strange animals intertwined with each other. That decoration appears on what is believed to be the cheek-piece of a helmet, decorated with a frieze of running, interlaced animals. A strip of gold bearing a Biblical inscription in Latin is one of the most significant and controversial finds, Staffordshire Council said. One expert believes the lettering dates from the 7th or early 8th centuries, but another is sure it dates from the 8th or 9th centuries. The inscription, misspelled in places, is probably from the Book of Numbers and reads: ""Surge domine et dissipentur inimici tui et fugiant qui oderunt te a facie tua,"" or ""Rise up, o Lord, and may thy enemies be dispersed, and let them that hate thee, flee from before thy face."" Regardless of the exact date, the hoard is certainly from a period of great turmoil, when kingdoms with tribal loyalties battled each other in a state of perpetual warfare, experts say. The land was also split along religious lines. Christianity was the principal religion, having gained ground at the expense of local pagan forms of worship, experts said. At least two crosses are among the items in the hoard. The largest is intact, though it has been folded, possibly to make it fit into a small space prior to burial, Staffordshire Council said. The folding may mean it was buried by pagans who had little respect for the Christian symbol, but it may have also been done by Christians who had taken it from someone else's shrine, experts said. The hoard will likely help rewrite history, experts said. ""Earlier finds will be looked at in the context of what we find amongst this mass of material,"" Leahy said. Said Leslie Webster, the former keeper of the Department of Prehistory and Europe at the British Museum, ""This is going to alter our perceptions of Anglo-Saxon England."" Excavation of the field where the hoard was found is now complete, and all items that were found are being held at the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery. The most important objects will go on exhibit from Friday until October 13, after which they will go to the British Museum in London for valuation. Once the items have been valued, Staffordshire Council said it hopes a selection of the pieces can go on temporary display at the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery in Stoke-on-Trent. Once the hoard is sold, the market value of the find will go to Herbert and the owner of the field where the hoard was discovered. The pair have agreed to split the amount.","Amateur metal detectorist found treasure in a field in Staffordshire, England .

"(CNN) -- At least 48 people were killed when a twin-engine turboprop plane crashed Wednesday while attempting to land in Taiwan's Penghu Islands, according to Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration. Officials say 10 people were injured in the plane crash and that five residents on the ground were also hurt. Taiwan's Transportation Minister Yeh Kuang-shih told reporters there were no casualties on the ground. Taiwanese authorities are now identifying victims and investigating the cause of the crash. Two of the people killed were believed to be French passengers, identified as Jeromine Deramond and Penelope Luternauer, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency. One of those on the passenger's list was an 82-year-old Taiwanese wood craftsman, according to local Taiwanese media. Footage aired on CNN affiliate ETTV showed the plane had crashed in a residential area and broken into pieces. ETTV reported that the fallen plane destroyed or damaged 11 houses. The central weather bureau reported lightning storms at the time and winds between 40 and 45 mph, the news agency said. Injured passengers were taken to Penghu Hospital, and TransAsia Airways established an emergency response center, according to a statement issued by the airline. The president of TransAsia Airways, Chooi Yee-choong, appeared briefly at a news conference and bowed in front of news cameras. He choked up as he expressed his sorrow to passengers' families and the public. ""I sincerely apologize,"" he said. Before Flight GE222 took off from Kaohsiung, Taiwan, it had been delayed because of conditions related to a typhoon, the airline said. The plane was a 72-seat twin-engine turboprop ATR 72. ""TransAsia Airways is exhausting all means to assist passengers, victims and families"" and working with investigators, its statement read. One of the plane's flight data recorders was recovered, and investigators will examine the crash site Thursday, the minister said. The plane crashed near Magong Airport at about 7 p.m., according to CNA. Witnesses told ETTV that they saw homes on fire. The cause of the crash is unknown. Some media reports said strong winds from Typhoon Matmo, which hit Taiwan early Wednesday, forced the plane to attempt a crash landing. Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration director, Jean Shen told reporters that visibility at Magong Airport at the time of the plane's attempted landing was about 1,600 meters (1 mile) and considered acceptable for landing. The Penghu Islands are off the west coast of the main Taiwanese island. Typhoon Matmo threatens mudslides in Taiwan .

"(CNN) -- How do Burmese punks keep their mohawks standing tall? Why does cash in Myanmar need to be kept clean? What does making a kissing sound in a Yangon restaurant get you? As recently as a year ago, few people would have cared about the answers to any of these questions. But newfound political freedom has brought a surge in tourism to the once isolated country, making Myanmar a 2013 traveler's hot spot, and a place worth getting up to speed on. Fall in love with Burmese food . 1. New Year celebrations last four days . The Burmese make a big deal of the New Year. Thingyan, known as the ""water throwing festival,"" is celebrated in April. This year it takes place April 13-16. Everything shuts down over the four-day New Year -- banks, restaurants, shops. The biggest celebrations are in Yangon and Mandalay. During the New Year water-throwing frenzy everyone throws and sprays water at each other. Staying dry isn't an option. Water symbolizes the washing away of the previous year's bad luck and sins. On New Year's Day, the fourth day of the festival, fish and birds are released as acts of merit and feasts are held for monks. In recent years of privation, hard-core Burmese punks used leather glue to spike up their hair at New Year. The superstrong glue meant their mohawks stayed standing through the Water Festival, but when the party was over they had to shave their hair. These days, Burmese punks use hairspray. Myanmar: Is now a good time to go? 2. Myanmar has fantastic beaches . Myanmar has 1,250 miles (2,000 kilometers) of coastline and some of the finest stretches of beach in Asia. Many beaches along the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea remain undiscovered by tourists and unspoiled by development. Many of them face west, so they produce great sunsets. The best known is Ngapali Beach, a 45-minute flight from Yangon, where almost two miles of white sand are lined with palm trees overlooking the Andaman Sea. Here, you'll find a number of large resorts. Less developed is Ngwe Saung, a beautifully unspoiled beach that's a five-hour drive from Yangon. Also called Silver Beach, its eight-mile (13 kilometers) stretch makes it one of the longest beaches in Asia. 3. The Internet isn't censored anymore, but it's still slow . The Internet arrived in Myanmar in 2000, but high prices and slow connections mean it's still not widely used. Under the former government, websites such as YouTube and Gmail were blocked, but restrictions have largely been lifted and last month Google chairman Eric Schmidt visited the country. Far more popular than the Internet are mobile phones, though here, too, prices are high compared with other Asian countries. Local IT firms are lobbying to introduce cheaper SIM cards and a breakthrough is expected soon. A U.S.$15 SIM card for mobile phones will be made available in June, in the run-up to the Southeast Asian Games to be held in Myanmar in December, but will be available only to foreigners. 4. You'll need plenty of cash -- and make sure it's clean . There are few ATMs in Myanmar, so visitors need to bring plenty of U.S. dollars. The higher the denomination, the better the exchange rate. Your greenbacks should be squeaky clean -- that means no creases, stains, marks or tears. A note that's folded or even a little worn is worthless in Myanmar. At present, credit cards are accepted only in five-star hotels and up-market shops and restaurants, usually with a 2-3% fee added to the bill. But this is changing. By the end of the year, credit cards should be more widely accepted. The local currency is the kyat (pronounced ""chat"") and U.S.$1 will get you about 882 kyat. The new 10,000-kyat note (less than U.S.$12) is the highest denomination -- be prepared for a bulging wallet. There's little worry about carrying a lot of cash. Crime against foreigners is rare and the Burmese -- the vast majority of whom are Buddhist -- are generally honest. Myanmar records 1 million tourists, surge in tourism income . 5. A kissing sound gets you a beer . When the Burmese want to get a waiter's attention they make a kissing sound, usually two or three short kisses. It's the sort of sound you might make if calling a cat. Walk down 19 Street in Yangon's Chinatown and you'll hear that kissing sound a lot. This narrow, pedestrian-only street is where the Burmese come to drink. Restaurants line either side of the street and chairs and tables are set out in front. The local brew is Myanmar Beer and it's cheap -- about 60 cents for a glass of draught. This is prime people-watching territory and if you keep an eye out you'll spot Yangon's hip-hop royalty on the prowl. Just don't expect to see any females. Most Burmese women -- married and single -- stay home in the evening. That's not to say Western women aren't welcome. It's understood that foreigners have different customs. 6. Hotels are expensive . Room rates shot up 350% last year, which means that a room that cost U.S.$25 a night in 2011 now goes for almost U.S.$100. It's a simple matter of supply and demand. Since the country opened up, business travelers and tourists have been packing flights to Myanmar. There are a lot more visitors -- more than a million last year -- but roughly the same number of hotels. More hotels are on the way, but they take time to build and the hotel shortage is expected to continue five to 10 years. Book accommodation well ahead. A lot of hotels are renovating and since they don't want to miss out on the visitor boom, they're staying open while upgrading. When making a reservation it's worth checking to see if any work is in progress and, if so, requesting a room away from the noise. Myanmar hit by severe hotel shortage . 7. The men wear skirts . The traditional Burmese dress is the longyi, a wraparound skirt worn by men and women. Men tie theirs in the front and women fold the cloth over and secure it at the side. NLD Leader Aung San Suu Kyi is known for her beautiful longyis and tailored tops. Her high-profile appearances have helped boost the popularity of the traditional dress among young women in Myanmar. As for what's worn underneath, that's a matter of personal preference. In the cities, Burmese men usually wear underwear beneath their longyis when they go out, but at home wear it as the Scots wear their kilts. In the countryside, underwear is much less common -- for men and women. As one man jokingly put it: ""Longyi are great. Free air-conditioning."" That's a plus, especially when the summer temperature tips 104 F (40 C). It's completely acceptable for a foreigner to wear a longyi and can be a conversation starter. 8. The food is exceptional . It's considered rude to eat with the left hand as this is the hand used for personal hygiene. To spell that out -- the left hand does the job of toilet paper. So eating -- as well as giving money -- is always done with the right hand. A typical Burmese meal includes steamed rice, fish, meat, vegetables and soup and all the dishes arrive at the same time. The Burmese use their fingertips to mold the rice into a small ball and then mix it with various dishes. As is the norm, Buddhists usually avoid eating beef and the Muslims don't eat pork. Meals are served with plenty of condiments -- from sweet to savory -- and everyone has their preferred way of customizing a dish. Myanmar vs. Burma. Which do you prefer? 9. The trains are seriously bumpy . The poor condition of railway tracks means carriages get shaken about. This makes for a bouncy ride, but trains are still a great way to see the country. Myanmar's trains are slow and have a reputation for running late. The most reliable route, Yangon to Mandalay, takes about 16 hours, assuming no delays. On overnight trains, there's more chance of getting some shut-eye in an upper class seat than in a sleeper. It can get surprisingly cold a few hours after dusk, so it's smart to bring something warm to wear. Buses are usually a faster option, but they're often crowded. Domestic flights are the most comfortable way to cover long distances and relatively cheap. 10. Yangon has a newspaper vendor on every street corner . After five decades under a repressive military regime, the Burmese are enjoying their newfound press freedom and showing a healthy appetite for news. In the past, all publications had to submit their stories to the Press Scrutiny and Registration Division for approval. Censorship was gradually phased out in 2012 and at the beginning of this year the bureau was formally abolished. Under the former ruling military junta, Myanmar had a reputation for jailing anyone who dared voice opposition; that included many in the media. Last year was the first year since 1996 that no journalists were jailed. Burmese journalists who fled the country and were forced to live in exile are slowly returning. April 1 was a landmark for the country's media. For the first time since 1964, daily newspapers were permitted. It's a big step for press freedom, but there are concerns that some of the popular weekly newspapers will struggle to make the transition to daily circulation. 11. The people with red teeth aren't vampires . Chewing betel nut is a national pastime. Small street stalls selling the palm-sized green leaves are everywhere. The leaves are filled with hard squares of betel nut, spices and sometimes a pinch of tobacco and then folded up and popped in the mouth and chewed. You have to chew a while before you feel the mild narcotic effect of the betel nut. At about 6 cents a wrap it's a cheap hit, but there's a downside. Not only does betel nut stain your teeth a reddish-brown, the little packages are spat out on the floor when finished -- making for messy sidewalks. It's also highly addictive.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- If that corner office at a financial firm on New York's Wall Street or at London's Canary Wharf has been illusory, then a Victoria Harbor view from Hong Kong's skyscraper skyline may be the place to find yourself in a few years. That's because the Asian city looks set to become the center of the Earth when it comes to jobs in the financial sector. CEBR, the London-based economics consultancy, recently forecast Hong Kong will have more financial services jobs than New York or London by 2016, with some 262,000 positions. The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) also gives its endorsement, saying Hong Kong will be the world's premier financial job center by 2017, with 275,000 positions. Believable or bizarre? ""It's three years from now, but it's believable,"" says Brian Lim, director of Value Search Asia, a Hong Kong-based boutique headhunting firm focused on the banking and financial sectors. ""Asian opportunities are going to be a lot more stable. (The employment market) has been slow because of the European and U.S. economic crises -- not because of major issues from our side."" Lim says he does expect continued job volatility on the so-called ""sale side"" of the financial industry, which includes investment banking, because of sensitivity to market gyrations. But he already sees more hiring on the less-market sensitive ""buy side,"" which includes asset and wealth fund management. But other search firms find recent job market forecasts far-fetched. ""I think it's bizarre,"" says Jonathon Hollands, Managing Director of Carraway Group, a financial and corporate headhunting firm headquartered in Hong Kong. As the global economy has slowed over the past few years ""Hong Kong is shedding jobs."" This past September, HSBC finished its planned Hong Kong layoffs by eliminating 3,000 staff from its workforce in the city -- part of a global restructuring to cut an astounding 30,000 jobs around the world. Earlier this month, Barclays announced it will cut up to 2,000 jobs with many of those losses coming out of Asia and Europe. Hollands expects even more job losses in Hong Kong are ""still to come."" As proof, Hollands cites a steep drop-off in recruitment requests from global banks based in Hong Kong. He declines to name them but says they are easy to guess. ""The amount they spend on recruiters is 80-100% down. They haven't spent anything on headhunters in the past year."" Still, CEBR's Chief Executive Douglas McWilliams is preaching the message that Hong Kong will boast the most financial jobs by 2016. He says it is ""inevitable as a result of the world's changing economic geography. ""And Hong Kong will be boosted by the internationalization of the renminbi (China's currency). But we have accelerated the (West-to-East job) shift through short-sighted overregulation, penal taxation and banker bashing."" Despite those reasons, financial executives from the West will not necessarily secure a new job in the East. Three Ls . Language ability, links across Asia and localization are prime deciding factors for the success of a financial services job seeker. ""'How good is your Mandarin?' is one of the first questions you will be asked,"" says Carraway Group's Hollands. ""Mainland China's market has been badly serviced by private banks"" and opportunities exist if you can speak the language. The second question will be about the strength of your regional relationships across Asia. ""People have to have relationships -- not just from doing well in the front office but to asset management and private wealth management in particular,"" says Hollands. ""The longer one has lived in China, the better. The best is if you've grown up here."" ""(Financial services firms) are getting people who understand the local markets,"" adds Lim of Value Search Asia. ""They will hire a Korean to cover Korean markets, Chinese to cover the PRC. We do see a large inflow of European and U.S. bankers (seeking jobs), but (they are) finding it very difficult to get a job here because they don't understand the local markets. It's a safer bet to pick someone local."" A third question correlates with culture -- literally how far are you willing to go to give ""face."" ""I recently had a qualified candidate lose out,"" says Hollands. ""He is a Korean national who had lived in Hong Kong but is currently based in Los Angeles. The guy who got the job is a local Hong Konger, and he's here. He had a face-to-face-interview. A phone call or a video call just isn't the same."" ""Being here gets you 70% of the way."" Looking ahead two years, the decision to relocate from West to East hinges on whether you believe financial jobs will be easier to find in Hong Kong -- as opposed to London or New York -- and whether you believe you are that much better than the competition.","Reports suggest Hong Kong could become the world's financial capital in terms of jobs .
Many jobs expected to be on ""buy side"" of industry, in asset and wealth fund management .
Analysts expect more job volatility on ""sale side,"" which includes investment banking .

"(CNN) -- The wait is finally over. On Saturday night, ""Whovians"" (""Doctor Who"" fans) finally got their first full look at Peter Capaldi in his role as the Twelfth Doctor (with no karaoke or mimes in sight). He almost literally landed with a splash, as we first saw him and companion Clara being swallowed by a dinosaur who ended up in 19th century London. Because, obviously. Here are five of our favorite moments of what was a spectacular season premiere. 1. The new Doctor himself . The Doctor was still in a bit of post-regenerative hysteria, which led to some hilarious lines. He also, of course, took a few shots at his new look, especially the eyebrows (""These are attack eyebrows! You can take bottle tops off with these!"") and the fact that he's now Scottish. That was probably one of the biggest surprises: For a Doctor who is darker than the ones we're used to recently (he certainly doesn't have the wackiness of Matt Smith), there was a great deal of humor in the episode. When we saw his final costume toward the end of the episode, we've gotta say, the Twelfth Doctor is looking sharp. 2. Clara back how we remember her . When Clara first officially met the Doctor, she was in Victorian dress. Having ended up in the 19th century, she was dressed for the times once more. Whether it was a callback or not, the producers seemed to know that the look really suits Jenna Coleman (In fact, a lot of the memorable parts of this episode seemed to do with the clothes - see Madame Vastra and Jenny's battle gear as well). With a few episodes under her belt, Clara is the ""veteran"" of the show, and much of it revolved around her, especially with the Doctor being in a confused state for much of it. She had some trouble getting used to this new Doctor, having fallen for the last one (see below), but she had instant chemistry with the Twelfth. 3. The icky new villain . A restaurant where you're on the menu? The half-visaged android the Doctor met could give Hannibal Lecter a run for his money. Their face-off (sorry) toward the end was one of the most memorable confrontations in recent ""Doctor Who"" history as well. 4. A dinosaur in the Thames?! Not much to say here, except that tyrannosaurus rex was quite a way to kick off the season. 5. The Eleventh Doctor makes a call . The biggest surprise of them all was the Eleventh Doctor's time-shifted call to Clara at the end of the episode, asking her to take care of the new him. (Though he wasn't a big fan of looking old.) We'll miss you, Matt Smith! What were your favorite parts of the episode?","Peter Capaldi officially begins his run as the 12th Doctor on Saturday's 'Doctor Who' premiere .

"(CNN) -- Margaret Thatcher, one of the seminal political figures of the 20th century, will be remembered for her unswerving belief in the virtues of free market capitalism and the vices of socialism, and for her role in the downfall of communism. People might wonder why Thatcher evokes such positive emotion from young conservatives, such as me, who were children during her heyday. The answer is simple. In our era of politics in which spin seems to take precedence to substance, Margaret Thatcher was an icon for what politics should be about -- courage, spirit and the determination to change things for the better. In pursuit of the defeat of what she saw as socialist totalitarianism, she made a close alliance with U.S. President Ronald Reagan and built a relationship with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, while still standing firm in opposition to the Soviet empire. Without question, she was one of America's closest and most important friends and was instrumental in winning the Cold War for the West. Opinion: How 'Lady T' built transatlantic bridges . She refused to be bowed by terrorism and stood against it in all its forms. After the Irish Republican Army attempted to assassinate her and her Cabinet at the 1984 Conservative Convention in Brighton, narrowly missing Thatcher but killing five people, she insisted on continuing the conference the next day. ""The fact that we are gathered here now, shocked, but composed and determined, is a sign not only that this attack has failed, but that all attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail."" Her courage brought moral clarity in highlighting the atrocity of terrorism as a means of political activity. Her resolve to stand against any threat to British interests was clear in the Falklands War. After the invasion of British territory by Argentine military forces, Thatcher said it would not stand. Fully knowing the real prospect of defeat, Thatcher ordered a British military task force to re-take the islands. They did. Along with foreign policy successes, Thatcher, known as ""The Iron Lady,"" scored domestically. Facing high unemployment rates, a crippling union stranglehold and an unproductive, stagnating economy, the United Kingdom of the 1970s was a country in dire straits. Thatcher believed that pervasive unemployment and growing inflation were not just temporary threats, they were burying Britain's future. She believed the root causes were found not in the shifts of economic cycles, but in the failure of Britain's flawed economic model. Opinion: Why Thatcher made so many enemies . She guided Britain's economic base away from domestic monopolies and toward global capitalism. Because of her privatization and deregulation policies, the United Kingdom became a center for international finance and investment. In 1987, Thatcher was elected to a historic third term. Despite her successes politically, she was a polarizing presence and had relatively low approval ratings during her tenure. Many Britons detested her attempts to curb the unions, her cuts to social programs and education, and her introduction of the Community Charge, called the ""poll tax."" Her Cabinet did not share her views on the European Union. She resigned as prime minister after three terms in 1990, believing her party had betrayed her. Still, there can be no debate of her enduring impact. Tony Blair's historic 1997 election and return of the Labor Party to power is often pointed to as a moment of renewed liberalism in Britain. In many ways, it was. But under the banner of a new Labor and Blair's embrace of a ""third way,"" it is also evident that Thatcher had changed Britain's economic debate forever. She had moved the political discussion from one of statism versus capitalism to a basic acceptance of free market economics as a standard of British political consensus. Opinion: Why Britain needs another Thatcher . Although many on the British left oppose what Thatcher did and what she stood for, there is a quiet, begrudging perhaps, but unmistakable admiration of her strong and unswerving leadership. History will record Thatcher stood for what she believed, and that both Britain and the world are better for it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Tom Rogan.","Tom Rogan: Margaret Thatcher was a close ally of U.S. and helped end the Cold War .
Rogan: She stood against terrorism and stood up for Britain, won the Falklands War .
Rogan: Privatization, deregulation and curbing unions revived the British economy .
You always knew where she stood and she changed world for the better, he says ."
"(CNN) -- The Oregon coast can be a moody destination year-round. In the mornings, brooding fog canopies the coastal highways and storms can roll in from the Pacific, kicking up without much warning. But in mid- to late summer, the heavier rains seem to sidestep the coast and, more often than not, sunshine blinks from behind the clouds. Whale spouts are spotted from shore; seals stretch and bark on the rocks; and tourists in search of stunning Pacific Coast views are drawn to the iconic Highway 101 en masse. It's a small dot on the map between Coos Bay and Newport, but slipping by Florence, Oregon, and all this historical city offers, would be a shame. Born near the mouth of the Siuslaw River in the late 1800s, Florence was a rugged coastal frontier settlement that relied mostly on fishing and logging to power its economy. Today, the city still counts these industries as important, but these days tourism is bringing in the bling. And it's easy to understand the draw. Florence has a charming old-world downtown, the Siuslaw River curves along its edges, offering spectacular natural views, and it is located along what is arguably the most beautiful and diverse section of the Oregon Coast. 20 stunning cliffside beaches . If you're traveling north on Highway 101, you'll cross one of this community's most notable landmarks, the Siuslaw River Bridge, a stunning double leaf bascule (or moveable) bridge featuring four towering art-deco-style obelisks. A quick right turn at the end of the bridge will spool you down into Florence's Historic Old Town District, a small but charming collection of restaurants, curio shops, coffee shops, art galleries and B&Bs. Walk along Bay Street, a wide avenue with intermittent views of the Siuslaw River and well-maintained flower gardens. Here you'll see a collection of historical buildings, many of them salvaged from nearby communities and given a second life in Florence. For instance, the Waterfront Depot Restaurant & Bar is housed in an old train depot found abandoned in Mapleton, Oregon, and saved from demolition more than 40 years ago. Today, this restaurant is one of the best places to watch the river crawl by while swilling a Mango Mint Fizz -- a sublime mixture of rum, mango juice, lemon juice, simple syrup and soda. Another must-have on the menu is the dreamy crab-encrusted Alaskan Halibut draped with a chili cream sauce. After dinner, make sure to find Gazebo Park, a small, nearly hidden patch tucked away off Bay Street. This intimate enclave featuring a small dock, a bench, and, you guessed it, a gazebo is about as romantic a getaway as you'll find in these parts. Linger on a park bench until sundown and watch the stars reflect off the river. Another historical building that found new life in Florence is the Edwin K Bed & Breakfast, a two-story 1914 craftsman-style charmer with six bedrooms and a private apartment. Most rooms have views of either the river or the famous Oregon sand dunes. Nightly rates start at $165 during prime season (May through mid-October). 50 states, 50 spots: Natural wonders . One of the best times to explore Florence is in May, when the city celebrates its annual Rhododendron Festival, a tradition for more than a century. After perusing the antique shops, browsing the art galleries or visiting the Siuslaw Pioneering Museum, grab a strong cup of coffee at the Siuslaw River Coffee Roasters, a locally owned gem that roasts its own beans. The eclectic shop is housed in a converted garage and outboard motor repair shop and is where you're sure to see loads of locals crowded around tables or sitting along a beautifully recovered church pew. This is the place to be when the weather turns gloomy and the gas stove is roaring in one corner. Rain never sounds as good as when it's thumping heavy on the coffee shop's tin roof, and when the storm passes, check out the view of the river and bridge from the back deck. If you're in the mood for adventure and don't mind getting a little sand in your teeth, head south out of Florence for an off-highway vehicle tour of the famous Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. A 40-mile expanse of arid, wind-sculpted sand dunes extends from Florence to Coos Bay, Oregon, and is a complete change from the green, lush Oregon environment most people know. Here, toast-colored sand dunes tower some 500 feet above sea level, and, in select areas, off-highway vehicle rentals zoom around and over the dunes at dizzying speeds. Join one of the many off-highway vehicle tour groups in the area, but use caution: some group tours can be pretty adrenalin-fueled. It's rumored that the eerie, windswept landscape is what inspired sci-fi author Frank Herbert to pen his best-selling novel, ""Dune."" For a closer look at some of Oregon's favorite residents, tour the Sea Lion Caves, a privately owned nature preserve just a few miles north of Florence up Highway 101. Visitors may take an elevator down 208 feet into what's touted as the largest sea cave in America, roughly the length of a football field and 125 feet high. World's top 25 theme parks . From an observation ledge, watch the natural comings and goings of the Steller sea lions who call this enclave home. The sea lions are most likely to congregate in the grotto during the fall and winter, whereas they take full advantage of the sunnier spring and summer weather to frolic on the rock formations just outside the caves. Gray whales are sometimes spotted swimming in the area, especially in the spring and summer. Be aware that the sea lion trademark ""barking"" can be loud and, while they are cute, their collective odor is less than adorable. Adult tickets are $14; children 5 and older may enter for $8; children under 5 are free. Don't miss the newly renovated and working Heceta Head Lighthouse, which towers 205 feet above the Pacific and has a light beam visible 21 miles out to sea. The crisp-looking white lighthouse with red roof stands out in sharp contrast to the stunning ocean vistas all around it. Book a room at the lightkeeper's cottage, a working B&B just a few hundred feet away from the lighthouse itself. The delightful Victorian-style home features an expansive view of the Pacific, an acre of well-maintained grounds, six distinctive rooms and a hearty breakfast selection. Rooms begin at $209 during the coveted high season (May through October). In the evening, as the light begins to soften, make like a local and gather a bucket, headlamp and some waders and search the soft sands of the riverbeds for mussels and clams. Regulars have a few favorite spots including a small inlet up Highway 126 near the fork of the Siuslaw River. Even if you're not in the mood to get muddy, grab a blanket and a hot beverage and relax along the shore as you watch the bobbing lights of the clam diggers blend in with the stars. Your vacation has officially begun.","Florence, Oregon, boasts small-town charm and coastal attractions .

"(CNN) -- Does money make you happy? Does being rich contribute to your spiritual life and its possibilities? Is the gap between the rich and poor a religious problem as well as a social problem in desperate need of solutions? Jesus, Pope Francis, and brain scientists have asked these questions, and the answers are clear if unnerving. Wealth and power are dangerous for your mental health, your spiritual condition, and for society in general -- especially when they contribute to the neglect of the poor. New research explains how this works (more on this in a minute). Ridding the world of poverty is, of course, a fantasy. Jesus knew this: ""You will always have the poor among you,"" he said (Matthew 26:11). He also said, ""God blesses you who are poor, for the kingdom of God is yours."" (Luke 6:20). Only a few verses before this moment in Luke, he cries (echoing the Old Testament): ""The spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring the good news to the poor."" (Luke 4:18). Jesus also noted, famously and controversially, that it is easier ""for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven."" (Matthew 19:23-24). Let's just hope that we've got some very skinny camels. Jesus discouraged the accumulation of wealth, worried about its effects on those who had it, and took special pleasure in helping the poor, dedicating his efforts to them. He must have shaken his head at the large gaps between rich and poor throughout ancient Palestine in the first century. Pope Francis has taken up Jesus' call on this. On his recent visit to South Korea, he repeated a cry that has become a central theme of his papacy, telling hundreds of thousands of listeners in Seoul that the gap between the rich and poor in Korea was a problem, and they should think back to early Christian martyrs in Korea. He said: ""Their example has much to say to us who live in societies where, alongside immense wealth, dire poverty is silently growing; where the cry of the poor is seldom heeded and where Christ continues to call out to us, asking us to love and serve him by tending to our brothers and sisters in need."" Everyone knows that the wealth gap in the U.S. has increased dramatically. ""The top 10 percent took more than half of the country's overall income in 2012, the highest proportion recorded in a century of government record keeping,"" The New York Times reported in April. It's a problem that makes you dizzy, and one that will never be easily solved. Indeed, the concentration of wealth at the very top of American society recalls the early 20th century, before the income-leveling measures of the New Deal kicked in. The growing income gap is perhaps the most pressing issue before the world, not just the United States, as the level of misery rises among the poor. Even those formerly known as the middle class, who have struggled mightily to make ends meet for decades now, face an array of problems that create mental and physical pain on a vast scale. So let's go back to Jesus and Pope Francis and their concerns. Do people on the other end of this inequality equation really fare better? Does wealth make you happy? Jesus certainly didn't think so, as the Baptist thinker Alan Bean has recently noted. He writes: ""The American marriage between market capitalism and American evangelical piety makes Jesus impossible. His words are inconvenient at best and heretical at worst."" Wow. Bean has spoken frankly and bravely here. He points to a fascinating new study from the Journal of Experimental Psychology. Three Canadian neuroscientists have suggested that being rich and powerful actually makes you less happy and, even worse, unable to sympathize with the poor. They find that the rich and powerful among us show less brain activity in that region of the brain where human sympathy is excited. ""Power diminishes all varieties of sympathy,"" explains Dacher Keltner, a social psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, in a recent interview on NPR. Conversely, those who feel poor and marginalized in society show a great deal of sympathetic activity. The ability to sympathize with those around us seems crucial to our survival, and it's connected to the mirroring functions of the brain. As the research now suggests, the richer and more powerful we feel, the deader will be that area of our brain where this crucial activity, which generates empathy, occurs. In fact, power fundamentally changes the way we respond to those around us. Is it any wonder that when a rich young man came to Jesus asking for spiritual guidance, Jesus said: ""If you wish to feel complete, go and sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven."" (Matthew 19:21). The young man ""went away grieving,"" as he had so much property and didn't want to let go of anything. But letting go is essential to our own happiness as well as the world's economic equilibrium. Jesus, Pope Francis and brain scientists would agree on this. It's a hard teaching, but it's important.","Jay Parini: Jesus, Pope Francis, scientists address question: Does money make you happy?

"(CNN) -- Arsenal claimed the first trophy of the 2014-15 English season Sunday with an emphatic 3-0 win over Manchester City in the FA Community Shield at Wembley. The traditional match is between the English Premier League champions and the FA Cup winners of the previous season and comes a week before the start of the regular league season. FA Cup winners Arsenal were two-up by halftime as midfielders Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey scored fine goals. The introduction of David Silva to an understrength City team gave them a glimmer of hope after the break, but substitute Oliver Giroud sealed the victory with a curling effort on the hour mark. Victory will be a morale boost for Arsene Wenger's men, who start their EPL campaign at home to Crystal Palace, while City begins its title defense at Newcastle. Wenger was also able to give starts to keynote signing Alexis Sanchez, formerly of Barcelona and other new boys Calum Chambers and Mathieu Debuchy. One man moving in the opposite direction to Sanchez is Belgian defender Thomas Vermaelen, whose move to Barcelona was confirmed Sunday as he was unveiled at the Nou Camp. Vermaelen's old team was winning the Community Shield, formerly the Charity Shield, for the 13th time and the first since 2004. Wenger said that his squad had been improved by recent signings. ""I would say overall it was a united team performance and it was a first half of quality, togetherness and good movement,"" he told gathered reporters. ""It's very difficult to compare (with past squads) but yeah, in the last two I've been speaking about big transfers. In the years before that we always lost big transfers so (the current policy) has now strengthened the squad."" He will be hoping that last season's Community Shield is not a precedent. It turned out to be David Moyes' only honor as Manchester United manager after Robin van Persie scored two goals in the 2-0 defeat of Wigan. United went on to finish seventh in the EPL and Moyes was sacked before the end of the season, to be replaced by Louis van Gaal.","Arsenal wins FA Community Shield at Wembley .

"Kiev, Ukraine (CNN) -- Sixteen people were killed an attack overnight on soldiers in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, local health officials said, in the latest spike in violence ahead of the weekend's presidential election. At least 13 of those who died in Donetsk were soldiers, according to acting President Oleksandr Turchynov. Another soldier was killed in a strike on a military convoy in the Luhansk region, the Defense Ministry said earlier, bringing the death toll overnight to at least 14 Ukrainian troops. Donetsk region's Health Department said 16 people had died in total and that 32 were hospitalized across the region, but did not specify how many were soldiers. In the Donetsk attack, an armored vehicle at a checkpoint in Volnovaha was hit by rocket-propelled grenades and mortars, which caused ammunition on board to ignite, the Defense Ministry said. The second attack hit a convoy of vehicles in Rubizhne in the Luhansk region, the ministry said. It added that ""terrorists"" blocked a bridge with ""civilian provocateurs"" and then opened fire using the people as human shields. No independent confirmation of the claims or response from separatist forces in eastern Ukraine was immediately available. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk called for an immediate emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council following the reported violence, which came as the interim government in Kiev prepares to hold presidential elections Sunday. ""We will provide evidence that it is Russia trying to escalate the conflict, attempts to seize Ukrainian state border checkpoints and scuttle the presidential election,"" he was quoted as saying by his office. Tensions remain high in Donetsk and Luhansk, where pro-Russia separatists staged a referendum on independence this month and control key public buildings in a number of towns and cities. Ukraine's Central Election Commission said Wednesday that 13 out of 34 local election commissions in Luhansk and Donetsk were ""blocked,"" or under the control of militia, the official Ukrinform news agency reported. Three others ""are operating but under threat of seizure,"" it said. NATO chief: Signs of Russian troop activity . Kiev and the West have accused Russia of supporting the separatists and have urged Moscow to take steps to de-escalate the crisis. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Thursday that there were indications that Russia may be preparing to pull back some of the forces it has amassed near Ukraine's border. On Monday, the Kremlin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered tens of thousands of troops near the Ukraine border to return to their bases but added the withdrawal could take some time. NATO has seen ""limited"" Russian troop activity ""that MAY suggest that some of these forces are preparing to withdraw,"" Rasmussen said via Twitter. ""It is too early to say what this means, but I hope this is the start of a full and genuine withdrawal."" His remarks came a day after a U.S. defense official told CNN the United States had seen the first preliminary signs that Russian forces might be preparing to move away from Ukraine's eastern border. Rasmussen cautioned that most of the Russian force deployed near the border remains there and that Russian military exercises continue. But he added, ""Any meaningful, comprehensive and verifiable withdrawal would be a first step from #Russia into the right direction."" Yatsenyuk was more skeptical, dismissing Russia's claims of a pullback as a ""bluff,"" according to a statement from his office. ""Even if the troops are pulling back, armed terrorists trained in Russia illegally break the state border of Ukraine with the direct assistance of Russia,"" he said. Ukraine cites 'provocations' Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said Thursday that Ukrainian border guards had again stopped armed militant groups trying to bring weapons and ammunition across the border from Russia. These attempts occur with ""the full connivance of the Russian authorities and unlawful inactivity by Russian border guards,"" it said in a statement. ""These and other provocations by Russian side in Ukraine are regarded as attempts to disrupt the presidential elections on 25 May and destabilize the situation in the eastern region of our country."" Ukraine's Interior Ministry also reported armed border clashes which, it said, left five border guards injured and one suffering a concussion following a grenade blast. Moscow, which blames the unrest roiling its neighbor on far-right, ultranationalist groups, denies having direct influence over the pro-Russia militants in Ukraine. NATO and the United States have previously estimated the size of the Russian force gathered near the border with Ukraine at around 40,000 troops. The United States, which along with other Western countries has sanctioned Russia for its disputed takeover of Ukraine's Crimea region, has threatened additional punishment for Russia if it fails to pull its troops back. Diplomats meet over Prince Charles report . Separately, Russia's deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom is meeting a senior UK Foreign Office official Thursday in London amid controversy over comments reportedly made by Prince Charles. The Russian Embassy requested the meeting Wednesday, two days after Charles reportedly compared Putin to Adolf Hitler during a trip to Canada. A statement will be given after the meeting, the Foreign Office said. According to the Daily Mail newspaper, Charles made the offhand comment during a tour of the Canadian Museum of Immigration in Halifax, Nova Scotia, while talking with a Polish woman who told the British royal how she'd escaped the Nazi Holocaust by fleeing to Canada. ""The prince then said, 'And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler,' "" the newspaper quoted the woman as saying, referring to Russia's annexation of Crimea in March. CNN has not been able independently to confirm the conversation. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said that ""if these words were really said, they undoubtedly do no honor to the future British monarch,"" according to the ministry's website. ""We find the use of members of the British royal family by Western media in a propaganda campaign against Russia on the difficult international issue of the situation in Ukraine unacceptable, outrageous and low,"" Lukashevich is quoted as saying. Representatives for Charles declined to comment. ""However, we would like to stress that the Prince of Wales would not seek to make a public political statement during a private conversation,"" Clarence House said in a statement. Some Russian troops at Ukraine border may be 'packing up' Prince Charles draws fire for reportedly comparing Putin to Hitler .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- China has executed eight people convicted of terrorism, including three for their roles in an attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported, citing local authorities. Authorities in Xinjiang, an ethnically divided province in China's far west, said that three of those executed ""masterminded"" a terrorist attack on October 28 when a vehicle drove through security barriers and into a crowd on the square in the capital. It crashed into a pedestrian bridge and burst into flames, killing five, including three in the vehicle, and wounded 40 others. The other five had been found guilty of crimes including murder of government officials, setting up a terrorist organization and the illegal manufacturing of explosives, Xinhua said. China has cracked down on violence in Xinjiang involving Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group after a series of high profile attacks in the past year. Religious extremists . Twenty-nine people were killed and 130 injured when men armed with long knives stormed a train station in Kunming, southwest China in March. The following month, an attack on a train station in Urumqi, the regional capital, left three dead, including the attackers, and an attack on an Urumqi market in May killed at least 39. China has blamed religious extremists for violence in the region. Some Uyghurs have expressed resentment toward China's Han majority in recent years over what they say is harsh treatment from Chinese security forces and Han people taking the lion's share of economic opportunities in Xinjiang. Uyghurs also say their religious and cultural freedom has been curtailed. Earlier this month, a town in Xinjiang temporarily banned people from wearing Islamic-style clothing and large beards on buses.","China executes 8 people convicted of terrorism .

"(CNN) -- It hurts me to say this, but I bet when I say ""Kim,"" you know the last name. Our world is no longer run by bankers and brokers but by public relations people who will do anything to keep certain names in (or out) of the news. If they are not trained psychologists, they sure act like them; they know how to get our interest even when we absolutely do not want to give it. And so into this vortex of extreme public relations savvy comes Kim K, one of the people who is ""famous for being famous."" How did she do it? By flaunting her vapid lifestyle, her great body and good looks and her money. Of course America idolizes her. But as it turns out, not nearly so much as she idolizes herself. Kim is putting together a big book of selfies called ""Selfish."" She said she was assembling sexy pictures of herself from a trip to Southeast Asia for a book to give to her newish husband, Kanye West, on Valentine's Day. But then the thought occurred to her -- why wouldn't everyone want one? Normal people would find a 352-page compilation of selfies in bad taste. But in truth we recognize the basic instinct: It's hard to resist walking by a mirror and not having one of two reactions -- to look or, at all costs, to avoid looking. Unlike Kim K, the Queen of Narcissism, most of us have a more ambivalent relationship to our own image. We look at pictures of ourselves and more often than not, cringe. If it's a flattering picture, we save it for our Facebook page or give it to our partner. But few of us, even few movie stars, want to create books of how glorious we look. Yes we all are mini-narcissists, but most of us have a sense of our flaws and the limits of how much time we should spend on adoringly looking at our own image. Kim K is a lesson in how extreme it can get when you are a canny self-promoter: You just love yourself so much 24/7. If you, like me, is relieved at the disappearance of Paris Hilton from the front pages and are not a fan of pathological narcissism, you know we should ignore Kim K and shun falling into her PR trap. But the fact that she has an esteemed publisher and that the editors there must think this book will sell well presents a serious issue: Why are young women entranced with this woman? (I understand why young men would be.) But young girls who are easily impressionable and hooked by hype may be enchanted with the ease with which she seems to float through life and take on her ""struggles"" (Which brand name shall I buy? Which mini-feud will I rage about?) as ones they would rather have than the ones they have in real life. They envy her. The fact is that the Kardashians have gained traction in their lives. They have built an empire and no one can deny she and her posse have figured out how to make a fortune based on her brand. Kim K won't be around forever. But is it some failure of feminism among the young that allows this kind of person to be a star? I remember the icons of my day: Janis Joplin -- a wild woman, a maverick and a massive talent (though, sadly an addict as well). There's Gloria Steinem, a woman who was mission driven. And while perhaps she had extra press attention because she was good-looking, it was her feminist theory, her amazing verbal ability and her mentoring of others that made her someone to follow and emulate. These were women who deserved to be famous. Even Madonna, embellished by PR but not created by it, had (and has) talent, and a provocative message about sexuality. Kim K, like Paris Hilton, is just about as thin as their photographs. They want our love and money and they hope to achieve it by showing how much love and money they have already. So wouldn't it be great if Kim K's selfie book sat moldering in book stores and on Amazon? That would reassure me about the soul of modern girls and young women. I wouldn't blame anyone for paging through it. It's a little like a car wreck -- awful, but hard to totally avoid looking at. But buying the book is another thing altogether. Instead of sending Kim K to the bank, let's encourage her to go to a really good therapist. This kind of narcissism needs to be treated, not celebrated.","Kim Kardashian is compiling a 352-page book of selfies titled ""Selfish""

"(CNN) -- A new diet drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July is now available for obese and at-risk overweight patients. The oral medication Qsymia can only be obtained with a doctor's prescription. Qsymia (pronounced kyoo-SIM-ee-uh) is the second diet drug approved this year. The FDA approved a weight-loss pill called Belviq on June 27. Patients in clinical trials experienced more dramatic weight loss with Qsymia than with Belviq. On Qsymia, patients went from an average 227 pounds to 204 pounds; on Belviq, the average weight dropped from 220 to 207. Qsymia had been known as Qnexa until its approval. The FDA asked the company to change the name to avoid confusion with another drug on the market, according to the company. Health care costs to bulge along with U.S. waistlines . Some consumer advocates worry that the medication's weight loss comes with a price. Some patients in the clinical trial suffered an increased heart rate and a condition called metabolic acidosis, which can lead to hyperventilation, fatigue and anorexia. Concerns have also been raised about birth defects. One of the ingredients in Qsymia is topiramate, an anti-convulsant that has been linked to birth defects such as cleft lip and cleft palate in babies born to women who have taken it for migraines or seizures. Qsymia's other ingredient is phentermine, an appetite suppressant. ""Our belief is that women will be invited (through) compelling advertising and marketing messages to experiment on themselves with a drug that has some effectiveness with healthy weight loss but possible serious risks,"" said Cindy Pearson, executive director of the National Women's Health Network. Qsymia's manufacturer, Vivus Inc., says that the drug helped lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels in obese people and that people taking it were less likely to get type II diabetes. Not enough good data to back obesity drug, panel says . ""Obesity is not being adequately addressed by diet and lifestyle changes or currently available therapies,"" the company said. ""The need for new options is urgent, particularly nonsurgical options."" The FDA approved Qsymia only for obese people or for overweight people with a body mass index greater than 27 who also suffer from weight-related conditions like hypertension and diabetes. Doctors are free to prescribe the drug to anyone, however, and there are concerns that physicians will open ""pill mills"" and prescribe Qsymia to people who just want to lose a few pounds. That's what happened in the 1990s with fen-phen, another diet drug combination that includes phentermine. An FDA advisory committee voted against Qsymia's approval in 2010. The panel recommended the drug's approval with a 20-2 vote in February, after Vivus proposed a risk management program to limit Qsymia's distribution and published additional results from one of its three clinical trials. Vivus is offering the pill only through mail order, so doctors can't sell it directly, said Dr. Barbara Troupin, Vivus' vice president of scientific communications and risk management. ""There will not be dispensing from doctors' offices,"" she said. ""Seeing that issue and what has happened in fad and diet drugs in the past, that is not a path that we're going to be taking."" The 4,430 overweight and obese patients in the Qsymia studies experienced various levels of weight loss. About half of patients on the recommended dose lost 10% of their weight, while four-fifths lost 5%. That amounts to about 12 pounds for a 227-pound person. Meg Evans, one of the patients, started out at 230 pounds and lost 48 pounds her first year on the drug and another two pounds the second year. ""I loved it,"" she said. ""I wasn't hungry. I almost had to remind myself to eat."" At 5 feet 9 inches tall, Evans, now 63, describes herself as having been ""Twiggy-like"" in college, weighing 120 pounds. Then she gained weight after having four children. An avid cook and eater, she said the drug made it easier to resist tempting foods. FDA advisers recommend diet drug . ""If I saw a chocolate-chip cookie, it was easy enough for me to say, 'I'm not really hungry. I can pass on it,' "" Evans said. She said the weight came off gradually, about four pounds a month, and her blood pressure went down almost immediately. In February, Dr. Michael Lauer was one of two FDA advisory committee members who voted against Qsymia's approval. ""I believe that if the public were to 'buy' (Qsymia) after FDA approval, it would run the risk of severe, even fatal, consequences from another diet lemon,"" Lauer wrote in Annals of Internal Medicine, also noting that the drug led to a slight increase in heart rates. The FDA and Vivus both acknowledge that the three clinical trials meant to measure Qsymia's safety and effectiveness were not designed to properly assess cardiovascular risk. The FDA has required Vivus to do a study on the drug's cardiovascular effects. Vivus earlier said it would be done after the drug's approval. Despite the label's warning that women of childbearing age should use birth control while on Qsymia, there are concerns that women will still get pregnant while on the drug. The FDA recommends a pregnancy test every month while on Qsymia. In the drug-maker's two-year clinical trial, 34 women on Qsymia became pregnant, even though they were told repeatedly to use contraception. No birth defects happened in those pregnancies, according to the company. Previous clinical trials of topiramate, one of the ingredients in Qsymia, have shown a risk of about five birth defects for every 1,000 pregnancies. Comparing the anti-obesity drug to treatments for other chronic diseases, Troupin said patients will probably need to continue taking Qsymia long-term, though the new drug is not expected to be widely covered by health insurance plans. FDA rejects another obesity drug . Evans, the patient who lost 50 pounds on the drug, said she has gained back about 20 pounds since the clinical trial ended two years ago and looks forward to going on Qsymia once it's approved, even though it can have side effects. ""There are side effects to everything,"" she said. She added that the drug wasn't the only reason she lost weight. Weekly counseling on nutrition and exercise were a big factor, too. The counselor helped her change her diet -- choosing a salad for lunch instead of a burger, forgoing pasta and potatoes at dinner -- and encouraged her to walk a few times a week in addition to her regular exercise as goalie in a women's soccer league. ""Before the medicine, I had been telling the girls they'd have to find a new goalie, because I couldn't dive for the ball like I did before,"" she said. ""Then I lost the weight, and I was diving and bouncing back up and having a great old time again.""","New diet drug is now available with a prescription for obese or at-risk overweight patients .

"(CNN) -- He's fired darts at a gray whale, sped through St Petersburg in an F1 car, and taken a supersonic flight in a bomber jet. Now Russia's ""action man"" president, Vladimir Putin, has again flexed his muscle in his latest testosterone-filled publicity stunt -- diving to the bottom of the Baltic sea aboard a red submersible to explore a 19th century shipwreck. The 60-year-old former KGB spy, showed no signs of slowing down his manly pursuits for the cameras, plunging 50 meters below the water to examine the frigate which sank in the Gulf of Finland in 1869. Putin climbed aboard the Sea Explorer 5 underwater research vessel on Monday for a 30-minute dive to the wooden wreck -- called Oleg -- which was discovered by divers in 2003. State television showed images of the Russian strongman carefully inspecting the wreck from the front seat of the glass-fronted capsule. Putin commented on how well-preserved the wreck was, before also praising the work of the Russian Geographic Society, which has been studying the sunken vessel. It's not the first time the thrill-seeking president has taken to the water in a bid to highlight his intrepid spirit and physical prowess. In 2009, Putin dived to the bottom of Lake Baikal in Siberia aboard a mini-submarine. Then in 2011 the Russian leader announced he had discovered two ancient urns while scuba diving in the Black Sea. Though, embarrassingly for the president, the Kremlin last year admitted the stunt was staged. In 2012 Putin also faced accusations from environmentalists that a seemingly wild tiger he tranquilized during a research expedition, had in fact been brought in from a zoo. Indeed, the pumped-up president's stunts have drawn ridicule online -- last year he earned the nickname ""alpha-crane"" after flying a deltplane in a mission to lead rare birds on their migration route.","Russian president Vladimir Putin explores Baltic Sea shipwreck in submersible .

"(CNN) -- Serena Williams is without peer in the modern women's game and now she is on a par with two American tennis legends from the past. The world No. 1 clinched her third straight U.S. Open title at Flushing Meadows on Sunday and in doing so sealed an 18th career grand slam singles title, equaling the feats of both Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova, who became a naturalized American citizen in 1975 after defecting from Czechoslovakia. It may have been a case of when and not if Williams would reach the totals amassed by her feted compatriots in the 1970s and 1980s, but the 32-year-old is still finding the achievement hard to comprehend. """"I don't know. It just doesn't seem right -- Chrissie, Martina, Serena, it's like oh my goodness!"" Williams told CNN's Rachel Nichols following her 6-3 6-3 win over Denmark's Caroline Wozniacki. ""It feels great because you hear these names growing up ... you don't think about yourself like that,"" Williams added. ""You just think, I want to work hard and do the best I can. Then you start chasing titles, then you start chasing legends and it's just a great feeling."" A 17-year-old Williams won her first grand slam singles titles at Flushing Meadows in 1999, beating Switzerland's Martina Hingis to become the first African American woman to win a grand slam tournament since Althea Gibson in 1958. Fifteen years on, Williams now has six U.S. Open singles titles to her name -- a feat only matched by Evert in the Open era -- to go with five titles at both the Australian Open and Wimbledon and two at the French Open. Success at this year's final slam caps a season of highs and lows for Williams who has won six WTA titles so far this year but, until now, had struggled on the biggest stage. In January, Williams exited the Australian Open in the fourth round and followed it with shock second and third round defeats at Roland Garros and Wimbledon respectively.

"Chanmyay Yeiktha, Myanmar (CNN) -- The first time I suggested shaving off all my hair and becoming a monk, nobody batted an eyelid. In Myanmar, it is perfectly normal for people to go into monasteries or nunneries for temporary periods. The monastic system is a revolving door, and most of the country's 55 million Buddhists, whether rich or poor, go in and out of it several times during their lives. What made the situation complicated was that I was a Westerner and it was 2002, a time when Myanmar, which is also known as Burma, was still a pariah state and branded an ""outpost of tyranny"" by the government of former U.S. president George W. Bush. Foreigners then were viewed with suspicion, and arranging to enter the forest retreat of Chanmyay Yeiktha, one of the most traditional of the country's monasteries, took some string-pulling. I eventually found myself shaved and robed and sitting in the little hut that would be my home for the next six weeks. The traditional period for temporary monkhood in Myanmar is only nine days, and I was wondering whether I had bitten off more than I could chew. I slept on a pillowless wooden board, and my morning began at 3.30 a.m. with an icy bucket shower and the scrape of a razor over chin and head. I then meditated with the other monks for two hours before a breakfast of rice and dal -- a stew of pulses such as lentils and beans -- at dawn. After that, it was back to the mediation hall until 10.30 a.m. when the second and final meal of the day was served. We were permitted to take a nap through the heat of midday before meditating again until around 7 p.m. As an atheist I became attracted to Buddhism in Myanmar because its monasteries have very little to do with ritual or theology. All of the emphasis is on practical techniques for uncovering the hidden workings of the mind. If a person wants to know what makes them tick, the techniques learned in Buddhism offer a powerful alternative to the hourly fees and drug prescriptions of Western psychiatry. But the process is difficult and it can only be faced alone. I was not allowed to speak to anyone in the monastery, even to exchange a greeting. When meditating I was encouraged to carefully observe every thought, every breath, every feeling. Even at meals, I had to be aware of each tiny thing -- the intention to move my fork, the movements of my jaws, my reactions to the flavors of the food. At the beginning all of this seemed virtually impossible, but after ten days of it my mind began to slow down and settle. Now I was able to see not only my thoughts, but also the subconscious feelings and desires that produced them. Soon I began to experience a feeling of serenity and mental clarity that I had not thought possible. In 2002, international sanctions were hitting Myanmar's economy hard. Donations of food to the monasteries, though regular, were not large. I was regularly sent out with a group of monks to collect alms. We went barefoot on the jungle trails, halting occasionally for villagers to drop handfuls of rice into our begging bowls. On one round I felt bad when a poor farmer gave me a few peanuts from his lunchbox, and at the end of my stay I mentioned this to the abbot. ""Don't be so egotistical,"" he rebuked me. ""That man was not donating food to you personally, he saw only a monk standing there. One day soon, your positions will be reversed. He will be the monk seeking self-knowledge and you will be the donor who gives him food. If you have more than he has, then you can give more to equal his gift of peanuts."" And that is what makes the monastic system work so effectively in Myanmar. Among monks, there are no economic or class divisions. The identical robes, the communal dining and the head shaving are all there to emphasize the equality that exists between them. But when temporary monks return to their lives outside, some are suddenly far more equal than others. And so villagers donate a handful of rice, while city professionals donate breakfast and lunch for the entire monastery, or a water purification system, or even a new dining hall. When I returned to Myanmar this year for my second 45-day stint as a monk, the ramped-up scale of these elite donations was very much in evidence. Since the reforms begun by President Thein Sein in 2011, the country's economy has grown at breakneck speed and the monasteries have grown along with it. Chanmyay Yeiktha's forest retreat was three times larger than I remembered, and is now surrounded by beautiful gardens of flowers and fruit trees. I looked in vain for my rickety wooden hut, and was shown instead to a well-built brick bungalow with a hardwood floor, a fan, a comfortable bed and a Western-style bathroom with a shower. There were spacious new meditation halls, a clinic and a library. Every day saw visits by city donors bringing varied and nutritious meals for monks of every social background. The population of the monastery also reflected Myanmar's new openness to the world. Although I was still the only Westerner, I now found myself among monks from Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and China. One monk from the city of Guangzhou in southern China turned out to be leaving the same day as me. After our disrobing ceremony, I asked him why he had traveled here. ""In China, we are not free to practice our religion,"" he told me. ""All Chinese Buddhists want to come here. We think of Myanmar as a place of freedom.""

"(CNN) -- When former U.S. congressman Anthony Weiner admitted two years ago to sending explicit messages and photos to women online, his wife was notably absent, letting Weiner make his public mea culpa alone. But on Tuesday, Huma Abedin was front and center as Weiner confessed to having further explicit exchanges, even after the first scandal forced his resignation from Congress. Abedin, 36, is no stranger to politics. She has worked for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for years and accompanied her husband on the campaign trail in his current bid for New York City mayor. She had her first news conference on Tuesday, however, and she admitted to being nervous -- but it was her moment to defend her husband of three years and describe her struggle to forgive him. Soul-searching Weiner seeks forgiveness . ""It took a lot of work and a whole lot of therapy to get to a place where I could forgive Anthony,"" Abedin said. ""It was not an easy choice in any way, but I made the decision that it was worth staying in this marriage."" Weiner admitted in June 2011 that he had sent sexually explicit messages and photos to women online. He apologized for initially claiming they weren't his and said he was seeking treatment, and he resigned from the U.S. House two weeks later. The couple had a baby boy in December of that year. On Tuesday, a gossip website published screen shots of sexual conversations that it said Weiner had had with a woman last summer, along with explicit photographs it claimed he had sent. Opinion: Why does Huma Abedin put up with Weiner? In his afternoon news conference, Weiner admitted that some of the online exchanges and photographs were his but said some were from before his resignation and some were after. Abedin said Tuesday she knows her husband made ""horrible mistakes"" both before and after his resignation from Congress. ""We discussed all of this before he decided to run for mayor, so really what I want to say is, I love him, I have forgiven him, I believe in him, and as we have said from the beginning, we are moving forward,"" she said. 2011: Stop calling Huma Abedin a victim . From intern to State Department . Abedin began working for Clinton as a White House intern in 1996, eventually becoming the former first lady's traveling chief of staff -- or ""body man"" -- during her campaign for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. When Clinton became secretary of state, Abedin served as a top aide to her. She remains a Clinton adviser. Although she is described as a very private person, Abedin's intelligence, striking style, unusual background and ability ""to make the trains run on time"" brought her attention well before her July 2010 marriage to Weiner. Vogue magazine profiled her in 2007, an unusual distinction for a campaign aide. ""Huma Abedin has the energy of a woman in her 20s, the confidence of a woman in her 30s, the experience of a woman in her 40s and the grace of a woman in her 50s,"" Clinton told Vogue. ""She is timeless, her combination of poise, kindness, and intelligence are matchless, and I am lucky to have had her on my team for a decade now."" Abedin is the daughter of college professors. Her late father, an Islamic scholar, was from India and her mother, a sociologist, was from Pakistan. She was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan, but the family moved to Saudi Arabia when she was 2. She moved back to the United States to attend George Washington University. She told Vogue that she decided at 15 that she wanted to be an international journalist, inspired by CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Congress, lewd photos and NYC's mayoral race: An Anthony Weiner timeline . Abedin's plans changed when the White House intern program assigned her to the first lady's office, not the press office as she had requested. She's not been far from Clinton since then, friends say. ""I don't think you could say they are like mother and daughter,"" actress Mary Steenburgen and longtime friend of the Clintons told Vogue in 2007. ""It's more like an older sister-younger sister relationship, but it's definitely familial."" Her efficiency, language abilities, attention to detail and remarkable ability to pack for long trips -- noted by the Vogue reporter -- make her invaluable to the globe-trotting Clinton. ""Huma does make the trains run on time,"" Clinton lawyer Bob Barnett told Vogue. The Vogue story hinted in 2007 that she had dated actor John Cusack and cyclist Lance Armstrong. Abedin was introduced to Weiner during the 2008 congressional campaign. Former President Bill Clinton officiated at their wedding. Their marriage drew extra attention because Abedin is Muslim and Weiner is Jewish. Weiner rose through New York City politics as a young man unafraid of a fight and eager for media attention. Abedin, in contrast, is known for her diplomacy and privacy. Read more: Weiner's wife: I forgive him . In her own words . As Weiner's latest scandal unfolded, Harper's Bazaar published excerpts of an article Abedin wrote for the magazine. ""Three years ago I was a single workaholic, traveling the globe with an amazing job at the U.S. State Department. I could not have imagined how much my life would change in three short years,"" Abedin wrote for the magazine's September issue. ""Today I'm married, with a feisty 20-month-old son, a full-time job, and a husband running for mayor of New York."" Abedin said she has long kept her personal life private, and no one is more surprised than she is to see herself out on the campaign trail. ""So why am I doing this? Because Anthony has always been a smart, caring, and dedicated person, and while he's the same public servant who wants what's best for the people he represents, he is now something else -- a better man,"" Abedin wrote. ""New Yorkers will have to decide for themselves whether or not to give him a second chance. I had to make that same decision for myself, for my son, for our family. And I know in my heart that I made the right one."" Has the road to political redemption gotten shorter?","Huma Abedin was notably absent when Anthony Weiner admitted to 2011 scandal .

"(CNN) -- Here's a roundup of five medical studies published this week that might give you new insights into your health, mind and body. Remember, correlation is not causation -- so if a study finds a connection between two things, it doesn't mean one causes the other. Good neighbors are good for your heart . A study published Monday in the Journal of Epidemiology & Community Health suggests your community matters in matters of the heart. Researchers tracked the cardiovascular health of more than 5,000 seniors with no known heart problems over four years. In 2006, participants in the Health and Retirements Study were asked how much they felt a part of their neighborhood, if they had neighbors who would help them, whether they trusted people in the area and if their neighbors were friendly. During the study period, 148 of the participants had a heart attack. Researchers found people who reported feeling more ""social cohesion"" were less at risk. Tight-knit local communities may help to reinforce and encourage certain types of behaviors that protect against cardiovascular damage, the study authors say. Fish good. Mercury, not so much. In June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued draft recommendations that encourage pregnant women, breastfeeding mothers and young children to eat two to three servings of fish per week to aid fetal and childhood development. This fish should be low in mercury, the FDA said, because mercury can harm the brain and nervous system. This week food safety experts at Consumer Reports analyzed data from the FDA to find out what kinds of seafood are safe for these populations to eat regularly. They identified 20 types -- including salmon, shrimp, domestic crawfish and oysters -- that contain low levels of mercury and are safe to eat several times a week. The experts said pregnant women and children should steer clear of six types of seafood: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, gulf tilefish, marlin and orange roughy. If you are a frequent fish consumer, meaning you eat 24 ounces or more every week, Consumer Reports recommends you avoid those seafood types as well. Researchers also found that canned tuna contained particularly high levels of mercury, and recommended pregnant women avoid it altogether. Having a baby could hurt your (mental) health . Many new mothers are made aware of their risk for post-partum depression. But having a baby can put both moms and dads at risk for mental health disorders like anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and psychosis, says Carrie Wendel-Hummell, who presented her study on perinatal mental health disorders at the Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association this week. ""(Post-partum depression) has been framed so much as being a hormonal disorder, but the evidence there is actually very limited,"" Wendel-Hummell said. ""Childbirth itself is a life change and a life stressor, so actually there's far more evidence that those risk factors are the cause."" The University of Kansas researcher conducted in-depth interviews with 17 new fathers and 30 new mothers. Many said they experienced stress related to their relationships, family-work balance issues, and struggles with poverty. Wendel-Hummell encourages new parents to accept help from friends, family and the community during the early stages of their child's life. Cancer screening doesn't always help . Data shows that screening people with a limited life expectancy for certain types of cancer doesn't provide any benefit to their health -- and that treating any cancer found in these patients can do more harm than good. But seniors at high risk for death are still being screened frequently, according to a study published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. Researchers looked at data from the National Health Interview Survey from 2000 to 2010, on more than 27,000 participants over 64. At least a third of participants with the highest mortality risk had received a recent cancer screening, with 55% undergoing prostate cancer screening. The analysis also showed that screening was common in participants with less than five years to live, the study authors say. ""It is the physician's responsibility to tailor treatment to the patient and his cancer,"" writes Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. ""Many Americans simply cannot accept that there are cancers that do not need treatment."" Violent video games may depress your fifth grader . Video games have long been a topic of intense debate. But most of these discussions have focused on how video games affect aggression or violent tendencies. A new study published in Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking looked instead at video games and depression. Researchers analyzed data from 5,147 fifth-grade students and their caregivers, who participated in another study. They found students who played high-violence video games for more than two hours a day had significantly more depressive symptoms than those who played low-violence video games for less than two hours a day. The researchers don't know if the link between the two is cause-and-effect, meaning the video games cause depression or vice versa. More studies will have to be done to see if the association would last as the students grow older.","Study finds seniors living in a tight-knit community were less at risk for heart attacks .

"(CNN) -- An Israeli airstrike blasted a residential tower in Gaza on Monday night. CNN video and Hamas-run Aqsa TV showed rockets hitting the structure known as the Italian Tower. Residents evacuated the tower after an earlier drone airstrike known as a ""knock on the roof."" The Palestinian Health ministry said 20 people were injured in the airstrike. The Israeli military said the building housed a Hamas ""command and control center."" Two days ago, an Israeli airstrike in Gaza reduced a 14-story residential building to rubble. Earlier Monday, the Israel Defense Forces said it had destroyed rocket launchers concealed inside a shelter for evacuees in Gaza. The IDF said Palestinian militants had fired rockets from spots next to several civilian facilities in the Al-Shati refugee camp in northern Gaza, including the Shuhada medical facility and the Even Sina and Zlach Halif schools. Both schools had been used as shelters for Gaza residents who had to leave their homes. On Sunday, the IDF said it told residents in the area to evacuate to avoid injury. In the subsequent bombing, the rocket launchers were hit, and the ""rocket arsenal concealed within the facility"" was destroyed, causing several secondary explosions and extensive damage, the IDF said. It's unknown whether there were any casualties. Hamas-run Aqsa TV reported that one person died and three people were critically injured in an airstrike on a vehicle in Gaza City. Ashraf el-Qedra, a spokesman for the Palestinian ministry, posted on his Facebook page that nine people were killed Monday, making a total of 2,131 killed and 10,890 injured in the past 50 days.

"(CNN) -- When an elderly nun and two fellow peace activists walked undetected onto one of the nation's most secure nuclear facilities last year, they wanted to call attention to the dangers of nuclear weapons. Yet their actions in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, triggered a very different concern: . If three older peaceniks can easily trespass onto the Y-12 National Security Complex -- once considered the ""Fort Knox"" for highly enriched uranium -- just how safe are the nation's nuclear weapons facilities from terrorists? Nuclear weapons interactive: Who has what? Sister Megan Rice, 83; Greg Boertje-Obed, 57; and Michael Walli, 63, will stand trial this week on federal charges of destroying U.S. government property, depredation against federal property exceeding $1,000, trespassing and injuring national-defense premises. The last charge alone carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. The trial began Tuesday at federal court in Knoxville, Tennessee, according to WATE, CNN's affiliate in Knoxville. In the predawn hours of July 28, 2012, Rice, Boertje-Obed and Walli walked under the cover of darkness through the woods and up a hillside, approaching a chain-link fence surrounding the Oak Ridge nuclear facility. Armed with flashlights and a bolt cutter, they cut their way through the fence, fully expecting to be arrested on the spot. Instead, they walked nearly a mile, cutting through four fences in all, breaching what was supposed to be the most tightly secured uranium processing and storage facility in the country. ""When we got to the very high security fence where there's a lethal force authorized ... I thought, maybe we should turn around,"" Boertje-Obed told CNN's David Mattingly. But they didn't. Hours later, the three activists were finally confronted by a guard after hoisting banners, spray-painting messages and splattering human blood on a building that houses highly enriched uranium. Since the incident, Congress has held a series of hearings and issued security recommendations to the Department of Energy and its National Nuclear Security Administration, which runs Y-12 and seven other nuclear weapons sites. Most recently, Deputy Energy Secretary Daniel Poneman testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in March that the Department of Energy has taken ""several major actions ... to improve security"" since the Y-12 breach, including management changes and independent security reviews. Today, changes at Y-12 are noticeable. A new security contractor is in charge. New signs and security fences are going up. While last year's security breach shed light on systematic weaknesses at Y-12, a former nuclear reactor safety manager at the Sandia National Laboratories said he doesn't think the nation's nuclear weapons material were ever at any risk. ""What these people did was more like trespassing than gaining access to any weapons-grade material,"" said Michael Allen, who is now a vice provost and dean at Middle Tennessee State University. ""Once they got in, they could spray paint things, but it's just like if you got into Fort Knox, you wouldn't know the combination to the locks."" Allen said the country's nuclear weapons material is spread across eight sites around the country that are ""usually out in the middle of nowhere"" to protect against threats. ""There's really only one place where the weapons are fully assembled; I'm not going to tell you which one,"" Allen said. ""And the reason there are eight places, they don't want people to have the full knowledge (of what the other facilities do). ""We almost never see an assembled nuclear weapon."" But another nuclear security expert said the Y-12 breach was more than just trespassing by a few environmental protesters. ""This was a very serious incident because they penetrated the protected area, and that's when there was supposed to be an immediate security response,"" said Edwin Lyman, a senior scientist with Global Security Program, a watchdog group that monitors the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. ""If they had been trained, the kind of paramilitary group that the Department of Energy is supposed to be ensuring they can protect against, with hand-carried explosives, other breaching tools, physical access to the building structure ... the guards would have already lost."" Lyman said the breach was not an isolated incident. ""It was a result of this reduced central oversight, giving contractors more responsibility for supervising themselves, and that's an invitation of corner-cutting and complacency to set in,"" he said. The incident not only broke the public's trust that the government is ""exercising good oversight"" of its nuclear weapons facilities, according to Lyman, but he said it also has ""global implications."" ""If we can't even control our own nuclear weapons material, it shows what a major challenge it is around the world ... that have comparably dangerous materials but are even less protected. And, Lyman pointed out, if the United States appears to have vulnerabilities in protecting its nuclear weapons material, ""then that not only reduces our authority to criticize other countries, it raising questions about the integrity of our own security.

"(CNN) -- A New York man was ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation after allegedly beating his girlfriend and her daughter to death with a hammer, claiming they were witches, prosecutors said Thursday. Carlos Alberto Amarillo, 44, allegedly called 911 early Wednesday and said ""two females are dead, they were assassinated, hurry, they are dead,"" the Queens district attorney's office said in a statement. ""I killed them because they are witches,"" Amarillo reportedly said on the 911 call, according to the statement. ""I want the police to kill me. I killed them with a hammer."" A neighbor told CNN he heard the banging, apparently from the hammer blows, but no screaming. When police arrived at the home where the 911 call was made, Amarillo was walking from the doorway to the street carrying a Bible. He allegedly told officers: ""I killed them, I killed them,"" according to the statement. Police found the body of his girlfriend, Estrella Castaneda, 56, face up on a bed with a pillow over her face, the statement said. The rubber grip of a hammer was next to her body. On the floor in a rear bedroom, police found the victim's daughter, Lina Castaneda, 25, with injuries to her head, prosecutors said. The hammer was next to her body. Lina Castaneda's 7-year-old daughter was found unharmed on the bed in her mother's room, authorities said. ""The defendant is accused of the violent beating death of his girlfriend and her daughter -- who in fact was herself the mother of a young child,"" Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown said in the statement. ""Thankfully, that child ... was not harmed."" In statements to police, Amarillo allegedly said that he believed the victims were witches and were ""performing voodoo and casting spells on him,"" Brown said in the statement. Camilo Alvarez, 23, who lives two houses down, said that about midnight Wednesday he heard a loud banging sound. He thought it might be his mother moving things around upstairs. Then, police officers arrived in front of his neighbor's house. ""As awful as it sounds, I think that was the hammering,"" Alvarez said. ""Nobody heard screaming -- that's the weird part -- so nobody called the police."" Still, Alvarez wondered if a call to police at that point could have made a difference. ""It was mind-blowing,"" he said. ""You never expect that right next door. They seemed like normal people; it just makes no sense."" Amarillo was arraigned Wednesday night on two counts of first-degree murder, two counts of second-degree murder and one count of fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon. If convicted, he could face life without parole. His attorney, Anthony Battisti, declined to comment on Thursday.","Carlos Alberto Amarillo, 44, allegedly killed two women he said were ""witches""

"(CNN) -- Pirates off the Horn of Africa hauled in hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years -- and funneled those funds into drugs, prostitution, real estate and other ventures. Somali pirates and their peers hijacking vessels in the region made about $400 million in ransom over the past eight years, according to a report published Friday. The report, Pirate Trails, was conducted by the United Nations crime unit, Interpol and the World Bank. It tracks the underbelly of the pirate world in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Kenya, Seychelles and Somalia. Most of the funds came from exchanging captives for ransom, an increasingly sophisticated process mostly controlled from Somalia. In total, 179 ships were hijacked off the coast of Somalia and Horn of Africa between April 2005 and the end of 2012. About 85% were released for ransom. Kingpins and foot soldiers . Pirate financiers, considered the ""money kingpins,"" earned the most loot -- about 30% to 50% of the total ransom paid, the study shows. Low level pirates, mostly foot soldiers sent to the high seas to do the dirty work, earn between $30,000 and $75,000 a vessel. Pirates who board the vessel first or use their own weapons in an operation get a bonus $10,000, the study says. Rewards aside, there is also punishment. Those who refuse to follow orders, mistreat the crew or fall asleep on the job get fined, according to the study, . And each step of the operation is tracked, with a lot of beneficiaries along the way. ""When a ship is caught, the pirates call at the city. Everybody celebrates,"" the study says. ""When the ship comes at the port, a crew comes to secure it. Everything is written down, every food, drink, any kind of transaction. The final amount will be deducted from the ransom at the end. The investor pays."" Pimps, cooks and militia benefit too . Cooks, pimps, lawyers and the militia controlling ports also get a piece of the pie. The pirates' money is ""typically spent on alcohol, khat, and prostitutes,"" the report said. ""Proceeds from piracy are also reinvested into the financing of future pirate operations and may support the purchase of real estate, investment in the khat trade, and other business investments and ventures."" Pirates in Somali areas controlled by the al Qaeda-linked militant group Al-Shabaab also pay a development tax to access the ports, according to the study. Although the piracy trade is controlled from Somalia, its effects spill into surrounding areas. Proceeds are moved by the kingpins across borders through smuggling, money laundering and wire transfers, the study shows. And the funds are widely distributed among various industries. ""Pirate financiers invest into a range of sectors ... some of these proceeds are recycled into financing criminal activities, including further piracy acts, human trafficking and investing in militias and military capacities on land in Somalia,"" the study says. Expensive menace . Khat, a narcotic plant popular in the region, is another favored investment, with pirates establishing their stakes in the trade. In neighboring Kenya, the drug is traded without much government oversight, making the nation a lucrative supplier, the study shows. It may benefit some people financially, but piracy has evolved into an international nightmare, hurting economies and sending the cost of living soaring. Though incidents of piracy have plummeted since 2011, it costs the global economy $18 billion a year in increased trade expenses, according to the study. It has reduced maritime activity in affected waters, affected tourism and led to the closure of money transfer services, a lifeline for some communities. ""Unchallenged, piracy is not only a menace to stability and security, but it also has the power to corrupt the regional and international economy,"" said Stuart Yikona, a World Bank senior financial sector specialist and the report's co-author.","NEW: Study shows low level pirates earn up to $75,000 a vessel .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Sentencing Commission voted Thursday to reduce sentencing guidelines that could shorten prison stays for about 70% of federal drug trafficking defendants, backing a proposal supported by the Justice Department and some conservative lawmakers. The unanimous vote by the commission sets in motion a change in the formula used to determine sentences for federal drug offenders. If Congress doesn't object to the change, it would go into effect on November 1. ""This modest reduction in drug penalties is an important step toward reducing the problem of prison overcrowding at the federal level in a proportionate and fair manner,"" said Judge Patti B. Saris, chair of the commission. ""Reducing the federal prison population has become urgent, with that population almost three times where it was in 1991."" Attorney General Eric Holder testified in support of the reduced sentencing guidelines last month and he hailed the vote Thursday. He said it ""represents a milestone in our effort to reshape the criminal justice system's approach to dealing with drug offenses. This reduction in the federal sentencing guidelines, while modest, sends a strong message about the need to reserve the harshest penalties for the most serious crimes."" Holder months earlier instructed prosecutors to start using their discretion to help accomplish some of the same goals, a move that some lawmakers and at least one federal judge on the sentencing commission interpreted as bypassing the legal authority of Congress and the commission. Judge William H. Pryor Jr., who serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit and is a member of the sentencing commission, said he wasn't pleased that ""before we voted on the amendment, the attorney general instructed assistant United States attorneys across the nation not to object to defense requests to apply the proposed amendment in sentencing proceedings going forward. That unprecedented instruction disrespected our statutory role."" The federal prison system holds 216,000 prisoners. With only 5% of the world's population, the Unites States has nearly 25% of its prisoners. Holder, in a statement Thursday, called on Congress to make further changes to sentencing guidelines, particularly those that reduce the discretion of judges on how to deal with drug offenders. He said legislation he is championing with some Republican lawmakers, such as Sen. Rand Paul, and Democrats, such as Sen. Patrick Leahy, ""would take further steps to reduce our overburdened prison system.""","Sentencing commission votes to reduce sentencing guidelines .

"(CNN) -- NASA's New Horizons explorer is hurtling through space on its way to the outermost reaches of the solar system for a rendezvous with the small, icy ""dwarf planet"" of Pluto and its five moons. It's a staggering decade-long, 3 billion mile journey that started with the New Horizons launch in 2006. The space probe is expected to reach Pluto next summer, the only spacecraft to visit it. It's also only the fifth probe to ever journey so far from the sun across such vast reaches of space, according to NASA officials. New Horizons is reminiscent of another historic undertaking: NASA's Voyager 2 mission to Neptune. Monday marks the 25th anniversary of Voyager's fly-by of Neptune and its moon Triton on August 25, 1989. The mission gave humanity its first close-up glimpse of the eighth planet from the sun and its largest satellite. Marking the 25th anniversary, NASA has released a global color map of Triton using Voyager's extraordinary footage of the moon and a video of the fly-by. The space agency says the map's colors are a close approximation of the moon's natural colors. NASA says the image of Triton and video provides a sneak peek of what scientists expect when New Horizons reaches Pluto. ""Although Triton is a moon of a planet and Pluto is a dwarf planet, Triton serves as a preview of sorts for the upcoming Pluto encounter,"" NASA said on its website. But the space agency also says it expects great differences in the large moon and the dwarf planet. ""Although both bodies originated in the outer solar system, Triton was captured by Neptune and has undergone a radically different thermal history than Pluto. Tidal heating has likely melted the interior of Triton, producing the volcanoes, fractures and other geological features that Voyager saw on that bitterly cold, icy surface."" Pluto, which is slightly smaller than Triton, will likely be very different from Neptune's large moon, but researchers expect the dwarf planet to have similar features to Triton, including internal density and bulk composition, and similarly low temperatures on its frozen surface. Voyager also discovered atmospheric plumes on Triton, according to NASA. The discovery, said NASA researchers, made it ""one of the active known bodies in the outer solar system, along with ... Jupiter's moon Io and Saturn's moon Enceladus."" Scientists are hoping the New Horizons mission will help establish whether Pluto or its largest moon, Charon, falls into this category. Space agency officials caution, however, when New Horizons makes its closest fly-by of Pluto on July 14, 2015, ""it will not be a replay of Voyager, but more of a sequel and a reboot."" New Horizons is more technologically advanced than Voyager, and it's also exploring a whole new planetary system, so researchers expect to make new discoveries. Monday, August 25, also marks another milestone anniversary for NASA: Two years ago, Voyager 1 reached interstellar space, defined by Voyager Project Scientist Dr. Ed Stone as ""the space between the stars.""","NASA's New Horizons mission hurtles toward Pluto in historic 3 billion mile expedition .

"(CNN) -- It's ugly out there. And it's only getting uglier. Tuesday has been a mess for much of the East Coast. A massive storm that started in California soaked a huge swath from Florida to New England, with snow and sleet falling in pockets of Pennsylvania and New York. This system isn't going away anytime soon. In fact, it could cause even more problems and headaches on Wednesday, especially if you are among the thousands at airports waiting and waiting and waiting to fly home for Thanksgiving. That's because winds are forecast to pick up and sock densely populated places in the Northeast in the next day or so. For drivers, big gusts mixed with drenching rains can slow things down any day. For air travelers, there is always a big trickle-down effect when places like New York's LaGuardia and Kennedy airports or those in Philadelphia and Boston experience wind delays. When this kind of stuff happens on one of the biggest travel days of the year? Let's just say people along the East Coast may have many good reasons to give thanks this holiday season. But the weather likely won't be one of them. Don't get trapped by bad Thanksgiving weather: Top tips . Storm blamed for wrecks, deaths . The expected issues shouldn't overshadow what this storm has already done, and continued to do Tuesday. The system started on the West Coast, proving its might from the get-go. A 52-year-old man in Yuba County, California, died Thursday when a tree fell on top of a vehicle, a county sheriff's office said. Road conditions were blamed for the deaths of two people in New Mexico. Three people were killed in an icy pileup along Interstate 40 late Friday in northwest Texas. The weather also was blamed for four deaths in Oklahoma since late last week . Those were just some of the casualties from a storm that has led to more than 100 wrecks. There was more where that came from Tuesday. One stretch of the the Pennsylvania Turnpike, about 20 miles east of Pittsburgh, saw a little of everything over the course of the day -- snow, rain, ice -- according to CNN's Shannon Travis. Snow was the issue for cities and towns along the Appalachian Mountains, all the way down to West Virginia. Parts of upstate New York, including Buffalo and Syracuse, were seeing flakes on Tuesday night. Still, it wasn't -- or at least won't be -- especially chilly everywhere. The National Weather Service forecast temperatures to rise into the 50s during the night in Philadelphia and Boston. But there, the temperature won't be the story so much as the wind speed. Sustained winds in New York -- where the thermostat should hit 55 degrees by 5 a.m. -- will reach 19 to 24 mph, with gusts blowing as strong as 55 mph. It will not be much better Thursday, when the forecast calls for breezes from the west at 21 to 24 mph, with more potent gusts. Forget the rain: That wind could hamper the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade through the streets of Manhattan. The giant balloons that are the parade's trademarks -- featuring characters from Hello Kitty to Snoopy to the Pillsbury Doughboy -- won't soar if sustained winds exceed 23 mph that day, because of fears that the balloon handlers won't be able to control them. ""We have a sergeant assigned to each of the balloons,"" New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said. ""They can be lowered all the way to the ground if the determination is made not to fly them."" Slick roads, high winds . Chances are no one will miss the gigantic balloon versions of Papa Smurf or Pikachu around the dinner table on Thursday. But the same might not hold true for hundreds trying to fly out on airplanes over the coming days. #ATL24: A day in the life of the world's busiest airport . As of Tuesday night, the weather's effect on flights was fairly minimal. As of 10:30 p.m., 158 flights had been canceled nationwide with another 84 scuttled Wednesday, according to the air travel tracking website Flightaware.com. The highest number of pre-Thanksgiving Day cancellations with 28 so far is northern New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport, the site says. There is a possibility this situation could turn for the worst, quickly, leading to major delays if not more cancellations. CNN's meteorology unit estimates, if winds blow as forecast, New York metro area airports could see average delays of two to three hours, and Boston's Logan airport could be even worse. This wouldn't just affect those flying in and out of those airports, or others like Washington's Dulles or Reagan that could be similarly affected. There's a ripple effect because of the logistics of carefully coordinated schedules and connecting flights that could affect many of the 3.14 million people that AAA projects will fly this weekend. In expectation of such headaches, major airlines like Delta, U.S. Airways, JetBlue and United have already relaxed their policies by letting some customers change their reservations without a fee. Storm prompts airlines to relax travel policies . Still, the vast majority of travelers -- 43.4 million, by AAA's count -- won't be in the air, but on the road. For them, the combination of strong winds and slick surfaces, even if they aren't coated with snow or ice, could lead to problems. In other words, make a plan if you will be among these millions over the next few days, packing snacks and patience in case you come to a crawl. And, as always, drive safely. 5 healthy eating tips for holiday travelers . CNN's Indra Petersons, Dave Hennen, Dave Alsup, Rene Marsh and Holly Yan contributed to his report.","NEW: Website: 158 U.S. flights are canceled Tuesday, 84 so far Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- A long-distance swimmer was attacked by a great white shark near the pier in Manhattan Beach, California, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. A fisherman on the pier had hooked the 7-foot shark Saturday and was trying to reel in the struggling fish when the victim swam by, LAFD spokesman Rick Flores said. ""It was agitated and when the swimmer got close, it bit him,"" Flores told CNN. The victim was part of a group of swimmers training in the waters near the pier. They did not see the shark until it was too late. The victim was bit in the torso, sustaining a wound Flores described as ""moderate."" ""The shark bit the swimmer and then released,"" he said. The 40-year-old man is still in the hospital, Flores said Saturday evening. Bystanders captured the aftermath of the attack on cell phone video. CNN affiliate KTLA posted the video on its website. It shows a group of swimmers frantically trying to reach shore with the victim screaming loudly from the water and people on the pier urging him to hurry, yelling that the shark was still close by. All of the swimmers in the water made it to shore safely. The victim was treated by paramedics at the scene, then transported to a local hospital, according to LAFD's Twitter feed. ""The male shark bit victim is reported to be in stable condition,"" a tweet from the lifeguard division said. The fisherman had struggled to reel in the great white for up to 40 minutes before the attack happened. Then he cut the line and the shark swam away, Flores said. Police closed down the Manhattan Beach Pier after the incident. It will remain closed until Tuesday, according to a press release. Shark attacks are still pretty rare, but have increased at a steady rate since 1900, ""with each decade having more attacks then the previous,"" according to statistics from the International Shark Attack File based in Gainesville, Florida. ISAF says on its website that in 2013 there were 72 unprovoked shark attacks on humans, actually the lowest number of global attacks since 2009, when 67 attacks occurred. The research organization emphasized on its website that an increasing number of shark attacks doesn't mean the rate of attacks is increasing. ISAF research shows people are spending more time at sea, which increases the interactions between humans and sharks. One-ton shark headed to Texas coast . What devoured this great white shark?

"(LifeWire)  -- Can a piece of paper save a marriage? One suburban Boston couple figured it was worth trying so they entered into a legal agreement to manage a major source of tension in their relationship - money. The couple, in their late 50s, met in college, dated for six years, married and had two children. And they fought constantly over their finances. The husband and wife, who asked to remain anonymous, had taken out two mortgages on their home and spent inheritance money to pay down debt from the husband's consulting business. ""I would lie awake at night thinking we're going to lose the house and lose everything we ever worked for,"" says the wife, who teaches at a local university. ""This was with me 24-7."" She valued stability; he saw debt as a means of building his business. Several marriage counselors couldn't help them come to terms with their different attitudes toward money. Then they came across an article about marital mediation, and it mentioned postnuptial agreements. ""It's the same concept as a prenuptial agreement,"" says Los Angeles attorney Scott Weston, co-author of ""I Do, You Do ... But Just Sign Here: A Quick and Easy Guide to Cohabitation, Prenuptial and Postnuptial Agreements."" ""Instead of being done before a marriage, it's done during a marriage,"" he says. Postnups, while much less common than prenuptial agreements, are gaining in popularity. Nearly 50 percent of attorneys polled by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers reported an increase in the number of postnups from 2002 to 2007. The agreements usually are used to settle financial issues, says Weston, whose high-profile clients have included Robert Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, as well as author Terry McMillan and boxer Oscar de la Hoya. Postnups might be used to determine who owns assets, set a budget for household expenses or remove a business from the table in the event of a divorce. Couples also have used them to decide such things as how often the mother-in-law gets to visit or how many boys-only weekends the husband gets to take. 'I was able to breathe easier' A postnuptial or mediated agreement can help save a couple's relationship -- if that's their goal. ""In cases where couples want to stay married, it can apply very efficiently,"" says Cambridge, Massachusetts, attorney John A. Fiske. ""If they don't want to stay married, it's hopeless."" The Boston couple, who had been married 30 years, fell in the former camp. Fiske helped them put into writing a mutually acceptable financial plan. They agreed to transfer their house into the wife's name, both to address her fear of losing the asset and to insulate it from the husband's business debts, and to split the mortgage and other household expenses. That was 18 months ago, and they credit the post-nuptial agreement with helping them become a mutually supportive couple again. ""In my case, I wanted financial security -- not necessarily a new BMW every year, but to feel some financial security,"" she says. ""What he wanted was emotional support from me."" The agreement largely has quelled their arguments, they say, even though the husband's consulting business is still between $150,000 and $200,000 in debt. ""I don't think the issue has ever totally gone away,"" the wife says, ""but I feel like I was able to breathe easier... without this being in the forefront all of the time."" Most couples do use the postnups as a blueprint for an eventual divorce, according to Elinor Robin, a Boca Raton, Florida, conflict strategist and mediator. But she thinks successful mediation can reveal the potential to save a marriage. ""The very process of working on this arrangement is a positive exercise for most couples,"" Robin says. ""People will say (a postnup) ruins the romance, it ruins the love. If you can't have difficult discussions, that's a death knell for a marriage."" Postnup takes three lawyers . Both husband and wife should have a postnup reviewed by their own lawyers or it's not likely to withstand a legal test. For the Boston couple, that meant $5,000 in fees: Fiske drew up the agreement and then they each hired individual lawyers review it. Getting a second opinion also allows the couple to make sure the terms are right for them. The husband's lawyer advised him against signing over the house, but he says he trusted his wife and felt it was the right move. ""I was told she could walk off with the house and leave (me) in the cold,"" he says. ""I viewed it as, I had used up my amount of equity in the house with the amount of debt I had. It wasn't (my wife's) fault. I would rather have the debt on my shoulders and not have the emotional problems."" Both view their postnup as the reason they made it to their 30th wedding anniversary. ""We both feel it saved our marriage,"" the wife says. ""It didn't make our problems go away, but it allowed us to keep going as a couple."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Netflix knows you well. The streaming and DVD service knows what you've rented and streamed and how long it took you to watch. It knows what genres you like and what performers you prefer. Who knows? It may even have an idea whether you prefer your popcorn lightly salted or slathered with butter. (Don't want the rest of the world to know? It's also testing a privacy mode.) It has taken this knowledge and managed to produce a few hits of its own -- not just with audiences, but also within the industry. Netflix is having a moment. Its series, such as ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange Is the New Black,"" recently picked up 31 Emmy nominations. Wall Street approves of the strategy, having bid up Netflix's share price 10-fold in the last five years. Emmy nominations 2014: What we learned . And the audience? Netflix just announced it has cracked 50 million subscribers, more than double the number it had just four years ago. It has taken some old showbiz lessons -- trust the creatives, budget them appropriately -- and added some new twists: Binge-watching. Deep data mining. Exploiting the catalog as if there were nowhere else to go. (From the comments on this Mashable piece, you'd think Netflix owned the only copy of ""Big Daddy"" and had it transferred to flammable nitrate stock.) Can it maintain its dominance? It wasn't so long ago that the place was posting losses and alienating customers. Pop culture doesn't sit still, and neither does business. Netflix, which helped drive Blockbuster into oblivion, has to watch challenges from distributors such as Amazon and Hulu -- not to mention stay friendly with content providers like movie studios. In the meantime, however, Netflix can offer a few lessons on how to scale the media mountain. 1. It's not TV, it's Netflix. In an interview with CNN's Brian Stelter, Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos made it clear Netflix wasn't going to operate by conventional TV rules. ""Every kind of flavor of (traditional TV) should go out the window, as we have conditioned the universe to expect instant gratification by the Internet,"" he said. Netflix's plan is multifaceted. It has its original series, which give it cachet. But a majority of Netflix watching is of old TV series, as if the service is an old UHF channel offering reruns of classic shows. And then there's the binge-watching, something anyone who's ever sat down for a ""Law & Order"" marathon is quite familiar with. Finally, there's the library: tens of thousands of titles at your fingertips. Netflix is on target with its focus on ""instant gratification,"" said Jim McKairnes, a former CBS executive who's now the Verizon Chair in Global Broadband and Telecommunications at Temple University. Today's audiences -- particularly younger viewers -- want what they want, when they want it. They have no concept of ""sitting down to watch TV,"" he said. ""That's a concept foreign to them. It's like trying to tell them what a phone booth is."" There's also something else: Money. Broadcast and most cable networks are dependent on advertiser dollars. Netflix takes cash directly from subscribers. Comparing Netflix with traditional TV networks is like comparing ""apples and furniture,"" McKairnes said. 2. Dig your data. It's worth noting that Reed Hastings, who co-founded Netflix with Marc Randolph in 1997, isn't from TV or movies. He's a techie, having made his first fortune with a software development company. So a number of Netflix's moves have been more striking in terms of technology than pop culture storytelling. Netflix was built for the Internet -- not for brick-and-mortar strip malls, like Blockbuster, its early competitor -- and embraced streaming as soon as broadband became widespread. Moreover, in 2005 it sponsored a $1 million ""Netflix Prize"" to go to the software designer who could best improve Netflix's algorithm -- and the improvements weren't even used. ""House of Cards,"" its first major original success, was built as much on data as it was content. ""Because we have a direct relationship with consumers, we know what people like to watch and that helps us understand how big the interest is going to be for a given show,"" Netflix's Jonathan Friedland told The New York Times. 3. Know your customers. Ah, the customer. For all the TV and movies we consume, it's surprising sometimes how little attention is paid to our desires. Shows are canceled or moved, quality is inconsistent and viewers are subjected to minor annoyances. Take one example: NBC's ""The Blacklist."" Next season, McKairnes observed, NBC is going to split its season in two. The show will debut in fall, take a break for the holidays and the Super Bowl, then return on a new night. The strategy runs the risk of alienating the show's fan base, he said. ""I don't know if the Netflixes of the world would do that in terms of pissing off their customers,"" McKairnes said. And that's the thing. Netflix treats the customer well, said brand marketing authority Jeetendr Sehdev. ""They have been very insight-oriented -- they've listened very carefully to the audience, been able to project audience's behaviors and they've developed services and a product operating around that,"" he said. That builds goodwill, he added. ""Audiences are far more willing to forgive brands that behave authentically and whose intentions are good,"" said Sehdev. ""(Netflix is) such a human, intimate, audience-centric brand. Even if they fail, that will be seen as being coherent with its brand image."" 4. Trust the creatives. In a speech at last year's Guardian Edinburgh International Television Festival, ""House of Cards"" star and producer Kevin Spacey -- a biased party, to be sure -- said he and the show's other producers, David Fincher and Beau Willimon, appreciated the service's willingness to take chances. ""Netflix was the only company that said, 'We believe in you. We've run our data, and it tells us our audience would watch this series,' "" he said. Jenji Kohan, the creator of ""Orange Is the New Black,"" agreed. Her show was turned down by both Showtime and HBO before Netflix grabbed it. The service ""pretty much bought it in the room,"" Kohan told The New York Times. It's an old lesson, but one that has to be consistently relearned, said McKairnes. ""HBO started it in the late '90s -- that's when broadcast network television was looking over its shoulder -- and AMC set the bar, and now Netflix is raising it,"" he said. The common bond: trusting creative types and letting them do their thing. 5. Get cool. ""Chelsea Lately"" host and comic author Chelsea Handler summed up a world of admiration about joining Netflix, where she's scheduled to host a variety of programs, including a new talk show. ""I'm more excited than I've been in awhile, and the team at Netflix is the most forward thinking, alert group I've sat down with in ages,"" she said in a statement last month. The Emmy nominations -- which also included nods for Ricky Gervais' ""Derek"" -- only added to the buzz around the service. Netflix's shows are built around storytelling, and Spacey -- reiterating a point made by the late director David Lean -- noted that the movie studios' blockbuster mentality runs counter to storytelling. The movie business needs to be more flexible, said Spacey, so it can have both. Could Netflix have an effect on the movie business? Not right now, said University of Nebraska film professor Wheeler Winston Dixon. Their business is less about storytelling and more about spectacle. ""The main thing studios have to do is to get people off the couch and into the theaters, and the thing that's going to do that is a huge blockbuster spectacle which offers IMAX, 3-D, blasting sound,"" he said. Still, with this summer's dismal domestic box office -- based on play-it-safe big-budget tentpoles and sequels filled with computer graphics -- it's worth watching if change is in the wind. 6. Watch -- out. If all the praise Netflix has earned sounds familiar, it's because we've seen this show before. The golden child is placed on a pedestal by the media and then knocked to the ground, or simply ignored. Netflix has been called the ""new HBO,"" but the old HBO was just as golden as Netflix in the early 2000s, before shows like ""John from Cincinnati"" came along. (It has since recovered much of its luster.) AMC was magical when ""Mad Men"" and ""Breaking Bad"" were peaking, less so after ""Cold Winter Sun"" and ""The Killing."" Even Pixar, sainted Pixar, has dropped a notch or two from the days before it started revving the wanly reviewed ""Cars."" (In Pixar's defense, ""Cars"" has been a merchandising bonanza.) Netflix has had its share of missteps. There was the Qwikster debacle, in which an attempt at a DVD-only service failed. (To its credit, the company quickly apologized.) It's currently attracting negative notice for stopping Saturday DVD mailings, because not everyone has signed up for streaming. Its series ""Lilyhammer"" and ""Hemlock Grove,"" though both renewed, haven't received a great deal of attention. Another original, ""Bad Samaritans,"" barely registered at all. Now other series are in the works, and may be hit or miss. One recent Netflix announcement said siblings Lana and Andy Wachowski, of ""The Matrix"" fame, are developing a show called ""Sense8."" Given the Wachowskis' recent track record, that show could go either way. Still, Netflix appears to have a plan. And as the service blazes its trail, it's certainly worth watching, said McKairnes. ""This is a whole new world,"" he said. ""I wouldn't even know how to describe what failure is yet. I don't know that anybody does in the world of streaming.""

"(CNN) -- A lab crucial to diagnosing cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reopened, according to the CDC. The Atlanta lab was closed several weeks ago after reports of multiple improprieties -- including transporting dangerous materials in Ziploc bags and sending a live sample of bird flu to a low-security lab -- prompted CDC Director Dr. Thomas Frieden to instruct his highest-security labs to stop transferring out biological materials. The TB lab resumed operations after an ""intensive review"" by the CDC's new internal laboratory safety working group. The group has implemented detailed safety procedures for TB inactivation, according to a CDC statement. This lab was not involved in the recent anthrax- and deadly flu-exposure incidents. The transfer moratorium remains in place for other high-security labs, known as BSL-3 and BSL-4. The lab mishaps continue to have broad impact, compromising care for patients with diseases such as chikungunya and potentially slowing work overseas on Ebola and MERS. Laboratories around the world can no longer depend on the CDC to help them diagnose these unusual diseases, said Michael Shaw, deputy director of the CDC's Office of Infectious Diseases. The CDC is one of only three public health labs in the United States that does quick testing on drug-resistant tuberculosis specimens to see which antibiotic might work the best. The CDC is still turning away about 100 samples per week that need to be checked for chikungunya, a mosquito-borne disease that's risen to record levels in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and other parts of the Caribbean, according to Shaw. Doctors in the area have been sending specimens to the CDC to help diagnose the disease, which often has the same symptoms as dengue fever or malaria. Without answers, doctors on the ground will have difficulty knowing how to treat their patients and whether they need to isolate them from others, Shaw said. The CDC has also stopped a mosquito surveillance program in Gulf Coast states aimed at detecting whether infected bugs are bringing the disease to the continental United States. State labs in the United States also rely on materials from the CDC to test substances such as white powders that are suspicious for bioterrorism. The labs have enough materials to last awhile but at some point will run out. Internationally, labs working on the Ebola crisis in Africa and on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome might see their work slowed down because of the CDC lab situation. Those labs depend on materials from the CDC to do their work. Shaw said they also currently have enough but might run out soon. The 22 CDC labs under the moratorium are in Atlanta; Anchorage, Alaska; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Fort Collins, Colorado. The moratorium will be removed lab by lab as each one can prove it can operate safely again, Shaw said. ""We shouldn't and we won't be doing this work unless we can do it in a safe way,"" he added. ""As soon as each lab can document that policies and procedures and validated protocols are in place, they can resume transporting materials."" CDC lab director resigns after anthrax incident .

"(CNN) -- A tea party leader tied to alleged political dirty tricks that rattled Republicans in Mississippi and beyond is dead -- shot once in the head in an apparent suicide, according to police. Police officers in Ridgeland, Mississippi, found Mark Mayfield's body shortly after 9 a.m. Friday on the floor of a storage room in his garage. ""Because all of the indications, it appears to be suicide, but we still got some things to look into,"" Ridgeland police Chief Jimmy Houston told CNN. ""He left a suicide note, and we are verifying its validity."" Authorities haven't disclosed the contents of that note or why Mayfield might have taken his life. Yet the lawyer and Mississippi Tea Party leader has been under fire for the past month, having been charged with three others -- according to The Clarion-Ledger newspaper -- in connection to a blogger accused of taking a picture of Sen. Thad Cochran's wife in her nursing home bed. This came a week after the blogger, Clayton Kelly, was himself charged. All were apparent allies of conservative state Sen. Chris McDaniel, who was then engaged in an ugly primary battle to see who would be the GOP Senate candidate from Mississippi. The photo of Cochran's wife -- who suffers from dementia and has lived in a nursing home for 14 years -- surfaced in a political attack ad on YouTube that aimed to smear Cochran, The Clarion-Ledger reported. It's unclear how the photo was used because the ad was removed within hours of being posted, according to the newspaper. This episode and others further inflamed the rhetoric in the primary fight. Cochran's spokesman Jordan Russell, for example, said last month that Mayfield and the others' arrests ""raises even more questions the McDaniel campaign needs to answer."" But on Friday, Cochran -- who narrowly edged McDaniel in Tuesday's primary -- and his team showed only sympathy upon hearing about Mayfield's death. ""This is very much a tragic and sad situation,"" said Austin Barbour, a senior adviser to Cochran's campaign. ""Mark was a really good guy. On behalf of Sen. Cochran and all of us for the campaign, our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and his friends."" Report: Mayfield faced conspiracy charges . Mark Mayfield leaves behind his wife and two children. He also leaves a legacy in Mississippi in other ways, as a lawyer and a political leader. The Mississippi Tea Party remembered him as one of its founding members ""and one of our biggest cheerleaders."" ""He had a patriot's soul, and a smile that was as big as day,"" the group said on its website. Outside Mississippi, Mayfield became part of a bigger national story one week after authorities arrested political blogger Clayton Kelly for allegedly exploiting a vulnerable adult and illegally and improperly obtaining a photo of her without her consent for his own benefit, according to the Madison, Mississippi, Police Department. Blogger's arrest shakes up Mississippi GOP primary . Mayfield was later arrested along with Richard Sager, an elementary school P.E. teacher and high school coach, according to The Clarion-Ledger newspaper. Police also charged a third individual, John Beachman Mary, but did not take him into custody because of ""extensive medical conditions."" All three face conspiracy charges, the newspaper reported. Mayfield's death came two days after the runoff to decide his state's GOP Senate nominee -- an election necessitated since neither Cochran nor McDaniel cracked 50% in the June 3 primary. Cochran won the latest contest by fewer than 7,000 votes, aided by African-American Democrats who were actively courted during the runoff campaign by pro-Cochran forces. According to Mississippi law, voters are not required to register with a political party, and anyone who doesn't vote in a primary election can cast a ballot in either party's runoff. McDaniel repeated his vow to use every legal maneuver available to fight the runoff results. Lawyer, friend: 'My heart is completely broken' Still, while that political fight continues, the focus Thursday was on Mayfield and his family. His wife Robin was the only other person at the family's Ridgeland residence at the time, and also the one who alerted authorities. The 57-year-old Mayfield was found dead of a lone gunshot wound, alongside a large caliber revolver. Mayfield's attorney, Merrida Coxwell, said in a statement e-mailed to CNN that he was a client ""but more importantly, he was a friend for almost 34 years. ""My heart is completely broken. This is beyond tragic and the people of this community and state have lost a good man and citizen."" In a phone call with CNN, Coxwell added, ""It's not important to me how it happened. It happened today. Mark's wife called and texted me that Mark was deceased."" And McDaniel posted a statement on his Facebook page saying that, ""regardless of recent allegations made against his character, Mark Mayfield was a fine Christian man who was always respectful and kind."" ""He was one of the most polite and humble men I've ever met in politics,"" the state senator added. ""He was a loving husband, father, a pillar of his community, and he will be missed.""

"(EW.com ) -- Dwayne Johnson has long been rumored to play a character in Warner Bros' rapidly expanding DC movie universe. In a surprising revelation happening days before the yearly Casting Revelation Geek Orgy known as Comic-Con, Johnson appeared to confirm his participation in the DC franchise. ""DC and I have been talking for a couple of years now,"" said the Hercules star, clearly excited to talk about anything besides Hercules. ""There's a character out there that we're gonna announce really soon, that I'm gonna play."" EW: 'Justice League' movie to follow 'Batman/Superman' in 2018 . ""Announce really soon"" could mean ""at Comic-Con"" or it could mean ""in the next year"" or it could mean ""actually never."" But what's even more interesting is that Johnson appeared to confirm specifically which character he'd be playing. After first explaining that he would not be playing Green Lantern--even though he badly wanted to incarnate the John Stewart version of the emerald superhero--Johnson notes that he's playing someone with ""the power of Superman."" He concludes: ""Just say the word. That's all I'm gonna say."" EW: Warner Bros. superhero release schedule reportedly released: We've got thoughts . ""Power of Superman"" is a clue; so is ""just say the word."" As comic book fans know, the character originally known as Captain Marvel essentially has Superman-level abilities--abilities that are activated when he says the word ""Shazam!"" So did the Rock just offer a clear tease that he'll be donning some version of Captain Marvel's red-and-yellow outfit? If so, it's likely that the film will feature some kind of Big twist: In the original comics, Captain Marvel is the grown-up alter ego of young Billy Batson. So the search is on for someone who can believably play a younger version of Dwayne Johnson. Warner Bros. had no official comment when contacted by EW, although it's worth pointing out that there is a rumored Shazam movie on the horizon for 2016.

"(CNN) -- As many as four inches of rain fell near Phoenix on Tuesday, sending flash floodwater through areas of Arizona already saturated from recent rains. Two women and their two dogs were rescued after flood waters trapped them inside a house in the rural community of New River north of Phoenix, according to Amanda Jacinto, spokeswoman for the fire department in the Phoenix suburb of Peoria. Aerial video from CNN affiliate KTVK showed firefighters landing on the roof of the house. Strong currents enveloped the base of the home and water pressure ripped off parts of the structure. Jacinto said the rescuers were unable to hoist the women onto the roof, so a four-person crew from the fire department could reach them via a shallow-water crossing. No one was injured during the rescue, according to Phoenix Fire Department Capt. Benjamin Santilla. Santilla reported 14 other rescues in the area. An elderly woman was trapped in her car as flood waters swelled around her SUV, submerging the bottom half of the vehicle, aerial video from KTVK showed. Two emergency responders pulled her to safety. Tui Khan was one of several drivers stuck as they tried to make it under an overpass in Phoenix. ""The cars were passing and one big wave came and then a bigger wave,"" Khan told CNN affiliate KNXV. Fire crews towed his car from the underpass. Peoria Fire Capt. James Neely assisted with the rescue. ""It's been a very busy morning,"" he told KNXV. ""A lot of stranded drivers trying to make their way to and from school."" Maricopa County activated its Emergency Operations Center Tuesday afternoon, according to Pete Weaver, director of the county's emergency department. ""We are watching the current weather forecast and do not anticipate things being as bad the rest of today and into tonight because we are now experiencing quick-moving small cells, but you never know with weather so we are keeping our EOC activated,"" said Weaver. The National Weather Service in Phoenix said a flash-flood warning was in effect for central Maricopa County in Arizona until 2:15 p.m. local time. The service tweeted at 1 p.m. that very heavy rain was about to fall in Scottsdale. There was 3.98 inches of rain in New River, according to KTVK.

"(CNN) -- Robert Downey Jr. is once again the most highly paid actor in Hollywood, according to Forbes magazine. The publication, which regularly ranks who's making top dollar, estimates that Downey earned roughly $75 million between June 2013 and June 2014, putting him at the top of its highest-paid actors list for the second year in a row. Forbes calculated that Downey earned $75 million in 2013 as well. Forbes says part of the reason for Downey's lucrative income is his ""Iron Man"" status. He's played the Marvel hero in three high-grossing, stand-alone features as well as in the 2012 blockbuster ensemble movie ""The Avengers."" Come 2015, he'll suit up as Iron Man again for the ""Avengers"" sequel, ""Age of Ultron."" At this point, Forbes says that ""it would be incredibly difficult for Marvel to continue making 'Iron Man' and 'Avengers' films without him."" Arriving in second place on Forbes' list is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. In 2013, the wrestler-turned-actor starred in five films, and Forbes estimates that the 42-year-old made $52 million between June 2013 and June 2014. In third place is Bradley Cooper, whose $46 million should go nicely with the Oscar nods he's earned over the past two years. Rounding out the top five is Leonardo DiCaprio, with an estimated $39 million, and Downey's ""Avengers"" co-star Chris Hemsworth -- aka ""Thor"" -- who made around $37 million over the past 12 months.

"(CNN) -- On Saturday, in the wake of the rocket attack that downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko urged the U.N. secretary-general to recognize the two main rebel groups in his country, the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic, as terrorist organizations. In a similar vein Monday, Poroshenko told CNN's Christiane Amanpour that everyone must chose between the terrorists and the civilized world. Although any country can declare those two rebel groups terrorist in accordance with their national legislation, and so make it illegal for any of their nationals to provide them with support, the U.N. secretary-general cannot, and nor can any other part of the United Nations, except possibly the Security Council. The reason is that there is no internationally agreed definition of terrorism. In fact, the debate on what terrorism means has been going on at the United Nations for at least 20 years, stuck in major disagreement over what may be considered legitimate when people are fighting for their right to self-determination. There are, however, many international conventions that define acts of terrorism, one of the earliest being the 1971 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, which would certainly cover the downing of the Malaysian airliner, so long as the act was shown to be intentional. But for Poroshenko, the rebels in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions were terrorists long before Flight 17 came down, and will remain so whether or not they are proved responsible. Russian President Vladimir Putin would see it differently. Although he backs President Bashar al-Assad's characterization of all rebel groups in Syria as terrorists, in the Ukrainian case he believes that the rebels are exercising their rights to self-defense and self-determination. The two issues are not completely similar because the Syrian rebels are looking to change their government rather than their nationality, but in both cases use of the terrorist label has the same intention of inviting universal condemnation. It makes it harder to distinguish between what may be legitimate and what is not. And here lies one of the complexities of so many current areas of conflict around the world, where borders have become disputed not by the states that exist on either side, but by the people who live inside them and resent the identity or confinement that they confer. Since 9/11, terrorism has come a long way from the isolated cases of assassination or attack that were common beforehand. A movement such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, which even terrorist groups regard as terrorist, is as much an overt insurgency as a covert group of bombers and killers. In fact, the territory it currently controls makes it one of the wealthiest oil producers in the Middle East. Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, all universally regarded as terrorist groups, control large areas of territory and aim to extend their reach. They are not like the Irish Republican Army, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, ETA or other historic organizations that more easily fit the popular concept of terrorism. Another issue that arises in the Ukrainian case is that if the rebels are terrorists, what does that make Russia? State-sponsored terrorism has been less of an issue since the rise of al Qaeda, which seems to have done perfectly well without it. And while there are murky relationships between illegal armed groups and governments in parts of Africa and South Asia, state sponsorship on a scale that involves the supply of missiles capable of bringing down an aircraft at 30,000 feet would seem to deserve a name more closely related to conventional warfare. So we now have a nasty mix in many places around the world of terrorism, armed opposition groups and proxy wars, all dressed up in ambiguity, denial and obfuscation. And while these dirty wars drag on, only one thing remains constant -- the dead bodies strewn around the fields and towns, whether fallen from the sky or just lying where they stood. It doesn't much matter whether the international community regards the Ukrainian rebel forces as terrorists or not, there are no possible reasons or exculpatory factors that can excuse what happened to Flight 17, if -- as seems to be the case -- it was brought down by a missile fired from territory under their control.

"(CNN) -- A popular antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections can cause abnormal -- and possibly fatal -- heart rhythms in some patients, according to a new warning from the Food and Drug Administration. The drug, azithromycin, sells under the name Zithromax or Zmax and is commonly sold in what's called a Z-Pak. The FDA warning comes after the agency reviewed a study on the drug that was published last May in the New England Journal of Medicine, as well as another study by a manufacturer of the antibiotic. The warning is ""not the result of adverse event reports related to azithromycin,"" according to an FDA spokeswoman. Researchers at Vanderbilt University looked at the records of thousands of Tennessee Medicaid patients over a period of 14 years. They found a 2.5 times higher risk of death from heart disease in the first five days of using a Z-Pak when compared to another common antibiotic or no antibiotics at all. The drug may cause changes in the electrical activity of the heart, according to the FDA. People with underlying heart problems seem to be especially vulnerable to developing this condition, said Wayne Ray, professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt and the study's lead researcher. The FDA said patients who have low blood levels of potassium or magnesium are at a higher risk. Patients who have a slower than normal heart rate or are already taking drugs to treat arrhythmias should also be cautious. Ray told CNN it's unclear why azithromycin can cause heart issues. He pointed out that similar antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, have also been found to cause heart arrhythmia. Pfizer, which produces the drug, released a statement Tuesday, saying: ""The majority of patients treated with Zithromax (azithromycin) are not affected by this label update."" So should people with heart problems stop taking the drug? Not necessarily. ""This just adds another 'con,'"" said Ray. He said it's important to ask your doctor the follow questions: How serious is the infection? If I use a Z-Pak could it aggravate any underlying health issues? Are there any other antibiotics that could work just as well? Ray said doctors often prescribe Z-Paks because the drug only needs to be taken for five days, versus the 10-day periods that are typical with other antibiotics. Drug labels for azithromycin have been updated to include warnings about this risk, the FDA said.","Antibiotic sells under the name Zithromax or Zmax .

"(CNN) -- The music of Philadelphia International Records sounds effortless: the easygoing groove of the O'Jays' ""Love Train,"" the triumphant horns of MFSB's ""TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia),"" even the cocky declamations of Billy Paul's ""Me and Mrs. Jones."" Leon Huff, left, and Kenneth Gamble founded Philadelphia International Records. But forming a new R&B label in the early '70s -- particularly one leaning away from the funky, angular sounds of James Brown and Sly & the Family Stone popular at the time -- wasn't easy at all, says Kenneth Gamble, who co-founded the label with Leon Huff in 1971 after several years of producing and songwriting success. ""It was very, very hard to get information for us. It had pretty much been the norm for African-Americans to [be cheated] out of a lot of their music and their royalties,"" he said. ""I think the industry, by closing us out of so many doors ... in order for us to make it, we had to do it on our own."" But, Gamble is quick to add, ""on our own"" didn't mean alone. There were independent distributors and radio stations, much more plentiful back then. There were disc jockeys, who were still allowed to have a say in the music they played. There was a major corporate label, Clive Davis' CBS, which supported PIR's work. And, of course, there were the musicians: the Delfonics and Stylistics, O'Jays and Spinners, Teddy Pendergrass and Billy Paul, and especially the house band, MFSB, which helped make PIR into the top R&B label of the 1970s. ""This was music -- sweet, gritty, elegaic, sensuous -- that celebrated love, fomented activism, pressed for change, celebrated 'blackness' in a moment in which black America, in an urgent sense of what that might mean, was just blinking awake,"" Lynell George writes in the liner notes to a new box set, ""Love Train: The Sound of Philadelphia"" (Philadelphia International/Legacy).  Audio slideshow: Listen to ""the sound of Philadelphia"" » . It was all about family, Gamble says, something expressed in the name MFSB: Mother, Father, Sister, Brother. (Don't believe the urban legend that says it stands for something else, Huff adds.) ""We used the same musicians on all the productions that we did,"" Huff observed. ""That sort of created a chemistry of sound, though none of the artists sounded the same."" That chemistry is evident on the box set, which collects the label's greatest hits with Gamble and Huff's pre-PIR productions -- including the Soul Survivors' ""Expressway to Your Heart"" and Jerry Butler's ""Only the Strong Survive"" -- and material from artists contracted to other labels and produced by PIR's Thom Bell, such as the Spinners. The label is also the subject of a PBS special, also called ""Love Train,"" which is scheduled to air Thanksgiving weekend. PIR's sound was something different. It was often lushly orchestrated, with instruments such as French horns and vibraphones taking prominent roles, and its nimble bass lines and trebly percussion later became the cornerstone of disco. Bell, a longtime Gamble-Huff pal who oversaw many of the arrangements, had trained as a concert pianist, giving it up because, he said, ""I was tired of articulating someone else's music. I was tired of hearing it go the way I was hearing it. I was hearing chords and tones and colors and feelings and emotions going one way, but ... when the master's notes are set in stone, they cannot be changed."" Arranging and producing gave Bell the opportunity to put his musical education to work in a different way, he says. ""We experimented with a lot of different instruments, because we were always infatuated with trombones and French horns and vibes; we used the whole orchestra,"" Huff said. ""We incorporated a lot of those instruments in our productions, and that turned out to be a different kind of approach."" Arranger Bobby Martin and Sigma Sound studios engineer Joe Tarsia were also key players in constructing the PIR sound. The model was Motown, with its smooth-running songmaking machinery, though PIR's songs were deliberately designed for the PIR artists, notes Gamble. ""Most of the songs that we wrote ... were tailor-made for these artists,"" he said. ""When we would sit down to write ... we would say, 'Who are we going to write for?' And then we'd lock that person into our minds."" As an example, he mentions Lou Rawls' ""You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine,"" which for Rawls was ""like going into a tailor shop, and the tailor measured you up and put the coat on you, and it fit perfectly."" Rawls, who had been in a career trough, took the song to No. 2 in 1976. Gamble, Huff and Bell, whose history together goes back to their 1950s teen years, are proud of the label's influence, and they still maintain ties to their hometown. Bell, who lives in northern Washington state, will be returning to the City of Brotherly Love to conduct its famed orchestra in 2009; Gamble has been active in building housing and schools there. ""Philly's a great city. It's the greatest city in America,"" Gamble said with pride. ""It's the place where America begins."" And the place where the ""Love Train"" chugged out to the world.","Philadelphia International Records was influential 1970s label .

"(Mashable) -- Seven years ago, Cyber Monday was established as the online counterpart to Black Friday, a day when Internet retailers would band together to lure holiday shoppers to web storefronts through steep discounts, free shipping and other promotions. So far, Cyber Monday has delivered on its mission, becoming the biggest single shopping day of the year for online retailers. And it keeps getting bigger: Sales on the day amounted to $1.25 billion in the U.S. in 2011, up 22% from 2010′s record highs, according to comScore. Sales on the second biggest shopping day of the year, Black Friday, tallied $816 million. But a number of trends — online retailers' increasing participation in Black Friday offers and the rise of multi-channel shopping, among others — leave many asking: Is there still a need for Cyber Monday? ""It is losing some of its luster,"" Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD Group, observed in a phone interview. In an effort to get a leg up on online retailers and each other, many brick-and-mortar retailers — including some of the biggest, such as Walmart — opened their stores as early as 8 p.m. the day before this past Black Friday, and advertised their deals online in the days and weeks leading up to the event. ""As a result, online retailers are moving their sales earlier too,"" Cohen explained. Many multi-channel and pure-play online retailers now run promotions on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, as well as Cyber Monday. Some have pushed the envelope even further: For the past few years, Amazon has opened its so-called ""Black Friday"" store of discounted products weeks before the actual event. Why start earlier? In part because consumers are expected to start shopping earlier than ever before — though it's tough to say whether it's the consumers or the retailers — with their early promotions — who are driving it. In general, launching promotions at an earlier date means retailers don't have to discount as deeply or for as long later in the season, said Sucharita Mulpuru, an analyst at Forrester Research. Cyber Monday starts early this year . Shifts in shopping patterns and consumer technology use are also driving the change. Shoppers are no longer buying offline on some days, and online on others: They're shopping on both simultaneously, often whipping out their smartphones or tablets in-store to run price comparisons. Just take a look at last week's figures: Online sales were up 17.4% on Thanksgiving Day and 20.7% on Black Friday, according to IBM. Mobile accounted for 16.3% of all online sales, up from a record-setting 9.8% in 2011. Mobile has put online retailers and brick-and-mortar retailers into more direct competition with each other, opening a window for pure-play ecommerce players to compete on Black Friday and other big in-store shopping days like never before. As a result, online retailers can't afford to wait until Cyber Monday to make compelling offers; they need to make them available on Friday or before if they want to capture sales from smartphone-touting shoppers in stores. ""What that does is spread out the sales period, thereby diluting it,"" Cohen said. ""Retailers now have to promote throughout the whole holiday season to stay competitive."" Cyber Monday was, as we mentioned, the biggest online-sales day in the U.S. last year, but growth is flattening. Whereas 2011 saw 22% growth since 2010, Cohen said retailers will be lucky to see more than 10% growth this year, while overall online spending during the holiday period will rise 16.8% (per eMarketer). A recent survey conducted by Google found that Cyber Monday ranks ""fairly low"" on shoppers' key days, with only 7% planning to purchase electronics on that day, and even less expecting to buy toys and apparel. What's an online retailer to do? Mulpuru said the key to any successful promotional period is the quality of the promotion on offer. So long as the deals are compelling, online retailers can expect to see ""strong double-digit growth"" on Monday, outpacing the overall growth of the ecommerce industry this year, she said. ""If retailers are offering the exact same thing on Black Friday [and Cyber Monday], there's a problem.

""Other days [of the holiday-shopping season] are compelling, but that in no way indicates Cyber Monday is becoming obsolete."" She also anticipates that the concept of Cyber Monday will evolve, and become more multi-channel: ""We'll start to see Cyber Monday offers not just online, but also in stores.""

""The pure players aren't going to abandon it; this was a gift given to them just a few years ago,"" he said. ""But it will be redefined, repackaged."" In the future, he expects to see online retailers offer more limited-time flash sales to motivate consumers to turn to that channel throughout the holiday season. Still, online stores will have a ""tough time"" competing on Black Fridays, Cohen added. ""Online is convenient, yes, but it's still a solitary process.

"(CNN) -- Former Philadelphia Eagles broadcaster Donald Tollefson was arrested Tuesday on charges alleging that he embezzled more than $100,000 in charity donations, according to the Bucks County district attorney's office. Tollefson fraudulently raised money for charities, such as the Special Olympics of Pennsylvania, the Salvation Army and the Brad Fox Foundation, and pocketed that money over the last three years, according to an investigation led by the Warminster Township Police Department. Investigators believe the ex-sportscaster stole more than $100,000 and scammed more than 100 individuals. Investigators are concerned there may be more individuals involved, according to a news release from the district attorney's office. Tollefson, 61, was arraigned Tuesday afternoon in Bucks County District Court on charges of unlawful activity, theft by unlawful taking, theft by deception and violations of the Pennsylvania charitable organizations statute. Tollefson is being held in the county jail after failing to post bail set at $250,000, according to the news release. The police investigation alleges that on October 8, Tollefson sold Eagles game-day trip packages for $500 at a 5K memorial run for Brad Fox, a Plymouth Township police officer killed in line of duty. Tollefson told attendees that half of the money would go to the Brad Fox Foundation and the other half would go to his own charity. According to one witness, a total of 18 packages were sold at a tavern after the run. But Thomas Fox, Brad's father, said his son's charity has not received any money from Tollefson to date, according to the release. Tollefson, a Glenside resident, is best known for his coverage of the Philadelphia Eagles and for hosting sports shows such as ""Eagles Game Day Live"" and ""Eagles Game Plan."" In 1999, the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia named him Person of the Year and inducted him into their Hall of Fame, according to the sportscaster's biography on the Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia website. According to the district attorney's office, Tollefson is due back in court for a preliminary hearing at 9 a.m. on February 27.

"(CNN) -- Asian stock markets tumbled in early trade on Thursday, reacting sharply to global fears that Italy's debt crisis could trigger a European recession. The slump tracked Wall Street where the Dow Jones industrial average fell almost 400 points in one of the steepest declines in more than a month. The Dow finished down 389.24 points, at 11,780.94, its worst decline since Sept. 22. Leading indices in Asia declined at the open. Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 2.1% to 8,569 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index plummeted 4.1 percent to 19,189. South Korea's Kospi dropped 2.6% to 1,858 and Australia's S&P ASX 200 lost 2.7% to 4,230. Italy, Europe's fourth largest economy, headed deeper into crisis on Wednesday after its borrowing costs exceeded 7% -- a psychologically important threshold since Greece, Portugal and Ireland required bailouts when their 10-year bond yield broke through this level. Selling intensified in Europe too after European Union officials said there were no plans to rescue Italy because its debt -- at $2.6 trillion -- was too large for eurozone countries to absorb. The selling intensified in the afternoon amid reports that European Union officials said they have no plans to rescue Italy. While Italy's bond rates are triggering intense market anxiety, experts say the problem is a lack of investor confidence, rather than solvency, which is plaguing debt-laden eurozone neighbors like Greece. ""This is a crisis of confidence, not of fundamentals,"" said Mark McCormick, currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. ""Italy's debt level is sustainable, but it needs to implement policies that will support economic growth."" If Italy works to solve its problems, the European Central Bank or International Monetary Fund will likely have the leverage that they need to step in with an emergency policy response to help reduce nervousness, said McCormick. ""We're already hearing rumors of an emergency ECB meeting, so they could come in and aggressively buy more Italian bonds,"" said McCormick. ""But it's a moral hazard for the ECB to buy a country's debt unless that country is addressing its long-term problems."" A set of economic reforms is making its way through the Italian parliament, and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has agreed to resign after the budget reforms are approved. But that may not happen until December. CNNMoney's Hibah Yousuf contributed to this report .","Asian stocks track Wall Street sell-off over European debt woes .

"(CNN) -- Edward Snowden, who leaked secret information about U.S. spying programs, has been granted an extension to stay in Russia for three more years, his attorney said in a televised press conference in Moscow Thursday. Snowden recently formally requested that Russia's government extend his temporary asylum, and Snowden attorney Anatoly Kucherena said the request had been accepted. ""As of August 1, 2014, Snowden has received residency for three years,"" Kucherena told reporters Thursday. Snowden's temporary asylum in Russia ended on July 31. He'd been holed up at a Moscow airport for five weeks before the Russian government granted asylum for one year on August 1, 2013. Snowden has kept busy working for a Russian website and speaking out on the disclosures about the U.S. government's spying programs and processes that he helped make public. Snowden's disclosures in 2013 made him an icon among those who praised him for risking his future to expose these secrets and a villain among those who accused him of being a lawbreaker who betrayed the United States. The former government information technology contractor collected information on spy programs -- in which the NSA mined phone and Internet metadata from thousands of people inside and outside of the United States -- and exposed the programs to the media. U.S. authorities have charged him with espionage and theft of government property. No change in U.S. stance . The White House says the extension of Snowden's asylum in Russia doesn't change the U.S. government's desire for his return. ""There's been no change in our position: Mr. Snowden faces felony charges here in the United States,"" said Ned Price, a spokesman for the National Security Council. ""He should return to the U.S. as soon as possible, where he will be accorded full due process and protections."" U.S. intelligence agencies fear Snowden has achieved celebrity as a leaker and could be inspiring others to disclose classified national security information. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently commented on Snowden's case in an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel. ""I think he is a poor messenger for the message that he's trying to take credit for,"" she told the magazine. ""I think he could have provoked the debate in our country without stealing and distributing material that was government property and was of some consequence,"" Clinton said.

"Las Vegas (CNN) -- Aubrey Plaza's lips are firmly sealed about her MTV Movie Awards ""Kanye"" moment four days ago, which could be seen as evidence that it was a stunt to promote her new movie. ""What do you think?"" Plaza replied Wednesday night at a ""To Do List"" screening. The actress ran onstage Sunday as Will Ferrell began his acceptance speech for the Comedic Genius award. While holding a drink in one hand, she grabbed his golden popcorn bucket trophy with the other in a not-so-convincing struggle to get it. MTV quickly promoted the ""incident,"" while officially denying it was staged and insisting that Plaza was expelled from the audience. The network's website posted a story headlined ""Did Kanye West Inspire Aubrey Plaza's Movie Awards Stage-Crash?"" West's interruption of Taylor Swift's speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards -- in which he made it clear he thought Beyonce deserved the honor more -- was soon followed by an apology tour. He told Jay Leno that his actions were rude and he was ""ashamed that my hurt caused someone else's hurt."" He announced that he would ""take some time off"" to think about how to ""make it through the rest of this life."" In fact, his planned three-month tour with Lady Gaga was cut short. But Plaza is offering no apology, confession or explanation. Her only public comment was a tweet posted Monday: ""thanks for the advice @kanyewest went better than planned!"" Was the struggle staged, but not with everyone looped in, so that MTV could deny it was a stunt without lying? Plaza was given the front-row center seat closest to Ferrell, whom she said she's ""known for a long time."" The camera did zoom in on her after she sat back down, giving viewers a clear shot of ""#TheToDoList"" scribbled across her chest. ""That's an interesting theory,"" Plaza said. ""I like that one."" Did she do it because the best way to get a Hollywood entertainment reporter to write about her is with bad behavior? ""Is that true?"" she said. As if she didn't know. Can she reveal anything people don't know? ""I can play the saxophone,"" she said. ""That's something surprising that people don't know about me.""

"(CNN) -- The violent cycle of retribution and retaliation only seems to be worsening. As militants fire volleys of rockets from Gaza, Israel is responding with waves of airstrikes. As Hamas vows to make its enemy pay the price, Israel is calling up hundreds of recruits and strengthening its positions around Gaza. Tensions between Palestinians and Israelis have always simmered in plain view, erupting periodically into deadly spasms. Could it be happening again? ""I do not want to over-dramatize, but the last few hours may have been, God forbid, the tipping point,"" Ari Shavit, a prominent Israeli author and journalist, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour on Monday night. ""What we see is different sides who do not want escalation ... they are dragged into something that is becoming very violent, very dangerous."" Israel prepared to expand operation against Hamas in Gaza . 'The blood is up' Long-standing resentments have boiled over in recent weeks following the kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, which Israel blamed on Hamas. The militant group praised the abductions but denied responsibility. Israel responded by cracking down on Hamas operations in the West Bank, arresting hundreds of activists and conducting widespread searches of homes. When the three teenagers' bodies were found last week in a field in the West Bank, anger erupted in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Hamas would pay. The mood darkened further when a Palestinian teenager was abducted and killed in Jerusalem in what police say could be a revenge killing. The news sparked clashes between protesting Palestinian youths and Israeli security forces in Jerusalem. Throughout that grim week, Israel and Hamas continued to trade fire across the Gaza border. ""You have got politics. The blood is up. You have got retaliation,"" said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East expert at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. 'Clouds are getting dark' The region has many depressing precedents when it comes to violence. In recent decades, Palestinians launched two armed uprisings against Israel, known as Intifadas, that each went on for years. In late 2008 and early 2009, Israel carried out airstrikes and then a ground offensive against Hamas in Gaza that killed hundreds of Palestinians. In November 2012, the two sides fought a bloody eight-day conflict that ended in a cease-fire. The region appears to be careering toward another confrontation. ""It's difficult to see how this stops. At what point does one of the sides say, 'You know what? Let's have a moment where we make a preemptive concession, we do some kind of peace talks,'"" said CNN's Fareed Zakaria. ""That's not in the cards right now."" The Israeli military is nonetheless gathering its forces near the border with Gaza. ""They are talking about an escalation,"" said CNN's Ben Wedeman. ""Perhaps not on the scale of November 2012 or the war at the end of 2008, beginning of 2009, but definitely there's a feeling that the clouds are getting dark over Gaza and things could get much worse."" On Tuesday, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon said the security operation against Hamas ""will probably not end within several days."" And the Israeli military was gathering its forces near the border with Gaza. ""They are talking about an escalation,"" said CNN's Ben Wedeman. ""Perhaps not on the scale of November 2012 or the war at the end of 2008, beginning of 2009, but definitely there's a feeling that the clouds are getting dark over Gaza and things could get much worse."" 'I still think no' There are reasons why violence may not engulf the whole region. Although clashes flared in some areas of Jerusalem after the killing of the Palestinian teenager last week, the unrest doesn't so far appear to be spreading. The Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz reported that ""many East Jerusalem officials expect the turmoil to die down."" It noted that West Bank cities have not joined the violent protests. ""Are we on the tipping point of a third Intifada? A major sustained escalation?"" Miller asked in a conversation with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. ""I still think no."" Palestinian people are ""far more interested in social-economic issues,"" Miller said. ""They know the pain and suffering caused by the second Intifada that achieved very little. And even Hamas, I suspect, weakened by the fact that they don't have much support from Egypt or Turkey, bad governance, economic mismanagement in Gaza, I'm not sure they are prepared for sustained battle either."" 'No angels here' Shavit said that since the collapse of U.S.-sponsored peace talks earlier this year, Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas have failed to halt the descent into crisis. ""What we see in recent months is that the extremists on both sides are taking the agenda and are actually cornering these two leaders and actually dragging us into conflict,"" he said. He faulted Netanyahu for failing to control hardliners in his government and not acting in time against violent Jewish nationalists. But Shavit also criticized Abbas for agreeing to a pact with Hamas after years of divisions between the two factions. ""There are no angels here,"" Shavit said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry also has to face tough questions about the unraveling situation. ""Some of us here warned a few months ago ... that the moment you try to have peace in this land, the way Secretary Kerry did in a courageous way, you cannot step back,"" Shavit said. ""And from the moment that negotiations collapsed in late March, this illusion that you can go back to Washington, deal with China and Ukraine and ignore the Middle East, was a dangerous illusion."" Role for U.S.? Now, it appears tricky for the United States to play a role in calming the situation. ""I'm not sure, frankly, that the Secretary of State wants or should put himself in a situation right now of trying to negotiate a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas,"" Miller said. The U.S. government lists Hamas as a terrorist organization. During the 2012 conflict in Gaza, Egypt brokered the cease-fire. But that was under Islamist-backed former President Mohamed Morsy, who has since been ousted and replaced by the country's former military chief Abdel Fattah el-Sisi. The new Egyptian president has ""very poor"" relations with Hamas, according to Zakaria. And in the current climate, ""I don't think an outside mediator is going to help,"" he said. Even Hamas has been losing support to more radical elements in recent years, Zakaria said, which has put the movement under pressure to act. ""On both sides, there is an internal compulsion, an internal dynamic which is pushing them to a confrontation that maybe they don't rationally want,"" he said. And those who will pay the price for the unwanted conflict are likely to be the civilians of Gaza and southern Israel.","""The blood is up. You have got retaliation,"" a Middle East expert warns .

"(CNN) -- While 12-year-old Zachary Reyna fights for his life against a brain-eating parasite, the Florida Department of Health has issued a warning for swimmers. High water temperatures and low water levels provide the perfect breeding ground for this rare amoeba, called Naegleria fowleri, officials said. They warned the public ""to be wary when swimming, jumping or diving in freshwater"" with these conditions. Zachary's family told CNN affiliate WBBH-TV that the boy was kneeboarding with friends in a water-filled ditch by his house on August 3. He slept the entire next day. Zachary is an active seventh-grader, his family said, so sleeping that much was unusual. His mother took him to the hospital immediately. He had brain surgery, and doctors diagnosed him with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, according to WBBH. The family said he is currently in the intensive care unit at the Miami Children's Hospital. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it has been in touch with Zachary's doctors and has released the same experimental anti-amoeba drug used to treat 12-year-old Kali Hardig recently in Arkansas. The Arkansas girl is only the third person in the last 50 years to survive this deadly parasite. Kali was infected with the same parasite a couple of weeks ago and was at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock. The cases are nearly always deadly, but Kali's condition is giving the Reyna family some hope. ""We continue to be amazed by Kali's progress,"" her family said in a statement Thursday. ""Today she's able to sit up on her own, write some words on a white board and stand with assistance for very brief stretches. She's even able to throw and catch a ball with her therapists. We are grateful for the continued prayers from Kali's supporters, which no doubt drive her recovery."" Her attending physician, Dr. Vikki Stefans at Arkansas Children's Hospital's Progressive Rehab Unit, said in a statement Thursday: ""Kali's progress is definitely a credit to her wonderful family and support system,"" Stefans said. ""There is no longer a question of whether she'll survive and do well, but just how well."" Zachary's family is hoping he becomes survivor No. 4. ""He's strong,"" his brother, Brandon Villarreal, told WBBH. ""He's really, really strong."" Getting Naegleria fowleri is extremely rare; between 2001 and 2010, there were only 32 reported cases in the United States, according to the CDC. Most of the cases have been in the Southeast. Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm freshwater, most often in the Southeastern United States. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. There is no danger of infection from drinking contaminated water, the CDC said. ""This infection is one of the most severe infections that we know of,"" Dr. Dirk Haselow of the Arkansas Department of Health told CNN affiliate WMC-TV about Kali's case. ""Ninety-nine percent of people who get it die."" Why 'nightmare bacteria' on the rise . Dr. Sanjiv Pasala, one of Kali's attending physicians, said doctors immediately started treating the girl with Impavido, an experimental anti-amoeba drug they received directly from the CDC. They also reduced the girl's feverish body temperature to 93 degrees. Doctors have used that technique in some brain injury cases as a way to preserve undamaged brain tissue. Several weeks ago, doctors checked the girl's cerebral spinal fluid and could not find any presence of the amoeba. Willow Springs Water Park in Little Rock is the most likely source of Kali's infection, the Arkansas Department of Health said. Another case of the same parasite was reported in 2010 and was possibly linked to Willow Springs, a three-acre sand-bottom, spring-fed lake. ""Based on the occurrence of two cases of this rare infection in association with the same body of water and the unique features of the park, the ADH has asked the owner of Willow Springs to voluntarily close the water park to ensure the health and safety of the public,"" the health department said. Willow Springs' website says its water is pH-balanced, chemically treated, chlorinated and routinely monitored by the health department. What's in your pool water? The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the CDC. ""Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations,"" the agency website says. ""After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days."" Here are some tips from the CDC to help lower the risk of infection: . • Avoid swimming in freshwater when the water temperature is high and the water level is low. • Hold your nose shut or use nose clips. • Avoid stirring up the sediment while wading in shallow, warm freshwater areas. • If you are irrigating, flushing or rinsing your sinuses (for example, by using a neti pot), use water that has been distilled or sterilized.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama pledged to stamp out the gremlins plaguing his administration's signature health-care overhaul Monday, saying there was no ""sugarcoating"" the difficulties faced by Americans hoping to sign up for insurance coverage online. ""Nobody's madder than me about the website not working as well as it should, which means it's going to get fixed,"" Obama said during an appearance at the White House Rose Garden. But he didn't specify exactly what went wrong or who was to blame for the problems, which include long waits to log onto the federally administered website and maddeningly long wait times once online. There's ""no excuse for the problems,"" Obama said. But he said tech industry experts were being brought in to help workers going 24/7 to fix the site, HealthCare.gov, which went live October 1. And he pointed out that the site isn't the only way to buy coverage. ""You can bypass the website and apply by phone or in person,"" he said. ""So don't let problems with the website deter you from signing up or signing your family up or showing your friends how to sign up, because it is worth it. It will save you money."" A standoff with congressional Republicans over government spending and raising the federal borrowing limit -- triggered by GOP efforts to defund the program -- distracted public attention from the problems of the new health care system, popularly known as Obamacare. But with that standoff over, the GOP has turned its fire back onto the problems faced by the website and onto Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, calling for her to resign. Sebelius attended Monday's Rose Garden remarks, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee announced that she was expected to testify at an October 30 hearing on the cause of the problems. The committee is already scheduled to hold a hearing on Thursday, with website and administrative contractors CGI, Serco and Equifax set to testify on their roles in the situation. Sebelius had been invited to this week's hearing but had a scheduling conflict, her office said. White House spokesman Jay Carney defended the program on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Live,"" saying that while HealthCare.gov is struggling, the administration's health care reform ""is not failing."" People who are able to submit applications through whatever means are happy with the results, he said. ""Health insurance provides security that a lot of these families haven't had in the past,"" Carney said. Have you had trouble signing up? Let us know . Obama said ""the essence of the law"" -- aimed at providing access to health insurance for the roughly 48 million Americans without it -- ""is working just fine."" ""In some cases, actually, it's exceeding expectations. The prices are lower than expected, and the choice is greater than we expected,"" he said. ""But the problem has been that the website that's supposed to make it easy to apply for and purchase the insurance is not working the way it should for everybody,"" he continued. ""There's no sugarcoating it. The website has been too slow. People are getting stuck during the application process."" And in a shot at the law's critics, he said, ""It's time for folks to stop rooting for its failure, because hardworking middle class families are rooting for its success."" But Rep. Luke Messer, R-Indiana, told CNN that his staffers were trying to sign up via HealthCare.gov while Obama was speaking, ""and the website didn't work."" ""This is one of those areas where the president's not going to be able to hide behind the rhetoric,"" said Messer, who supported the failed Republican effort to halt the program. HealthCare.gov: What works, what doesn't . Other Republicans kept up their attacks on the health care reforms on Monday, with the office of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeting that when a visit to the Obamacare website made a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles seem pleasant, ""it's time for the President to consider delaying this rushed effort."" A Washington Post/ABC News poll released Monday showed that 56% of respondents consider the website difficulties a harbinger of broader problems with the Affordable Care Act, a constant target of conservative critics who consider it the epitome of big government overreach. Obama administration officials have highlighted the fact that nearly 500,000 people have filled out applications for Obamacare, though the number who purchased coverage remains unknown. Initial difficulties have started to ease for logging on to the website for the new exchanges, some of which are run by states and others by the federal government. But problems now are occurring further along the process, with insurance industry sources having said they are getting some applications with missing information. The application portion of the website was brought down this weekend for overnight maintenance, as it has been on previous weekends and some weeknights. ""To ensure that we make swift progress, and that the consumer experience continues to improve, our team has called in additional help to solve some of the more complex technical issues we are encountering,"" the Health and Human Services department said in a blog post Sunday. ""Our team is bringing in some of the best and brightest from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the team and help improve HealthCare.gov."" Logging in tough for some early registrants . The administration is still not releasing the numbers on how many people have taken the next step of enrolling: choosing a specific health care plan. The administration has said it will do that monthly, so the first tally of enrollment numbers will come in November. The Congressional Budget Office has said it expects 7 million people to enroll by April 1. Although March 31 is the deadline for people to get health insurance or face a fine, officials warn that failure to sign up by February 15 could be a problem because of the time needed for the coverage to take effect. Carney told reporters on Monday afternoon that lingering problems in signing people up could result in relief, noting that the law makes clear that ""if you do not have access to affordable health insurance, you will not have to pay a penalty for not having affordable health insurance."" Hope for a smoother ride on HealthCare.gov . He also repeated the President's assertion that high demand in the first weeks of the new exchanges contributed to the website problems, noting that the larger-than-expected response exposed existing ""glitches and kinks."" Although the administration tally of applications did not break down how many of the applications came through state-run exchanges, a CNN survey of officials with those exchanges found that at least 257,000 people had signed up for new insurance plans as of Friday afternoon. Not all of them had made a payment, and not every state responded to the CNN request. A ConsumerReports.org article last week offered tips for people trying to sign up, but had the following advice for those overwhelmed by the difficulties: . ""If all this is too much for you to absorb, follow our previous advice: Stay away from HealthCare.gov for at least another month if you can. Hopefully that will be long enough for its software vendors to clean up the mess they've made."" But in a statement issued Monday night, the group said its criticism of the website doesn't mean it now opposes the Affordable Care Act.

"New York (CNN) -- The New York City Opera needs $7 million in fundraising by Monday or it could be closing its curtains for good. On top of that money, the opera company wants to raise an additional $13 million by the end of 2013 towards future seasons, according to a press release. ""If we don't raise the ($7 million) by the end of Monday the board is going to begin the process of bankruptcy,"" spokesperson Risa Heller told CNN on Friday. The company started a campaign to raise $1 million of that $7 million through an online fundraising site -- Kickstarter.com -- that will end September 30. As of Friday the online campaign had raised only $202,223 donated from more than a thousand supporters. The organization raised $1.5 million outside of Kickstarter campaign, according to Heller. ""The odds have been against us for a long time,"" George Steel, general manager & artistic director for the company, said in an online video, ""but in the face of that difficulty we have made tremendous progress."" The company, dubbed ""The People's Opera"" by former NYC Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, was founded on the principle that every New Yorker should be able to afford to go to the opera, Steel said. Steel explains that in order for the company to break even, it would need to sell every ticket for $600, but instead the starting ticket price is actually $25 to make it more affordable. The New York City Opera received critical praise in the past for its world premieres of work including Robert Ward's ""The Crucible"" and Anthony Davis' ""The Life and Times of Malcolm X."" The company opened its current season on September 17 with the opera ""Anna Nicole,"" and should it fail to raise the necessary funds by Monday, that could be the Company's last production. ""We need the help of the people we were founded to serve to put on our season this year,"" Steel said, speaking to New York residents and opera fans everywhere. ""We need you to come together and carry it forward into the future. I hope we can count on you."" This year marks the 70th anniversary of the New York City Opera, which opened in 1943, making it the second opera house in NYC. The Metropolitan Opera was founded over 60 years earlier, in 1880.","""The People's Opera"" was founded on the idea that every New Yorker should have access .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese police have arrested a man after the dismembered body of a missing six-year-old girl was found in several plastic bags near her home in Kobe City. Through DNA testing, police identified the remains as those of first-grade student Mirei Ikuta, missing since September 11, police from Hyogo prefecture told CNN. The remains were found Tuesday afternoon by police searching bush near the girl's home. Police said a 47-year-old local man, Yasuhiro Kimino, was arrested Wednesday afternoon in relation to the disposal of the body. Local media reported the man's hospital ID card had been found in the bags. Japanese news agency Kyodo quoted an investigation source as saying the bags, one containing the victim's head and another the victim's hand, was found about 100 meters from her family home in central Japan. Local media reported Mirei was last seen at her grandmother's house on September 11, before leaving to see a friend.

"(CNN) -- The U.S Army has granted a member of a religious minority permission to keep his turban, beard and uncut hair while he serves in the military, the Pentagon and a group representing him said. Capt. Kamaljit Singh Kalsi, a doctor, is a Sikh, a faith that calls on its adherents not to shave or cut their hair. Kalsi filed a request in the spring for an accommodation to follow the principles of his religion. This month the Army granted his request, the Sikh Coalition told CNN. The Pentagon public affairs office later confirmed that Kalsi would be allowed to keep his turban, beard and uncut hair. The civil rights group hailed the move as ""a major step toward ending a 23-year-old policy that excludes Sikhs from service."" Kalsi said he was ""overjoyed."" ""Like the many Sikhs who fought before me, I know I will serve America with honor and excellence,"" he said in a written statement. But the Sikh Coalition provided what it said was a copy of the letter from the Army. Maj. Gen. Gina Farrisee said in the letter that Kalsi's ""beard, uncut hair, and turban will be neat and well maintained at all times."" She said her ruling applies only to Kalsi's case, and is not a change of Army policy. ""This accommodation is based solely on the facts and circumstances of your case,"" the letter said. ""This accommodation does not constitute a blanket accommodation for any other individual."" She said the exception could be revoked ""due to changed conditions."" Her letter was dated October 22 and released by the Sikh Coalition the next day. Kalsi is not the only Sikh asking permission to keep his hair, beard and turban while serving in the Army. Capt. Tejdeep Singh Rattan, a dentist, applied at the same time as Kalsi. His case has been deferred until he receives the results of his dental board examinations, the Sikh Coalition told CNN. Both were scheduled to report for active duty in July. The Sikh Coalition said Kalsi and Rattan had been assured when they were recruited to join the Army's Health Professions Scholarship that their unshorn hair and turbans ""would not be a problem."" ""Both are concluding their training and are slated to begin active duty in July 2009. However, the U.S. Army is now disputing their ability to serve with their Sikh identity intact,"" the Sikh Coalition said in an April 14 letter addressed to Defense Secretary Robert Gates. ""It doesn't make sense to me, especially in these hard times,"" Kalsi told CNN at the time. ""The military is hurting for professionals. They need doctors, they need nurses."" Amardeep Singh, the head of the Sikh Coalition, told CNN in the spring that the issue affects observant Sikhs, not those Sikh-Americans who entered the military after removing their turbans and shaving their beards and hair. The issue is important for the roughly 500,000-strong American Sikh community, Singh said. Sikhs faced hostility after the September 11, 2001, attacks, when people associated them with al Qaeda terrorists because their turbans and beards resembled the militants' appearance. The Sikh religion was founded in India. ""The perception is still there,"" Singh said. ""We're sort of still feeling it."" He said surveys chronicle the problems Sikhs face. Among them is one conducted in the Queens borough of New York City recently in which children reported being on the receiving end of verbal and physical abuse, he said. ""These kids are being harassed in New York. It's Queens, the most diverse county in the United States. If this is happening in Queens, it's happening in other parts of the country."" So, he said, the opportunity to serve in the U.S. Army sends the opposite message  -- ""that we are part and parcel of the fabric of this country."" CNN's Joe Sterling in Atlanta, Georgia, contributed to this report.","Capt. Kamaljit Singh Kalsi is a doctor in the U.S. Army, practicing Sikh .

"Washington (CNN) -- A ""grand"" moment for the Clintons, a spotlight on Elizabeth Warren, more muted White House expectations about Iran, and stretch-run GOP calculations filled our weekly trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table. 1. TWO EVENTS, ONE CONTRAST: CLINTON VS. WARREN . Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren are featured in high-profile events happening at the same time Monday -- both in New York City. Maeve Reston of The Los Angeles Times reminds us it is a great opportunity for those who like to compare and contrast the agendas and approaches of the Democratic Party's leading women. ""Obviously, a lot of people on the left would like to see Elizabeth Warren run,"" says Reston. ""But she's been out there on the trail doing a lot more for Democratic candidates so far than Hillary Clinton, who's been really focused on her own agenda,"" Reston adds. ""So it will be interesting to watch that contrast and whether Hillary, who will be doing more Democratic events, (is) building up a little resentment there by not getting out on the trail."" The Clinton event is part of the Clinton Global Initiative's focus on women and girls. Sen. Warren is headlining a big EMILY'S LIST fund-raiser. 2. IF FOR SOME REASON HILLARY'S EVENT DOESN'T HAPPEN... Yes, there is work for the Clinton Global Initiative. And events to help Democrats gin up women's turnout in the midterms. But the most important upcoming event in Clintonland is the arrival of daughter Chelsea Clinton's baby -- the first grandchild for Bill and Hillary Clinton. And Politico's Maggie Haberman tells us the ""baby watch"" is both a personal and political turning point for the likely 2016 Democratic front-runner. ""The Clintons have not said when (their) daughter, Chelsea Clinton, is due with (their) first grandchild ... but it is believed to be within the next few weeks,"" says Haberman. ""Hillary Clinton has said this is the thing that will impact, to some extent, anyway, her thinking about running for president, and so we are now entering that window. She says she's going to see what being a grandmother feels like."" 3. A BET ON SCOTT BROWN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE . The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a big player in this year's GOP Super PAC spending, is making a big bet on Scott Brown and the New Hampshire Senate race. Fresh from a new research effort in the Granite State, the Chamber is convinced that the race, a dead heat entering the final six weeks, can be swayed by aggressively linking incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen to President Barack Obama. Watch for a tough new ad this week making the case that she has supported the President more than 90% of the time. The latest CNN poll put the President's approval rating in New Hampshire at 35%. Looking to make a splash, the Chamber is buying time in the more expensive Boston TV market in addition to New Hampshire outlets. 4. A LAME-DUCK FOCUS ON IMMIGRATION? Congress is gone until after the midterm vote, and GOP leaders are breathing sighs of relief because there were no last-minute surprises that might have hurt the party's election efforts. Well, Robert Costa of The Washington Post reports, that's no accident. But his conversations with key tea party leaders suggest there might well be some fireworks in the so-called ""lame duck"" session scheduled for after the election. ""They're already planning to fight the president if he moves forward on executive action on immigration,"" explains Costa. ""In fact, (Republican Congressman) Steve King (from Iowa) told me that he's prepared to tie government funding in December to blocking any potential executive action. So we could have another showdown on the horizon if that happens."" 5. U.S. and IRANIAN LEADERS AT U.N., BUT LOW EXPECTATIONS . It almost happened last year: a meeting between the leaders of the United Sates and Iran. And you could argue there is more urgency this year, given the potential for Iran to shape the fight against ISIS. But Julie Pace of The Associated Press reports that the Obama White House is going to great lengths to note grievances with Iran as it lowers expectations for any dramatic diplomatic moment as both President Obama and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani attend United Nations events this week. ""Nuclear talks with Iran are deadlocked, there's a lot of tension over whether the U.S. and Iran will work together to fight the Islamic State, and most importantly, White House officials are absolutely furious with Iran for detaining a Washington Post reporter and his wife,"" says Pace. ""And the takeaway for the White House has been that while Rouhani and his colleagues may talk more moderately than some of their predecessors, a lot of the actions haven't changed and there's not a sense that having a meeting would be productive at this point.""

"Editor's note: Pedro Noguera is a professor at New York University and director of the Metropolitan Center for Urban Education. He is editor of ""Unfinished Business: Closing the Achievement Gap in Our Nation's Schools"" and author of ""The Trouble With Black Boys: And Other Reflections on Race, Equity and the Future of Public Education."" Pedro Noguera says the U.S. must have a strategy for spending the stimulus money for education. NEW YORK (CNN) -- The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, President Obama's stimulus package, could serve as a historic investment in our children's future, an initiative that could very well change the course of our nation. It is an opportunity that cannot be squandered. However, there is good reason for concern that the funds made available for education under the act will not result in the change we need. Over the past eight years, educational progress in the United States has been modest at best. According to a national study by the Gates Foundation (""The Silent Epidemic,"" 2006), dropout rates in many of our nation's largest cities are 50 percent or higher. Similarly, large numbers of students lack proficiency in reading and math in many school districts across the country, and many who graduate and go on to college are largely unprepared for the rigors of college-level course work. Seven years after the adoption of the No Child Left Behind law, it is clear we are still leaving many children behind. Tinkering with existing policy is unlikely to produce different results. The Obama administration needs a bold new strategy for reforming our public education system if it hopes that our schools are going to play a more significant role in moving the nation forward. However, so far, and certainly it is still is early in the term of this administration, no new vision or strategy for reforming the nation's schools has been articulated. There is justifiable reason to be concerned that by calling for funds from the stimulus package to be spent quickly on ""shovel-ready"" projects in order to produce the jobs that are so desperately needed, the administration will not have the time to develop a thoughtful strategy that can guide the reform of the nation's public schools. Obama has spoken out about the challenges confronting public education, most notably in his inauguration speech and most recently in his address before Congress. On each occasion, he has lauded the achievements of charter schools and chided public schools for their failures. The president's use of the bully pulpit will undoubtedly be essential to usher in new reforms, but given that 90 percent of children in the United States attend public schools, it is clear that he or one of his appointees will need to do more than criticize public schools to address the tremendous challenges we face. Education Secretary Arne Duncan may soon have $15 billion at his discretion. These funds should be used to encourage school districts to employ research-based strategies for intervening early with slow learners, raising academic standards and, most important, improving learning conditions in underperforming schools. He must also recognize that one of the unintended consequences of using test scores as a barometer for judging schools has been that many schools have narrowed the focus of the curriculum to test preparation. That effectively denies students who desperately need help the most the kind of enriched learning environment that cultivates the imagination and stimulates achievement. The administration must realize that America's schools need more than just money to address the many problems they face and to promote the kind of education that will be needed to support our economy and democracy in the 21st century. More funds are needed, especially in communities where the schools have been sorely neglected, but increased funding alone will not produce better results. The most successful charter schools -- and let's be clear, not all charters are successful -- have demonstrated that increased autonomy, combined with site-based decision-making over the use of resources, can sometimes contribute to greater effectiveness. There is no reason why similar strategies cannot be deployed in regular public schools. At the same time, some schools need far more help than they have received, and clearly, pressure alone will not produce a change in results. Policies and systems must be in place to promote best practices in teaching, to address the non-academic health and social needs of disadvantaged children, to reward innovation and success, and to intervene effectively in schools in need of improvement. We must also ensure that, like the countries we typically compare ourselves to, we provide quality early childhood education, health care and extended learning opportunities to all children in need. The United States will not be a leader in the 21st century if we continue to ignore the basic needs of vast numbers of our children. Perhaps most important, there is the possibility that education can also play a role in the economic recovery. Over the longer term, there must be more strategic investments made to ensure some degree of alignment between the curriculum of our secondary schools and the sectors of the economy where growth can be anticipated. Schools should be supported in developing career academies and internships with industries in biotechnology, organic food production, telecommunications, robotics and a wide variety of ""green jobs."" This is especially true in economically depressed areas like the de-industrialized rust belt cities of the northeast and Midwest. Put most bluntly, there can be no future for the auto industry if the public schools in Detroit, Flint or Gary are not capable of educating a new generation of workers to design the cars of the future. In cities and towns across America where jobs are being lost at a dramatic rate, revival of local and regional economies will require strategic investments in human capital made possible by highly trained and motivated teachers and a curriculum that provides students with 21st -century skills. To solve the pressing problems confronting our economy and our schools, national leadership by the Obama administration and the teachers' unions will be needed. We must avoid the tendency that has become popular in some political circles to blame teachers and unions for the failings of our schools. Unions must play a greater role in addressing the performance of their members, but we must also acknowledge that if unions were the problem, the South would have the best schools. We have to move the conversation about teacher quality forward, beyond a narrow debate over merit pay and job protection, to one focused more broadly on how to insure that teachers receive adequate support and training to meet the academic needs of their students and to ascertain their effectiveness in the classroom. Strong leadership by Obama and Duncan will be needed if we expect to see superior academic outcomes and greater accountability for the dollars we invest. The federal government must send a clear message to the states that ""failure is not an option."" We have a tremendous opportunity to move our nation forward by substantially improving our schools. We cannot afford to waste it. Our children deserve it, and our future as a nation depends upon it.

"(CNN) -- The world's first man-made surfing lake has been given an opening date of summer 2015. Surf Snowdonia in Wales's Conwy Valley will comprise a 300-meter-long lagoon 10 miles inland, with machines to create waves up to six feet in height. If you can't wait til then to carve a wave that isn't straight out of a sea-sprayed, sun-bleached postcard, there are other unusual surf experiences out there. Pororoca (Brazil) Porocora means ""great roar"" -- exactly what you hear for 30 minutes before this Amazonian tidal bore rolls into view. The wave has its own competition -- the National Pororoca Surfing Championship -- and appears between March and April, when the strengthened Atlantic Ocean tide rushes into the Amazon Basin. How to find it: The bore starts at the point where the Amazon River meets the Atlantic Ocean, but it can travel 800 kilometers (497 miles) inland. The most popular surf spot is the stretch that passes through Sao Domingos do Capim in Para state, which is served by Belem/Val de Cansâ€”Julio Cezar Ribeiro International Airport, 149 kilometers (92 miles) away. Standing wave (Munich) More than 100 surfers ride this standing wave on the Eisbach River every day, but it's not for novices -- the flow rate is about 20 tons per second. The wave, which reaches a height of two meters, is created by concrete slabs that were placed on the riverbed in the 1970s to weaken the river's flow. How to find it: The standing wave can be found on the stretch of water that passes through Munich's city center, Englischer Garten (English Garden). The nearest U-Bahn stop is Hauptbahnhof. Habitat 67 (Montreal) In 2002, Olympic kayaker Corran Addison became the first person to the surf St. Lawrence River's standing wave, named after the adjacent housing complex. Later, he set up a surf school where others could learn to ride the urban wave. Addison estimates he's taught more than 3,000 students how to surf it. The wave is created by a river-bottom depression. Addison is now lobbying to create additional depressions throughout Montreal, with the use of submerged concrete blocks. How to find it: Habitat 67 -- both the housing complex and the wave named after it -- can be found at Marc-Drouin Quay in the Montreal city center. Severn Bore (Gloucestershire, UK) The Severn Bore is created when rising tides in the Bristol Channel force water up the Severn Estuary, creating waves of up to 2.8 meters in height. The largest bores occur in spring. Surfers get a ridiculously long hang time -- the record is held by a surfer who rode it for a length of five miles. ""There's something completely mad about riding a muddy, powerful wave up the Severn Estuary, 30 miles inland,"" says local surfer Phil Williams. How to find it: One of the most popular entry points is near the Severn Bore pub on Main Street, in the village of Minsterworth. Bristol, and its regional airport, is 63 kilometers (40 miles) away. Lake Michigan (United States) Lake Michigan is the only lake with enough wind to produce surfing conditions. On average, there are just 10 surfable days per month during surf season, which typically lasts from June to August. The first people to surf the lake were U.S. soldiers who returned to Michigan from Hawaii after World War II with surfboards they'd purchased. How to find it: The best surf spots can be found on the eastern shore of the lake. Antarctica . Overcrowding won't ever be a problem here. The first (and as yet, only) known person to surf in Antarctica was Red Bull athlete Ramon Navarro. In late 2013, Navarro headed to the South Shetland Islands and became the first person to surf in Antarctica. It's one of the world's riskiest surf spots -- it's estimated that without protective gear, Navarro would have died within two minutes of being submerged. How to find it: Tricky. This is one of the world's most inaccessible places. Unless you're a sponsored pro or can convince Red Bull to spend thousands of dollars getting you there, this is probably left as a fantasy. Skeleton Coast (Namibia) The Skeleton Coast is one of the most barren, inaccessible surf spots in the world. Surfers rave about the consistent swell in areas like Swakopmund, Walvis Bay and the town of Luderitz. The coastline's popularity in recent years has prompted the Namibia Surfing Association to impose restrictions on access points. How to find it: Start with the section of coastline at Luderitz, then head along the coast to Swakopmund, where there are several surf stores. The Skeleton Coast is served by Hosea Kutako International Airport in Windhoek, Namibia. Cox's Bazar (Bangladesh) In this Islamic country, nonprofit organization Surfing the Nations organized the country's first surf competition in 2005 in the coastal town of Cox's Bazar and local surfer Jafar Alam recently set up the country's first surf school, complete with rental boards donated by professional surfers from around the world. How to find it: Cox's Bazar is located on the Bay of Bengal in southeastern Bangladesh. The town has its own airport and is well connected with regular flights from the capital, Dhaka. Arabian Sea (Oman) Popular surf spots on this spectacular chunk of coastline include Sur, Ras Al Hadd and Salalah, where Oman's first surf school, Surf School Oman, was set up. The water is warm year round, although surfers need to be self-sufficient due to a lack of facilities. There are strong riptides and the odd shark -- elements that prove even more disturbing when you're possibly the only surfer in the water between here and Africa. How to find it: One of Oman's most popular surf spots, Salalah is a coastal city in the southern province of Dhofar. The airport serves domestic flights from the capital of Muscat and a small number of flights from neighboring countries. Busua Beach (Ghana) Ghana's coastline is a muddy, dusty undiscovered surfers' paradise. ""Ghana has an almost unique combination of plentiful surf spots, warm water, consistent swell from the south Atlantic and few surfers, making the country one of West Africa's best surfing destinations,"" says John Callahan, co-founder of surfEXPLORE. Busua Beach is home to Ghana's only surf shop, Black Star Surf, and the country's only surf school, Mr Brights, which was set up by a British surfer from Cornwall. How to find it: Busua is a resort on Ghana's western coast. The nearest airport is Takoradi Airport, 37 kilometers (22 miles) away. Reykjanes (Iceland) Surfing in Iceland presents various challenges, not least the freezing temperatures. ""The weather here changes rapidly, so it's all about being at the right place at the right time,"" says Hreinn Eliasson at Arctic Surfers. ""But I just love how spontaneous the surf scene is in Iceland."" One of the most popular areas is the Reykjanes Peninsula -- the waves break over a rough volcanic reef, so wetsuits and foot protection are essential. How to find it: Easy! Head to the Reykjanes Peninsula in the southwest, just 49 kilometers (31 miles) from the capital, Reykjavik.","Only RamÃ³n Navarro has surfed in Antarctica.

"(CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he would take a phone call from Iran's president, if he called, but warns that he would have tough words for the man he described this week as ""a wolf in sheep's clothing."" ""We're not averse to calling,"" Netanyahu said in an interview Thursday with CNN's Piers Morgan in New York. ""I'll tell you what I'll tell him,"" he said. ""'You want the sanctions lifted? Stop your nuclear program.'"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who took office in August, has projected a more moderate image than his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Western leaders have expressed optimism about Iran's more conciliatory tone under Rouhani, whose comments in recent weeks have raised hopes that a deal could be struck over the country's controversial nuclear program. Rouhani has called for the lifting of international sanctions, imposed over the nuclear program, that have taken a heavy toll on the Iranian economy. In an indication of the shifting mood, he spoke with U.S. President Barack Obama by phone last week, the first direct conversation between leaders of the two countries since the Iranian revolution in 1979. CNN Poll: Most in U.S. favor negotiations with Iran . The 15 minute conversation, which included translations, was described by Obama's National Security Advisor Susan Rice as ""cordial and constructive."" Questions for Rouhani . But Netanyahu remains skeptical about Rouhani's intentions. In a speech at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, he described him as ""a wolf in sheep's clothing, a wolf who thinks he can pull the wool over the eyes of the international community."" He told Morgan on Thursday that he would have plenty of questions for Rouhani, including why Iran needs underground bunkers and intercontinental ballistic missiles. ""Why do you need to enrich uranium?"" he asked, listing countries that operate civilian nuclear energy programs without enrichment, including Canada, Mexico and Indonesia. Netanyahu: Iranian president is 'wolf in sheep's clothing' ""They don't have enrichment because enrichment -- uranium enrichment -- is how you make nuclear weapons,"" he said in the interview, which will air at 9 p.m. ET on Friday. Iran has repeatedly insisted that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Khodadad Seifi, an Iranian representative at the United Nations, said this week that Tehran is cooperating with the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and that its work is carried out under surveillance cameras. Unperturbed by U.S. shutdown . Asked if he was concerned about the partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government this week, Netanyahu seemed unfazed. ""They'll work it out,"" he said. ""Been there, done that."" And despite the crisis in Washington that has paralyzed many public services, Netanyahu defended the U.S. democratic system. ""I think, with all its flaws, the American political system has a lot riding for it,"" he said. ""It's probably the best political system in the world.""
