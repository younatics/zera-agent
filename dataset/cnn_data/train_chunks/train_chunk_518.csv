A bride-to-be has made a brave leap into married life in a more dramatic fashion that most. Meredith Lewallen, 26, rappelled down the side of a 20-story building on Thursday to celebrate her wedding this coming Saturday - and raise funds for charity in the process. In a white dress, harness and helmet, Miss Lewallen eased her way over the side of the SunTrust building in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Pre-wedding jitters?

Complete in white dress and harness the bride whooped as she launched off the side of the building two days before her wedding . The brave bride told the Times Free Press: 'As soon as they saw the white dress, I heard a bunch of cheers and woo-hoos and I thought, OK, I've got to go, there's no turning . back.' She admitted that walking down the aisle on Saturday should be a little easier than her adventurous rappel - as long as she didn't trip. The 26-year-old was part of a fundraiser for River Rocks Chattanooga which donates to ecological projects and nature reserves. Another 70 thrill-seekers were expected to rappel the building, having raised at least $1,000 for their place. The ten-day RiverRocks festival is aimed at outdoor enthusiasts with yoga sessions, canoe trips, climbing and cycling. Started in 2009, the events are now attended by around 50,000 people. The 279ft SunTrust building was built in 1968 and stands in downtown Chattanooga, a town of 160,000. Happy day: Meredith Lewallen did a charity rappel two days before her wedding in Tennessee .

New Culture Secretary Maria Miller will today call on television bosses to broadcast more women’s sport in the wake of the success of stars such as Jessica Ennis, Victoria Pendleton and Ellie Simmonds this summer. In a letter to broadcasters, Mrs Miller says that female athletes serve as ‘incredibly powerful role models’ for women and young girls. But she adds that outside of the Olympics and Paralympics women’s sport has been ‘woefully under-represented on television’. Mrs Miller is summoning executives at the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky to discuss the issue with her. Role model: TV bosses have been told to broadcast more women's sport in the wake of success of athletes including Jessica Ennis . She will urge them to broadcast less men’s football and devote more time to sports such as women’s cricket, football, rugby and netball which, she says, ‘end up buried pretty deep within the TV schedules, if shown at all’. A source at the Culture Department said: ‘There is a real risk that, as we head towards winter, football will dominate again and the names of our female Olympic and Paralympic stars will fade.’ Letter to broadcasters: New culture secretary Maria Miller says female athletes serve as 'incredibly powerful role models' for women and young girls . Studies have suggested that women’s sport accounts for as little as 2 per cent of televised sports coverage outside Olympic periods. The Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation recently found that 80 per cent of women and girls do not do enough sport. A study last year found that just 0.5 per cent of commercial sponsorship in sports goes on women’s events. In her letter, Mrs Miller, who succeeded Jeremy Hunt as Culture Secretary in the recent Government reshuffle, says: ‘Across the Olympic and Paralympic Games, female athletes have had incredible success. ‘British women have stood proudly atop the medal rostrum. ‘The success of these athletes has been truly inspirational and now we must make sure we keep that momentum going.’","New Culture Secretary Maria Miller wrote to broadcasters .

Without her bank card to pay for a taxi and no one to collect her, Miss Baker was forced to hike the five-mile journey home along a busy dual carriageway. It took her two hours to walk from Walsall Manor hospital to her home in Tipton, West Midlands on Monday afternoon. She was so exhausted that Miss Baker, who was due to give birth tomorrow, was forced to take a break at a library before continuing her painful journey. But just three hours later, she went into labour on the toilet but there was not enough time to take her back to hospital. Her partner Clint Jones, 25, dialled 999 and paramedics were forced to deliver daughter Kelsey Jones, weighing 7lb 6oz, on her bathroom floor. It took Miss Baker two hours to walk from Walsall Manor hospital to her home in Tipton, West Midlands . Miss Baker, who has another daughter, one-year-old Demi-Leigh, today blasted the hospital’s maternity unit for failing to listen to her.

'They said, ""you still have to be discharged"". 'I rang my mum but she lives over 60 miles away in Banbury, Oxfordshire, but she didn’t have her car with her.

Ministers are poised to reverse the decision to send millions in aid to Rwanda amid concern over the African country’s dire human rights record. Justine Greening said yesterday she would take a ‘critical look’ at the decision by Andrew Mitchell, her predecessor as International Development Secretary. Mr Mitchell’s move to unfreeze aid to Rwanda has prompted an outcry and sparked a row between the Foreign Office and other donor countries, which have been pressing for Britain to take a tough stance against Paul Kagame’s regime. Reversal? Justine Greening (left) said yesterday she would take a 'critical look' at the decision by Andrew Mitchell (right), her predecessor as International Development Secretary . The decision came on Mr Mitchell’s final day in the job before David Cameron made him Tory Chief Whip in a reshuffle. Half of the money released by Mr Mitchell has already been sent to the regime run by his friend, President Kagame. The remaining £8million is due to be paid in December. Miss Greening is mulling over the future of the entire £37million in general budget support the UK gives to Rwanda – half our total aid to the country. A £21million payment due at the end of this year now looks set to be axed. She is said to see a ‘distinction’ between humanitarian and development aid and general budget support that goes straight into the Kagame regime’s coffers. Amnesty International has just published a devastating report on Rwanda’s human rights record. The report said Mr Kagame’s security forces had ‘illegally held scores of civilians in military detention without charge or trial amid credible claims of torture’. The United Nations has accused the country of arming a bloody uprising in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo. Decision to be made: Miss Greening is said to see a 'distinction' between humanitarian and development aid and general budget support that goes straight into President Paul Kagame's (pictured) regime's coffers . Concerns have been raised about Mr Mitchell’s friendship with Mr Kagame, who played a role in helping to ‘detoxify’ the Tory party’s uncaring image. He helped Mr Mitchell establish a project for Tory volunteers in Rwanda and the senior Tory is thought to have visited the country at least eight times in six years. 'I’m going to take a new approach to ensure that every pound we spend has the biggest possible impact' Justine Greening, International Development Secretary . Miss Greening also pledged a ‘new approach’ on the wider aid programme, including starting talks with the Indian government on winding down its £280million a year in aid. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham yesterday, she pledged to take a tougher approach to aid spending, with a greater focus on helping the world’s poorest. She said she would travel to Luxembourg next week to demand changes in the European Union’s aid programme, which has come under fire for pouring taxpayers’ money into relatively wealthy countries including Brazil, Iceland and Turkey. ‘I’m going to take a new approach to ensure that every pound we spend has the biggest possible impact,’ she said. Problem: One Tory delegate warned that Prime Minister David Cameron's (pictured) decision to pour billions more into foreign aid at a time of cutbacks at home remains a 'very thorny issue on the doorstep' ‘And yes, that will mean stopping some programmes where I don’t think they are working.’ Miss Greening was challenged by Tory delegates to do more to end the waste and corruption in the aid budget. One warned that Mr Cameron’s decision to pour billions more into foreign aid at a time of cutbacks at home remains a ‘very thorny issue on the doorstep’. 'We should recognise that as countries get richer we need to be responsible about how we transition in our relationship from aid to trade' Justine Greening, International Development Secretary . Another, Emma Warren, from Reading, urged Miss Greening to do more to ‘make sure our money doesn’t end up in the pockets of corrupt individuals who are holding their country back’. Miss Greening insisted there would be no retreat on the Prime Minister’s pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of Britain’s income on aid, which will see the aid budget rocket from £8billion to £12billion. But she said that aid would be focused more tightly on the poorest countries in future, with India set to lose out. ‘We should recognise that as countries get richer we need to be responsible about how we transition in our relationship from aid to trade,’ she said. The aid programme to India is the source of huge discontent in Tory ranks, with many arguing it is wrong to hand huge sums to a country that is now wealthy enough to pursue a space programme.","Justine Greening will take a 'critical look' at decision by Andrew Mitchell .

The number of homeowners who are renting out a room to a lodger has doubled over the last year, a report reveals today. The boom in renting out a room is ‘mainly being driven by the economic climate’ with people struggling to afford their mortgage as well as their rising household bills, a report claims. More than 950,000 homeowners currently have a lodger, compared to just 477,000 last year, according to the report from the financial services firm LV. Landlord: The report says Britain is turning into a nation of Rigsbys, the character played by Leonard Rossiter (centre) in Rising Damp. He is accompanied by Ruth (Frances de la Tour) and Philip (Don Warrington) It says Britain is turning into a nation of Rigsbys, the landlord played by the late actor Leonard Rossiter in the hit TV series Rising Damp. Under a Government scheme, homeowners are allowed to rent out a room for up to £4,250 a year before paying a penny of tax on the extra income. When asked why they have taken in a tenant, more than a third said they are renting out a room ‘to boost their squeezed income.’ Others said they are using the rent to pay their bills, such as council tax and heating bills, and others are using the extra money to pay down their mortgage or other debts. Millions of workers have been hit by a pay freeze for the last two years, which means they have no extra money to cover the cost of their rising household bills. To make matters worse, VAT has jumped to 20 per cent, child benefit has been frozen for three years and the cost of food is rising sharply and the cost of petrol or diesel is crippling. Extra income: Under a Government scheme, homeowners are allowed to rent out a room for up to £4,250 a year before paying a penny of tax on the extra income . By taking in a lodger, either temporarily or on a more full-time basis, they can boost their finances. Matt Hutchinson, director of the flat and house share website SpareRoom.co.uk, has seen a 155 per cent increase in people offering rooms from Monday to Friday over the last year. He said: ‘The booming lodger market is showing no signs of slowing. ‘The fact that lodger income is tax-free . up to £4,250 per year means renting out a room is one of the more . appealing ways of generating some extra cash when times are hard. The average age of a lodger is 29 although a minority - six per cent - are between the age of 45 and 54, according to LV’s report which polled more than 2,000 adults. It comes at a time when high house prices mean millions of people cannot afford to buy their own home but also find that rents have reached record levels which they cannot afford. With an average house price of around £160,000 but far higher in London and parts of the South, a person on the average salary of £26,000 has no chance of buying. Latest figures, from the Council of . Mortgage Lenders, show how the number of mortgages being handed out has . collapsed from the much higher levels before the credit crunch. Terraced: With an average house price of around £160,000 but far higher in London and parts of the South, a person on the average salary of £26,000 has no chance of buying . In July, just 49,500 got a loan to buy a . home. In July 2007 - the month before the credit crunch struck - the . figure was nearly double this level at 96,500.

The fall in first-time buyers has been equally dramatic, plunging from 568,200 in 2001 to just 193,000 a decade later. The English Housing Survey, published by the Department for Communities and Local Government, shows how the crisis is forcing growing numbers of young people to rent. The number of households who are privately renting, such as parents with young children, has ballooned to its highest level since the 1970s. There are 3.6million households who are privately renting from a landlord in 2010/11, the latest available figures, compared to just two million a decade ago.","Boom in renting out a room 'mainly being driven by the economic climate'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:06 EST, 17 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:15 EST, 17 September 2012 . A woman whose mother threw her in a pile of burning trash minutes after she was born has finally come face-to-face with the woman who nearly ended her life. Amy Woodward-Davis, who is now 41 years old and a mother herself, survived horrific third and fourth-degree burns that covered 70 per cent of her body. She was born to a 16-year-old mother who didn't know she was pregnant until she gave birth to Amy in the bathroom of her Kansas City home. Then and now: Just minutes after she was born in 1971, Amy Woodward-Davis was thrown in a burning pile of trash and has since undergone more than 200 surgeries to treat her life-threatening burns . She was discovered by her grandfather who thought he heard a crying kitten. When he looked in the backyard, he found that it was a newborn baby, wrapped in newspapers in a pile of burning trash. The burns were so bad her race was not immediately clear. The Houston Chronicle tells the story of how Amy, known at the time as 'baby girl x',  was treated and spent more than two decades in and out of Shriner's Hospital which specializes in treating burn victims. Amy was adopted by Shriner's burn technician Lena Woodward and her husband after they spent a year as the young girl's foster parents. At the age of 5, Amy became curious about why she was being teased by her classmates about her burns. Mrs Woodward and her husband decided to explain the issue in the simplest of terms, saying that she used to have a bad mama who burned her but now she has a good mama who won't. As time passed, that served as sufficient explanation for Amy, who was more focused on getting through her 200 surgeries and her schooling. When she was 21, Amy decided that she was done with having surgery. Healing: Amy was adopted by a burn technician who worked with her at a specialty hospital where she was treated for 22 years . 'I'm all right with myself,' she told The Chronicle. 'At some time in your life you have to be at ease with your mind on how you're going to look, and this is how I'm going to look.' In 2009, when Shriner's announced a significant staff cut, Amy told ABC 13 that the hospital workers made her feel like she was at home during her 22 years as a patient, and that they helped her come to terms with what happened. 'I didn't look like this before and I know I didn't I had to get burned to look like this and I accept that. They did a wonderful job with me,' she said at the time. Amy has since reconnected with both her biological mother and father, who was 19 and living in California at the time of Amy's birth. Growing up: Amy learned she was adopted at age five, but it wasn't until this May that she finally met with her biological mother face-to-face, though she still won't answer why she threw her in the trash . In 2006, Amy spoke to her biological father for the first time. That phone call was the first time that her father learned that Amy existed. Just this May, Amy took the biggest step towards resolution by visiting the family home where she was found burning in the backyard pile of trash. Her biological mother and father, who have since married and had two other children, gave her a tour of the house but one room the skipped was the bathroom where Amy was born. 'I didn't want to face the fact that this is where I was born and nobody took my life seriously. I was born in this bathroom, and the next thing you know I was burned up,' she said. During the visit, she and her mother exchanged glances and pleasantries but the looming question went unanswered: Amy has asked her mother several times what happened on the day of her birth, but her mother has never answered. In that effort, Amy went into social services after completing her undergraduate and master's degrees and now works as an adoptions caseworker in Child Protective Services. 'I didn't get the closure, but I would love for the other kids who came behind me to get the closure,' Amy told The Chronicle.","Amy Woodward-Davis was found wrapped in newspaper in a burning trash pile after her teenage mother panicked .

A young Russian woman has accused her ex-boyfriend of posting sexy pictures of her on a fake escort profile he created in a bid to get her deported from the U.S. Ruzilya Khusnutdinova, 24, claims Vladimir Dranovsky - a Brooklyn dentist twice her age - sent a link to the web page to immigration officials, according to court documents. She has filed a lawsuit in Brooklyn Supreme Court demanding $16million in damages from the 42-year-old and the company hosting the profile. A Brooklyn dentist has been accused of creating a fake profile for his Russian ex-girlfriend on escort website escortsexguide.com (above) and sending the link to immigration in an attempt to get her deported . The page, which was still active yesterday, boasted she had a 'medium frame and very touchy breasts'. It offered an explicit menu of sexual services ranging 'from $200 to $600 per hour, depends on fantasy' alongside images of her posing seductively on a hotel bed in a black bra and thong. Mr Dranovsky says he has never heard of the site, doesn't recall taking pictures of her and claims Miss Khusnutdinova was actually a sex worker, it was reported in the New York Daily News. Miss Khusnutdinova told of the moment U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers knocked on her door in May and showed her the advert on escortsexguide.com. 'They pulled out my naked pictures. At first, I’m scared, then surprised and shocked,' she said. She says she was questioned for several hours, during which she insisted she had not engaged in prostitution. Ruzilya Khusnutdinova . Her lawyer says she has unsuccessfully tried to get the profile removed by Florida-based Primal Ventures Inc, which runs the site. Miss Khusnutdinova says she was studying biochemistry in the Russian city of Kazan when she met Mr Dranovsky through a dating website. She says he helped her get a student visa by enrolling in a language school in 2009 and that it was while they were on a romantic trip to Lake George a year later that she claims the pictures were taken. But Mr Dranovsky, who owns a dental practice in Bensonhurst, said she was already working for an escort service at the time, a claim she denies. Court documents say she dumped Dranovsky after he became abusive and also refused to return her passport unless she gave him $4,000. He was charged with grand larceny, but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge in February, court papers show. Miss Khusnutdinova is seeking damages for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation and civil rights violations, it was reported on www.courthousenews.com.

Astonishing footage of the dog diving into a fast-flowing river, and then dragging the canoe with his pals back to the safety of the shore, has been posted on YouTube and is already attracting a healthy following. No information is included with the video, but it appears to be shot somewhere in the U.S. Scroll down for video . Canine conundrum: How did the two dogs end up on the canoe, and what will they do to escape? He didn't even paws! Without a thought for his own safety, Robbie the Labrador jumps into the water and begins paddling furiously towards the distressed dogs . Heart-stopping moment: The dog's owner can be heard shouting words of encouragement as his pet struggles against the fierce current . Risky game: Some YouTube users have posted questions over why the humans did not help, and whether this was a training exercise . The footage starts with the bizarre sight of two dogs floating downriver in a canoe, one perched nervously at the front and the other whining behind. The dog in front is barking from the boat but, while its tail is wagging, it is clear that the situation is becoming increasingly distressing. Seemingly responding to the dog’s woof for help, our hero bounds into the water and swims towards the drifting canoe. His owner and a friend encourage the dog, Robbie, to 'keep going, boy' and 'bring him home', as the Labrador furiously paddles against the current. Strength and ingenuity: The clever Lab manages to find the rope attached to the canoe and drag the boat and two yapping dogs back to shore . Where's the thank you? Once they reach the riverbank, the two stranded dogs jump off and run away . Well done! Robbie shakes himself off and soaks his owner as the man gives him a well-deserved pat . Eventually, Robbie manages to find the rope attached to the canoe and begins an extraordinary tug-o-war as he drags it back to shore. Despite his life-saving efforts, the other two dogs leap from the canoe without a word of thanks when they get close enough to the shore and disappear off camera. Thankfully, the hero dog’s owner is on hand to give him a good pat. Some YouTube users described the footage as 'incredible', but others criticised the humans, asking why they let the dog risk being washed away while they themselves did nothing to help. The most satisfying part of the drama has to be the moment right at the very end of the clip, when Robbie vigorously shakes himself dry and gives his owner a soaking.

Scores of civilians, many of them women with screaming children clinging to their necks, crossed a narrow river marking the border with Turkey as shelling on a Syrian town intensified yesterday. The U.S has responded to the escalating violence between Syria and Turkey by sending a 150 strong specialist task force to its ally Jordan, after concerns that the violence might spread across the southern border as well as in the north. The news comes after the UN reported that 335,000 Syrian refugees have registered with the organisation, an increase by ten times since March. Syrian refugees: An injured man is carried to an ambulance after crossing the Orontes river on the Turkish-Syrian border near the village of Hacipasa in Hatay province . It came as Turkey scrambled fighter planes to . force a Syrian passenger jet to land and seized what it suspected was . military equipment being ferried from Russia to Syrian President Bashar . al-Assad's forces. The . interception of the Syrian Air plane late yesterday happened soon after Turkey's chief of . staff warned that his troops would respond with greater force if shells . from Syria continued to hit Turkish territory. Men, women and children crossed the narrow Orontes river which marks the . Syrian-Turkish border near the village of Hacipasa in Hatay province. Villagers helped the families by ferrying them in small metal boats as they fled the violence in the Syrian border town of Azmarin where several mortar shells landed early on Wednesday. As heavy machine gun fire could be heard from the Turkish side, smoke rose into the sky and cries of 'God is greatest' rang out between the bursts of gunfire, a witness said. Fleeing: A Syrian family have boarded one of the small metal boats used to ferry Syrian refugees over to the Turkish side, helped by villagers from Hacipasa . Escape: Refugees are getting in to boats on the Syrian side . 'The firing started getting intense . last night. Some people have been killed, some are lying wounded on the . road,' said Mune, a 55-year-old woman who crossed the river to Hacipasa. 'People want to escape but they can't. Many have settled in a field outside the town and are trying to come,' she said. Ambulances and medical aid waited on the Turkish side of Orontes, taking wounded to the main city of Antakya or district hospitals. 'Don't take me across, take me back. I . want to return and fight,' said one man in a blood-stained shirt, being . carried from the river on a stretcher. The news of shelling on Azmarin came just before Turkey's military chief of staff said that Turkey . will respond with greater force if Syrian fire continues to hit . its territory. After several attacks from their neighbour, Turkish military forces have responded across the border to . northern Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad's forces have been . battling rebels. To safety: Scores of Syrian civilians have been crossing the river in an attempt to escape fighting in Azmarin and surrounding villages on the Syrian side . Conflict: Civilians flee the Syrian civil war in their thousands, a conflict which now threatens to spread to Turkey . ‘We responded but if it continues we . will respond with greater force,’ Turkey's Chief of Staff, General . Necdet Ozel, told state television TRT. It is not clear whether the shells . that have hit Turkish territory in the past week have been aimed towards the nation or if Syrian troops have made mistakes when attacking rebel . positions. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh . Rasmussen said on Tuesday the military alliance had plans in . place to defend Turkey. He gave no further details, but a senior U.S. defense official said NATO would likely react if Turkey made a request . for assistance. Jordan and other neighbouring countries . are increasingly worried that the violence will spill over to countries south of Syria. The beginning: Smoke from a Syrian mortar bomb rises near the border in Turkish Hatay province on Monday, which led to a retaliatory strike from Turkey for the sixth consecutive day . The 150 troops sent by the U.S. to . Jordan are intended to provide support to the American ally as they deal with the increasing influx of Syrian refugees. The specialist task force is also . preparing to move in to help secure the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons . should President al-Assad lose control over these. The U.S. force is stationed about 35 . miles from the border and officials told the New York Times that there has been . talks of a buffer zone in Syria where Jordanian troops would operate . with U.S. military as logistical support.

Most of those fleeing are taking refuge in neighbouring Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The sharp rise in casualties and . refugees indicates the growing intensity of the conflict, which . developed from peaceful protests against Assad in March 2011 into a . full-scale civil war. An estimated 30,000 people have been killed as main cities such as Aleppo, Homs and the capital Damascus are savagely contested. Not backing down: A mobile missile launcher protecting the Turkish side this weekend, shortly after Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan warned Damascus that Turkey would not shy away from war if provoked . Taking charge: Syrian President Bashir al-Assad . After a wave of defections and rebel attacks on strategic government targets, President Bashir al-Assad has assumed personal command of his forces, still convinced he can win through numbers. A picture posted on his Facebook page shows the the 47-year-old dressed in full military regalia, summing up his transformation since the July bomb attack which killed his inner circle security leadership, including his brother-in-law and defence minister. Recent visitors say it strengthened President Assad’s conviction and he has now taken full responsibility for the day-to-day leadership. ‘He is no longer a president who depends on his team and directs through his aides. 'This is a fundamental change in Assad's thinking,’ said a pro-Syrian Lebanese politician close to Assad. ‘Now he is involved in directing the battle.’ 'The fighting nerve is steady. The Iranians and the Russians may have helped them. Their ability to manage daily and control the situation has improved.’ It is a self-confident leader who has ordered his military to focus on the capital of Damascus and the second largest city of Aleppo, which has seen a majority of the conflict. However, observers say Assad’s victimisation of the regime is ludicrous and that he is deluded if he thinks he can win. ‘The problem is the regime lives in its own world. It is clear the people are rejecting this idea that it is a secular regime set upon by extremists,’ a Western diplomat said. ‘Bashar is not the victim. He is the cause of the violence.’ Other observers of the escalating conflict say the question may no longer be one of Assad’s presidency, but of the existence of Syria as a nation. ‘Everybody is kind of hypnotised by the issue of whether Bashar is president or not, whether he is leaving or not,’ said one Arab official. ‘I fear the problem is much bigger than that. The problem is to see how Syria is going to survive, how the new Syria is going to be born.’ A factor which has helped Assad to hold on to power is the failure of the rebel forces to unite under one command. Religious and ideological disagreements among rebels have led to clashes as they fail to find common ground on issues other than the ousting of President Assad. The rebel forces have failed to keep control of their claimed territories under attacks from the government and in the frustration have switched tactics to suicide bombings and hit-and-run attacks. ‘Militarily the regime is more relaxed but from a security position the country is falling apart,’ said the pro-Syrian Lebanese politician. ‘An explosion might happen anywhere, an assassination might happen, the situation is chaotic and out of control.’ He added that the following months will be crucial to the war as the satiation depends on Russian support, the American election and the situation in neighbouring Iran.","UN reported that 335,000 Syrian refugees have registered with the organisation, ten times more than in March .

First came the low, cultured hum of the Formula One racing car engine; then rolling thunder as the rocket fired up. A plume of flame shot out for ten seconds and the roar at the nozzle reached an estimated 186 decibels – louder than a Boeing 747 at take off. Indeed, the racket from the rocket was later claimed to be the loudest man-made noise anywhere in the world. Such is the awesome power of the British supercar which aims to shatter the land speed record next year. Scroll down for video . The moment that scientists at RAF St Mawgan near Newquay, Cornwall test fired the first new rocket built in Britain for 20 years, which will power the 1,000mph Bloodhound . Engineers check monitors showing the Cosworth engine and rocket from Bloodhound SSC inside a hardened shelter at RAF St Mawgan, Newquay, where the engine is on test . Four years after the . project began, the rocket system which the designers hope will help . Bloodhound SSC (supersonic car) smash through the 1,000mph barrier has been . tested for the first time. At 12 feet long, 18 inches in diameter . and weighing just under 1,000lb, the rocket is the largest of its kind . ever designed in Europe and was the biggest to be fired in the UK for 20 . years. Yesterday, it was bolted to the floor for the test in a . bomb-proof hangar at Newquay Airport, Cornwall, and was only operating . at half capacity. But next year, if all goes well when . it is fitted inside the £10million car, the rocket will send the . gleaming orange and blue machine racing to 1,050mph. In the hangar it was surrounded by a . ‘water deluge system’ in case it exploded and concrete blocks separated . it from other parts of the engine. ‘If it blows up, at least we’ll save . something,’ said one engineer. Guests were invited to watch via a video . link in a nearby hangar and around 120,000 people around the globe . viewed it online. The rocket is seen here with the 'Cosworth' sign on the side moments before the test . In its ultimate form the rocket will . generate around 27,500lb of thrust – equivalent to about 80,000 . horsepower, the combined output of 95 Formula One cars. Earplugs were . available yesterday, a wise precaution given that the rock concert said . to be the loudest ever – a 1976 show by The Who – reached a mere 126 . decibels. The assault on the record is due to . take place in the South African desert at Hakskeen Pan, the site in 1929 . of one of Sir Malcolm Campbell’s many attempts. If Bloodhound succeeds, . it will reach 1.4 times the speed of sound – fast enough to get from . Land’s End to John o’Groats in 51 minutes. It would also see RAF pilot Andy . Green, 50, who will drive Bloodhound, smash his existing land speed . record by more than 200mph and become the first man to drive through the . 1,000mph barrier. Should the target of 1,050mph be reached, it will . also beat the low-altitude speed record for aircraft of 994mph. Mr Green described what he faces at . the controls: ‘2G acceleration, then 3G deceleration. 2G is the . equivalent of 0 to 60mph in 1.5 seconds. 3G is the equivalent of coming . to a complete stop from 60mph in one second – what most people would . call an average car crash. 'Then all I have to do is control three . engines and keep it going in a straight line.’ Up to a speed of 350mph, . it will be powered by a Eurofighter jet engine. A Cosworth V8 racing car . engine is there to pump peroxide fuel into the rocket. A catalyst in . the rocket then causes a chemical reaction which generates a temperature . of 600C and the rocket ignites, giving the car the massive boost it . needs to hit 1,050mph after 40 seconds. Then, 3.5 seconds and one mile later, it will start to decelerate. Project team leader Richard Noble said the successful tests were a ‘major milestone’. A replica version of the Bloodhound was also on display at RAF St Mawgan near Newquay, where 400 people gathered to watch the rocket test .

They came from a giant ground sloth (Eremotherium rusconi), an ancient relative of modern tree sloths, armadillos and anteaters. The grizzly bear-sized animals used foot-long claws to grasp tree limbs and scrape off bark for meals - as scientists know from studying their fossilised dung, or 'coprolites'. Fresh enough: These lumps of giant ground sloth dung are around 100,000 years old and reveal that the animals ate tree bark . The Pleistocene is the geological epoch which lasted from about 2.58million to 11,700 years ago, spanning the last ice age. The modern continents were essentially at their present positions during the Pleistocene, the plates upon which they sit probably having moved no more than 100 km relative to each other since the beginning of the period. The climate of the era was marked by repeated glacial cycles where glaciers pushed to the 40th parallel in some places. It is estimated that, at maximum glacial extent, 30 per cent of the Earth's surface was covered by ice. During this period marine and continental faunas were essentially modern although many animals, specifically, mammals were much larger than their modern relatives. A major extinction event of large mammals (megafauna), which included mammoths, mastodons, saber-toothed cats (like the one pictured above right), glyptodons, ground sloths, Irish elk, cave bears, and short-faced bears, began late in the Pleistocene and Neanderthals also became extinct during this period. During the Pleistocene Epoch (2.58million years ago – 12,000 years ago) giant ground sloths lived . over much of North and South America. They stood 20ft (7m) tall on their hind legs to get food from trees, but were otherwise rather slow-moving quadrupeds. Conditions are sometimes so dry their dung can be preserved for thousands of years with little deterioration or change. These specimens where collected in April 1941 by Smithsonian Curator Remington Kellogg at Rampart Cave in the Grand Canyon. Scientists have estimated them at around 100,000 years old. Fossil evidence of giant ground sloths was first uncovered in 1840 by Richard Owen, but complete skeletons are rare.

While Curiosity begins to explore the Martian surface, the moon may soon be home to another rover - and this one plans to mine. Astrobotic Technology today revealed Polaris, a rover it hopes to send to the moon on top of a SpaceX rocket in October 2015. It will search for ice that could help future explorers set up a moon base - and is powered by solat panels that give it the appearance of having a mohawk. Scroll down for video . The life sized working prototype of the Polaris rover that could mine the moon in 2015 . The Polaris rover is 5 ½ feet tall, 7 feet wide and . almost 8 feet long. It can move at about a foot a second on . 2-foot-diameter composite wheels. Its suspension will enable the rover to rise up over rough . terrain, but also lower itself to the ground to perform drilling. The . rover will weigh 150 kilograms, or about 330 pounds, and can accommodate . a drill and science payload of up to 70 kilograms. Polaris is a first of its kind solar-powered robot that will search for potentially rich deposits of water ice on the moon. Observations . by NASA and Indian spacecraft suggest that a substantial amount of . water ice could exist at the lunar poles. That ice could be a source of . water, fuel and oxygen for future expeditions, researchers say. Polaris . can bore one meter into the lunar surface and . can operate in lunar regions characterized by dark, long shadows and a . sun that hugs the horizon. It has been developed for an expedition to . the moon's northern pole that would launch from Cape Canaveral on top of a . SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicle. Polaris . is a flight prototype but has the same configuration as the rover that . will eventually land on the moon. It includes a number of flight-worthy . components, including wheels and chassis beams constructed of light, but . tough composite materials. This . will enable Astrobotic team members to spend the coming months testing . and improving the robot's computer vision, navigation and planning . software, and software that can plot the rover's position on the moon . within 10 feet. Polaris will have a drill capable of getting a metre under the lunar surface to look for sign of ice . The Polaris rover will hunt for ice on the moon that can be mined to help set up moon bases for future explorers . Astrobotic — led by CMU's William ""Red"" Whittaker — develops robotics technology for planetary missions. 'It is the . first rover developed specifically for drilling lunar ice' said . Whittaker. Other robots built by the Field Robotics Center have . developed technologies necessary for lunar drilling, but none of them . were ever meant to leave Earth. 'What . Polaris does is bring those many ideas together into a rover . configuration that is capable of going to the moon to find ice,' Whittaker added. To find . the ice, a rover must operate as close to the dark poles as possible, . but not so far that it can't use solar arrays for power, Whittaker said. Polaris has three large solar arrays, arranged vertically to capture . light from low on the horizon. The solar arrays will be capable of an average of 250 watts of electrical power. Polaris . also makes use of software, pioneered in CMU's NASA-funded Hyperion . robot, that keeps track of the rover's position relative to the sun's . rays to maximize solar energy and husbands battery power for use in the . long shadows and dark regions found at the poles. The lander being developed to drop the lunar mining rover on the moon's surface . Whittaker said the lunar day lasts about 14 Earth days, though only . about 10 days are suitable for water prospecting at the poles. The Astrobotic team expects Polaris . could drill 10 to 100 holes during that time as it locates and . characterizes water ice deposits. Astrobotic, in partnership with CMU, is also vying for the Google Lunar X Prize of more than $20 million. Polaris is one of two Moon rovers under development by Astrobotic in competition for the Google contest, which offers a total of $30m in awards to privately funded projects exploring the Moon. First prize – $20m – will be awarded to the company that can 'safely land a robot on the surface of the Moon, have that robot travel 500 meters over the lunar surface, and send video, images and data back to the Earth.' If Polaris successfully survives the long, frigid lunar nights, as anticipated, the prospecting mission could be extended indefinitely. Astrobotic has won nine lunar contracts from NASA worth $3.6 million, including one to evaluate how Polaris can accommodate NASA's ice-prospecting instruments during a three-mile traverse near the moon's north pole.","Polaris rover will search for ice that can be drilled to stock future moon bases .

The chalice made for London Mayor David Evans in 1891 from the 24-carat gold bar presented to the 19-year-old Queen is said to be worth £30,000. Queen Victoria was given the gold bar as part of the ceremony of her coronation in 1838 before it was melted down and transformed into the 10in-high cup.

An inscription on one side reads: ‘This cup was made from the ingot of gold offered at the altar by Queen Victoria on her coronation in Westminster Abbey.’ It is not known what happened to the chalice after it was made for the mayor but it was bought at auction several years ago by its current owner. The owner, an unnamed woman from Norfolk, paid £6,000 for it and although the inflated price of gold today would mean it was worth £10,000 if it was melted down, the association with Queen Victoria has raised its value to £30,000.

A British schoolgirl orphaned in the Alpine gun massacre said her father was standing next to her when the killer first struck, it emerged today. It is the chilling testament of Zainab Al-Hilli, seven, which is helping detectives piece together the sequence of the quadruple slaughter in eastern France. Zainab’s father, Surrey engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife Iqbal, 47, and his 74-year-old Swedish mother-in-law, Suhaila Al-Allaf, all died in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire on September 5. New developments: Investigators now believe French cyclist Sylvain Mollier was killed before the Al-Hilli family . But details of a new ballistics report leaked to Le Parisien newspaper on Friday suggest that French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old nuclear industry worker, was the primary target. He was hit by the first stream of bullets before the ‘frenzied’ gunman turned his attention on Mr Al-Hilli, who had parked the family BMW in a layby close to the village of Chevaline. Eric Maillaud, the prosecutor in nearby Annecy who is leading the investigation, confirmed that Mr Al-Hilli had got out of the car with Zainab, while denying that any conclusions had been drawn from the ballistics report. But today senior police officers working on the Anglo-French inquiry confirmed that it was in fact Zainab who was supplying key evidence. ‘The little girl remembers key facts - her testament is crucial,’ said one, who said many of Zainab’s recollections were corroborated by new forensic evidence. Sand and gravel was, for example, found on the soles of Mr Al Hilli’s shoes - proving that he had been outside the car. He then got back into the driver’s . seat, locked the doors, and tried to get away - but in his panic put the . BMW into reverse and became stuck in a muddy bank. This allowed the gunman to fire bullets into the heads of all the seated adults, before returning to finish Mr Mollier off. Burial: Relatives of Sylvain Mollier at Ugine Funeral Home after police refused to allow them to cremate him as they continued their investigation . Violent killings: Aerospace engineer Saad Al-Hilli from Surrey, was murdered in a suspected assassination alongside his wife and mother-in-law . Mr Mollier’s glasses and bicycle pump were also found ‘a fair distance’ from where his lifeless body was found lying next to the car, said the source, suggesting it had been moved. The first witness on the scene - an ex RAF serviceman from Britain - confirmed that the engine of the car was still running and all the doors were locked. Zainab, who had been shot in a shoulder and pistol whipped around the head was also still outside the car - suggesting that her terrified family was about to leave her behind. Her sister Zeena, four, was inside the BMW all along, apparently hiding underneath her mother’s dress, and was unscathed but severely traumatised. Both little girls are currently back in Britain at a secret address where they are being looked after by family and social workers. Mr Maillaud confirmed that British detectives were in touch with the girls, and were being kept informed about any information which they might offer of their own accord. This means that there are no formal police interviews taking place - but Zainab is slowly being ‘coaxed’ into saying what happened. One of her earliest recollections was that ‘one bad man’ had been shooting people, but more information is now being offered. Mr Maillaud has been working on a theory that the atrocity was linked to a dispute Mr Al-Hilli was having with his brother, Zaid, over their father’s will. But today he said that some £750,000 kept by the Al-Hillis in a bank account in Geneva - around an hour’s drive from Chevaline - remained untouched. ‘The account had not moved for a very long time,’ said Mr Maillaud. Instead, the focus of the investigation is now on Mr Mollier, who was hit by up to seven bullets in the attack. French police inspect a drain under the road to the murder scene at Cheverlaine during their investigations . Until now he was regularly described by detectives as ‘collateral damage’ during what looked like the professional assassination of Mr Al-Hilli. No family or friends of Mr Mollier have spoken about his death, nor released a photograph of the father of three, who lived in nearby Ugine. A month ago his body was ‘temporarily buried’ in a secret ceremony, even though this went against the wishes of his relatives, who had asked for him to be cremated. Forensic experts wanted to examine his body for clues, which would have been impossible if the remains had been destroyed. Thirty people attended the funeral, which took place in a closed burial site which was deliberately kept hidden from the media. The family left their Europa campsite after two nights and moved to the La Solitude du Lac campsite, which overlooks Lake Annecy . Peaceful spot: Walkers on the remote 3 km track to the scene of the attack outside the village of Chevaline where the Al-Hillis and Sylvain Mollier were murdered . French investigators are examining the theory that he may have led a ‘double life’ and been the intended target of the shooting. Mr Mollier worked for Cezus, a subsidiary of the Areva Group, specialising in zirconium metalworking for nuclear fuel containers. Cezus is owned by the Areva group which in 2007 was forced to deny a report in Der Spiegel that it had flouted UN sanctions by providing Iran with enriched uranium. He had two teenage boys from a previous marriage while his new partner, a pharmacist, gave birth in June. Mr Mollier was still on paternity leave and had been using his spare time to cycle around the countryside. He was identified after his partner, worried about not seeing him return, alerted the police. Police have also revealed they are looking for a motorcyclist who was seen in the vicinity of the crime scene at around 4pm - within half an hour of the killings. A local farmer said he saw the rider looking ‘unsure of the route’, and struggling to manoeuvre his bike over pot-holed roads. Brett Martin, a 53-year-old Englishman who used to be in the RAF, was the first to arrive at the scene of the carnage on his bicycle.",Zainab Al-Hilli's crucial testament is helping detectives piece together the exact sequence of the quadruple slaughter in eastern France last month .

High life: Owen Danter, a former bank manager at Santander, stole more than £100,000 from his customers to fund his luxury cars and clothes . A bank manager abused his position of authority to steal £128,000 from elderly women customers to fund his champagne lifestyle, a court heard yesterday. Owen Danter, 33, targeted pensioners who ‘always asked for him personally’ because they trusted him and he knew they rarely checked their savings accounts. Despite siphoning off tens of thousands of pounds over four years, the Santander Bank branch manager was never suspected and his thefts were not picked up by quarterly audits. Danter, a former deputy chairman of the local Conservative Association and leading light in the Chamber of Trade, was a respected figure who would be seen around town dressed in sharp suits and driving luxury sports cars. He was manager in the East Yorkshire market town of Driffield, but his salary of £35,000 plus bonuses was insufficient to fund the lifestyle he wanted to lead, Hull Crown Court heard. Starting with small amounts and increasing the thefts to thousands, he emptied the accounts of his most vulnerable customers and spent every penny on drinking, entertaining and socialising. Detective Sergeant John Meagher said: ‘He was living the high life and spending the money on expensive drinks such as champagne.’ He was caught when he carried out a failed suicide attempt. He left a note for his employers, detailing his criminal behaviour and naming the accounts he had stolen from. Danter, of Beverley, East Yorkshire, admitted nine offences of theft and was yesterday jailed for 21 months. Judge Jeremy Baker QC told him his victims were ‘emotionally upset’ when the crimes came to light and ‘they realised the person they trusted, their bank manager, had in fact defrauded them’. The court heard Danter had become an  alcoholic and his condition fuelled the thefts. The judge told him: ‘You set up a front to your life of respectability, but underneath it all was the fact you became addicted to alcohol.’ Jane Bryan, prosecuting, said Danter picked on elderly customers with bonds and savings accounts where ‘the missing money was unlikely to be noticed’. One victim, aged 69, had £70,969 stolen from three accounts. Another, aged 82, had signed over power of attorney to her daughter but Danter still managed to take £10,000. A third was actually dead when he stole £8,400 and closed her account. Abuse of trust: The former chairman of the local Tory party branch took money from cash points at the bank in Driffield, East Yorkshire, before targeting elderly women . His eldest victim was an 86-year-old woman who had £17,599 taken from her accounts. The offences took place between June 2007 and July 2011, when he stole £15,000 from the bank cash machine and disappeared. Danter drove to a forest to commit suicide, but the attempt failed and he raised the alarm and was taken to hospital. Police, alerted by colleagues and relatives worried about his disappearance, found suicide notes detailing his crimes. In the red: The hard-drinking 33-year-old tried to commit suicide after his debts, alcoholism and criminal behaviour spiralled out of control, the court heard . After being released from hospital Danter gave a full confession. Bernard Gateshill, defending, disputed the prosecution figures and said the thefts totalled £107,000. All money stolen from customers has been reimbursed by the bank and Santander has recovered £30,000 from Danter’s pension fund.","Former co-chairman of local Tory party branch wore expensive suits and drove luxury cars .

A Michigan teen who was elected to her high school’s homecoming court in a cruel prank by some classmates has drawn an incredible show of support from her small community. Whitney Kropp, 16, a student at Ogemaw Heights High School, was initially thrilled to learn that she had been elected to the homecoming court of her sophomore class. But her triumph turned to humiliation when she found out from other students that her nomination was nothing but a prank by the popular kids at the school - and she was told that the male student who was elected with her had withdrawn. Scroll down for video . Bullied: Whitney Kropp had been voted to her school's homecoming court but found it was a prank . Speaking out: Whitney appeared on the Today show to lambast her bullies and reveal how hurt she had been . Her mother Bernice Kropp told NBC that the joke prompted students to pick on her daughter both at school and on Facebook. Whitney Kropp admits that she's not among the popular students at Ogemaw, but didn't think her classmates could stoop so low. Yet the bullying became so relentless that she thought about taking her own life. She told WNEM-TV: 'I had actually . reached a point where I had thought about suicide for how bad this case . was in. I thought I wasn't worthy at Ogemaw Heights at all.' 'I felt like I wasn’t worthy,' she added on the Today show. 'Why even be a part of this community, this world if I’m just going to be tossed around like basically a piece of trash?' But the savage bullying was soon overpowered by a tremendous outpouring of support for the teen. A Facebook page was set up in support of Miss Kropp; the 'Support Whitney Kropp' page already has more than 33,000 likes - and counting. Kindess: Donations have helped Kropp pay for her dress, hair and make-up for the dance on Saturday night . Hurt: The 16-year-old was . humiliated to learn that she had been elected in a prank by fellow students . For the homecoming dance on Saturday night, businesses will buy her dinner, take her photo, fix her hair and nails, and dress her in a gown, shoes and a tiara, the Detroit News reported. Shannon Champagne and another beauty salon worker have offered their services to help. 'It really touched me,' Champagne, a nail tech, said. 'I can't believe that kids can be so mean and ruthless. In high school, everything means everything to you. You don't realize that none of it will matter after you leave.' And at the homecoming game on Friday, residents will flood to the football stadium so they can cheer when she is introduced at halftime. They will wear orange - her favourite colour - and t-shirts emblazoned with messages of support. 'I am in awe, overwhelmed at the amount of support,' Jamie Kline, 35, who began the Facebook support page, told the News. 'I never expected it to spread as far as it has.' For Miss Kropp, the messages and kind . words from the town and complete strangers thousands of miles away is . enough to drown out the bullies - and she's now looking forward to the . big dance. Bernice Kropp . told WNEM: 'This was something that was really awful, could have ended . awful, and because so many people came together, it just turned right . around.' Support: Whitney, second from right, is seen with her sister Olivia, mother Bernice and brother Justin . Kropp recounted to the News how she had been sitting in her geometry class on September 13 when the results of the homecoming vote were announced over the school PA system - to the laughter of some of her fellow classmates. Despite her surprise, she had been happy that she had been called, her mother said. 'The first thing is softhearted,' Bernice Kropp said when asked to describe her daughter. 'She's just sweet. She doesn't have a mean bone in her body.' Even when Josh Awrey, a popular football player, quickly withdrew as the other sophomore rep, she was still excited about the news. 'In the Homecoming Court! :)' she wrote on her Facebook page after the announcement. 'Little nervous but this is going to be fun :D' After the backlash, Awrey has now decided to remain a class rep, even though he said on his Facebook page that he had never wanted to be part of homecoming. 'Im sick of everyone blaming me,' he wrote. 'I had nothing to do with this. I think what they (students) did is rlly rude and immature.' See below for video .

A funeral notice from Ms Gillard's office said instead his family and friends will mourn his death and celebrate his life at a private gathering. And those wishing to honour his memory are being asked to give to his favourite charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres - Doctors Without Borders. Mr Gillard, 83, who died on Saturday, used his humble background in South Wales as a catalyst to improve himself and those around him with a lifelong love of literature and education. The funeral notice said: ‘John was a humble man who always sought to help others. 'He died as he lived and has donated his body to science and requested that there should be no formal funeral service.’ Another funeral notice, from the trade union United Voice, paid tribute to Mr Gillard as a life member who had a longstanding commitment to the union movement. ‘John upheld union values, and often talked of the impoverished conditions of vulnerable workers and the benefit of collective action through union membership. His life was spent improving the lives of others,’ it reads. The father of Australian Prime Minister, John Gillard, died in Adelaide, Australia .

"By . Andy Dolan and Ryan Kisiel . UPDATED: . 17:49 EST, 11 October 2011 . Joanna Yeates suffered 43 injuries in a prolonged ‘violent struggle’ as she fought for her life, a jury heard yesterday. Marks on the 25-year-old’s body were said to be consistent with her being pinned down and strangled with both hands by her 6ft 4in neighbour Vincent Tabak. Tabak admits the manslaughter of Miss Yeates but denies her murder. Yesterday, on the second day of his murder trial, the jury at Bristol Crown Court heard described in harrowing detail the final moments of the landscape architect’s life. Agonising death: Joanna Yeates (left) had . suffered 43 separate injuries, the jury was told. Vincent Tabak (right) has admitted manslaughter but denies her murder . DNA evidence: Police found traces of Miss Yeates's body in Tabak's car . Nigel Lickley, prosecuting, said that . on December 17 last year Dutch engineer Tabak pinned down 5ft 4in Miss . Yeates by her wrists as he used his height advantage to overpower his . neighbour. ‘Her neck was held for long enough and . hard enough to kill her,’ the QC said. ‘There was a violent struggle by . Miss Yeates to survive. ‘Death . was not instantaneous. It took sufficient force to kill her. There was . no sign of a use of a ligature. He might have let go but he did not. He . knew that Miss Yeates was in pain and struggling to breathe. Despite . that Vincent Tabak continued to hold and squeeze her neck to kill her.’ Mr . Lickley added that a fracture to her nose and bruising to her head . ‘could have been as a result of a forcible contact with the floor or . other object’. Home Office pathologist Dr Russell Delaney concluded Miss . Yeates died of compression of the neck, probably using two hands. The . jury also heard that when Miss Yeates’s body was found eight days later . on Christmas Day, covered by snow beside a country lane, her T-shirt . and bra had been pushed up to partially expose her right breast. Tabak’s . DNA was later discovered on her chest, while police also uncovered . clothing fibres and blood spots linking Miss Yeates to his silver . Renault Megane car. The . 33-year-old university graduate is said to have killed his next-door . neighbour within minutes of her returning to the garden flat she shared . with boyfriend Greg Reardon, 28, in Clifton, Bristol. Yet . he maintained throughout his police interviews that he played no part . in her death. The court heard that when he was first arrested in . January, Tabak tried to explain away incriminating forensic evidence by . suggesting lab workers who processed the DNA material were corrupt. But less than three weeks later, he is said to have confided to a prison chaplain that he had news which would ‘shock’ him. Scroll down for CCTV footage of Tabak in Asda . Vincent Tabak walks through the aisles of Asda buying crisps, beer and rock salt . CCTV footage shows Tabak casually walking into the supermarket while it is alleged that Miss Yeates's body was in the boot of his car . Mr . Lickley said Tabak told Peter Brotherton, a volunteer in the prison . where he was on remand, that he would plead guilty ‘for the crime that I . have done’. When questioned further, he confirmed he was talking about . ‘the young lady in Bristol’. He eventually pleaded guilty to Miss Yeates’s manslaughter three months later. Mr . Lickley said that during a statement Tabak gave after his arrest in . January, he placed himself in his victim’s flat, saying he wandered into . the entrance to speak to his landlord, Christopher Jefferies, who also . owned Miss Yeates’s accommodation. Clue: In the days and weeks after Joanna's murder, Tabak followed the police website for news of the case . He . also told officers he might have eaten a pizza on the night of the . murder. The Tesco pizza Miss Yeates bought just before she died has . never been found and scientists have determined that she didn’t eat it . herself. The court had . previously heard Tabak also told police Mr Jefferies had a habit of . entering his flat without permission and had offered police potentially . incriminating evidence about his landlord’s car in a bid to throw them . off his scent. At the time, Mr Jefferies was under arrest in connection with the murder, although he was later cleared of involvement. Mr . Lickley told the jury that by admitting manslaughter, Tabak ‘accepts he . unlawfully killed’ Miss Yeates. The QC said that what the jury had to . consider was his state of mind when he killed her. He . did not lose control, the prosecution suggested, but ‘chose to continue . until she was dead’. ‘He didn’t panic… he was seen on film making . decisions and beginning to cover his tracks,’ Mr Lickley said. Tabak . ‘wanted and intended’ to kill her ‘and it is our case that he is guilty . of murder’, he added. Miss . Yeates’s parents, David and Teresa, attended the first day of the trial . but were absent yesterday as  forensic evidence linking Tabak to their . daughter was outlined. The court heard that the DNA found on Miss . Yeates’s chest was one million times more likely to belong to  the . defendant than any other unknown individual. Tabak’s DNA was also found . on the back of her jeans, suggesting he had carried her under the knees. Mr Lickley had already . told the court that after ‘squeezing the life out’ of Miss Yeates, Tabak . drove to Asda – where CCTV showed him buying beer, crisps and rock salt . – with her body in the boot of his car. He then allegedly dumped her . body later that night in Longwood Lane – three miles from Miss Yeates’s . flat – and returned to Bristol to collect his girlfriend, Tanja Morson, . 35, from an office Christmas party. While at Asda, the court heard he sent his girlfriend a text saying he was ‘bored’. Tabak . told police that before heading to the superstore, he had driven his . car from the road to his driveway to warm up the engine. Mr . Lickley told the jury that moving the car ‘to the side of the house may . have been the opportunity to place Miss Yeates into the boot’. In the days and weeks after the murder, Tabak avidly followed the police website for news of the case. The . prosecution also alleges that he described the killer as a ‘detached, . crazy person who was able to carry on with life’ at a dinner party the . following month. Mr Lickley said he had been describing himself. The trial continues. Struggle for survival: The injuries suffered by Joanna Yeates was revealed to the jury . An examination of Joanna Yeates’s body revealed the shocking catalogue of injuries from her struggle for survival. Home Office pathologist Russell Delaney found bruises and grazes on her neck and chin, Bristol Crown Court heard. His post-mortem examination also uncovered haemorrhages, including under her eyelids, while a blood clot in her nose was likely to have been a result of the compression to her neck. Marks on her wrists suggested she had been pinned down, while the pathologist also found a small fracture at the base of her nose. The court heard blood may have dislodged from her nose and dripped on to the stone wall close to where her body was discovered as Vincent Tabak tried in vain to lift her body over the wall. In addition to the fractured nose, there were 12 injuries to Miss Yeates’s head and neck, three to her torso, 12 to her right arm, 11 to her left arm, one on her right leg and three on her left leg. A later internal examination found further bruising beneath the skin and possible injury to her voice box. ‘The overall pattern of injuries indicate an episode of manual compression of the neck that is known as strangulation,’ prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC told the jury. ‘Quite apart from the fear an attack might cause, direct compression will be uncomfortable and painful,’ Mr Lickley added. ‘Miss Yeates would have found it difficult to breathe and you would have expected her to resist and struggle.’ In court: An artist's impression of Vincent Tabak, who is on trial for the murder of Joanna Yeates - he is alleged to have texted his girlfriend saying he was 'bored' just hours after the killing .

Mitt and Ann Romney paid deliberately paid more taxes than they needed on their $13.6 million income last year, it has been revealed. The presidential hopeful’s campaign released their tax records for 2011, showing he paid a total of $1.9million in taxes, giving him a rate of 14.1 per cent. They also donated just over $4 million to charity, double the amount of the Obamas. It was also revealed that the Romneys deliberately limited deductions for charitable giving, meaning that they voluntarily paid more tax than legally required.

Long-awaited: Left, the first page of Mitt and Ann Romney's 2011 returns, and right, the signature page . Democrats instantly leapt on the . disclosure, arguing that it was at odds with what the former . Massachusetts governor said in July. In a July 29 interview with ABC News,  Romney said: 'I don't pay more (taxes) than are legally due and . frankly if I had paid more than are legally due I don't think I'd be . qualified to become president.’ In total, the Romneys earned $13,696,951 in income, mostly from investments, which are taxed at a lower rate. According to the release by Romney trustee Bradford Malt, the Romneys' charitable donation of $4,020,772 to charity last year ‘significantly reduced their tax obligation for the year'. Romney's campaign said the candidate had paid an effective tax rate last year of 14.1 percent, and owed an average effective federal tax rate of 20.2 percent over the 20-year period ending 2009. Most of the Romneys' $13.7million income from 2011 came from investments. Their $4million donation to charity accounted for nearly 30 per cent of their gross income. The former Massachusetts governor and former head of Bain Capital has been under significant pressure to release his tax returns, especially from the Obama campaign. Raising funds: Romney arrives at a campaign fundraising event at Red Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas Friday afternoon . Donorarazzi: Donors take pictures of Romney using their smart phones at the event . Stumping: Romney was at the Ringling Museum of Art in Sarasota, Florida yesterday at a campaign event . According to Malt, the Romney’s will release a notarised letter from Pricewaterhouse Coopers as proof that both Mitt and Ann Romney paid their state and federal income taxes for the past 20 years. Mitt Romney’s campaign today released a statement from his physician proclaiming that he is a ‘vigorous man’ who has ‘reserves of strength, energy, and stamina’ that allow him to handle ‘unexpected demands.’ Dr Randall D. Gaz of Massachusetts General wrote that Romney, 65, takes a baby aspirin and cholesterol medicine Lipitor, adding that the GOP hopeful doesn't smoke or drink, or have any serious illnesses. The campaign also released a health summary for his running mate, Paul Ryan, which declares his health excellent. Ryan's doctor says he exercises vigorously, doesn't smoke, and uses alcohol infrequently. Ryan has said he enjoys the taxing P90X workout regimen. Talking Points Memo notes that Romney artificially inflated his tax rate so that he could remain in his self-proclaimed 13 per cent tax bracket by way of deferring $1.75million in charitable donations. The couple’s 2010 tax return had already been released. Campaign officials said the couple filed the return Friday with the Internal Revenue Service, after receiving an extension. Romney released his 2010 tax returns and a 2011 estimate in January, but he has declined to disclose his returns from earlier years. His vast fortune and his long association with Bain Capital, the private equity firm he cofounded, have been much discussed this year. His campaign earlier estimated that Romney would pay about $3.2million in taxes for the year, an estimate well above the $1.9million actually paid. He paid about $3million in federal income taxes in 2010 – an effective rate of 13.9 per cent. Critics, including Obama, have urged Romney to release more than just the two years of returns and follow his father's model. When George Romney ran for president, he released 12 years of tax returns. The Romney campaign did put out a summary Friday by Malt, the trustee of the couple's blind trust, saying that over the 20-year 1990-2009 period, the Romneys owed both state and federal income taxes and paid federal taxes at an effective annual rate of 20.2 per cent. Romney told reporters in August that he's never paid less than 13 per cent of his income in taxes during the past decade. He said that Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's claim to have heard that he paid no taxes in some years was 'totally false.' Waiting game: Mitt and Ann Romney, pictured at a fundraising event three days ago, deferred $1.75million in charitable donations to artificially inflate their tax rate . In good health: In a note released by his physician, Romney was declared to be in good health . The former Massachusetts governor, who would be among the richest presidents ever elected, is aggressively competing with Obama for the support of middle class voters. Romney has estimated wealth of as much as $250million. Vice president Joe Biden gave only 1.5per cent of his income to charity. In tax returns released by the White House, Joe and Jill Biden earned a combined $379,035 in 2011, and paid $105,362 in taxes, only giving $5,540 to charity.  And according to the Washington Times, Romney gave twice as much of his adjusted gross income to charity as President Barack Obama did. Obama's own tax return for last year showed that he and Mrs Obama paid $162,074 in federal taxes on $789,674 in adjusted gross income, an effective tax rate of 20.5 per cent.  The president gave less than 7per cent to charitable organisations in 2011. Their income plunged from $1.7million in 2010, with declining sales of the president's books. His tax rate of 14.1 per cent is below . that of many Americans because most of it flows from capital gains, . which are taxed at 15 per cent whereas the top marginal income tax rate . now is 35 per cent. On average, middle-income families, those making from $50,000 to $75,000 a year, pay 12.8 per cent of their income in federal taxes, according to Congress' Joint Committee on Taxation. Several tax law experts said Friday that Romney's newly released tax returns would not be much help in uncovering the most persistent mysteries of the candidate's sprawling finances - whether he used aggressive tax-deferral strategies, what are the specifics and tax advantages of his numerous offshore investments, what is the source of his massive retirement account and what are the details behind his now-closed $3million Swiss bank account. The analysts said those details could emerge only if Romney provided far more of his tax returns - including files dating back to his years at Bain Capital, the private firm he left in 2001. Romney, who initially refused to disclose any tax returns, has drawn the line at providing only his 2010 and 2011 returns. It has been a trying week for the presidential hopeful, as Romney has been doing damage control for the leaked fundraising video in which he notoriously said that 47 per cent of the nation ‘believe that they are victims' and don't pay federal income tax.","His campaign released overview of Mitt and Ann Romney's 2011 tax return .

A toddler died in a tragic accident when he fell from his grandmother’s moving car after undoing his own car seat and opening the door, an inquest heard today. Levi Brailsford’s grandmother heard the click of the door handle on her black Volvo 4x4 as she drove across a roundabout in Bristol but as she tried to pull over, the door opened and he tumbled out of the vehicle. He suffered serious head injuries and was taken to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol where his death was confirmed. Tragedy: 'Determined' Levi Brailsford suffered serious head injuries and died after undoing his seat-belt and falling from his grandmother's moving car in front of horrified witnesses in Bristol . Flax Bourton Coroner’s Court, near Bristol, heard the 'determined' two-year-old had previously slipped his arms out of the harness on his child seat and that he knew how to use the handles to get out of the car. The hearing was told the child locks were only active on the side of his car seat because there would normally be someone sat beside him. A police officer said that if the child locks had been active on both sides of the car the accident was 'unlikely' to have happened. Kathleen Medway had stopped her car after spotting her daughter, 29-year-old Andrea Brailsford, with Levi on their way to pick up her eldest child from school on May 11. Mrs Brailsford was struggling with the toddler and her mother offered to take him home for her. Levi jumped into the car and was sitting in his car seat, behind the front passenger seat, as his grandmother headed off. Three to four minutes later, as she turned left from Hollway Road on to Stockwood Lane, Levi had unbuckled his belt, crawled across the seats and opened the back door on the driver’s side. In statements read to the hearing, witnesses said they were horrified when they realised an 'object' they saw fall on to the road was a small boy. Accident: Witnesses told the inquest that they were horrified when they realised an 'object' they saw fall on to Stockwood Lane (pictured) was a small boy. He was taken to hospital but later died . Visibly distressed, Mrs Medway told the hearing she was certain she had strapped her grandson into the child seat properly before she started the car. The coroner was told there were no faults with the car seat or the car that could have contributed to the accident. Avon Coroner Maria Voisin recorded a verdict of accidental death. Mrs Medway, from Stockwood, told the inquest: 'As I was driving down to the roundabout I heard the door go. 'I didn't shout or anything as I thought that if I did it would make him jump, so I just kept going round very slowly. Tributes: Flowers and teddies left near the scene. A coroner has declared a verdict of accidental death . As I pulled up on to the pavement, in my mirror I saw the door had flown open. 'I . still didn't think anything much of it, just that it had opened. I got . out and pushed it closed, that's when I saw him on the floor, then I . screamed.' The hearing was read witness . statements from William Roach and Sean Whittle who were driving in a . silver Mercedes just behind the black Volvo. Mr Whittle said: 'I saw an object fall out of the car. As it landed I was horrified to see that the object was a young child. 'We . both swore and instantly stopped. We immediately jumped out of the car. The driver of the car, a woman I now know to be his grandmother, got . out of the driver seat. 'She looked at the child and said 'oh my god'. The grandmother immediately went to the child and scooped him up in her . arms, she was hysterical, pulling him to her chest and screaming 'what . have I done? Oh my god, I've killed Levi'.' Mr Whittle and Mr Roach called the emergency services and said many people gathered and tried to help the bleeding child. Memory:  photograph of Levi Brailsford when he was just 26 months which was left at the scene where he died . Great Western Ambulance Service sent paramedics and an air ambulance to the scene and attempts were made to revive Levi before he was taken to Frenchay Hospital. Police Constable Mark Steadman was called to the scene to carry out a forensic investigation at around 3pm on the day of the incident. He told the inquest he had tested the child seat and the car doors but found no faults with either. He said the harness on the seat was not designed to be a restraint and that in an emergency situation should be able to be operated by a child. 'His family thought Levi was more than capable of doing this,' Pc Steadman said. 'He was either pulled out or fell out and landed on the carriageway.' Asked by the coroner if both child locks had been active whether the accident could have occurred, he said: 'It's unlikely to have happened, which is why they fit rear safety locks in the vehicles.'","Levi Brailsford suffered serious head injuries and was confirmed dead in hospital in Bristol .

The lone survivor of the shooting rampage Candice Moten, from San Antonio, testified against her former boyfriend yesterday, telling the court he shot dead her mother, sister and unborn child after they accused him of slashing their car tires. She told jurors she watched as 32-year-old James Morrison gunned down her family outside their apartment in April 2009 after the couple had been arguing. Scroll down for video .

Candice - who was five months pregnant at the time - was shot in the abdomen. She survived, but her unborn child did not. Candice, left, denied that she and sister Krystle, right, and mother Laura were violent and aggressive towards Morrison . She said Morrison came to their home to slash their tires and when they came out to confront him he pulled out a gun and started firing at them. 'He shot us, period, and then (my mom) yelled . out, ""I'm not dead yet"" and he came back and shot more,' Candice Moten told the jury. 'He shot more . after she yelled at him.' Morrison's defense lawyers say he acted in self defense. They have argued he feared for his own life because each of the three women weigh 240 pounds and were being aggressive and violent towards them. Attorney Joel Perez pointed out that is client is only 5' 8"" tall and at the time weighed only 160 pounds. The . three women were described as the aggressors to the court, according to MySanAntonio.com and the jury were told Morrison only opened fire to . fend the women off after a struggle. He is charged with capital murder in the shooting deaths of Laura Moten, 46, Krystle Moten, 23, and Candice's unborn child who she later named Angel. Candice was in hospital a week before she learned that her three family members were dead. Morrison was not the father of the unborn child. He could face the death penalty or life in prison if convicted. Perez quizzed Candice about the sworn testimony she gave earlier to the court. Damage: The argument started after Morrison slashed the tires of the vehicles in the driveway . April 2010: Candice Moten was shot in the abdomen, she survived but her unborn child did not . She told the jury she and her then-boyfriend had been arguing all night and that he had been drinking vodka and beer right before the shooting. It was while she was on the phone to 911 about the tire slashing incident that he shot at her. He then shot her sister and mother as they tried to escape, she testified. Perez told the court the three women charged him all at once and his client started shooting because he was trying to get away. Under cross-examination, Candice denied this but acknowledged that she, her mother and sister could be violent. She later downplayed this, saying her mother and sister were 'verbally violent', according to mysanantonio.com.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 17:23 EST, 3 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:24 EST, 3 October 2012 . A Texas businessman is accused of working as a Russian agent and selling $50million in sensitive military technology to the Russian government. Alexander Fishenko and ten of his employees were indicted by federal prosecutors on Wednesday on charges they used a Houston-based company to funnel cutting-edge microelectronics out of the country. Fishenko 46, is a Cold War-era story -- an immigrant from the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan who worked for Soviet military intelligence in the 1980s. Raid: Federal agents carried boxes out of Arc Electronics Inc in Houston on Wednesday as part of an investigation into the sale of sensitive military technology . He emigrated to the United States in 1994 and became a naturalized citizen in 2003. For the last decade, prosecutors claim, he was operating his company, Arc Electronics Inc, as front to move radar and surveillance systems, weapons guidance systems, detonation triggers and other heavily-regulated technologies to Russia. He and ten others are accused of purposely evading strict export controls for cutting-edge microelectronics. Fishenko is also charged with money laundering and operating inside the United States as an unregistered agent of the Russian government. The name of Fishenko's attorney was not immediately available. His wife, Viktoria, who was identified as a co-owner of her husband's business but not charged, declined to comment Wednesday. 'I will speak when I know what's going on,' she said. Hiding in plain sight: Arc Electronics, run by Kazakh-born Alexander Fishenko, hid in sight in an unmarked warehouse in Houston . The indictment alleges that since October 2008, Fishenko and his co-defendants 'engaged in a surreptitious and systematic conspiracy' to obtain the highly regulated technology from U.S. makers and export them to Russia. U.S. authorities say the microelectronics could have a wide range of military uses, including radar and surveillance systems, weapons guidance systems and detonation triggers. They also say the charges come amid a modernization campaign by Russian military officials hungry for the restricted, American-made components. 'The defendants tried to take advantage of America's free markets to steal American technologies for the Russian government,' Loretta Lynch, U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, said in a statement. Stephen L Morris, head of the FBI office in Houston, called the charges an example of how some countries have sought to bypass export safeguards 'to improve their defense capabilities and to modernize weapons systems at the expense of U.S. taxpayers.' According to court papers, Fishenko was born in the former Soviet Republic of Kazakhstan and graduated from a technical institute in St. Petersburg before coming to America in 1994. Indictment: Fishenko was one of 11 people charged by federal prosecutors for allegedly evading US export rules . He holds U.S. and Russian passports and has frequently traveled overseas to do business, making tens of millions of dollars on exports, authorities said. An analysis of Arc's accounting records showed a 'striking similarity between fluctuations in Arc's gross revenues and the Russian Federation's defense spending over the last several years,' the court papers say. Investigators also recovered a letter to Arc from a Russian domestic intelligence agency lab complaining that microchips supplied by the company were defective, the papers add. Phone calls and emails intercepted by U.S. investigators also 'constitute devastating evidence of Fishenko's illegal procurement for the Russian government,' the court papers say. Prosecutors said the evidence revealed repeated attempts by Fishenko to cover his tracks. In one instance in March, he 'directed an employee of a Russian procurement firm to ""make sure that our guys don't discuss extra information, such as this is for our military client,""' the papers say. In an earlier conversation, Fishenko favorably referred to a business associate using 'a Russian colloquialism for ""spy"" or ""secret agent,""' the papers add. About a dozen FBI agents in Houston executed a search warrant on Wednesday at Fishenko's firm, an unmarked business located in an industrial area in southwest Houston. They took at least 18 cardboard boxes of materials from inside the business to a large truck parked in an alley in the back of the business. Under sentencing guidelines, Fishenko faces more than 12 years in prison if convicted on all charges.","Alexander Fishenko is accused of using his Houston company, Arc Electronics, to circumvent export rules .

These two African elephants got themselves into a right old tangle during an encounter on a Kenyan game reserve. Tusk to tusk with their trunks intertwined, the scene could be mistaken for a playful show of affection between the two majestic males. In fact the elephants were locked in a battle for mating rights after both setting their sights on the same female on the Masai Mara National Reserve. Trunk-twister: The two African elephants battled for 20 minutes on Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve . Photographer Dmitry Stepanov, who captured the shots of the two elephants' tangled trunks, said the struggle between the pair lasted 20 minutes. The 32-year-old described the elephants grappling with their trunks 'like sumo wrestlers', but added that he was surprised at how tame the face-off between the two enormous animals was. 'They were fighting for a female and it looked similar to a sumo fight,' said Mr Stepanov, who took the photographs from the safety of a car parked 100 metres away from the elephants. 'However it was not very aggressive and they did not make much noise.' Although the two animals' battle for dominance went on for 20 minutes, it seems there was no clear victor. 'In the end, I think it ended without a winner and neither received injuries,' the photographer said. 'In fact, they looked a little sleepy and it looked more like a game than a fight. However, our guide told us it was a fight.' Tusk-to-tusk: Photographer Dmitry Stepanov captured the majestic creatures fighting over a female elephant . Mating rights: As the two elephants entwined their trunks, the struggle seemed more like a game than a fight, the photographer said . The African elephants wrestled using their trunks after both setting their sights on the same female elephant . Mating among African elephants occurs every four years and can take place at any time of the year. The elephants live in herds comprised of related females and their young. Male elephants leave the herd when they reach adolescence and maintain loose relationships with other males as they mature. In later life they live alone, approaching females only during breeding season. Gentle tussle: 'It was not very aggressive and they didn't make much noise', the photographer said .","Photographer captured the 20-minute stand off on Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve .

It appears that the existence of global warming, once such a hotly contested issue is now widely accepted, but the extent to which mankind is behind the changes still divides opinion. A recent online poll found the percentage of people who believe global warming is happening is consistently high across the world, but belief that man is to blame is much lower, with the US, Britain and Japan being the most sceptical. Of the 13,500 people surveyed from 13 countries the majority agree global warming is happening, basing this opinion on increased or excessive rainfall, rising average temperatures and droughts. Dire consequences: Scientists have warned that the loss of glaciers in South America, which are now in terminal decline because of global warming, will threaten the water supplies of millions of people . Flash floods in Wollongong Australia: The majority of people now agree in the existence of global warming, often based on climate changes they see around them such as increased rainfall . There was still some discrepancy across countries, with 98 per cent of those surveyed in Hong Kong and Mexico believing in climate change, compared to 72 per cent in the United States. However there was far more of a divide between nations when it came to belief in the reason behind global warming. Global warming, or the rise of the earth's atmosphere is believed in large part to be due to an increase of greenhouse gases, produced by industry emissions, the burning of fossil fuels and large scale farming, becoming trapped in the atmosphere. The rate of increase is rising, with two thirds of the recorded 0.8°C rise early 20th century having occurred since 1980. Devastation: Nearly 30,000 people were killed in Sri Lanka when a tsunami hit in 2005. Developing nations are more likely to agree human behaviour is a cause of global warming . In response to the question of whether human activity was mainly responsible for climate change the U.S. Britain and Japan all revealed a fairly high level of skepticism. In the United States 58 per cent agreed human activity was a contributing factor while in Britain it was 65 per cent and 78 per cent in Japan. These scores were markedly lower than other nations. In Hong Kong 94 percent of citizens agreed, followed by 93 percent in Indonesia, 92 percent in Mexico and 87 percent in Germany. The poll was conducted for the insurance firm Axa by opinion poll group Ipsos and questioned people in Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and the United States. Debate: The causes of global warming will continue to be a hotly disputed issue, while the real time consequences can increasingly be seen across the globe such as the floods in Pakistan . Though no explanation was offered for the differing levels of acceptance of mankind’s role in global warming there seems to be a divide between those countries that are developing and those that are highly industrialized. Developing countries are more likely to suffer the consequences of global warming such as increased occurrence of natural disasters, and have less to lose economically in admitting that human behavior, such as heavy industries, is a contributing factor. This may explain why populations in less industrialised countries are more willing to believe mankind needs to change it’s behaviour to combat global warming.","13,500 people surveyed from 13 countries in an online poll - the majority agreed global warming is happening .

"New York based prosthetic maker Arimed said the hands would be custom made for Hamza . By . Paul Thompson . PUBLISHED: . 11:21 EST, 9 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 01:59 EST, 10 October 2012 . Hate preacher Abu Hamza is to be given a new set of rubber hands - at cost of over $19,000 to the US taxpayer. The suspected al-Qaida cheerleader has been told he will not be able to have his usual metal hooks while awaiting trial on terrorism charges. U.S. authorities consider the hooks a security risk and have refused to hand them back to Hamza after he arrived in New York over the weekend following his extradition from Britain. This courtroom drawing shows accused terrorist Abu Hamza al-Masri, centre, in Manhattan federal court in New York, today with his stumps clearly exposed . During his initial court appearance his lawyer Sabrina Shroff asked a judge to return the metal hooks - but was turned down . Hamza, who is being held in the top security Manhattan Metropolitan Correction Centre in New York city, is having to eat all his food through a straw. Former prison official Jack Donson said: 'I know the corrections officers aren't going to be feeding him, that's for sure.' Hand for a hook: The suspected al-Qaida cheerleader has been told he will not be able to have his usual metal hooks while awaiting trial on terrorism charges . Prison sources said the refusal to allow Hamza to have his hooks stems from a previous attack at the New York jail on a guard by a terrorism suspect. In 2000 prison guard Louis Pepe was stabbed in the eye with a sharpened comb by Mamdouh Salim, a former top aide to Osama bin Laden. US prison authorities will arrange for Hamza to be fitted with a new set of prosthetic hands in the coming weeks. According to prison sources Hamza will be given a pair of cable operated rubber hands. New York based prosthetic maker Arimed said the hands would be custom made for Hamza. Non electric prosthetics costs between $5,000 and $8,000 each, while high spec models featuring sensors can cost up to $55,000. Hamza, who faces months in jail before . being put on trial, will be given the cheaper option, according to law . enforcement sources. 'We have people on contract. We'd have someone come in a do it,' said a law enforcement source. 'The rule is you give the guy what they had before. Not anything better.' Hamza lost his hands after mine exploded while he was fighting the Soviet army in Afghanistan.

Jeremy Schneider, his lawyer, and Abu Hamza, who pleaded not guilty to terror charges in a New York court today . He was extradited to the US after an eight year legal battle on terrorism charged stemming from attempting to open a terror camp in Oregon and assisting in the kidnapping of 16 tourists, including two Americans, in Yemen. Traci Billingsley, a U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman, said she cannot provide specific information about individual inmates. 'In general, if an inmate arrives at . any of our facilities with a prosthetic that we believe could pose a . danger, it would not be permitted inside,' she said. Billingsley added that the Hamza would be medically evaluated to determine if other devices would be appropriate. John . N. Billock, head of the Orthotics & Prosthetics Rehabilitation . Engineering Centre in Warren, Ohio, and a pioneer in the field, said a . hook for a hand would 'definitely be considered a weapon.' 'You could brutalize somebody with it,' he said. 'You can put somebody's eyes out or knock out their teeth.' He said hooks are typically made of stainless steel or aluminum. The price of prosthetics in place of hands can range from $15,000 to $100,000, he said. While in Belmarsh prison awaiting . extradition Hamza’s cell was fitted with special £650 taps so he could . use them with his hooks. The tough measures emerged as Hamza . was formally arraigned on the 11 charges which saw him extradited from . London to the US on Friday after eight years of resisting. Yesterday the 54-year-old pleaded not . guilty to facilitating violent jihad in Afghanistan and trying to set up . a terrorist training camp in Oregon. He also denied involvement in the 1998 . kidnapping in Yemen of Western tourists in which three Britons and an . Australian were killed. Hamza appeared at Manhattan’s Federal . Court wearing a navy blue jumpsuit with a brown T-shirt underneath, the . standard garb of a high security prisoner at the ‘Supermax’ jail where . he is being held. Crackdown: In 2000 Mamdouh Salim (pictured), a former top aide to Osama bin Laden, stabbed a guard in the eye with a sharpened comb at the same prison . He was not wearing his hooks leaving the stumps clear for the public to see and spoke only once during the 30-minute hearing. The scale of the investigation was . also made clear by prosecutor John Cronan who revealed that the US . District Attorney has 8,500 documents, four hard drives and 24 DVDs of . evidence against Hamza. Some of the evidence to be used in the . trial may also come from British authorities, although Mr Cronan did . not elaborate further. According to the New York Post US . taxpayers are outraged at the prospect of having to pay between £10,000 . and £35,000 for a pair of prosthetic arms for Hamza. Were he to claim his human rights were . being infringed, prison staff would be forced to get him a . non-threatening pair of rubber hands on cables - but he won’t get his . hooks back. A source added that with no hooks . Hamza was almost certainly eating through a straw in jail because ‘the . correction officers aren’t going to be feeding him, that’s for sure’. Hamza’s laywer Jeremy Schneider said . after the hearing that his client was having a ‘hard time’ in the grim . Metropolitan Corrections Centre. He added that as far as he understood . it prison guards had been giving Hamza his hooks back for part of the . day but not permanently.

She had been allowed to play out later than normal as a treat for a glowing school report she received. On Monday, Bridger was remanded in custody after appearing before magistrates in Aberystwyth, when the police van carrying him was attacked and he was sworn at by an angry crowd. A terrified couple revealed their home was stormed by police after vile web pranksters claimed they had kidnapped missing April. Kevin Murphy, 43, and Debbie Maidment, 45, from Sheerness, Kent, were left shocked when officers swooped on their home last Sunday after claims on Facebook they had the Welsh schoolgirl. The message was posted on a Facebook group on Sunday morning, which sparked a deluge of calls from concerned friends and relatives. Then at 9.45pm that evening police descended on their home and began to rummage through every crevice of the couple’s home. Astonishingly they have alleged that the hoax message is the latest attack in a five-year hate campaign orchestrated by an estranged member of Mr Murphy’s family. Mr Murphy, 43, said: 'The police just went through opening cupboards, searching everything down to the smallest carrier bag. 'It would have hampered the search because they don’t need to be searching here when they could be spending time doing what they set out to do. 'How many hundreds of miles are we from Wales?

A mixture of a retired teacher's DNA and that of the man accused of her murder has a one-in-a-billion match after it was found on the back of her hand, a court heard today. A 'full DNA profile' of drifter Stephen Farrow, 48, was found on a swab taken from Betty Yates’ left hand following the discovery of her body. The 77-year-old was found stabbed to death in her cottage, in Bewdley, Worcestershire, on January 4, having been killed two days earlier. Farrow, of no fixed address, claims he saw Mrs Yates on December 30 but Bristol Crown Court heard the location the DNA sample was found would make it 'extremely rare' to get such a strong profile days later. Forensic Scientist Christopher McKenzie told the jury: 'The DNA profile obtained showed a mixture of DNA from two people which matched the corresponding DNA profiles of Mrs Yates and Stephen Farrow. 'We found that it is a billion times more likely to have come from Betty Yates and Stephen Farrow than from Betty Yates and someone other than Stephen Farrow.' Mr McKenzie said he would expect the DNA to only stay on the hands for a relatively short period of time. 'Typically washing is the best way of removing it, or contact with other surfaces,' he said. 'You would expect the hands to be regularly washed and in contact with other items.' Mr McKenzie said given the strength of the DNA profile he would expect there to have been either direct physical contact between Mrs Yates and Farrow or for it to have come from a bodily fluid - potentially saliva or sweat. Farrow, who has a personality disorder, denies murdering Betty Yates, right, but admits the manslaughter of Rev John Suddrds on the grounds of diminished responsibility . He added it was 'extremely rare' to find a DNA profile in such a strong level in active life after just 12 hours. When questioned by Farrow’s barrister Peter Gower QC about the possibility of 'secondary transfer' - meaning that Farrow may have touch a surface and Mrs Yates picked up the DNA from that surface - Mr McKenzie said it is 'very rare' to detect DNA in the levels they have found from secondary transfer. The court heard a number of swabs were taken from Mrs Yates but the sample from the back of her left hand gave the strongest profile. Farrow, who was not present to hear the evidence having declined to come to court, denies the murder of Mrs Yates. Accused Farrow has pleaded guilty to burgling another property, where a note was found threatening to kill 'Christian scum' He is also standing trial for the murder of Rev John Suddards, found stabbed to death at his home in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, on February 14. Farrow admits the manslaughter of Mr Suddards on the grounds of diminished responsibility but denies murder. He has pleaded guilty to burgling another property, Vine Cottage, also in Thornbury, over the Christmas and New Year period, where a note was found threatening to kill 'Christian scum'. The jury heard yesterday that investigators examined Mrs Yates’s home for two weeks following the discovery of her body. Mr McKenzie, who has worked as a forensic scientist since 1998, attended the scene on January 5. This shows the scene at the home of retired schoolteacher, Betty Yates, 77, where DNA was found on her hand . Upsetting: Betty Yates was found stabbed to death at her home, picture, in January this year . He said Mrs Yates was laid at the . bottom of the stairs dressed in a woollen jumper, black tracksuit . bottoms and with socks and clogs on her feet. He agreed that her head was laid on a . cushion from her sofa, with the knife sticking out of her neck and that . arms were in a raised position and her legs slightly twisted. 'I looked closely at the location of the knife and how it was in her body,' Mr McKenzie said. 'When you looked closely at the jumper it was folded. The knife had passed through three layers, so as it was folded it went through one layer, then another fold, then the collar and into her neck.' He said that after the body had been removed they did not find any blood under the cushion her head had been laid on. 'It was as I would expect if she had been hit and stabbed in the position in which she was found,' he said. Horror: This is an aerial view of the scene in Thornbury where Reverend John Suddards was found dead in February last year . Sad: Floral tributes were left outside of the vicarage following the death of Reverend John Suddards . The jury were shown a long walking stick and a two inch long splinter that had broken off the stick. Mr McKenzie said blood found on the walking stick matched that of Mrs Yates. Farrow was arrested in Folkestone, Kent in February after Avon and Somerset Police launched a nationwide manhunt after Mr Suddards’s body was discovered. Farrow has a severe personality disorder, which the prosecution accepts. The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.

A cocktail waitress was bludgeoned to death with a hammer by a man hired by her estranged husband to make the killing look like a break-in gone wrong, prosecutors allege. Paramedics said the hole in Shauna Tiaffay's head was so deep they first thought she may have been shot.

Detectives say . Tiaffay, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, had tried to commit . suicide by driving his truck into a wall after learning he had become a . prime suspect. His friend Noel 'Greyhound' Stevens, . 37, a vagrant who lives in campsites around the town, has been accused . of committing the murder. He . was arrested after a 'concerned citizen' allegedly called police to say . a man nicknamed Greyhound killed someone's wife for $600 and the . promise of more cash. Charged: Mrs Tiaffay's estranged husband, George Tiaffay (left) is accused of hiring his longtime friend and vagrant Noel Stevens (right) to carry out the killing in what police initially thought was a burglary gone wrong . The friend told officers that Greyhound, later identified as Stevens, hit Mrs Tiaffay so hard the handle broke off the hammer. Stevens . admitted he was a longtime friend of Tiaffay's and worked for him as a . handyman, but denied any knowledge of the killing. Detectives allegedly found several . items of Mrs Tiaffay's clothing, including a black dress, a thong and a . blood-stained pair of jeans at two of his tents in the city. They . also discovered a replica key to Mrs Tiaffay's apartment made in a . store that Stevens frequented, it was reported on www.ktnv.com.

The pair were also said to have been recorded on a store surveillance camera together buying a hammer, knife and gloves a few weeks before her death. Tiaffay, 40, also faces charges of conspiracy to commit murder, burglary with a deadly weapon and robbery with a deadly weapon. Stevens is facing similar charges.

Now the Algerian beauty has become a fashion muse to top designers including Karl Lagerfield, regularly treading the catwalk in high-profile shows and making front covers of glossy magazines. Miss Dehar, now 20, has used the scandal to catapult herself to fame, while Bayern Munich player Franck Ribery is facing jail and a hefty fine for spending £5,000 flying her from Paris to a five-star German hotel for sex as a 'birthday present' to himself.

Just months after having sex with the married father of two,  who is worth £40million, Miss Dehar got an agent and began being photographed for Italian publications V magazine and Vanity Fair Italy as well as popular French magazines. Smitten Chanel designer Lagerfeld described her as the idealised vision of a French courtesan and even photographed her debut look book himself. 'She is fascinating,' he said.

The blonde former escort showcased her . second collection of lingerie at Paris Couture Week in July, and models . much of the skimpiest underwear herself. She has her own website and . French sculptor David LaChapelle is exhibiting a metal mould of her . body. Although the charges against Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema, 22, and Lyon's Sidney Govou, 30, have never been proven, the three men may never live down the disgrace of their alleged indiscretion. For Miss Dehar, on the other hand, the shocking story has lifted her from underage call girl working at a French brothel to international stardom. She moved to France from Algeria when she was 10 and grew up on a crime-ridden housing estate in the Paris suburbs with her mother and two brothers. Her father walked out on the family when she was 14 and she began bunking off school, meeting wealthy men in expensive bars along the Champs-Elysees. She told Paris Match at the time of the scandal that she turned to prostitution shortly after her 16th birthday. 'The first time I did it was also to celebrate a man's birthday,' she said. 'I've always looked older than I am, and when I began to understand that I was pleasing to men, I thought: ""Why not take advantage of it?"" 'I asked for 2,000 ­euros a night or just 500 euros for what I called a brief moment of pleasure. 'I have had encounters with all kinds of people from the world's of sport and showbiz. They proposition me and I make myself available. 'But I have no pimp and I don't give the money I make to anyone. 'I only have paid sexual relations with people that I choose to. No one forces me to do anything and when I don't want to do something, I don't. 'I consider myself to be a call-girl, but not a prostitute.' In 2010, she was one of 18 girls questioned in a police raid on Paris brothel Cafe Zaman, used by some of France's best footballers, in a scandal that threatened to engulf the country's World Cup campaign. She said Ribery had hired her for a single night on his 26th birthday, but did not know she was underage, and she refused to give evidence at his trial. 'Franck approached me in a Paris club,' she said. 'He made reservations at a luxury hotel in Munich. We had sex and he paid me. I was a lovely little present, wasn't I?' Veteran French actress Isabell Adjani is now planning to make a documentary about her rags-to-riches life story. But critics have described her as 'just a prostitute' with others painting her as a cynical moneymaker for whom self-promotion is the only objective.

President John F Kennedy had a speech prepared in October 1962 announcing to the American people a full scale invasion of Cuba, it has been revealed. He planned to deliver the speech if Soviet ships carrying strategic nuclear missiles reached the island, according to papers released from Robert F Kennedy’s personal files by the John F Kennedy Presidential Library. The Cuban Missile Crisis began 50 years ago this week, but even now the world is still learning just how close it was to nuclear Armageddon during those 13 tense days. Dire times: President John F Kennedy (right) is seen with his brother and closest confidant Robert F Kennedy at the White House before the crisis began in October 1962 . 'My fellow Americans, with a heavy heart, and in necessary fulfillment of my oath of office, I have ordered - and the United States Air Force has now carried out - military operations with conventional weapons only, to remove a major nuclear weapons build-up from the soil of Cuba,' read a draft speech JFK planned to read. Those remarks were among the many private thoughts revealed in new papers released by the estate of Robert F Kennedy, who served as Attorney General and his brother's closest confidant during the missile crisis. Harvard University professor and Cuban Missile Crisis scholar Graham Allison writes in the Christian Science Monitor that an American strike would have been an almost certain precursor to World War III, which would have cost hundreds of millions of lives - at least. RFK detailed a plan offered by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara to bomb Cuba with 500 sorties and then invade with 90,000 American troops if Soviet ships broke a blockade and brought strategic nuclear missiles to the nation 90 miles off the coast of Florida. 'If we go in, we go in hard,' RFK wrote. Intelligence: This is the missile base the U.S. military planned to strike . Brink of war: The National Security Council provided JFK's key advice during the missile crisis, though RFK said only his brother was able to lead the world away from the edge of disaster . RFK scribbled notes during a meeting about a possible airstrike on Cuba. 'Invasion must follow!!' was McNamara's message. The strategic nature of the Russians' nuclear weapons was one of the reasons why their close proximity caused such alarm at the White House. Strategic nuclear weapons are used to attack, as their name suggests, particular strategic targets, such as military installations, missile command centers or cities. Tactical nuclear weapons tend to be smaller devices that are used on the battlefield. Professor Allison believes that the Russians would have responded to an invasion with tactical nuclear rockets - striking American ships and troops. Americans had no knowledge that these smaller nuclear weapons were already on the island. The Americans would have likely used nuclear weapons of their own, almost certainly drawing in a further Soviet nuclear response. RFK's papers reveal that outcome didn't happen only because JFK and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev both realized the severity of what was coming. The Soviet ships carrying missiles to Cuba turned back thanks to a series of public, private and secret concessions - including the withdrawal of NATO missiles from Turkey. Though the documents, released just shy of the 50th . anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis, don't rewrite Cold War history, they . do provide insight into the personal thoughts of the era's key figures, . historians say. Kennedy advised John F. Kennedy during the Bay of Pigs . invasion and the missile crisis, key moments during his brother's presidency. His title as attorney general ‘disguised his real position, . which was the closest adviser to the president and the president's confidant . and the person the president trusted most,’ said journalist and historian . Michael Dobbs, who blogs for Foreign Policy. ‘That's the interesting point of . this, that he kind of reflects his brother's thinking.’ The seven boxes of newly released material include . telegrams, reports, meeting transcripts and handwritten notes by Kennedy, some . with doodles and quotes in the margins. Historical marginalia: Robert Kennedy doodled the Liberty Bell and wrote down a quote from a Polish World War II memorial in Italy . ‘It gives you a sort of insight into what was on his mind, . what he doodled,’ Dobbs said. ‘It's interesting from a human perspective.’ One page, sandwiched between lined pages of notes on the Bay . of Pigs invasion, includes a sketch of the Liberty Bell with a summarized quote . from a Polish World War II memorial in Italy. ‘We the Soldiers of Poland for your liberty and ours give . our souls to god, our bodies to Italy and our hearts to Poland,’ Kennedy wrote . in pencil. The 1961 botched invasion sought to oust communists with the . help of anti-Castro Cuban exiles and veiled U.S. support. More than 100 members . of the CIA-sponsored invasion team were killed and many were captured by Cuban . forces. One CIA document offers a profile of Castro: It calls him . intelligent but ‘not very stable’ and ‘touchy, impatient and rash.’ Another outlines plans to assassinate Castro, including a . 1964 plan with connections to the Mafia. Key moments: In his role as attorney general between 1961 and 1964, RFK (pictured) advised his brother President John F. Kennedy during the Bay of Pigs invasion and the missile crisis . Nuclear fears: This newspaper map from the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis shows the distances from Cuba of various cities on the North American Continent . The mob and ‘patriotic Cuban exiles’ eventually settled on a payment of $100,000 for assassinating Castro, $20,000 . for his brother Raul and $20,000 for revolutionary Ernesto Che Guevara, plus . $2,500 for expenses. Another prominent thread throughout the documents is the . 13-day crisis over Soviet missiles in Cuba. On one white page from a meeting on October 16, 1962, the first . day of the crisis, Kennedy wrote out two columns: proponents of a blockade . against Cuba and supporters of a military strike. ‘It's interesting to see in his handwriting who's on which . side,’ Dobbs said. The blockade won out. How Fidel recruited SS troops for the Cold War: . Nazi training: The ex-Cuban leader, pictured in 2004, allegedly hired ex-SS officers to train his troops . Fidel Castro recruited former members of the Nazi SS to train Cuban troops during the Cold War, newly-released German secret service files have revealed. The then Communist President of Cuba also bought Belgian-fabricated arms from two middle-men who had strong links to the extreme German right. It sheds light on the extent Castro, who in public was stringently committed to socialism, was willing to go in order to further his grip on the island nation and prevent an invasion from the U.S. Bodo Hechelhammer, historical investigations director at German foreign intelligence agency Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) said: 'Evidently, the Cuban revolutionary army did not fear contagion from personal links to Nazism, so long as it served its objectives.' The documents, released by the BND and published online by German newspaper Die Welt, show a series of plans developed in October 1962 - at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Scotland Yard is preparing to examine claims a powerful paedophile network may have had links to Downing Street and a former prime minister. Labour MP Tom Watson shocked the Commons yesterday by alleging there was ‘clear intelligence’ linking a former Number 10 aide with a notorious group of sex offenders. He has compiled a dossier allegations for the Metropolitan Police, which is currently dealing with hundreds of allegations of abuse against Jimmy Savile. Call for probe: Labour MP Tom Watson shocked the Commons by alleging there was 'clear intelligence' linking a former Number 10 aide with a notorious group of sex offenders . Scotland Yard today said the number of the broadcaster's victims was 'fast approaching' 300, with 400 . separate lines of inquiry. Meanwhile 160 . people alone have complained of abuse to the NSPCC since the scale of . Savile's paedophilia was revealed. But the scandal was widened yesterday when Mr Watson suggested a Number 10 insider was named in files connected to the conviction of a child porn smuggler in the early 1990s. Writing on his blog Mr Watson said: 'I have no doubt the Met will take this seriously.' He said he has written to Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe with more details of the case, which he said would 'obviously remain confidential'. Mr Watson said there was a trail between the evidence used to convict a child abuser called Peter Righton in 1992, and No 10. He told the Commons: ‘The evidence used to convict paedophile Peter Righton, if it still exists, contains clear intelligence of a widespread paedophile ring. ‘One of its members boasts of his links to a senior aide of a former prime minister who says he could smuggle indecent images of children from abroad. ‘The leads were not followed up, but if the file still exists I want to ensure that the Metropolitan Police secure the evidence, re-examine it and investigate clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10.’ Mr Cameron said Mr Watson ‘raises a very difficult and complex case’ and he was ‘not entirely sure which former prime minister he is referring to’. But he agreed to look at the case ‘very carefully and see what the Government can do’ to give Mr Watson the assurances he wanted. Prime Minister: David Cameron said Mr Watson 'raises a very difficult and complex case' and he was 'not entirely sure which former prime minister he is referring to' On Sunday, former Conservative minister . Edwina Currie claimed Sir Peter Morrison, a leading Tory MP during Lady . Thatcher’s era, had sex with underage boys.

In the Sunday Times she claimed she heard that Sir Peter, who was Mrs Thatcher’s parliamentary private secretary and deputy chairman of the party, had sex with 16-year-old boys when the age of consent was 21. Sir Peter died aged 51 in 1995. However yesterday afternoon Mr Watson wrote on his blog: ‘I am not naming the person for obvious reasons but for clarity it is not former MP Peter Morrison. ‘This afternoon my office has been bombarded with calls regarding Morrison, I think because he was named by Edwina Currie at the weekend as having inappropriate sexual relations with teenage boys.’ Query: On Tuesday MP Steve Rotheram publicly questioned whether 'high-ranking politicians and/or their advisers' were involved in child abuse . Mr Watson said he had decided to speak . out after being contacted by ‘a former child protection specialist’ who . had harboured concerns for years that the Righton case was never . properly explored. 'The leads were not followed up, but if the file still exists I want to ensure that the Metropolitan Police secure the evidence, re-examine it and investigate clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10' Labour MP Tom Watson . He said: ‘The central allegation was that a large body of material had not been fully investigated. ‘Within the material...were letters from known and convicted paedophiles. The contact, who has seen the letters, claimed one paedophile in particular was of great concern. ‘He said the paedophile, who worked with children, boasted of a key aide to a former PM who could help get hold of indecent images of children.’ On Tuesday MP Steve Rotheram publicly questioned whether ‘high-ranking politicians and/or their advisers’ were involved in child abuse.","Labour MP Tom Watson alleged intelligence links child sex offenders to ex-Number 10 aide .

The world's smallest fly is a gruesome parasite that lives inside the heads of ants, growing in size until the victim is decapitated. The fly, found in Thailand, is just 0.4mm long - the same size or smaller than a grain of salt. The adult flies lay eggs inside ants' bodies, then the larvae grow to maturity inside their victims' heads, until they finally fall off. Small but deadly: The fly is a member of a family of parasitic insects that grow to maturity inside the heads of ants . The discovery has shown that even the tiniest insects can be prey to parasites. The flies can decapitate victims with heads as small as 0.5mm. At just 0.40 millimeters in length, it is 15 times smaller than a house fly and five times smaller than a fruit fly. Dr. Brian Brown of the Natural History . Museum of Los Angeles County, these flies can probably decapitate some . of the smallest ants in the world, ones with heads as small as 0.5 . millimeters. 'It had always been assumed that smaller . species of ants would be free from attack because it would be . physically impossible for flies that are 1-3 millimeters in length to . develop in their relatively tiny heads,' he said. 'However, here we show . that even the smallest host ants in a host-parasitoid system cannot . escape.' At just 0.40 millimeters in length, it is 15 times smaller than a house fly (pictured) and five times smaller than a fruit fly . The tiny fly, Euryplatea nanaknihali, is also the first of its genus to be discovered in Asia, and it belongs to a fly family (Phoridae) that is known for ""decapitating"" ants. Some species in the Phoridae fly family lay eggs in the bodies of ants, and the resulting larvae feed in the ants' heads, eventually causing decapitation. In fact, some of these phorid flies are being used to try to control fire ants in the southern United Sates. Although this has not yet been observed, it is highly likely because the fly's only known relative, Euryplatea eidmanni, is known to parasitize ants in Equatorial Guinea.","Fly is 15 times smaller than a house fly and five times smaller than fruit fly .

The sister of one of the pilots who died on September 11th said that it is outrageous that the military judge is allowing the terror suspects to wear camouflage clothing inside the courtroom. ‘This judge has to grow a backbone,’ Debra Burlingame told MailOnline. The leeway that the judge granted the accused terrorists comes during the second day of the pretrial decisions in the case against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the hijacked plane attacks and his four alleged al Qaeda conspirators. The request for the different dress code comes as the men want to portray themselves as soldiers during the trial- a move that Ms Burlingame says shows that their intention is to promote their violent cause. On trial: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed boycotted the pretrial hearings and the judge ruled that the defendants can wear camouflage gear if they want to during the formal trial . ‘They are trying to use their situation to rally jihadists around the world and that puts American troops in danger,’ she said. ‘If these defendants were members of . the Klu Klux Klan and they were on trial for killing a black family, for . burning their house, would they be allowed to wear their Klan uniforms . in court to show their solidarity with their fellow Klan members? Absolutely not! ‘These men are guilty of war crimes- you have to strip them of all those things that promotes their murderous cause.’ The only stipulation that the judge, . Army Col. James Pohl, made regarding the dress code for the five . defendants is that the camouflage that they wear must not be U.S. military uniforms. Hurt: Debra Burlingame, the sister of one of the pilots whose plane was hijacked in the 9/11 attacks, calls the leniency on the dress code issue a way for the terror suspects to promote their cause . 'I'm sympathetic because he’s under a . microscope and he wants the proceedings  to be fair and to be perceived . as fair and legitimate,’ explained Ms Burlingame, who is a former . attorney,  ‘but he doesn’t have to take it when defence council and the . defendants go over the line.’ ‘It is the judge’s job to insure a . fair trial for the defendants and prevent them from making propagandist . statements from inside an American military courtroom. ‘They are speaking to Islamists . members of al Qaeda and those who would be ripe for recruitment for . their cause. They want to portray themselves as soldiers of Allah.’ Mastermind: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed has previously claimed responsibility for the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon that resulted in thousands of deaths . Prosecutors have asked the judge to . approve what is known as a protective order intended to prevent the . release of classified information during trial. Colonel James L. Pohl is the lifetime soldier who is at the heart of the biggest terrorism trial since the September 11th attacks. Mr Pohl attended Pepperdine University in California for law school, has been a soldier since the 1980s before making the switch to a more legal focus in the early 2000s. While known to many as the man presiding over the court room in Guantanamo, this is far from his first time in a contentious situation. Mr Pohl, 61, was appointed to lead the Guantanamo military commission, and first made headlines while serving over several of the cases involving American soldiers who were tried for their role in the Abu Ghraib torture scandal. He butted heads with President George Bush over the issue of whether or not that prison should be destroyed, with Bush arguing that in favor and Mr Pohl deciding that it could not be razed because it is a crime scene. From there, he went on to preside over the trial of the Fort Hood shooting in 2009. Though it happened in 2000, Mr Pohl is still working on the case relating to the suicide attack that left 17 American soldiers dead on board the U.S.S. Cole. Lawyers for the defendants say the . rules, as proposed, will make it harder to mount a defense. The American . Civil Liberties Union, which has filed a separate challenge, says the . restrictions are overly broad and would improperly keep the public from . hearing the men speak about their captivity. The U.S. government has acknowledged . that the defendants were subjected to 'enhanced interrogation . techniques' before being transferred to Guantanamo in 2006, which in . some cases included the simulated drowning method known as . waterboarding. Mohammed and his four co-defendants . face charges that include terrorism, conspiracy and 2,976 counts of . murder in violation of the law of war, one count for each known victim . of the September 11 attacks at the time the charges were filed. They . could get the death penalty if convicted. Mohammed was not in court on Tuesday, . opting to boycott the hearing after dismissing the military tribunal . with scorn on Monday, saying 'I don't think there is any justice in this . court.' The defendants who chose with Mohammed . to boycott the hearing were Saudi defendant Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi . and Pakistani national Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali, a nephew of Mohammed. Neither provided any reason for their absence but a lawyer for al-Aziz . Ali had said on Monday that his client's father had recently died and he . was grieving for him. Those who showed up in court were . Walid bin Attash, a Yemeni who grew up in Saudi Arabia, and Ramzi . Binalshibh, another Yemeni who was originally chosen to be one of the . hijackers but couldn't get a U.S. visa to enter the country. The judge presiding over the case, . Army Col. James Pohl, ruled, over the objections of prosecutors, that . the defendants have the right to be absent from a weeklong pretrial . hearing in a case considered to be one of the most significant terrorism . cases in U.S. history. Poor conditions: The detainees' defence lawyers . say the environment in the office assigned to them at Guantanamo . (pictured) is making them ill . Court: Monday's hearing was more peaceful than previous proceedings have been . The chief prosecutor, Army Brig. Gen. Mark Martins, had argued that the rules for the special war-time . tribunals known as military commissions require the defendants to attend . all sessions of the court. Prosecutors also said in court papers that their presence was required to ensure that the proceedings are viewed as legitimate. But lawyers for the men disagreed, and . said the threat that they could be forcibly removed from their cells . would be psychologically damaging for men who had been brutalized while . held during their captivity by the CIA in secret overseas prisons, prior . to being taken to Guantanamo in September 2006. The argument provoked groans from a . small group of family members of September 11 victims who were chosen by . lottery to come to Guantanamo to view the proceedings. A few other . families watched the proceedings on closed-circuit TV from U.S. military . bases in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Maryland. In the end, the judge ruled that the . defendants didn't have to attend the rest of the weeklong session, which . was called to hear arguments on 25 pretrial motions on preliminary . legal issues. He reserved the right to require their attendance at . future hearings and said they would have to attend the actual trial.","Ruling comes as families upset over allowances being granted to terror suspects in Guantanamo Bay .

She never imagined it would end up saving her life. After embarking on an impressive fitness regimen of netball, running and swimming and losing four stone, the mother-of-four discovered a small lump. Mrs Peters, 46, from Bristol, decided to get it checked by a doctor - and was diagnosed with breast cancer. She was told that had she not slimmed down, she would never have spotted the 1cm lump. Fighting fit: Deb Peters lost four stone playing netball. She then discovered a cancerous lump in her breast that doctors say would have gone undetected had she still been overweight . Mrs Peters had not done much sport since school before suddenly taking the decision to get fit about 18 months ago. She said: 'I do think everything happens for a reason. What on Earth made me think after 30 years I’m going to get fit? 'I didn’t do anything before. But three of the children were at school and didn’t need picking up and dropping off. Changing habits: Mrs Peters had not exercised in 30 years until she took up netball, running and swimming . 'I was a bit bored and thought I would just do something.' She went to netball, started swimming with her son who had recently left the Army and took up running. Her consultant explained her out-of-the-blue decision to take up the sport was lucky because it meant her cancer was caught early. Mrs Peters said: 'When I saw the lump near my armpit I went to the doctor. I'd had lumps before that had been nothing. 'Then everything happened so quickly. You go from not thinking about cancer to meeting the cancer nurse and deciding whether you are going to have a lumpectomy or a mastectomy. It’s really surreal.' The lump was removed during surgery at St Michael’s Hospital, Bristol, last December. Mercifully, the cancer had not spread. Mrs Peters then underwent a month of radiotherapy and will take medication every day for the next five years. Her consultant told her she was lucky to have lost the weight at such a vital time. 'Apparently I would never have seen the lump before I lost the weight, because it was tiny. I didn’t feel it but spotted it in the mirror when I got out of the shower. 'It was only 1cm big, so I certainly would not have seen it so soon otherwise.' Now the classroom assistant plays netball, swims more than 800 lengths and runs the equivalent of more than a marathon every week. She even continued her regimen even when having radiotherapy treatment in March. She said: 'Apart from the two weeks off after the operation I have done the same thing pretty much every day. 'I wanted cancer to be the smallest part of my life. 'Netball is fantastic because you are doing it with other people from all walks of life and you get a camaraderie you don’t really get on your own with swimming and running. 'I always loved netball at school and I am quite competitive. It’s fun and it’s for everybody. We’ve got teenage girls up to women in their 60s. 'I went back a couple of weeks after my operation and could take it at my own pace.' 'And when I was having treatment it was good to know I was going to see my friends and have a game.' Mrs Peters has now completed the Bristol Half Marathon and Great North Run with her husband Keith this year. She has also taken part in the Race for Life twice. She said: “When I started running everyone laughed but I gradually got more and more into it. 'And then I nagged Keith to come out with me and now we pretty much always run together.'

The controversial scheme at Hull And East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust  is to raise awareness of how much various tests, procedures and visits cost. It is hoped that this will deter time-wasters. Phil Morley, chief executive of the trust that runs Hull Royal Infirmary said he hoped the move would encourage patients to 'value' and 'appreciate' the service. Unexpected: Patients may soon receive fake bills to raise awareness of how much treatments actually cost . Mr Morley wants to introduce printouts of costs next year. He said: 'I don't think people recognise the value of what we have in the NHS. One visit to A&E for painkillers alone costs the NHS £150. 'What we get for free, we often take for granted. It's reminding people how precious the NHS is. 'We have people coming into A&E for paracetamol because they have a headache. It costs an A&E visit for something they could get for pennies. We still prescribe paracetamol for people. Is that right when most people have it at home in their cupboards?' The trust, which runs Hull Royal Infirmary and Castle Hill Hospital in nearby Cottingham, is under pressure to save £99m. Mr Morley: Fed up of people attending A&E to get paracetamol for a headache . The efficiency savings have to be made by 2018 and include ward closures and bed losses. Mr Morley said the budget for one person's health each year in England is about £1,700. But some patients need more treatment than others, depending on their condition or problem, and the cost of operations, procedures and tests vary. 'Some people will be surprised by what they think is a tiny cost,' said Mr Morley. 'It's a lot of money and some people will be staggered. 'I want people to recognise the value and preciousness of what we have and see if it helps us all make better choices, make people stop and think about what we need to do differently. 'The NHS is all of ours and when somebody has been through A&E eight times in a month, it's a lot of money. But I don't want people to feel this is a disincentive for coming in. Mr Morley wants to bring in the scheme for patients treated at the Hull Royal Infirmary . 'It's so people make the best use of the NHS and appreciate it. If you had been in the US, you would have had to pay for it. 'If some care could have been given somewhere that is just as good but cheaper, is hospital the right place to be?

Horror: Daniel Fernandez, pictured, died Friday evening after sticking his head out of a double-decker bus which went through an underpass . Scene: The accident happened on I-95 southbound, near the George Washington Bridge . According to the New York Times, Mr Fernandez was on his way to a birthday party in New Jersey and was coming from St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens. As the bus drove through the Fletcher Avenue Underpass around 6.30pm, he struck his head on the concrete structure. The teenager was hurried to Hackensack University Medical Center, but was pronounced dead on arrival, according to Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman. Twitter user Kaylan Baez was apparently on the double-decker bus, and wrote early Saturday morning: ‘Never thought I would ever witness something like that. My prayers go out to dan and his family. R.I.P. Daniel Fernandez.’ Earlier in the evening, she was tweeting about how excited she was for the party. Another girl who was on the bus tweeted: 'Sitting here with your blood on my foot wishing this was all a bad . dream. I love you so much Dan you were there for me till the last second.' Impact: The roof hatch was found bent back from the impact . Party bus: The double-decker bus was carrying 65 other teenagers to a birthday party in New Jersey . According to the New Milford, New Jersey Patch, many of the 65 teenagers on the double-decker bus ran onto the highway following the accident. Another bus was stopped, and the remaining teenagers were shuttled to the Fort Lee Port Authority station. No other teenagers on the bus were injured. The bus’ hatch was bent back from the impact. According to the Cliffview Pilot, there is supposed to be a safety seal on the hatch. Designer Limousines, the company that owns the double-decker bus, did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment. Shock: One girl apparently witnessed Mr Fernandez's death and tweeted her disbelief . The bus involved in the accident has two floors with a dance floor on the lower level, as well as touch-operated juice machines, satellite TV and WiFi, as well as a V.I.P. room and two sound systems. It is advertised as being able to fit 70 passengers. The traumatic turn of events led to hours of traffic congestion along the southbound area of the George Washington Bridge as investigators tried to piece together what happened. And though no other teens on the bus were injured, sources told ABC 7 that many of them suffered severe emotional trauma from witnessing their friend’s death.","Daniel Fernandez, 16, was riding with 65 other friends to birthday party in New Jersey from Queens school .

A firm of ‘bounty hunters’ will be paid up to £40million to track down tens of thousands of illegal migrants. The Border Agency awarded a contract earlier this year as it tries to find up to 170,000 immigrants who have gone missing. Services company Capita, who won the bid, will be paid according to how many are discovered. The cases will then be handed over to immigration officers who will try to remove them from the country. Backlog: The UK Border Agency is hunting up to 170,000 missing immigrants . Border chiefs are struggling to deal with the backlog of cases in the Migration Refusal Pool, which is made up of migrants whose appeals to extend their work or student visas were turned down. They should have then left the country but in many cases officials had no idea whether they had left the country or were still here illegally. In around 40 per cent of cases officials had not even sent out the letter telling them to go back home. Border Agency chief executive Rob Whiteman revealed the existence of the contract yesterday before the Home Affairs Committee. He told MPs that a trial scheme operated by another company, Serco, found one in five of those contacted left the country within six months. Mr Whiteman said: ‘The contract is a payment by results, where they will make contact with potential over stayers from our records. ‘The potential value of the contract, if they performed very well over a four-year period, would be around £40 million.’ He added: ‘Capita will be paid for the number of people who they make contact with and leave. ‘If nobody leaves, because they make contact with them, nobody will get paid.’ Revealed: Border Agency chief executive Rob Whiteman revealed the existence of the contract with Capita before the Home Affairs Committee yesterday . Committee member James Clappison criticised the agency for allowing huge increases in the immigration backlog. Mr Clappison, the Tory MP for Hertsmere, said: ‘We have got the equivalent of a small town being added to the Migration Refusal Pool every quarter.’ At the end of June this year the Migration Refusal Pool stood at nearly 175,000 - and was increasing by around 100 every day. John Vine, chief inspector of border and immigration, discovered it during a routine inspection. He said urgent action was needed to tackle it, because currently tracking down and removing such illegal migrants was not seen as a priority. Critics said the emergence of the new backlog raised concerns about the credibility of the immigration system. In some cases, when migrants had refused to leave, their details were not placed on the Police National Computer. This means if they were arrested officers would have no idea they were wanted by the immigration authorities.","The Border Agency has enlisted a private firm to help track down up to 170,000 missing immigrants .

Phelps, who had lived at the house for 19 years - with son Louis, 18, . and partner Chris Harding, who recently moved in - added: ‘I’ve lost . everything.

Emergency: Avon Fire and Rescue said it was 'satisfied' that an 'accidental ignition' by builders started the fire . Ms Phelps had been out shopping with her mother last Friday lunchtime when she got the call from next-door neighbour Belinda Standbridge, 45, urging her to get home. Miss Standbridge - whose house was also badly damaged - had been in bed asleep for 20 minutes when the fire began, but she said her smoke alarms did not go off because they were faulty. However Merlin Housing said the alarms in her home are mains wired, battery backed-up units that were installed in 2010 and found to be working perfectly when inspected this June.

Miss Standbridge said: ‘Luckily my neighbour Ashling (Bidwell) saw what was happening, found my daughter and she woke me up just in time. Our loft has been destroyed and I’ve lost a lot of family possessions. The rest of the house is badly smoke-damaged.’ The third house - now unliveable - is owned by an elderly woman who lives there with her son. An Avon Fire and Rescue spokesman said an ‘accidental ignition’ by builders started the fire. A Merlin Housing spokesman said: ‘Our understanding is that a sub-contractor of ours was carrying out repairs to the guttering of 4 Mill Crescent when the fire started and spread to Number 6.’ He added that Merlin Housing is investigating whether correct procedures were followed, and has visited local residents following the fire, offering to put them up in a hotel last weekend.

The singer's father predicted she would never get anywhere in the British music industry because of the colour of her skin. And now Kanya King, founder of the MOBO Awards (Music Of Black Origin), has revealed that finding success as a black woman in 90s Britain was tougher than it is today. Scroll down for video . Kanya King, left, who founded the MOBO awards, and singer Alesha Dixon, right . Speaking to MailOnline, King said: 'My father came from Ghana and always said to me, ""Education education education"", because he felt that as a mixed-race child I would need to work harder than everyone else. 'Discipline and focus was very important. He would tell me, ""As an African you are going to have obstacles and you are going to be challenged"". 'He instilled in me from a very early age that I had to be the best I could be.' King founded the MOBOs in 1996 as an awards which would recognise and celebrate artists - of any ethnicity or nationality - performing black music. King continued: 'Back . then I had a hard time convincing people . that an urban awards ceremony was even needed. 'There was a huge gap in . the market - urban genres weren't recognised by the mainstream media, so there . was certainly an element of not knowing quite how to market a black . artist.' Kanya King, left, with Alesha Dixon, right, announcing that Glasgow would be the host city for the 2011 MOBO awards . But things, she feels, are very different now: 'There has been a huge shift in perspective since then, and now there's a great sense of Team UK within the urban music scene, a group of people who have rallied around each other and carved their own niche. 'We . established our own unique style of music. UK garage, grime, British hip-hop, dance-hall, dubstep: we developed our own genres as opposed to just emulating our American counterparts. 'We started to do something original, and labels . finally understood how to create a buzz around black and urban artists.' Alesha Dixon presenting the 2011 Glasgow MOBO awards, left, which were founded by Kanya King, right . King, whose father died when she was 13, was raised by her Irish mother in a council flat in northwest London. 'I agree with Alesha's dad, and there is still an under-representation of people of colour within the music industry, but things have changed significantly. 'Racism existed in all sectors, not just music. When my parents came over here in the 50s and 60s it was pretty bleak and they really struggled. They had real difficulties trying to rent a house. Lots of shop doors had signs reading, ""No blacks, no Irish, no dogs"".' As the youngest girl of nine siblings, King knew she 'always had to work hard and be better than everyone else'. And although her mother wanted her to be a teacher (and her teacher told her she would never do anything better than work in a supermarket), her heart and determination always lay in music and business. 'Success in life is not always about having the right education or the most money,' she said. 'Sometimes its just about having the right mindset.'

"By . Matt Chorley, Leon Watson, Martin Robinson and Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 03:39 EST, 23 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 12:48 EST, 24 September 2012 . Denial: Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell insists he did not call police officers in Downing Street 'plebs' Under pressure Tory Andrew Mitchell has again denied that he called Downing Street police officers 'plebs' in an abusive tirade launched after they refused to open a gate. In an interview on Whitehall this morning he apologised for his actions but continued to question the truth of a police report that directly contradicts his version of events. Despite this, David Cameron has now decided not to hold any official investigation into what has happened. That decision was confirmed tonight with Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood saying he agreed with the PM that there would not be 'any purpose' in a probe after Mr Mitchell apologised for the incident. In a letter to shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, the civil servant wrote: 'There clearly remains a genuine difference of view about what words were actually used. 'But Andrew Mitchell has acknowledged that his words and behaviour were inappropriate and he failed to show proper respect for the police.' The Chief Whip, who is refusing to resign, admitted at the weekend he had sworn during the confrontation with officers who guard the Prime Minister's residence. Mr Mitchell again reiterated his apology after not showing the police 'the amount of respect I should have done' during the confrontation last week. But asked if he called the officer a 'pleb', he said: 'I want to make it absolutely clear that I did not use the words attributed to me. 'I have apologised to the police, I have apologised to the police officer involved on the gate and he's accepted my apology and I hope very much that we can draw a line under it there,' he said. But the report from police, leaked last night, specifically says he used the word when officers refused to open the gate at the end of Downing Street to let him cycle out. The Met has also said he will investigate how it was leaked. The outburst occurred on Wednesday – the day after two female police officers were murdered on duty in Manchester. The report raises questions over whether Mr Mitchell misled the Prime Minister when he denied using the word. Mr Mitchell, who arrived in Whitehall in a VW Polo, accepted that he should not have spoken to the officers in the way that he did. Scroll down for video . Getting ready: Andrew Mitchell launched himself out of the polo and into his statement . Denial: The Tory Chief Whip appeared in the rain and spoke to reporters just outside Downing Street . 'It had been the end of a long and extremely frustrating day - not that that is any excuse at all for what happened,' he said. 'I didn't show the police the amount of respect I should have done. We should all respect the police, they do an incredibly difficult job.' However he made clear that he was determined to resist calls for his resignation. 'I am now going to go in and get on with my work. Thank you very much indeed,' he said. Despite Mr Mitchell’s attempt to draw a line under the row, . two senior Liberal Democrats today said he still had questions to answer. Claims: Mr Mitchell said he had apologised to the police involved, who had accepted it . Jeremy Browne, the crime prevention minister, said the chief . whip had to tie up the ‘loose ends’. “I know there’s a big media debate about what this says . about the Conservative party; whether it means the Conservatives are out of . touch and whether they sound like they’re taking down to people,’ he told BBC . News. ‘I think people want to know what was said. I can understand . as well why people fell that we need to get to the bottom of it, and explaining . to the media what was not said is not the same as explaining to the media what . was said, so there is a sort of sense of all the loose ends not being tied up.’ And former Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell warned that . until Mr Mitchell was ‘able to say, unequivocally to say, what it was he said . and to frame his apology around that’ then the story would ‘still have legs’. Labour has demanded a full inquiry into the affair. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said: ‘Andrew Mitchell’s account of what went on is unravelling day by day and we need to know exactly what happened. ‘David Cameron cannot dismiss this incident and hope it goes away.’ The accounts of the Downing Street police and Mr Mitchell are markedly different. In the report, the police allege he said: ‘Best you learn your ****ing place. You don’t run this ****ing government. You are ****ing plebs.’ The officer who wrote his report for his superiors only hours after the incident said he did so because Mr Mitchell told him: ‘You haven’t heard the last of this.’ The policeman said: ‘I write this for your information as Mr Mitchell’s last comments would appear to indicate he is unhappy with my actions.’ Rebuttal: 'I want to make it absolutely clear that I did not use the words attributed to me,' Mr Mitchell said . This official police report, leaked to The Sun, is in line with what was reported on Friday. In response to that story, Mr Mitchell . issued a statement: ‘While I do not accept that I used any of the words . that have been reported, I accept I did not treat the police with the . respect they deserve.’ Sources close to the minister then specifically briefed newspapers to deny he had used the word ‘plebs’. The report reveals how polite the . officers insist they were to Mr Mitchell until they were forced to warn . him he would be arrested under the Public Order Act if he swore at them . again. Hanging on: Andrew Mitchell on his bicycle at the gates to Downing Street . In contrast, Mr Mitchell has claimed . that after asking officers to open the main gates to Downing Street for . his bicycle, and being refused, he did not swear directly at police. He . simply said: ‘You guys are supposed to ****ing help us.’ A friend of the minister said at the . weekend that he was ‘100 per cent adamant’ he had not used the word . ‘plebs’ or ‘morons’, although he was not calling anybody a liar. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said . yesterday the Chief Whip had been ‘wrong’ to lose his temper, but added . that if no new revelations emerged about the confrontation, Mr Mitchell . should be able to remain in his post. He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show: . ‘Unless something comes to light about the rival versions, about what . was and what was not said that I don’t know about, I think he should . apologise in full – he’s done that, that’s right – and draw a line under . it in that way.’ Yesterday, Communities Secretary Eric . Pickles said he was ‘very proud to be a pleb’ as he criticised Mr . Mitchell for his outburst. The Tory Cabinet minister, who grew up . in the working-class West Yorkshire town of Keighley, said the . beleaguered Chief Whip had used ‘ungentlemanly and ungallant language’ – . but should not lose his job for having a ‘bad temper’. He said: ‘I think it would be wrong to . say that either party is lying, but what is very clear is that Andrew . Mitchell used ungentlemanly and ungallant language which he regrets and . he has apologised both to the police and to the Prime Minister.’ Sources close to Mr Mitchell said he . would be ‘relaxed’ about an investigation into the outburst, because he . was ‘confident’ of his case.","Chief Whip again denies that he used 'the words attributed to me'

Tragic: Boxer Lewis Pinto sent his girlfriend a picture of himself with a noose around his neck hours before hanging himself . A professional boxer sent his girlfriend a picture of himself with a noose around his neck hours before hanging himself. Lewis Pinto, 24, was found hanging from a tree in a park near his south London home by a dog walker, an inquest heard. The night before his body was discovered in June this year, Lewis had an argument with his girlfriend Natalie Lomas, 20. Croydon Coroner's court heard how Lewis had gone to meet Natalie who was on a night out with friends. However, after having an argument the pair went their separate ways. Between 3am and 3.30am the couple exchanged a series of phone calls and text messages. Coroner Dr Roy Palmer told the inquest that in one message the super middleweight prospect wrote: ‘Goodnight and goodbye’, followed by a picture of himself with a noose around his neck. Dr Palmer said: 'Lewis was speaking to Miss Lomas between 3am and 3.30am on the phone and through text messages. 'He sent her a picture of himself with a blue noose around his neck. Another of his texts said he was driving to Beddington Park.' After receiving the message he was heading to Beddington Park to kill himself, Natalie frantically contacted the police to alert them. But after searching the park and the surrounding area police could not find him. Tragically Lewis had led them on a 'false trail' and had instead gone to Roundshaw Park in Wallington, near Croydon. Lewis was unbeaten as a pro after initially making his name on the unlicenced boxing scene. The inquest was told he had a long history of depression and that he had threatened to kill himself a number of times. In March 2008 Pinto was treated in hospital for an infected wound to his stomach after he had stabbed himself in an apparent suicide bid. He told doctors that he did it because he was upset after just splitting up with his girlfriend of three years. He was started on a course of anti-depressants and was offered counselling which he did not accept. Throughout 2011 Lewis told doctors he was feeling suicidal, the hearing was told. In August he was rushed to St Helier’s Hospital in south London after taking a drug overdose and the following month he told psychiatrists he had planned to hang himself, but couldn’t go through with it. Doctors put his behaviour down to an 'immature personality' rather than 'cries for help'. The talented boxer, who lived on the Roundshaw Estate in Wallington, Surrey, made his professional debut in April this year and was tipped to rise to the top in the sport. Roundshaw Park in Wallington, where the boxer, tipped for the top, was found dead by a dog walker . His body was found in the wooded area of Roundshaw Park in Wallington on June 3rd just after 8am. A dog walker made the terrible discovery as she took her dog on an early morning walk. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. Dr Palmer told the court that the cause of death was suicide. Recording a verdict of suicide, Dr Palmer said: 'Taking in the totality of the evidence, I conclude that Lewis did mean to take his life. 'It was an impulsive act, but I am sure he meant to end his life that night. 'He set a false trail, so although his girlfriend and the police did all possible to try and find him he went somewhere else.' Natalie, who had been in a relationship with Lewis for 18 months, attended the inquest with her mother. Speaking to Natalie, Dr Palmer said: 'I am very sorry you lost your boyfriend in such sad circumstances. You did everything you could to fix the situation.' Lewis’ family were not present at the inquest. Contact the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90 if you need help or advice.

Natasha Stokes found her son wandering along a busy road alone after nursery staff failed to see him leave . Alfie Stokes, 3, managed to bypass school staff before walking more than half a mile on his own .

A PC who made a false police report that his iPhone had been stolen was caught after he used it to call his girlfriend. PC Gareth Beard, 35, wanted a new iPhone so pretended his had been snatched in a McDonald’s and created a bogus crime report to back up his fictitious claims. But the bungling policeman, who worked for the Met, was rumbled when the phone was used to call his girlfriend and home number after he reported it stolen in April 2010. Gareth Beard was found guilty of reporting his mobile stolen to claim for a new one on his insurance . Beard denied fraud but was convicted following a trial at Southwark Crown Court. He was spared jail today after Nicholas Yeo, defending, urged a judge to give him a suspended sentence and said Beard had repaid O2 the £489 he conned them out of. Judge David Higgins told him what he had done was ‘deplorable’ and ‘deeply antisocial.’ He added it ‘greatly undermined’ the confidence and trust the public placed in the police force. But he said a six-month jail term fitted the crime and was satisfied he could suspend this for two years as it was Beard’s first offence. Beard will also be tagged, be the subject of a curfew between 8pm and 7am and pay court costs of £1,000. The judge warned him: 'If you commit any further crime while this sentence is suspended you will be brought back before me and I will sent you straight to prison. No mitigation will save you.' Asked if he understood Beard answered: 'Yes, your honour.' The officer lied because he wanted a new Apple iPhone . Sentencing him, Judge Higgins said: 'Your motive for this offence, which in my judgment can only be pre-meditated, was to secure a new phone worth between £400 and £500 through the medium of the company which insurance the allegedly stolen telephone. 'This was an insurance fraud, albeit towards the lower end of the spectrum. 'There is, however, an added dimension to this as you were at the time a serving police officer and you used your position to further this fraud.' The judge said when Beard was found out he lied repeatedly to cover his tracks. He added: 'You contended this was merely a product of such things as panic, confusion and foolishness. 'In my judgment it was neither. This was obviously the product of a criminal who in fear of being discovered attempted to lie as a way out of his predicament without success.' The court heard Beard, of Caterham, Surrey, had been a promising police officer who had received recommendations in his early years. But after his lip was bitten off during a domestic incident he attended he suffered post-traumatic stress, was put on anti-depressants and he was consigned to a desk job. Shortly before he committed this crime he had been disciplined by the police for poor timekeeping. Beard has been facing an internal disciplinary hearing before he quit the force. He now plans to work as a builder.","PC Gareth Beard has quit the Met Police force and now plans to work as a builder .

Banned: Deputy head teacher Teresa McKenzie was cleared two-and-a-half years ago by a jury of having sex with a special school pupil but has now been banned from teaching for two years . A deputy head teacher cleared two-and-a-half years ago by a jury of having sex with a special school pupil has been banned from teaching. A jury at Chester Crown Court took less than an hour to return a unanimous not guilty verdict in the case of 41-year-old mother of two, Teresa McKenzie, from Meifod, near Welshpool, Powys. But in a newly announced decision Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Education has banned her from teaching for at least two years. The ban follows a finding by the Teaching Agency that, despite being previously cleared by the jury, she was guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct whilst employed at the school between December 2007 and July 2008'. The findings of the Teaching Agency say that she sent more than 600 text messages to a troubled pupil at the Cheshire school, and wrote letters to him calling him her 'gorgeous pirate'. Ms McKenzie can apply to teach again in two years and had the right to challenge the ban at the High Court. The panel found that she engaged in inappropriate communications with 16-year old Pupil A , including sending 644 text messages between December 2007 and July 2008 and four emails. It found that she failed to maintain professional boundaries with Pupil A, though the findings make it clear that she is not alleged to have had any kind of sexual relationship with the boy. The panel said that Pupil A joined the school, which is a residential and educational establishment for pupils with special needs, as a boarder in October 2006, but was excluded in July 2007, before being controversially readmitted in November of that year, by which time he was 16. It said that two letters Ms McKenzie gave the boy began 'To my gorgeous Pirate' and 'Sweet Pupil A', and that her communications with him contained phrases including 'my seafaring sweetie', 'I will love you forever and ever and ever' and 'I won’t be able to concentrate in the meeting thinking about your beautiful eyes, strawberries and cream hair, soft hands, gorgeous laugh, strong-shoulders, delicious lips'. Sheer joy: Teresa McKenzie is pictured walking free from Chester Crown Court after being acquitted of having an affair with a pupil two-and-a-half years ago . She also wrote 'How are you . sweetie?', 'Imagine me giving you a big hug and kiss this morning. How . I’d love to do that' and 'I love you darling'. Recommending . a Prohibition Order, the panel said: 'Ms McKenzie was in a senior . position and one of considerable trust in relation to this highly . vulnerable adolescent, who became dependent on her. Firm: Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Education has banned Ms McKenzie from teaching for at least two years . 'In her efforts to support him, she lost her objectivity and this impacted on her professional judgment. She mismanaged the situation and by her own admission was out of her depth.' Giving the decision on behalf of the Secretary of State, Teaching Agency deputy director Alan Meyrick said: 'Ms McKenzie failed to observe professional boundaries, and in failing to observe those boundaries she abused the position of trust that she held with a vulnerable pupil. 'Her behaviour also set a poor example to her colleagues and placed others in the school at risk. 'The language used by Ms McKenzie in her communications with Pupil A was inappropriate and the amount of these communications was excessive. 'I consider that it is in the public interest to support the recommendation of the panel that Ms McKenzie is prohibited from teaching.' The decision means that Ms McKenzie is prohibited from teaching in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children’s home in England. She may apply for the Prohibition Order to be set aside, but not until 3 October 2014, and if she does so, she will have to persuade a panel that she is fit to return to the classroom. She has a right of appeal to the High Court.","Teresa McKenzie was cleared by a jury two-and-a-half years ago of having sex with a special school pupil .

You're an unhappy man, Charlie Brown: Peter Robbins is not looking forward to the new Peanuts movie . The man who voiced cartoon favourite Charlie Brown has called the forthcoming Peanuts movie pointless and a ‘horrible idea’. Peter Robbins, who was the first person to voice Charlie Brown, accuses 20th Century Fox of lacking creativity and trying to steal the thunder of the original televised version of the popular cartoon. The new Peanuts film is expected to hit the silver screen in November 2015 with a screenplay written by the cartoon’s creator Charles M Schulz’s son and grandson. Mr Robbins, 56, famous for voicing Charlie Brown’s trademark screams of frustration in the 1960s, told TMZ: ‘What's the point? 'If it's to reintroduce the character of Charlie Brown to a new generation, it's been passed on successfully for 46 years. That's the beauty of it.’ Comparing the new flick to a ‘knock-off band’ he added: ‘If they were so creative why don't they come up with some new characters?’ ‘It just seems to me they're trying to steal the thunder of these great classics, and from what I can tell, they're not qualified.’ ‘It's perfect the way it is.’ The 2015 release will coincide with the 65th anniversary of the comic strip and the 50th anniversary of 'A Charlie Brown Christmas.’ The son of Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz, Craig Schulz, as well as his grandson, Bryan Schulz,  worked on the screenplay together. Classic: Mr Robbins voiced Charlie Brown, left, in the early 1960s and his interpretation of Charlie's characteristic 'AAUGH' outbursts is still used today . Creator: The popular cartoon strip was the brainchild of Charles M. Schulz . 'We have been working on this project for years,' Craig Schulz, president of Charles M. Schulz Creative Associates, said in a statement. 'We finally felt the time was right and the technology is where we need it to be to create this film.' He promised that the new film would be 'true to the strip and will continue the legacy in honor of my father.' It will be produced by 20th Century Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios and directed by Steve Martino, the director of Ice Age: Continental Drift and Dr. Suess' Horton Hears a Who. The comic strip ran from October 2, 1950 to February 13, 2000, and in its prime reached 355 million people in 75 countries.","Peter Robbins calls new animated movie version of the classic cartoon pointless .

This is the jaw-dropping moment a young boy achieved what appears to be the world's longest basketball shot. But rather than doing it from on the ground, the Finnish youngster hit his target from 230 feet (70 metres) up in the air. The astonishing video was filmed at a ski jump tower in Lahti, Finland. Scroll down for videos . Easy peasy: The Finnish boy, dressed casually in a hooded jacket, prepares to take his ambitious shot . Vertiginous height: The ski jump tower at Lahti, in Finland, is an immense 230 feet (70 metres) up in the air . Space jam: The description under the video claims the sensational shot has broken the world record for the longest drop of a basketball . Lucky it's orange! The ball becomes increasingly difficult to see as it drops from the incredible height . A boy dressed in a checked, hooded jacket is seen gently dropping the ball over the edge of the tower and into a forest of trees. Amazingly, his shot goes into the basket far below, and he shouts and bangs the side of his tower in delight. The boys made 19 attempts at their stunt before getting it right on the 20th try. 'This video is gonna be a hit,' writes one YouTube user. The brief description beneath the video, posted on Saturday but thought to have been filmed two years ago, stresses that the shot beats the record set by How Ridiculous - an Australian foursome who sank a shot from 219.5ft (66.89m) up at Perth's Western Australian Cricket Ground. The Guinness world record for the . longest successful basketball shot is 104ft 7in (31.9m), set by Elan . Buller at Campbell Hall Elementary School in North Hollywood, . California.

Overjoyed: The unnamed boy shouts and bangs the tower's wall as he achieves the remarkable shot . Other basketball records include the . most free throws in one minute - 39, by Ashley Graham (USA) at Tualatin . Hills Athletic Center in Beaverton, Oregon. How Ridiculous have lobbed balls off the top of all sorts of high structures in Perth, as well as performing bizarre stunts in the gym and on the football field. Their exploits include using exercise balls to bounce the ball into the net and kicking a ball over a bar and into a basket in an extremely tough-looking trick. They have also made videos of themselves catching a Frisbee while jumping off a speedboat and getting a hole-in-one on a golf course - with a throw. Exceptional: The lone boy appears to have beaten the official record set by an Australian group who perform crazy sporting stunts all year round . Perhaps the most bizarre clips show them hitting an egg with a boomerang and knocking an ice cream out of someone's hand. Now it appears that one of their craziest sporting stunts has been beaten by a very talented child.

She had been active in the local Conservative party and had volunteered at her local hospital. Few knew the 91-year-old had spent the Second World War infiltrating German sea patrols before cracking codes at Bletchley Park - home of the Enigma decoder.

After her mission she WALKED to Sweden before escaping back to Britain in the empty bomb bay of a Mosquito aircraft . Proud: Last year Miss Green received a a certificate, left, from David Cameron and Bletchley Park Badge  in honour of her 'vital service' during the Second World War . Winston Churchill called them ‘The geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled’. Indeed the importance of the code breakers at Bletchley Park cannot be underestimated. Intelligence from Bletchley played a vital part in the defeat of the U-boats in the six-year Battle of the Atlantic, British naval triumphs in the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941 and the Battle of North Cape off the coast of Norway in 1943. By 1944 British and American commanders knew the location of 58 out of 60 German divisions across the Western Front. In addition, a great deal of information was decrypted about General Erwin Rommel’s Nazi forces in North Africa. Bletchely was a 24-hour operation. Codes came in at all times and were colour-coded depending on which branch of the German military they involved. The code was then sent to relevant sections to be deciphered. Initially this took time but with the advent of the Bombe computers - an ingenious device that enabled Bletchley staff to crack the German military's Enigma code - codes could be cracked within hours. Once broken, the codes were translated into English. She was taken to German occupied . Norway in a submarine, having refused to be dropped by parachute. At the . time, women were not allowed on submarines, so she had to pretend to be . a boy. She was . assigned to give key information on a heavy water factory being . developed by the Germans for energy purposes. Her operations helped in . the build up to the famous sabotage attack by the so called Heroes of . Telemark, immortalised in the 1965 film. After her mission was over, she walked from Norway to neutral Sweden, and escaped in the empty bomb bay of a Mosquito aircraft. She went on to help at Bletchley Park when German codes were famously broken with the help of Enigma machines. There . she listened to Morse code from the German High Command for up to 15 . hours at a time, passing the details to specialist decoders. In an interview last year Miss Green . said: 'The work at Bletchley Park did shorten the war by several years . and saved many lives, but it’s very upsetting for me to talk about that . time and I’d rather forget it. 'It was a horrible time and I don’t . enjoy thinking about it. I had kept quiet, but I spoke out because I . watched a programme on television about a girl who worked as an agent in . Belgium. 'Before that I just didn’t tell anybody what I had done during the war. 'It wasn’t how they paint it at all, . with all this romance. I never even knew I was listening to the German . High Command. It could be a boring job, sitting for 15 hours at a time, . taking down the codes. Documents: Miss Green kept her Air Force log book but did not tell anyone of her war experiences - even her family - until last year . Mission: Miss Green, whose mother was Norwegian, was seconded to the Norwegian resistance after Army chiefs discovered her bi-lingual background . Journey: She was taken to German occupied Norway in a submarine, having refused to be dropped by parachute. At the time, women were not allowed on submarines, so she had to pretend to be a boy . 'I didn’t know who I was listening to, it was a secret even to us. But there are some parts of my experiences which are best left buried that I will never talk about. I learnt the meaning of the phrase man’s inhumanity towards man.' She added: 'I understand why a lot of . young people aren’t interested in the war - I used to think stories . about the Second World War were boring. 'But . if knowing about it can stop it happening again, with the terrible acts . and degradation, it’s worth it. I’m certainly no one’s hero and it’s . silly to think of it that way. Role: Miss Green's operations helped in the build up to the famous sabotage attack by the so called Heroes of Telemark, immortalised in the 1965 film . Thought provoking: Miss Green's log book also provided space for her last will and testament. She died at a residential care home in Darwen, Lancashire, on Friday aged 91 . 'During the war thousands of people did extraordinary things they never dreamed they could do. Some more than others, but that’s life.' Family friend Dr David Grimes, who . knew Miss Green for more than 20 years, said: 'She was an extremely . difficult person. She had arguments and rows with everyone. 'But .

But for most of us the rural dream will remain just that, not least because of the soaring cost of living in the countryside, according to a report yesterday by Halifax. The bank’s report reveals the average price of a home in rural areas is £202,000, compared with the £172,000 average in an urban area. The ‘rural premium’ of £30,000 is more than the average full-time worker earns in a whole year. Turville village in the Chilterns, Buckinghamshire: The area is the most expensive rural hotspot, which is close enough to London for commuters to live in the countryside but work in the capital . The soaring price of living in the countryside has been dubbed ‘the River Cottage effect’, after the Channel 4 series featuring chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall growing his food in his own rural idyll. ‘Country living is an aspiration for many Britons – the fresh air, the scenery, the slower pace,’ said Halifax housing economist Martin Ellis. ‘It all adds to the attraction, but this has its drawbacks. For many of those tempted, the high prices put rural homes out of their reach. ‘The traditional British country pile has become less affordable. ‘It is proving more and more difficult to find fruitful results when foraging for houses in the country.’ One ‘country pile’ advertised in this . week’s exclusive Country Life magazine is an eight-bedroom manor house . near Petersfield, Hampshire, which costs £4million. The . most expensive rural hotspot is in the Chilterns, which is close enough . to London for commuters to live in the countryside but work in the . capital. For the past decade, the average house price in the area has increased by £1,107 every month. In 2002, you could buy a home in the area for £295,000. Today the same property would cost £428,000. Another big winner is the Cotswolds, which includes famous towns such as Stow-on-the-Wold, Cirencester, Bourton-on-the-Water, Moreton-in-Marsh and Tetbury, which is near Prince Charles’s Highgrove home. The average house price there is £283,700, just over eight times the average salary of a local resident, which is £34,811. The Halifax report is based on average house prices in local authorities in the UK. A home is defined as ‘rural’ if it is in a  town or village with a population under 10,000. Overall, it found only one in 17 of Britain’s 111 rural local authority districts are ‘affordable’. To be affordable, the ratio of house  prices to local earnings must be below four. A spokesman from rural affairs campaign group the Countryside Alliance said: ‘The significant difference in house prices will come as no surprise to the thousands of people currently unable to get on to the housing ladder in  rural Britain. ‘Many simply cannot afford to live in the areas where they grew up, causing concerns that rural communities may disintegrate as people are forced to move away, often into towns where housing is more affordable. ‘The Countryside Alliance cannot overstate the importance of kick-starting the housebuilding programme, because the future of our rural communities depends on it.’",Only one in 17 of Britain’s 111 rural local authority districts are ‘affordable’

Archaeologists in Guatemala say they have discovered the tomb of Queen Kalomt'e K'Abel, one of the great warrior queens of the Maya civilisation who was dubbed 'the Holy Snake Lord'. The tomb, which has lain undisturbed for centuries, was found during excavations of the royal Maya city of El Perú-Waka, in the sweltering Petén jungle region in northern Guatemala. Among a hoard of glistening jade jewels, the archaeologists found in the seventh-century tomb a small alabaster vase showing the image of the queen's face and inscribed with her name. The Holy Snake Lord: Archaeologists say this . tiny alabaster vessel shows a depiction of Queen Kalomt'e K'Abel, . considered one of the great warrior queens of the Maya civilisation . Remains of the great queen: This picture shows . the bones of Queen K'Abel, who reigned for 20 years over the region and . is onsidered the greatest ruler of the Maya's Late Classic period . 'To discover something of this . importance is very unusual,' lead archaeologist David Freidel told . Reuters. 'She was the supreme warlord of her kingdom.' The white alabaster vessel is carved as a conch shell, with the head and arm of an aged woman emerging from the opening. The depiction of the woman, mature . with a lined face and a strand of hair in front of her ear, and four . glyphs carved into the jar, point to the jar as belonging to K’abel, . researchers say. A drawing of the glyphs on the back of the vessel researchers say is the name of Queen K'Abel . The remains were discovered in June but it has taken until now for experts to verify the identity of the queen. Professor Friedel, an anthropologist and Maya expert working out of the Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, said the find was significant because the newly uncovered tomb is a rare situation in which Maya archaeological and historical records meet. 'The Classic Maya civilization is the only ""classical"" archaeological field in the New World — in the sense that like archaeology in Ancient Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia or China, there is both an archaeological material record and an historical record based on texts and images,' he added. 'The precise nature of the text and image information on the white stone jar and its tomb context constitute a remarkable and rare conjunction of these two kinds of records in the Maya area.' Guatemala is studded with pyramids and . ruins from the ancient Mayan civilization, which thrived between AD 250 . and 900 and extended from modern day Honduras to central Mexico. El Perú-Waka’, located approximately . 75km west of the famous city of Tikal, consists of nearly a square . kilometre of plazas, palaces, temple pyramids and residences surrounded . by many more square kilometres of dispersed residences and temples. Queen K’abel’s portrait has appeared . on Mayan plaques that associate her with the year 692 during the Mayan . classic period, when she ruled the region with husband, King Wak K’inich . Bahlam II. Nevertheless, . the discovery of the tomb of the great queen was 'serendipitous, to put . it mildly', Professor Friedel said, since the team at El Perú-Waka has . focused on religious sites rather than burial locations. 'In . retrospect, it makes a lot of sense that the people of Waka’ buried her . in this particularly prominent place in their city,' said Professor . Friedel. Relics discovered in the tomb of Queen K'Abel: The Maya queen was buried alongside a hoard of jade jewels and other artifacts . Ancient: A stucco polychrome bowl with a lid found at the Peru-Waka site . El Peru-Waka is situated towards the top right of this map of western Peten and adjacent parts of of the Maya world . Considered the greatest ruler of the . Maya's Late Classic period, Queen K'Abel is thought to have reigned for . at least 20 years between 672-692AD, according to Professor Friedel. The Maya civilisation thrived in Central America for nearly 3,000 years, but reached its height between AD 250 to 900. Noted for the only fully developed written language of the pre-Columbian Americas, the Mayas also had highly advanced art and architecture as well as mathematical and astronomical systems. Maya influence can be detected from Honduras, Guatemala, and western El Salvador to as far away as central Mexico, more than 1,000km from the Maya area. The Maya peoples never disappeared. Today their descendants, like the girl pictured above, form sizable populations throughout the Maya area. They maintain a distinctive set of traditions and beliefs that are the result of the merger of pre-Columbian and post-Conquest ideas and cultures. She . was the military governor of the Wak kingdom for her family, the . imperial house of the Snake King, and she carried the title 'Kaloomte' - . translated to 'Supreme Warrior' - and was higher in authority than her . husband the king. Historians . believe that the community she ruled often battled the powerful king El . Zotz and his kingdom Tikal - just south of the border with present-day . Mexico - where well-preserved ruins are a popular draw for tourists. Olivia Navarro-Farr, PhD, assistant professor of anthropology at the College of Wooster in Ohio, originally began excavating the locale while studying as a doctoral student with Professor Freidel. Continuing to investigate this area this season was of major interest to both because it was the location of a temple that received reverence and ritual attention for generations after the fall of the dynasty at El Perú. With the discovery, archaeologists now understand the likely reason why the temple was so revered: K’abel was buried there, Professor Freidel said. Guatemalan archaeologist Griselda Perez said: 'We had made a lot of discoveries of objects making reference to this queen and now to complete it with her remains is very important.'","Kalomt'e K'Abel was one of the great warrior queens of the Maya and bore the title 'Kaloomte' which is 'Supreme Warrior'

Militia group had stockpiled more than $87,000 worth of guns and bomb materials . By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 22:23 EST, 15 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:03 EST, 16 October 2012 . Former Army medic Christopher Jenderseck pleaded guilty Monday to charges that he burned bloody . clothes, spent shotgun shells and a cellphone to help his fellow soldiers . cover up a double murder linked to a militia group . plotting several terrorist attacks. Jenderseck told a Liberty County . Superior Court judge he built the backyard bonfire used to dispose of the items . last December. He said his fellow soldiers did not tell him was he was . destroying evidence to cover up a killing, though he figured it out as the fire . burned. Brett Roark, father of Michael Roark and Brenda Thomas, mother of Tiffany York, and Morgan York, sister of Tiffany York, from left, listen to Former Pfc. Christopher Jenderseck give testimony Monday. Jenderseck also admitted he did nothing to stop them. “I was ashamed of myself that I let myself become a part of this,” the . 26-year-old Iraq veteran told the judge. Jenderseck was the second defendant to plead guilty in a case that’s stunned . this military community near the Georgia coast. Ten people, including eight current and former Fort Stewart soldiers, have . been jailed on charges that they belonged to an anti-government group that . prosecutors say plotted several terrorists acts and ultimately had plans to assassinate the President of the United States. According to Jenderseck, Michael Roark, 19, and girlfriend Tiffany York, 17, were killed when because Geroegia militia members thought they knew too much about their terrorist plans. Authorities began investigating the group last December . after local fishermen discovered the bodies of recently discharged soldier . Michael Roark,19, and his 17-year-old girlfriend, Tiffany York. Both had been shot . in the head and their bodies left in the woods. Christopher Jenderseck admitted to destroying clothing, shotgun shells and a cellphone after the December killings of Roark and York. He agreed to testify against other defendants. Four Fort Stewart soldiers were soon arrested in the slayings, and to being part of a militia group that had stockpiled more than $87,000 worth of guns and bomb materials. Prosecutors say Roark and York were killed because they knew about the militia . group. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. But prosecutors said Jenderseck’s only involvement was helping the others . burn a cellphone, spent shotgun shells used in the killings and clothing the . shooters wore that was spattered with blood and brain matter. Investigators . later found charred remains of those items in the backyard of Army Sgt. Anthony . Peden, who’s charged with being one of the shooters. “Mr. Jenderseck was not present” during the killings, Durden told reporters . after court. “Although he was a member of the group, he was not involved . directly in the homicides.” That’s one reason why prosecutors agreed to let Jenderseck, who had been . jailed since mid-September, serve the rest of his seven-year sentence on . probation. His defense attorney, Jarrett Maillet, said Jenderseck planned to . return to Fargo, N.D., where he enrolled in college after his enlistment with . the Army ended in April. Jenderseck’s plea deal requires him to testify against the other defendants . in the case and against any new suspects who may be charged later on. Prosecutor Isabel Pauley told the judge Monday that Aguigui recruited . Jenderseck into his militia group last year at a time when he was . psychologically vulnerable -- Jenderseck had recently finished a tour in Iraq and . had problems at home including the death of his grandfather, a failed marriage and the suicide death of a friend and fellow soldier. Aguigui, Pauley said, was interested in recruiting Jenderseck because he was . a trained combat medic. “Aguigui questioned this defendant and asked him, ‘If I were to bring you . someone filled with holes, could you fix him up?’ Jenderseck¿s plea deal requires him to testify against the other defendants in the case and against any new suspects who may be charged later on. Jenderseck ended up getting a tattoo on his right shoulder — the Greek . letters alpha and omega intersecting to form an anarchy symbol — that . prosecutors say members of Aguigui’s group wore. Jenderseck said he had the . tattoo covered up with another after the killings because he was ashamed. His attorney said that while Jenderseck may have been disgruntled with the . military when he joined up with Aguigui, he wasn’t on board with carrying out . terrorist attacks and knew little of such plots. 'The leader of this group would kind of keep them in the dark and the right . hand didn’t know what the left had was doing,' Maillet said. 'What he did know . about it he thought was a bunch of talk, and not so much action,' Maillet added. Investigators say that the Georgia militia had terrorist plans for Fort Stewart (pictured) outside Savannah, Georgia.","Soldier helped .

Rapist: Graham Kelly, 59, jumped over a fence armed with the kitchen blade and raped the woman in a stable in Driffield, near Hull, East Yorkshire, after stalking her for weeks . A rapist who attacked a woman while armed with an eight-inch carving knife was snared after his quick-thinking victim tricked him into coming back to her home for coffee. Graham Kelly, 59, jumped over a fence armed with the kitchen blade and raped the woman in a stable in Driffield, near Hull, East Yorkshire, after stalking her for weeks. But, in an attempt to save herself, the woman convinced Kelly she liked him and asked him back to her house so police could arrest him. The victim, who can not be named for legal reasons, said: 'It was coffee or kill me. I chose coffee.' She cried as a jury at Hull . Crown Court took just 30 minutes to return a unanimous . verdict, convicting Kelly of rape on Friday. During his trial, the woman told how 'obsessive' Kelly would wait for her in lay-bys, stalk her in supermarkets and 'shower ' her with texts. But when she spurned his advances, his lust turned to rage. 'He left a letter saying he was going to end his life and he had chosen the tree where he was going to do it,' she said. And in a sinister twist, the woman knew Driffield murder victim . Linda Merigo, the mother stabbed to death in front of her young son in September 2010, . and she feared Kelly was going to kill her. 'When he jumped over the fence with the knife in his hand, Linda Merigo flashed through my mind,' she said. 'I didn’t have time to think, I couldn’t get Linda off my mind. 'I was going to bleed to death in a field and never see my children again.' With the carving knife held to her side, the woman tried frantically to come up with a plan to save her life. 'I was thinking how can I get out of this without him getting me,' she said. Waiting for sentence: Kelly's victim cried as a jury at Hull Crown Court (pictured) took just 30 minutes to return a unanimous verdict, convicting Kelly of rape . 'I was trying to convince him not to kill me. He had just raped me and said he was going to kill me. 'He asked for a coffee and I said . ""Yes, I will make you a coffee"". I was safer knowing where he was and . that the police were coming.' She told Kelly to come back to her . home for coffee. But, as she cycled home, she saw an elderly neighbour . and asked him to call the police. Kelly was waiting for her outside her home and she let him in, making him a coffee. Rural: Kelly attacked the woman in a stable in the picturesque town of Driffield, near Hull, East Yorkshire . Sinister twist: The woman knew Driffield murder victim Linda Merigo, the mother stabbed to death in front of her young son in September 2010 by her husband Alfredo (pictured together) He was arrested when the police arrived ten minutes after the neighbour called 999. Judge Mark Bury deferred sentence for reports. He said: 'This could be a one-off . piece of behaviour, which will never be repeated but I’m concerned this . man does have an obsession with her and if he were to be released after . an ordinary sentence, he might still harbour resentment. 'I want to know more about him before I sentence him. 'If it is the case he is a ticking timebomb, the sentence will be indefinite.' After the verdict, Detective Constable Claire Burnett said Kelly had a dangerous obsession with his victim. DC Burnett said: 'He pursued her . relentlessly. He followed her, waited near her home and sent her text . messages. Finally, he confronted her at knifepoint in an isolated . location. The victim was understandably put in a terrified position. 'I am delighted with the verdict. Kelly will now be looking at a long term of imprisonment.' Kelly, from Driffield, East Yorks, will be sentenced next month. As he was remanded in custody to await sentence, DC Burnett said the woman was relieved Kelly had been convicted of rape.

"By . Sophie Borland . PUBLISHED: . 05:44 EST, 24 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:48 EST, 25 September 2012 . A man fighting a Sars-like virus in a British hospital has been connected to an artificial lung to keep him alive. The 49-year-old, who was born in Qatar but is believed to have been living in Britain, is being treated in an intensive care unit at Guy's and St Thomas’ hospital in London. He is being treated is isolation after apparently catching the new type of coronavirus in Saudi Arabia. Scientists have likened the infection to Sars, which claimed 900 lives worldwide between 2002 and 2003. Health experts said the patient had recently travelled to Saudi Arabia (pictured), where another man has died as a result of the virus . A spokeswoman for the hospital said that the man, who is in isolation, is receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (Ecmo) treatment, which delivers oxygen to the blood outside the body when the lungs are not able to. It also continuously pumps blood into and around the body. 'We are one of five designated specialist centres in the UK to offer this treatment,' she said. 'We are following strict infection prevention and control procedures to protect patients and staff. 'There is no evidence that the virus has been transmitted to any other patient or member of staff. However, staff involved in caring for this patient are being followed up by occupational health as a precaution.' It is only the second confirmed case of the new illness – like Sars, a type of coronavirus – anywhere in the world. One other man, aged 60, is known to have died in Saudi Arabia in July, although experts believe there may be other victims. Last night the Health Protection Agency confirmed it was investigating a third possible case. They believe a patient may have died in Britain from the same illness, having also contracted it in the Middle East. At present the HPA does not know how much of a threat this new virus poses to the general public. Coronaviruses cause most common colds but can also cause Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome). In 2003, a Sars outbreak  hit more than 30 countries worldwide when the disease jumped to humans from civet cats in China before spreading to Hong Kong. Scientists say it is highly unlikely . it will be anywhere near as dangerous as Sars, although they are . monitoring the situation very closely. The HPA has ordered checks to be carried out on anyone who came into contact with the Qatari patient. Deadly: SARS viruses can be seen in and surrounding a cell . It is believed he developed a severe  chest infection while back in Qatar, after catching the virus in Saudi Arabia. When the illness worsened, the patient – or his family – then arranged for him to be flown privately by air ambulance to the UK on September 11. Initially he was treated at a private . hospital in London but was then transferred to a larger NHS trust in the . capital, which specialises in treating respiratory infections. He is currently being treated in an . isolation unit and requires intensive care. It is not known whether he . is likely to survive. All medical staff who come into contact with him . are wearing masks and protective gloves. The HPA will not confirm where he is being treated, or his identity. Scientists last night said they would be ‘watching carefully and waiting’ to see whether any more cases emerged. Both confirmed victims suffered from . fever, a cough and breathing difficulties. But the pair had never met, . so scientists think at least one other person in Saudi Arabia had the . virus and passed it on. Hundreds of people died in 2003 after a Sars outbreak in Asia (file picture) Professor Peter Openshaw, director of . the Centre for Respiratory Infection at Imperial College London, said: . ‘For now, we need to be watchful: any evidence of human to human . transmission causing severe disease would be very worrying and would . raise the spectre of a new Sars-like outbreak. 'The hope for now is that these cases . are just highly unusual presentations of a generally mild infection, and . that viral surveillance and detection is now so good that we are . picking up cases that would not have been found in previous times.’ Professor Andrew Easton, a virus . expert at the School of Life Sciences at the University of Warwick, . said: ‘At this point it is a case of watching carefully and waiting as . more data accumulates. ‘Given that this is a respiratory . infection and there have only been two cases over several months, it is . not likely to represent a serious threat. ‘However, it is important to be . watchful and to monitor for any future cases to obtain a better . understanding of the true risk.’ Professor Easton said it was possible . the virus was initially passed on from animal droppings, just like Sars . which is thought to have come from bats. At present the World Health Organisation says there is no reason for tourists not to visit the Middle East. Coronaviruses were first identified in the mid 1960s and . are a group of viruses causing respiratory infections in humans and . animals. This is the first time this particular strain of coronavirus has been . identified in the UK and only the second time in the world - in both . cases the infection was acquired in the Middle East. The virus was . identified by the Health Protection Agency's virus reference . laboratories at Colindale. It is genetically the same as one recently . isolated in a laboratory in Saudi Arabia, which was then confirmed. SARS was also caused by a coronavirus. The two cases have experienced a serious respiratory illness which makes it similar to SARS. Coronaviruses can cause a range of symptoms varying from mild symptoms . such as the common cold to more serious respiratory illnesses. As this particular strain has only been recently found there is limited information on its severity and transmission. In terms of symptoms, the virus has been identified in two cases of acute, . serious respiratory illness who had fever, cough, shortness . of breath, and breathing difficulties. At this point it is not clear . whether these cases are typical of infection with this virus or whether . it could be circulating more widely, but causing a milder illness, and . only very rarely causing a severe illness. There is not yet enough information to make specific treatment . recommendations. However, acute respiratory support for those with . severe symptoms and who have been hospitalised would be advised. Coronaviruses are typically spread like other respiratory infections . such as influenza. This infection is therefore likely to be passed from . person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes, though much . is unknown at this stage.","Patient held in quarantine after infected by 'new' strain .

Fans of the brand flocked to shops to get their hands on its newest bit of kit when it went on sale on Friday. In London almost 1,300 people queued outside Apple’s flagship store in Regent Street, while some camped at the company’s shop in Covent Garden for up to a week to be at the front of the queue. Fans around the world queued for the new iPhone 5 on Friday - and today Apple said it had sold 5 million of the handsets in just three days . Apple CEO Tim Cook said: 'Demand for iPhone 5 has been incredible and we are working hard to get an iPhone 5 into the hands of every customer who wants one as quickly as possible. 'While we have sold out of our initial supply, stores continue to receive iPhone 5 shipments regularly and customers can continue to order online and receive an estimated delivery date. 'We appreciate everyone’s patience and are working hard to build enough iPhone 5s for everyone.' The sales figures were announced as a new survey found Apple has taken Aston Martin’s title as the UK’s coolest brand. Its new phone, thinner and lighter than previous models and can use the newly announced 4G network, costs from £529. The 32GB model is £599 and the 64GB version costs £699. The new 4G network offers speeds of up to five times faster than 3G and allows uninterrupted access to the web on the go, high-definition films downloaded in minutes and TV streamed without buffering. Hundreds queue at the Covent Garden Apple for the new iPhone 5 . The iPhone launch was followed by a flurry of complaints about the phone’s maps, with reports of geographical errors and missing information, and Apple have promised improvements. The battle for domination of the mobile and tablet market has become increasingly heated recently with Apple’s competitors taking it on with a series of new products. Nokia and Microsoft recently joined forces to launch two phones which will run on the Windows operating system.

Google has no immediate plans to create an iPhone app to replace its dumped Maps app, the search giant claimed today. It had been reported that Google has already submitted an app. However, Google's Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt denied the claim - but refused to rule out launching an app in the future. Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, launches the Nexus 7 tablet in Japan, telling reporters the firm had not submitted an iPhone maps app. Apple launched its own mapping service . earlier this month when it began providing the highly anticipated update . to its mobile software platform iOS 6 and started selling the iPhone 5. But users have complained that Apple's new map service, based on Dutch navigation equipment and digital map maker TomTom NV's data, contains glaring geographical errors and lacks features that made Google Maps so popular. 'We think it would have been better if they had kept ours,' Schmidt told a small group of reporters in Tokyo. 'But what do I know?' 'What were we going to do, force them not to change their mind? It's their call.' Schmidt said Google and Apple were in constant communication 'at all kinds of levels.' But he said any decision on whether Google Maps would be accepted as an application in the Apple App Store would have to be made by Apple. 'We have not done anything yet,' he said. Google and Apple were close partners with the original iPhone in 2007 and its inclusion of YouTube and Google Maps. But the ties between the two have been strained by the rise of Google's Android mobile operating system, now the world's leading platform for smartphones. The Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol as it appears in Apple's maps. The firm has come under fire for some of its 3D photography which has distorted buildings. Schmidt said he hoped Google would remain Apple's search partner on the iPhone but said that question was up to Apple. 'I'm not doing any predictions. We want them to be our partner. 'We welcome that. I'm not going to speculate at all what they're going to do. 'They can answer that question as they see fit,' he said. Google provides Android free of charge and allows developers to add applications on an open basis, betting that by cultivating a bigger pool of users - now at over 500 million globally - it can make more money by providing search functions and selling advertising. 'Apple is the exception, and the Android system is the common model, which is why our market share is so much higher,' Schmidt said, adding that success was often ignored by the media, which he said was 'obsessed with Apple's marketing events and Apple's branding. 'That's great for Apple but the numbers are on our side,"" he said. At one point, Schmidt, who was in Japan to announce the launch of Google's Nexus tablet here, used the device to show off a new function of Google Maps. The feature allows users to shift their view of an area by moving the device in the air without touching the screen, similar to the effect of looking around.

Talented jazz musician Taron Pounds was so badly injured in a fireworks explosion at a family party in July that his mother said that she didn't recognise him the first time she saw him in the hospital. Suffering severe wounds to his nose, eye, neck and chest, the left side of the 22-year-old's face was literally 'blown off' and doctors told his family that he was lucky to still be alive. Despite this the guitarist has come through a 22-hour operation in Oklahoma City on Friday during which doctors used part of the bone and skin from his leg to begin the difficult task of reconstructing his face. Scroll Down for Video . Two surgical teams operated on Taron Pounds for 22-hours as they transplanted bone and tissue from his legs to his disfigured face on Friday . Celebrating a family wedding at his home when the stray firework exploded into his face on July 7th, Pounds was rushed to OU Medical Center in Tulsa as a level one trauma patient close to death. Coming through one month in intensive care, doctors shifted their focus to restoring what they physically could of Pounds' horribly disfigured face. 'Taron lost a lot of bone and tissue. He is really missing a lot of bone in the left eye area, the nose and the roof of his mouth,' said Trinitia Cannon, M.D., an ear, nose and throat specialist at OU Medical Center and one of the lead surgeons in the marathon surgical effort. 'We were able to take bone and skin from his leg, as well as blood vessels that keep that skin alive and we basically reconstruct his face with that.' Taron Pounds hugs his step-father David Cauthron (left) and his mother Tammy Cauthron before his massive operation on Friday . A digital scan of Taron Pounds face displays the severe damage the firework that exploded caused . One surgical team operated on Taron Pounds' face while the second worked on his leg from where blood vessels and bone were taken . During the marathon operation, two surgical teams worked in tandem in the operating room - the first led by Cannon, spent time on the face and neck area attempting to close the four inch hole in Pounds' face left by the blast. The second team, headed by ear, nose and throat specialist Dr. Jose Sanclement harvested bone and tissue from the left leg used by the first team for the facial reconstruction. 'It’s basically a transplant,' said Sanclement. 'We are transplanting a piece of bone to another place in the body. It is sort of like a puzzle finding the right pieces and then when we have the right pieces, we establish blood supply.' Almost three months after his accident, the injuries the firework caused to Taron Pounds are clear . In the accident, Pounds suffered the loss of most of the bone that holds and stabilises his mid-face, in addition to a substantial amount of nasal and cheek bone which support his left eye, the roof of his mouth and teeth. Five days after the operation, doctors expressed their satisfaction with Pounds' progress as they monitored blood flow through the transplanted blood vessels and skin and bone. 'Mentally and emotionally, he has a lot of healing to go through,' said Cannon to KJRH. In July, Pounds was at a family party in Inola, in charge of fireworks, when something went badly wrong. The talented jazz musician was in charge of the fireworks display at a family party in Oklahoma . Pounds lit the fuse of a commercial-grade mortar shell, and seconds later, his family members saw the firework explode on the ground. 'I didn’t even recognize him,' said Tammy Cauthron, Pounds' mother, of the first time she saw him after the accident. 'His face was blown off -- the left side gone. 'The left side of his face was peeled back and parts missing. I literally identified my son by his fraternity tattoo.' 'This really is every parent’s nightmare -- to have this much damage to our child. What do dads do? We fix stuff and Dad can’t fix this one,' said David Cauthron, Pounds’ stepfather. This will be the first of a series of arduous operations for Taron, the next of which will be in two months . Dr. Cannon admitted to Newsok that the first time she saw Pounds, she was unsure where his nasal passages were because of the extensive damage. Together with Dr. Sanclement, the physicians have been working up to this operation for several weeks, performing smaller surgeries to repair his jaw and stabilise the bones around his mouth. Pounds will now spend another five days in recovery at the hospital before returning home to continue his recovery and his next surgery will most likely be in another two months. He still cannot see out of his left eye, however doctors are unsure whether his sight will be restored. And his surgical team believe that it will still be another six months before Pounds is back to what's 'cosmetically acceptable' for him in the long term. 'Taron has accepted ... he's not going to be exactly what you see in this picture ever again, inside or outside,' said Tammy Cauthron. 'He's changed. This is a life-changing event for our entire family. 'For Taron, it's physical, as well as emotional and mental. There's a lot of changes — for the good, I know he's a much stronger man because of this.'","Accident in July almost killed musician Taron Pounds .

Ed Miliband's health policy was in chaos today after he took less than 24 hours to abandon his promise to protect the NHS from another costly reorganisation . Ed Miliband’s health policy was in chaos today after he took less than 24 hours to abandon his promise to protect the NHS from another costly reorganisation. The Labour leader went from warning yesterday that he would not reverse the coalition’s controversial Health and Social Care Act to promising to do just that. While Labour has extended its lead over the Tories for being trusted with the health service, the confusion will do little to persuade voters Mr Miliband is ready to take tough decisions in government. The NHS has to make £5billion every year in efficient savings by 2015 to make up for smaller rises in funding and growing demand from an ageing population. The Health and Social Care Act sparked the first big coalition split two years ago when then-Health Secretary Andrew Lansley unveiled the largest shake-up of the NHS in its 60 year history. Primary Care Trusts were abolished, with £60billion in health spending handed to groups run by GPs. After months of wrangling and re-writing, which saw several elements watered down and the role of private firms curtailed, it passed into law earlier this year. Mr Lansley was demoted at the reshuffled and replaced by Jeremy Hunt. Yesterday Mr Miliband said he could not promise to reverse the changes if he became Prime Minister. He told a Q&A in Manchester: ’I think what would be not sensible is for us to come along and say, “well, Andrew Lansley, now Jeremy Hunt, they’re changing all the arrangements, have these new clinical commissioning groups and so on, and we’re just going to reverse it all back and spend another £3bn on another top-down bureaucratic organisation""' But within hours Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, tweeted: ’I'll repeal the Bill. Full stop.’ Andy Burnham, shadow health secretary, said that he would repeal the bill . Aides then suggested the legislation could be repealed, but not all of the changes it introduced would be reversed. Today Mr Miliband appeared to admit that he got it wrong yesterday. He told BBC One’s the Andrew Marr Show: ’We will repeal their NHS bill. It puts the wrong principles back at the heart of the NHS, it puts the principles of competition, markets and money as the central defining principles of the NHS. ’We are going to repeal the bill, we are going to make those changes but of course we have to look at the detail of some of the reforms, some of the changes that have been made because I don't want to just shuffle the deckchairs all over the place again.’ Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb today said it would be 'madness' for Labour to repeal the Health and Social Care Act. 'From . my point of view, anyone who believes in the NHS and who wants to see a . sustainable NHS dealing with really challenging problems of an aging . population, should just be interested in making this work,' he told BBC . One's Sunday Politics. 'To . say repeal the act, effectively, is telling the NHS we're going to go . through another complete restructuring. It would be madness to do that.'","Labour leader told voters in Manchester it would not be ’sensible’ and cost £3billion to unpick the coalition’s NHS reforms .

An assistant school principal has been removed from his post after exchanging almost 3,000 text messages and copious late night phone calls with a pupil. Christian Del Re, 32, has been accused of 'inappropriate contact' with an 18-year-old girl at Leon M. Goldstein High School for Sciences in Brooklyn, New York. Both Del Re, who married his high school sweet heart Gina in 2005, and the girl have denied that their relationship went beyond texting and talking. 'Inappropriate': Christian Del Re, an assistant principal and an 18-year-old pupil exchanged some 3,000 text messages and several late-night phone calls . But a pupil claimed they saw Del Re . playing with the girl’s hair on one occasion. He is also said to have . been seen driving the girl from the school’s parking lot in his car. Investigators found that Del Re had texted the girl 1,442 times between November 2011 and January this year while she texted him 1,477 times. That is an average of 1.3 text messages per hour between them for 91 days. Numerous phone calls were also made after midnight and ranged from 49 to 163 minutes, officials said. On at least two occasions he called her at about 3am. Del Re claimed he was helping the . student cope with problems, telling investigators she ‘would talk to him . about problems at school, problems with other students and problems . with her boyfriend,’ according to a report compiled by Richard Condon, . the special commissioner of investigation for the New York School . District. Denies anything more: Del Re, a married man, and the young woman both deny that the relationship went beyond texting and talking after another pupil claimed they saw Del Re playing with the girl's hair . Miss him: One student said Del Re, pictured with the principal Joseph Zaza and pupils at the school in 2009, was a 'good man' and 'always very involved with the school' ‘Del Re said that he never touched’ the student, according to Condon’s report. He turned over three letters of recommendation he wrote to help the pupil gain a college place and get a job, in an attempt to clear his name. Del Re did, however, admit to driving the young woman to the train station three times and said the phone calls were made so late because he got home from work late. According to the NY Daily News, . Education Department spokeswoman Connie Pankratz said: ‘We are moving . forward with disciplinary charges against Christian Del Re and will be . seeking his termination. Removed: Del Re has been removed from his post at Leon M.

He knew how to offer students advice. ‘There could be 3,000 text messages, but it doesn’t mean there was anything sexual. I don’t believe it.’ Student Kevin Guerara, 17, said he missed having Del Re at school. He said: 'He doesn’t deserve this. It’s all just rumours. 'The woman who accused him just wanted attention.’ Gave advice: Del Re claims he was simply giving the pupil advice to cope with her problems and that calls made late at night were done so because he was late getting to his Staten Island home (pictured) after work .","Christian Del Re has been removed from his assistant school principal post after 'inappropriate contact' with an 18-year-old pupil .

Among the dozens of photos that proud parents Curtis and Leonie Norville were taking of their newborn son, one in particular stood out. The striking image showed nine-week-old Romero lying on a play mat with a ghostly white reflection in his left eye. Alarm bells immediately started ringing for Mr Norville, a professional photographer and cameraman who had never seen anything like it before. Romero Norville was discovered to have had a rare eye cancer which had caused a large tumour behind his eye . After a trip to the GP, Romero was swiftly referred to a local children’s hospital where a consultant delivered the devastating news that a rare eye cancer had caused a large tumour behind the eye – and five smaller ones behind his right eye. Four months on, Romero is responding to chemotherapy and laser treatment. But his parents have decided to speak out about his case to warn other parents about the condition. ‘When we were told he had tumours it was heartbreaking and Leonie was hysterical. 'She was crying her eyes out,’ said Mr Norville, who is in his 30s and from Perry Barr in Birmingham. ‘We’d never heard of this condition before. No one in our family had had it. Our world fell apart. ‘But he is responding well to treatment. Romero has been very good and the only problem is he wakes up a lot at night because chemotherapy makes babies feed little and often.’ Mrs Norville, an adult social services manager, added: ‘At first when we heard the news I would cry every day – away from Romero so he wouldn’t pick up on our unhappiness. Now we take it one day at a time.’ The couple first spotted something was wrong at the end of May. ‘Romero is our first child so we were taking lots of photos with a camera phone,’ said Mr Norville. ‘Sometimes you get red eye in the photos but this looked almost like a hole in his eye. ‘We went to the GP who said the eye wasn’t reflecting light and referred us to Birmingham Children’s Hospital.’ Within days, tests revealed the mass of tumours behind his eyes. The infant was diagnosed with retinoblastoma, a malignant tumour that starts in the retina, the light sensitive lining of the eye. The condition, which is inherited in around two in five cases, affects around 50 children in the UK each year, generally under the age of five. If caught soon enough, the chances of being cured are around 95 per cent. Romero was diagnosed with a large tumour behind his left eye and five smaller ones behind his right eye at Birmingham's Children Hospital . Romero was immediately started on a course of chemotherapy and has had six-hour sessions every month for the past four months. The tumour in his left eye has shrunk by a third and the smaller tumours in his other eye have gone following regular laser treatment. Mr Norville, who, along with his wife is now campaigning to help raise £4million for the hospital’s Children’s Cancer Centre Appeal, added: ‘Romero is incredibly resilient. He is very happy, jolly and playful.’ Consultant paediatric oncologist Dr Helen Jenkinson said the challenge of treating bilateral retinoblastoma was to try and salvage as much vision as possible. She added: ‘We would expect with Romero that he will make a full recovery, we would expect to cure him and I hope that he will have relatively normal vision when he is older. ‘He has continued to grow and thrive throughout his treatment and he looks fantastic now. 'We are delighted with his progress.’","Parents were taking lots of pictures of their newborn son when they noticed something different .

Prince Carl Philip of Sweden was assaulted in an unprovoked attack as he left a nightclub in Cannes in the early hours of Saturday. The 33-year-old prince had been partying with a group of friends and his girlfriend, former glamour model Sofia Hellqvist, at celebrity haunt Baoli when three men jumped on him as as they left the club at 3am. A witness filmed the incident on a mobile phone and posted a video online showing the prince being grabbed by the neck before receiving a blow to the back of his head. Scroll down for video . Playboy: Prince Carl Philip has been branded a rebel since he split from his partner of ten years and instead began seeing Miss Hellqvist, an ex-glamour model and reality television star in 2010 . The incident is the latest event of . what has been called the playboy prince's 'Wild Summer' which has seen . him hit the Swedish party scene wearing an alien mask, lose his Gucci . wallet and hitch hike on his way to a motoring competition where he . crashed his car in the first race. The shaky video from Saturday morning show the prince keeling over after being hit and Sofia and . their friends get involved in the brawl. Sofia was reportedly hit multiple . times as she tried to separate the prince and the attackers who were unknown to the royal couple. The prince is heard shouting ‘Let me go’, in Swedish followed by a distraught Sofia screaming ‘No, honey!’ Attack: Prince Carl Philip is seen with a hand around his neck before someone hits him in the back of his head . The prince falls over as a result of the blow and his girlfriend Sofia Hellqvist is seen diving after him in the video shot outside the nightclub . In an interview with Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet Sofia and Carl Philip spoke of their ordeal. ‘We . were having a nice night out with some close friends. As we were about . to leave Carl Philip was attacked by some strange men,’ Sofia said. The couple maintain that the blow on the video was the first one exchanged and that the attack was completely unprovoked. Prince Carl Philip dated PR Executive Emma Pernald for ten years before they split in 2009 . ‘It has been reported that our close friends were involved and we stress that this is not the case. ‘I . would like to emphazise that it was the actions of my good friends . which ensured that this sad situation ended ok,’ the prince told the . newspaper. Prince Carl . Philip, third in line to the throne after the birth of Princess Estelle in February this year, has a long withstanding reputation as a playboy who prefers driving . race cars and wild parties to royal duties. His relationship with ex-glamour girl Sofia caused a scandal when it came to light two years ago. The prince had been with his previous partner PR executive Emma Pernald for ten years, and it was widely believed a wedding was on the cards when they suddenly split in March 2009. Many high-profile royal commentators in the Scandinavian country are still in disapproving of Carl Philip's new partner, despite King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden accepting Sofia as a member of their family. Although his son has been named the 'black sheep' of the royal family it was alleged in 2010 King Carl Gustaf himself . The unauthorised biography called The Reluctant Monarch alleges that the wholesome King of Sweden has in fact spent thousands of pounds in a strip club during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, had an extramarital affair with singer/model Camilla Henemark in the nineties and enjoyed  'coffee-girls', less-than-dressed young ladies hired to entertain the King and his friends after private dinners. If the allegations are true it may not come as a surprise that before she bagged a royal boyfriend Sofia Hellqvist was famous for her participation in the sex and alcohol-fuelled reality show Paradise Hotel, kissing pornstar Jenna Jameson and topless appearances in the Swedish mens magazines. The royal couple maintain that neither they nor their friends know the identity of the men who grabbed Carl Philip. No police report has been filed and the matter is being investigated by the royal household. According to the Swedish royal family’s Chief of Information Bertil Ternert the decision on any potential legal actions will be taken later in the week. The nightclub situated near Port Cano harbour and it is a popular haunt for the rich and famous and has previously played host to Naomi Campbell, Jude Law, Uma Thurman and Bill Clinton as well as the Swedish royals.","Prince Carl-Philip, 33, attacked outside club on Saturday morning .

"By . Victoria Wellman . PUBLISHED: . 11:35 EST, 2 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:44 EST, 2 October 2012 . A young Oregon couple and their baby who fell desperately ill after moving into a newly purchased home have discovered that the house is a former meth lab that has been emitting highly toxic fumes ever since they moved in. Beth and Jonathan Hankins of Klamath Falls bought the property through foreclosure in the summer and though they recognised it was a fixer-upper, could never have predicted the traumatic events that would follow. Within a matter of days, Beth began experiencing problems with her breathing and by week three of their occupancy, Jonathan and their infant son, Ezra, had been struck with agonising sores, migraines and nose bleeds. Happy days: Jonathan, Beth and baby Ezra Hankins bought their foreclosed home in the summer for $36,000 but soon all three of them had fallen ill with breathing difficulty, migraines and mouth sores . More than they bargained for: The Klamath Falls, Oregon house on Radcliffe was visibly in need of repair but methamphetamine toxins are invisible and they had no idea of the property's history . Oblivious to the connection, the couple were about to make a call to the doctor when a neighbour revealed the shocking truth about the home's previous tenants and just as quickly as they had taken ill, their dream purchase became their nightmare. The owner of a coffee house and an ER nurse, Mr and Mrs Hankins had bought the home from government-sponsored Freddie Mac. 'We said, ""It needs a little bit of love, but it's got good bones,""' Jonathan Hankins told Yahoo News. 'We just had no idea that those bones were poisonous.' Buying the home 'as is', they were informed of their responsibilities for detecting lead paint and asbestos hazards and chose not to bother with an inspection that would only point out superficial repairs anyway. Superficial: Before disaster struck, Jonathan Hankins and his two-year-old son Ezra painted the walls of their new home thinking they only had to make minor repairs and give the house a little love to resurrect it . Good as new? The Hankins spent about $5,000 on upgrading rooms like the bathroom before discovering the shocking news about their beloved home . Neither brokers nor the Freddie Mac representatives warned them of any drug activity on the property so armed with paintbrushes and an optimism - illustrated in a happy family picture on the day of closing - the Hankins moved into their new home. After hearing the news from their neighbour, a $50 testing kit proved that the house on 2427 Radcliffe was not only a meth lab but that its contamination level was nearly 80 times higher than the Oregon Health Authority limit. Wasting no time, Mr Hankins moved his wife and baby boy out of the property and into a rental. 'The walls were poisoning us,' he concluded as he lamented that the couple are now facing financial ruin. How a young couple could have been allowed to purchase such a dangerous home with no warning is part of a complicated legal story. Decline: Beth Hankins, an ER nurse, started experiencing breathing problems before her husband started suffering from migraines and nosebleeds and Ezra developed mouth sores . Innocence: Ezra before he contracted mouth sores is one of the luckier children according to Joe Mazzuca of Meth Lab Cleanup who says he has spoken to families who children have died owing to the toxic fumes of meth . Though in 23 states including Oregon, laws require seller to disclose if a property was ever used as a clandestine drug laboratory, Freddie Mac claims it had no idea of the Klamath Falls house's history. And because they sold it 'as is' to the Hankins family, it is no longer their responsibility to clean up or contribute to the costs associated with the disastrous discovery. Freddie Mac spokesman Brad German told Yahoo News: 'We certainly empathize with the situation, but we had no prior information about the way the home had been used. If we had, of course, we would have disclosed it.' Joe Mazzuca of Meth Lab Cleanup, a company that does what it says on the label, admitted that even with disclosure laws, only one in ten labs are busted and since the toxins are invisible 'you don't always see the meth residue.' 'It's extremely dangerous stuff' he said of methamphetamine. Home-style: A home-made meth lab likely similar to the one in the Hankins home that a $50 tester kit revealed emitted fumes 80 times higher than the legal rate of contamination . He also explained that information regarding the history of a property routinely falls through the cracks by the time the bank or government agency has reached the point of foreclosure. According to Mr Mazzuca he receives calls from people in exactly the same position as the Hankins every three to five minutes and recently heard from a man in Michigan who unknowingly bought a contaminated home that killed his 14-year-old daughter after two years. While sadly Michigan has no disclosure laws, the meth lab expert said: 'I could tell you stories like that for days.' Mr Hankins meanwhile is less willing to let Freddie Mac off the hook for their part in the sale and vented his frustration on Change.org. Before: Mrs Hankins and her family now face financial ruin as they are billed $5,000 to $15,000 for the clean-up on top of a mortgage and rent from the place they are living now . Peace: Mr Hankins, a coffee shop owner has posted an online petition asking Freddie Mac who sold them the house to shoulder the cost of the clean-up . Posting an online petition to try and hold them accountable for the costs of the clean up, he wrote: 'Freddie Mac advertises, ""Our qualifying homes come with a reviewed title, and a repaired living space making them easier to sell and improving home values in your territory. We sell our homes responsibly. Freddie Mac is committed to having the best property maintenance and sales standards in the country."" 'We had no reason to expect otherwise. Instead, they irresponsibly sold us a ticking time bomb of dangerous chemicals without even telling us.' But attorneys are insisting that the 'as-is' fine print is what will ultimately leave the $5,000 to $15,000 clean-up burden on Mr Hankins' shoulders. A quote he has been given costs more than the house is worth.","Family suffered nose bleeds, breathing problems, migraines and mouth sores before they discovered the shocking truth from a neighbour .

A 24-year-old man was arrested at Heathrow Airport on Monday morning on suspicion of committing or planning terrorism offences. He was detained by officers from the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command after arriving on a flight from Bahrain. It is suspected the arrest was made in relation to attempts to prevent people joining up with Syrian rebels and then returning to Britain with honed terrorism skills. Arrested: The 24-year-old man was arrested after arriving on Monday morning from Bahrain on suspicion of terrorism offences . The man was taken to a south London police station where he is being questioned over alleged terrorist activity. A police spokesman said: 'Officers from the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service) Counter Terrorism Command today, Monday November 12, arrested a 24-year-old man on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, under the Terrorism Act 2000. 'He was arrested at 8.45am after arriving on a flight from Bahrain to Heathrow Airport. 'The man was arrested after initially being stopped by immigration officials at 8am.' He added: 'Today's arrest forms part of an investigation into travel to Syria in support of alleged terrorist activity.' Another man, Shajul Islam, 26, a trainee NHS doctor, has been charged with keeping a British and a Dutch journalist captive. Islam, who studied at St Bartholomew's and a University of London hospital, is accused of being part of an extremist group that held John Cantlie, who worked for various newspapers including the Sunday Times, and Jeroen Oerlemans for around a week in the war-torn state. Threat: Britain's security services want to stop people joining up with rebels in Syria and then returning with dangerous terrorism skills . Islam, from Stratford, east London, was arrested at Heathrow Airport last month as he arrived back in the UK with his wife and one-year-old daughter on a flight from Egypt. He is accused of being a doctor for the jihadi group that kidnapped the journalists and held them at a camp in Syria. Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans were kept handcuffed and blindfolded after being captured as they travelled into Syria to cover the conflict there. It is alleged that Islam, with others, unlawfully and injuriously imprisoned Mr Cantlie and Mr Oerlemans against their will, between July 17 and 26. Islam is due to appear at the Old Bailey on April 12 for a plea and case management hearing, and a six-week trial is set to begin on June 5. Scores of extremists, some newly converted to Islam, have been heading off to the Middle East and MI5 and counter-terrorism police units are using anti-terror powers to disrupt their travel plans. The civil war is largely seen as a fight between the Free Syrian Army and the repressive regime of Bashar al-Assad. Firepower: A Syrian rebel firing a heavy mounted machine gun as they fight to overturn Bassar al-Assad . However, Western governments are increasingly worried that it is being hijacked by jihadist groups inspired by Al Qaeda ideologies. A small number of British Muslims have already been detained and questioned over concerns they intend to join extremist brigades fighting with the rebels. One security source warned in: ‘There is an increasing number of Muslims going to Syria but they are becoming difficult to monitor because the disguise their ultimate destination by first travelling to France before flying on to Turkey and Jordan. 'The question is when they return to the UK do they carry on their lives peacefully, happy to have done their bit for jihad, or do they bring jihad back to Britain?’ The source added: ‘Some have the will to carry out attacks and by the time  they return they also have capacity to make bombs  and fire guns. This is a concern that needs to be closely monitored.’ Unlike the Libyan conflict, the Syria volunteers are  not refugees from their home country and counter-terrorism agencies fear that once the war is over, these trained fighters will look for a new jihadist cause. There are up to 100 British fighters in Syria, and some of Pakistani origin have been identified in the forefront of foreign brigades.

Intervention: General Sir David Richards said contingency plans were in place for limited military action in Syria . Hundreds of British troops could be deployed to Syria if the humanitarian crisis worsens, our top soldier said yesterday. General Sir David Richards  said contingency plans were in place for a ‘very limited’ military response. His admission is the most serious warning yet that Britain could deploy forces to the warzone, and will fuel fears that the UK risks being slowly sucked into a full-scale conflict. The Chief of the Defence Staff’s comments come only days after David Cameron announced he would consider military options to remove President Bashar al-Assad. But General Richards stressed that the international community and political leaders would need to secure support from Syrians before so-called ‘safe zones’ could be protected by foreign forces. British troops could also play a part in providing food, shelter and medical supplies to refugee camps in neighbouring countries. Around 40,000 Syrians have been killed since the uprising began in March last year, while hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled across the border. General Richards also said the main focus of any action should be to ensure the crisis did not spill over into other countries. He told BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show: ‘There is no ultimately military reason why one shouldn’t [intervene] and I know that all these options are quite rightly being examined. ‘But we are some way off. The humanitarian situation this winter I think will deteriorate and that may well provoke calls to intervene in a limited way. ‘We develop contingency plans to look at all these things. ‘It is my job to make sure these options are continually brushed over to make sure we can deliver them and they’re credible. General Sir David Richards said it is important to contain the crisis so that it doesn't spill over into countries like Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey . ‘The main thing we are all focusing on is to contain the crisis so that it doesn’t spill over into countries like Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey. That’s our primary focus but that would also accommodate a humanitarian crisis because we could help deal with that. ‘It is certainly something we have got to look at.’ General Richards’s comments come amid growing signs of frustration in Downing Street at the inability of the international community to halt the fighting. Free Syrian Army fighters walk on rubble of damaged buildings in Homs. At present there is no legal basis for delivering military assistance to the rebels . During the Prime Minister’s visit to the region last week, it emerged that officials were told to examine how Britain could get around an EU arms embargo to funnel weapons directly to opposition fighters. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the UK had not ruled out military intervention in Syria . No-fly zones imposed by RAF jets and direct Western air strikes have not been ‘ruled out’ and will be discussed when Mr Cameron chairs a meeting of the National Security Council on Syria. In another BBC interview  yesterday, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond also revealed the UK had not ruled out military intervention in Syria. But he stressed that diplomats are focused on overcoming objections from Russia and China to a resolution in the UN. He said: ‘We don’t rule it out. At the moment we don’t have a legal basis for delivering military assistance to the rebels. - Israel confirmed yesterday  that it had fired warning shots into Syria after a stray mortar round hit an Israeli Defence Force post. It is the first time the country has fired on Syrian forces since last year’s uprising began. A string of mortar shells have struck the Golan Heights, which were seized by Israel in 1967. The two countries are formally at war and a UN force patrols the buffer zone. Israel said it views the incidents as accidental but has warned it holds Syria responsible.","General Sir David Richards's comments come after PM said he would consider military options to remove dictator Bashar al Assad .

A 73-year-old grandfather is on the run after shooting dead his daughter-in-law in a brutal attack. Eugene Palmer, of Stony point, New York, confronted Tammy Palmer, 39, with his shotgun yesterday after she put her two children on the school bus and returned to her home, which is on the same block of land as his. She was found dead with a bullet wound to her chest later that day. Dead: Tammy Palmer, pictured right with her two kids, was shot dead on Monday . According to The Journal News, the first shot of pellets struck her in the arm and she screamed and the second and third struck her in the right side of the chest, killing her. The weapon used in the slaying was found in the yard of her Willow Grove Road home near her body. Tammy Palmer's family said the Eugene Palmer had began a campaign of harassment against her after the 39-year-old took out an order of protection against her estranged husband, John. The order preventing him from the home where she was raising their two children, aged 12 and 16. Harassed: Tammy Palmer, pictured left, said the man had been harassing her since she separated from his son, John . Mourning: The victim's mother, Violet Pannirello, pictured, said she didn't think Mr Palmer would kill her daughter . School: Palmer, pictured, had just dropped her kids at the school bus when she was shot dead . She lived in a separate house but on the same property as her father-in-law. 'This morning she put the kids on the bus, I think she was hanging clothes,' said the victim’s father John Pannirello. On the run: Eugene Palmer, pictured, is armed and dangerous in the woods, police believe . 'He went there, I guess they had an argument. Went to get a gun, killed her.' Eugene Palmer's sister, Elaine Babcock, said he rushed to her house straight after the slaying and admitted what he'd done. 'He just came in and said, 'Here’s money to pay my taxes with, I’ve had enough. 'I shot and killed Tammy. Give me an hour to get away and then do whatever you have to do — call the police... whatever you have to do,' and then he just took off,' Babcock told CBS. The woman said she immediately called police, who believe he fled into Harriman State Park, which backs on to his property. Search teams spent yesterday hunting the woods for the man, a retired park ranger, and were using tracking dogs and helicopters to help them. Today they discovered his vehicle, a 1995 green Dodge Ram pickup truck, shortly after 1pm, and remain confident he is somewhere in the park. Tammy Palmer's parents are struggling to come to terms with the loss of their daughter, and are fighting to take custody of her two children. They say her relationship with her father-in-law had grown increasingly ugly, culminating in a fight last week. But they never thought the man would end her life. Crime scene: Palmer's body was found with a shotgun nearby at her home, pictured . 'She told me 'Mommy, don’t worry I’ll be alright.' I don’t think she ever thought that this man would kill her,' Tammy's mother Violet Pannirello told CBS. 'She’s gone. She’s resting. She’s not scared anymore. It’s so sad,' Pannirello said, adding 'a part of me died today.' Police said Palmer is likely to be dangerous, as he has a large collection of guns. Authorities said to call 911 if he is spotted.","New York Mother-of-two Tammy Palmer, 39, shot dead on Monday .

Titanic Captain Edward John Smith failed his seafaring exams on the first attempt it emerged . His sterling reputation meant some members of the upper class would voyage with no one else, but it has now emerged that the captain of the Titanic 'failed his original navigation test'. Edward John Smith, who famously went down with the 'unsinkable ship' when it hit an iceberg on its 1912 maiden journey, finally received his Masters Certificate in February 1888 at the age of 38. He is among the well-known seamen to appear in The Great Britain, Masters and Mates Certificates 1850-1927, which were published today on the family history website Ancestry.co.uk. The 280,000 documents, released in partnership with the National Maritime Museum, detail the seamen who passed examinations designed to test their experience, general good conduct and sobriety. The question 'What shall we do with the . drunken sailor?' led to 19th Century . politicians imposing stricter regulation on seamen with new regulations aimed to combat drunk and disorderly behaviour, which was rife in the Merchant Navy during the early 19th century. Launching the newly accessible records in London today historian Tony Robinson TV's Time Team, said: 'Captain Smith who was eventually the man in charge of the Titanic when it sank failed his exams the first time round because he did not have sufficient navigating skills. 'In the mid 19th Century there was an incredible problem in Britain's Merchant Navy, which was essentially that all the sailors were getting hammered all of the time. 'It's quite understandable. They were away from their homes for years on end, away from any port for months on end with nothing to do on the ship. 'In addition to that, water went off very quickly. It went brackish and alcohol is obviously quite a robust preservative so they were drinking far more rum than you or I would think to be appropriate.' As sailors began to earn a more generous wage, increasing amounts of money were spent on alcohol. Scroll down for video . Disastrous trip: The Titanic was declared unsinkable when it was built at the turn of the 20th century but on its maiden voyage it famously struck an iceberg and sunk .

The bow of the Titanic at rest on the bottom of the North Atlantic, about 400 miles southeast of Newfoundland . 'In the early 1800s, doctors were becoming much more interested in health generally and they realised that this was a real social problem. There's one doctor that I've read was working on a ship and described one sailor as being so drunk that he had ""lost the ability to look after his personal attention"", and somebody else had been drunk non-stop for ten days. 'The Victorians documented and recorded all of this and set tests which would ensure that there senior staff were sober and could exhibit good conduct.' Upon passing, men were awarded a Masters Certificate as proof that they were fit for service. Certificates specified the recipient's name, address, certificate number, birth date, birth place, port of issue, examination date and the previous ships on which they sailed. It was the Mercantile Maritime Act of 1850 that led to the introduction of Masters Certificates by the British Board of Trade and all ranks, from mates to captains, were required to sit these examinations. This year marked the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, . immortalised here in the 1997 James Cameron blockbuster of the same name . Captain George Moodie, the master of the Cutty Sark was awarded his certificate in Fife in 1861 before captaining numerous voyages to India. The famous ship is pictured here in Millwall Docks. After the new law was introduced in 1850, disorderly sailors were quickly forced to clean up their act. Crucially, legislation stated that seamen were no longer permitted to 'sell bad drugs', 'work under the influence of alcohol' or 'fraudulently alter' their Masters Certificates. Another famous captain who successfully passed his examinations is Captain George Moodie - Master of the renowned British tea clipper the Cutty Sark, who was awarded his certificate in Fife in 1861 before captaining numerous voyages to India. Delving into the past: The information came to light following research by TV presenter Tony Robinson for the programme Time Team . Despite running away to sea aged 15, Sir Edgar Britten qualified as a Master in December 1900 and went on to captain the RMS Queen Mary, a large ocean liner that was later used as a troopship carrying Australian soldiers to the UK. 'All of this stuff is hand-written and the ink has faded, often there's very bad handwriting and mistakes are made or rats ate the documents,' said Robinson. 'So it's a complex activity, cleaning . this up and putting it online, but the more people that become interested . in family history the more cost effective it becomes.' Ancestry.co.uk . international content director Miriam Silverman said: 'These records . provide fascinating insight into Merchant Navy life at the turn of the . 19th Century and signal the end of the stereotypical ""drunken"" and . disorderly sailor. 'They also went a long way to helping the Merchant Navy become respected the world over. 'They . are also a rich source of information for anybody looking to find out . more about a seafaring relative, or trace the career of a famous . captain.' John Sloan has used the newly released . documents to learn more about the life of his ancestor, the Merchant . Navy's Captain Christen Klitgaard. 'One of the things I was missing was his Masters Certificate, which was a . very important document to prove that he was actually a qualified . captain.' Captain Klitgaard first went to sea in the 1800s as a cabin boy at the age of 15. From there he progressed through the ranks to the post of Captain, eventually becoming a ship owner. 'He actually ended up spending 50 years at sea and covering one million miles, which was always his ambition,' said Mr Sloan. 'During that time he got married and had 10 children, all of whom sailed with him. 'He actually trained at Queen Alexander hospital to become a midwife so that he could be on hand (to help deliver his children).'

Strolling down the main shopping drag in this working-class Rio de Janeiro suburb, it's not the second-skin dresses in shocking pink spandex that catch the eye or even the strapless tops with strategically placed peekaboo paneling. The newest look can instead be found in stores like Silca Evangelical Fashion, where the hot items are the demure, long-sleeved frocks with how-low-can-you-go hemlines and the polyester putty-colored potato sack dresses. In the birthplace of the 'fio dental' or dental floss string bikini, so-called evangelical fashion has emerged as a growing segment of the country's $52 billion-a-year textile industry, catering to the conservative sartorial needs of Brazil's burgeoning numbers of born-again Pentecostals. On trend: Dresses made by Brazilian brand Kauly, which produces Evangelical fashion, on display in a shop window in Sao Paulo . Once so difficult to procure that evangelical women tended to make much of their own clothes themselves, the modest garb is now popping up all over Brazil. On the tiny high street of Rio suburb Itaborai, not one but two evangelical clothing stores compete to dress the faithful. M&A Fashion got its start two decades ago as a conventional clothing shop, selling the short, tight styles favored in this tropical country, but shifted to evangelical offerings five years ago. Silca Evangelical Clothing, two doors down, opened in March. 'It used to be that the word `evangelical' had a tacky connotation,' said M&A manager Marcelo Batista, who converted from Catholicism a decade ago. 'But now, we're not afraid to show who we are. Evangelical women now wear this clothing proudly,' he said, gesturing at the racks of ample dresses, long A-line denim skirts and ribbed sweaters that in the 100-plus degree heat were enough to make you sweat just by looking at them. Introduced in the mid-19th century by American missionaries, Brazil's neo-Pentecostal churches were long regarded as fringe groups. Aggressive proselytizing, particularly among the poor and disenfranchised, has produced a dramatic spike in the community's numbers in recent decades and eaten away at Brazil's status as the world's largest Catholic country. In 1980, evangelicals represented just over 6 percent of the population, according to the country's IBGE statistics agency. In the 2010 census, more than 42 million people, or 22per cent of the country's 190 million, identified themselves as evangelicals. Some statisticians predict that if current trends hold, evangelical Christians could become the majority here by 2030. With the spiraling numbers have come increased visibility and political and economic strength. Three senators and 63 congressional representatives belong to evangelical churches, and a candidate with links to the Universal Church has a considerable lead in polls ahead of next month's mayoral race in Sao Paulo, South America's biggest city. The Universal Church also owns one of Brazil's main television networks, TV Record. Preserving modesty: Women in some Evangelical congregations are expected to cover up at all times, except at home with their husbands . Still, Brazil's evangelicals are far from a unified block. Today hosts of homegrown Pentecostal denominations have their own dress codes, which range from draconian to permissive. Evangelical men are also expected to dress modestly, in long-sleeved shirts and slacks that are more readily available in regular stores. Women in some congregations wear the archetypal Brazilian outfit, tank tops and short shorts, in their daily lives, donning demure skirts and shoulder-covering tops only for services. In others, women are expected to cover up at all times, except at home with their husbands, and don't even remove their form-concealing robes at the beach. Pastor Marcos Pereira of the conservative Assembly of God of the Latter Days said his church's strict dress code had its foundations in scripture. The church forbids women from wearing pants as well as red and black fabrics and encourages the use of robes. 'The Bible orders women to wear this kind of clothing. It says women's bodies are not meant to be on display for everyone, just for their husbands,' Pereira said, adding that adhering to the church's dress code 'is a way for women to be in communion with God.' Sao Paulo-based label Joyaly makes clothes aimed at moderate evangelicals, who generally cover shoulders and knees and shun women's pants altogether. Off limits: The modest garb is now popping up all over Brazil as women conform to the evangelical church's strict dress-code . In demand: Hot fashion items among the evangelical communities include the demure, long-sleeved frocks with how-low-can-you-go hemlines and the polyester putty-colored potato sack dresses . Launched in 1990, the label is among the . oldest and priciest of the evangelical labels, its garments widely . considered the creme de la creme of the sector. Its best-selling . below-the-knee denim skirts, the staple piece in most evangelical . women's closets, retail for $60 to $75, while the dresses run for about . $75 to $100. The label doesn't make anything transparent, nor does it . make pants. Commercial director Alison Flores said the brand was born of his mother's constant struggle to find clothes that met the family church's modesty guidelines. 'Because she has a real entrepreneurial spirit, she decided to regard this problem as a business opportunity,' he said. 'She started making things for the ladies at church and then through word of mouth, the ladies from other churches and so on. People would come from all over to the really out-of-the-way neighborhood we lived in then. 'There was so much pent-up demand because until then, practically no one was attending to this public,' Flores said. A decade later, the family-run company set up shop in Sao Paulo's Bras garment district as the sole evangelical label. 'It really shocked people. They'd walk by, do a double-take and say `What's that all about?'' he said. Now Bras is chock-a-block with evangelical brands. Top accessory: Many women wear hats to church services as they attempt to cover up . One such newcomer is Kauly, a 10-year-old family-run label that was born again five years ago. 'We . sort of stumbled into it by accident after we made a few more sober, . conservative pieces,' said director Fabricio Pais, a Catholic.'They sold . so well we said, `Hold on, this is interesting.' Six month later, we . decided to radically change our product to cater to evangelical . consumers.' Since then, the label has seen its profits climb by around 30per cent annually, said Pais. The association representing Brazil's textile sector, ABIT, doesn't keep statistics on growth in niche sectors, but one of the group's recent publications emphasized that evangelical fashion was 'in real expansion.' The tables have turned so completely that now evangelical specialty clothing lines attract scads of nonbelievers. Batista, the manager of M&A Fashion in Itaborai, estimates that about 40per cent of the store's clients are not evangelicals. 'It's so hard in regular stores to find clothes that aren't too short or don't show a lot of cleavage that women who aren't comfortable with showing a lot of skin for whatever reason shop here too,' he said. Customer Ana Paula Fernandes agrees. As a nonpracticing Catholic, Fernandes converted to an evangelical church two years ago. Dressed in cutoff shorts and a white tank top with spaghetti straps permitted by her congregation for day-to-day wear, Fernandes said it took her a while to get used to the modest garments required for services. 'Once when I first joined, I went to church in pants, and the pastor called me out on it,' said the 25-year-old manicurist and mother of a 7-year-old daughter. 'It seemed strange at first, but now I see how what you wear affects other people, not to mention your own sense of self-worth.' Now, she says she wears only modest, loose-fitting dresses to church. 'I feel dignified,' she said.","22per cent of Brazil's 190 million, identified themselves as evangelicals in the 2010 census .

In the plea agreement, he admitted he . had sex with the girl, that she was under his care or supervision and . that he used a computer to persuade the girl to have sex with him . illegally. The court heard that Schaap had a . relationship between June 1 and July 30 with a girl who had not yet . turned 18, and took her from Indiana to Illinois to Michigan, according . to the criminal information. Schaap took the girl 'with the intent . that she engage in sexual activity for which (Schaap could) be charged . with a criminal offense', according to the Chicago Tribune. Prosecutors are seeking to forfeit a . number of items they believe he used when committing the crime, . including his iPad, iPhone, digital camera, voice recorder and two . computer flash drives. Schaap had been counseling the teenage girl, one former member of First Baptist Trisha Kee told CBS Chicago. The church did not confirm Ms Kee's statement, but issued a statement in August explaining why they fired him: ‘Our church grieves the need to take this action and the impact it will have on our people,' the statement read. 'We ask that everyone pray for the families involved, and pray that the situation will be handled in a Christ-honoring manner.’ The legal age of consent in the state of Indiana is 16, the lowest age allowed in any state. Eddie Wilson, the director of public relations for the church, told the Chicago Sun-Times that the church is in the process of finding a new pastor to lead the congregation. He added that Schaap and his wife Cindy are currently in seclusion to work out their marital difficulties. Cindy Schaap is the daughter of the late founder of the church, Rev Jack Hyles. Schapp's published books include Marriage: The Divine Intimacy and Dating . with a Purpose: Common Sense Dating Principles for Couples, Parents, and . Youth Workers. The pastor has received his fair share of criticism over the years due to some of his more controversial teachings. Last year, he was chastized for his views on women, believing them to be an inferior species and saying husbands should take charge of their wives and blasted Eve as being the sinner. He also said it would be a 'cold day in hell before I get my theology from a woman', adding: 'Your soul is going to hell because of what Eve did.' Long-running: Schaap, pictured preaching from the church's pulpit, had been pastor there since 2001, but was dismissed after a vote from the deacons . Place of worship: The First Baptist Church is located in Hammond, Indiana, and is partially housed in the old federal court building; its auditorium sits 7,500 . Roots: Schaap, pictured left, is married to Cindy Schaap, the daughter of the late Rev Jack Hyles, right, who founded the First Baptist Church in Hammond . Typically, mega-churches have more than 2,000 members or regular attendees, with several areas to listen to sermons, often with one or more pastors speaking during a Sunday service. Mega-churches are houses of worship with 2,000 or more members and weekly attendees. They have grown in popularity in recent years, and are mostly a phenomenon of modern times. According to the Hartford Institute for Religion Research, most current mega-churches were founded after 1955 after larger churches started to become more appealing to many church-goers. Many focus on ‘seeker services,’ which often offer little deep theology and instead appeal to sceptics and non-believers. They are also aimed at targeting younger audiences, often with the prospects of contemporary music and more casual settings than traditional churches. The denominations involved include Baptists, Methodists, and Nondenominational, as well as some Pentecostal churches. Many of them feature contemporary worship styles, with live music complete with worship band, and sometimes even an orchestra pit. Mega-churches have also received a fair amount of criticism, as some say they focus more on entertainment than on worship, and that large numbers detract the amount of time pastors can spend with the congregation. First Baptist itself is housed in the old federal courthouse building in Hammond, Indiana, and contains an auditorium that seats 7,500. Mr Wilson said that more than 15,000 people attend services at the weekend. Members of the mega-church have already expressed their shock at the pastor’s alleged actions. ‘The pastor been good to us,’ said Ronald Winston to WGN-TV. Mr Winston lives at the church’s mission. ‘He take care of the shelter. I don’t have no better opinion of him.’ Another member, Aranda White, said: ‘To me, he was teaching to word from the Bible. I have nothing bad to say about him.’ An informational meeting was held at the church at 7pm tonight to address the dismissal of Schaap, who has led the congregation since 2001. In the meeting of the congregation Wednesday night, church leaders said that Schaap admitted to having sex with one of the members of First Baptist Church when she was 16. The Times of Northwest Indiana reported that near the end of the meeting, Pastor Eddie Lapina said that he would serve as interim pastor as the church continues their search for a suitable replacement. Those filing out of the meeting bore grim faces, and few offered to comment for the paper. Those who did said that they would continue to pray for the family and for Schaap. More than 1,000 people attended the meeting. One member, Joseph Flores, said that he was feeling conflicted over the firing. ‘I’m glad to see they’re doing something,’ he told the Times, ‘but I hope they show the good he’s done for us, too. He straightened up this part of the city, and he’s done a lot for this community.’","Jack Schaap, 54, has been pastor at First Baptist Church of Hammond in Indiana for 11 years .

A condo developer in Atlanta wants to tear down a historic mansion built for the grandson of Thomas Jefferson, as it’s impeding the development of their property. But members of a Georgia historic society have come up with a unique option – offering the opulent Randolph-Lucas House to someone who appreciates its historic ties, for free. The only stipulation is that the buyer most front around $350,000 to move the mansion to a different neighbourhood in the area. And of course, the sundry renovations aren’t free, either. Eminent domain? A condo association in Atlanta is trying to obtain the land where the Randolph-Lucas mansion now stands . Old hat: The 1924 Federal Revival mansion was moved once before in 1997; a conservation group is offering the mansion for free to anyone who will pay to move it . The Federal Revival house was built on Peachtree Road in Atlanta in 1924 for Hollins Nicholas Randolph, who was a prominent attorney in Atlanta and a descendent of the third president of the United States. Preservationists at the Buckhead Heritage Society have tried to spread the word. Wright Mitchell, a Buckhead attorney, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the costs of repair are too much of an unknown for prospective buyers. The condominiums, painted a pale shade of yellow and standing storeys above the mansion, were built in 1997. As part of their contract, they moved the house 35 feet away from the development to comply with zoning regulations. The association which owns the units claim the historic house is in poor condition, and are filing with the Atlanta Urban Design Commission to tear it down and instead replace it with an open-air pavilion for residents of the condos. Fixer-upper: The house has been uninhabited for 25 years, after its last resident died; here, the shutters show obvious signs of wear . Historic: The house was built by Thomas Jefferson's grandson, who was a prominent lawyer . But between the two sides, the 2500 Peachtree Condominium Association has an agreement to hold up – when they built the condos 15 years ago, they were required to move the house. Family ties: Randolph was the scion of President Thomas Jefferson, pictured . They were also required to renovate it, according to Reporter Newspapers. The house has been empty some 25 years, since its previous owner passed away in the 1980s. From there, it became a popular venue for weddings, and was granted historic status in 1990. The condos were allowed to be built if and only if they preserved the house. Atlanta, like many places in the country, did not have a solid preservation movement in place until well after the 1960s, meaning that many historical buildings from bygone eras have been flattened to make way for newer constructions. The preservation society told the Journal-Constitution that they’ve had several prospective buyers, but no bites yet. They said the poor economy isn’t helping. They also said the condo association will not let engineers and architects inspect the property to discern how much work the property actually needs.

Dentist Joyce Trail, 48, who has been jailed for conning the NHS out of £1.5million by pretending she had fitted dentures to dead patients . A dentist swindled over £1.5million from the NHS by pretending she had fitted dentures to dead patients in order to fund her luxury lifestyle. Joyce Trail, 50, splashed out on designer clothes, bags, jewellery, luxury homes, £1,000-a-night hotel suites in the Caribbean and America and a designer shoe collection 'to make Imelda Marcos' proud. The grandmother, who also used the money to send her granddaughters to a posh private school, was jailed for seven years today. She made thousands of false claims for dental work which had not been done - sometimes using the names of deceased patients. A court heard the scam was one of the biggest NHS frauds ever uncovered by police. Jailing Trail at Coventry Crown Court, Judge Peter Carr said her offences had been motivated by pure greed. Trail is thought to have netted around £1.4million by making bogus claims for dental work which she had not performed between April 2006 and March 2009. She submitted over 7,000 dodgy invoices . for lucrative denture work over a three-year period that was never . actually carried out at her practice in Handsworth, Birmingham. A further £94,000 in employer’s contributions was paid into Trail’s pension during the period of the indictment, bringing total proceeds from the fraud to £1,556,743. Judge Carr was told that the sum could have instead funded 73 newly-qualified nurses for a year, 221 hip replacements, or life-saving drugs for 51 leukaemia patients. Trail, from Little Aston, Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, and her daughter Nyri Stirling, 33 - who also worked at the practice  - were convicted of conspiracy to defraud in July following a five-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court. The jury heard Trail amassed a collection of Jimmy Choo shoes that the judge said would have made 'Imelda Marcos proud.' Jailing Trail, who pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice before her trial, Judge Carr said he believed the roots of the offences lay in an earlier NHS investigation into her conduct. The judge told her: 'In 2004 you were investigated. The result of that investigation was that it was decided that you had over-claimed in relation to services you provided. 'You were ordered to pay back over £320,000.' Life of luxury: Trail's home in Little Aston, Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, with four cars pictured in the driveway .

'It is my view that, having been ordered to pay back such a large sum, and not wishing to forgo the lifestyle to which you by then had become accustomed, you deliberately set out to ensure that you did not.

Britain's only flying Cold War Vulcan bomber will take its final flight next year before being grounded because of soaring restoration costs. After a multimillion-pound fundraising scheme, Avro Vulcan XH558 was restored in 2007 and given a certificate of airworthiness before appearing at more than 60 air shows. But The Vulcan to the Sky Trust has announced that 2013 will be the final flying season for the aircraft based at Doncaster's Robin Hood Airport. Scroll down for video . Piece of history: The Avro Vulcan bomber on its return flight to the skies after it was restored . Momentous occasion: Cheering crowds gathered to watch the restored Vulcan bomber taking to the skies for the first time in 14 years in 2007 . Proud: The crew of the restored Vulcan bomber, from left to right, Al McDicken, David Thomas and Barry Masefield . At the height of the Cold War, Vulcan bombers carrying nuclear missiles were a key part of Britain's deterrent. They were retired two years later but XH558 was later restored. The only action that XH558 saw was in the Falklands War in 1982 when it flew 8,000 miles to bomb the runway at Port Stanley and Argentinian planes on the ground. Since the restoration the charity estimates that more than ten million people have seen the aircraft, including three million when it flew as part of the Queen's 2012 Diamond Jubilee celebrations. But the charity has admitted that it would be too expensive to continue flying the Vulcan beyond next year. Trust chief executive Dr Robert Pleming said: 'All Vulcans have a finite safe flying life and XH558 is already significantly beyond the hours flown by any other aircraft of her type. 'At the end of next year, she will need a £200,000 modification to her wings to increase her flying life.' Big project: The V-bomber under restoration at the Bruntingthorpe Airodrome in 2007 . Team effort: Members of the team at Bruntingthorpe Airfield who helped return the former RAF Vulcan bomber XH558 to the skies pictured celebrating after securing funding to complete its restoration . Public interest: Spectators get a close look at the RAF Avro Vulcan bomber XH558 at Bruntingthorpe Airfield in 2006 . As well as complex and expensive wing modifications there is also concern about the Vulcan's jet engines. The Vulcan strategic bomber was used by the RAF between 1956 and 1984, and formed the backbone of Britain's airborne nuclear deterrent during the Cold War. Manufacturers A V Roe & Co (Avro) named the aircraft 'Vulcan' after the Roman god of fire. The plane initially carried the UK's . first nuclear weapon, the Blue Danube gravity bomb, and was equipped to . carry it to Russia - an exercise in deterrence. It was also capable of conventional bombing missions, and played a vital role in Operation Black Buck during the Falklands War in 1982. The Black Buck combat missions saw the planes fly 3,889 miles from Ascension Island to Stanley on the Falkland Islands. On May 1st 1982, a single Vulcan flew over Port Stanley and bombed the airfield there, achieving a direct hit which rendered it unusable by fighter aircraft. The plane was retired by the RAF in 1984. Andrew Edmondson, engineering director for XH558 said: 'From the start of the 2014 season, it is unlikely that we could accommodate any engine failures and that even without any technical problems, soon our set of engines would be out of life. 'There are no more airworthy engines available, and refurbishment would be so difficult and costly that there is no possibility that it will happen.' Also because of the closure of aviation suppliers since the aircraft's maiden flight in August 1952 the cost of re-manufacturing or refurbish parts would be too high. Mr Edmonson added: 'We know, for example, that the set-up costs to remanufacture a main wheel are more than £70,000. If the approved engineering drawings are no longer available, it can be practically impossible given any amount of money.' In a letter to the Trust supporters, . Dr. Pleming said: 'Next year will be the last opportunity anyone will . have, anywhere in the world, to see a Vulcan in the air. 'The . Vulcan to the Sky Trust's aspiration is that when XH558's flying life . is over, she will become the centrepiece of a new project that will . inspire and train new generations of youngsters to become engineers and . technicians, helping to solve the UK's significant shortfall in the . number of talented young people entering technical careers.' Michael . Trotter, the Trust's director, said: 'XH558 will be maintained in . excellent running order and will continue to delight her supporters with . fast taxi runs while developing further her role in education as the . centrepiece of an exciting new type of inspirational engineering . education centre.'

Justine Greening has called for a major shake-up in the EU aid budget – as it emerged more than half the cash is squandered on relatively rich countries. The International Development Secretary challenged the basis of the £10billion-a-year budget, which channels cash to countries such as Turkey, Iceland and Brazil. She is pressing for a major shift in policy to target resources at the poorest countries. International Development Secretary Justine Greening today insisted aid money should be targetted at helping the poorest nations . Miss Greening held talks with . ministers from France, Germany, Ireland, Denmark, Finland and Luxembourg . to build a coalition for reform. She also discussed the issue with the EU’s foreign affairs commissioner, Baroness Ashton. Ms Greening's get-tough message marks shift away from the softly-softly approach of her predecessor, Andrew Mitchell (pictured) Miss Greening said: ‘I don’t think . it’s right that the EU still gives money to those countries higher up . the income scale, when we’ve taken the decision to target the poorest. ‘I’ll be doing everything I can to get other countries on board.’ Her intervention comes amid mounting . concern about the EU aid budget, which receives £1.4billion a year from . the UK, equal to one-sixth of this country’s total aid budget. Figures . prepared for the Commons international development committee reveal that . just 46 per cent of EU aid goes to genuinely needy countries in the . developing world. The figures suggest around £784million . of aid money channelled through Europe now goes to better-off . countries. By comparison, some 72 per cent of British aid money is spent . in the world’s poorest countries. Experts say the discrepancy means that for every £1 Britain channels through the EU, the world’s poorest countries lose 26p. Many of the countries funded by Brussels are considered too wealthy to receive aid directly from the UK. Among the projects funded by the EU . are a scheme promoting tourism in an Icelandic national park and a . pro-EU television series in Turkey.

"By . Sir Roy Strong . PUBLISHED: . 16:06 EST, 6 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:14 EST, 8 October 2012 . Sir Roy Strong, historian and former director of the V&A museum, says both the Labour and Conservative parties are using 'one nation' rhetoric but neither are suggesting ways out of the 'trashocracy' mess . The Conservative Party must have had a rude awakening last Tuesday. Someone had not only got in through the back door but they raided the holy of holies. They made off with that jewel in the Tory crown, that vision which had carried the party to electoral victory for most of the last century – one-nation conservatism. What makes it worse is that Ed Miliband, in his landmark speech, had appropriated a mantle which David Cameron believed that he unassailably wore. Alas, no longer! The Labour Party leader, in words that should have been spoken by the present Prime Minister, gave vent to his passionate belief in a country in which ‘patriotism, loyalty, dedication to the common cause courses through the veins of all, and nobody feels left out’. Liberally sprinkled with Churchillian rhetoric, he reiterated the phrase ‘one nation’ 44 times, thus reducing the present Government’s Big Society to something akin to an object of universal derision. We have not heard anything like this since some of Margaret Thatcher’s star performances. Readers might well ask what is the difference between ‘one-nation socialism’ and ‘one-nation conservativism’. What is it anyway? One-nation conservatism was the invention of Benjamin Disraeli. It was a vision that successfully averted the country from the revolutions and class wars that were to engulf the European mainland. By the middle of the Victorian period, the effect of the Industrial Revolution had been to create not only a new, immensely rich middle class, but also a wretchedly paid working class, which lived in conditions that can only be described as shocking. By the late 1860s, working-class men had the vote and Disraeli realised that for the Conservatives to gain government, social reform must be carried through to gain their support. Money talks: Harry Enfield's comic creation 'Loadsamoney' and a 1869 caricature of Benjamin Disraeli . In this way a line of descent was formed that enabled the Conservatives to accept the Welfare State as created after 1945 and support it until the dependency culture it created as its downside came under attack by Margaret Thatcher. WE now need to go back and ask ourselves: Is the Britain of 2012 in any way similar to the country as it was in the 1840s and 1850s when Disraeli formulated his ‘one nation’ idea? What shocked him most in that period was the utterly enormous gaps between the rich and the poor, the haves and the have-nots. As far as I have observed things in my lifetime, all that we have seen is one form of divided society replaced by another. The industrial revolution, which gave birth to cotton mill towns, such as Mossley, near Manchester, pictured, lay the foundations for a class-divided Britain . Cotton rooms at John Spencer Ltd Cotton Mills of Burnley, fell silent after the industrial revolution but the class system by then was well and truly established . What I am trying to argue is summed up in a comment I overheard one woman make to another at the Royal Opera House: ‘Don’t worry, if you’re short of staff I’ll send some of mine over to help out.’ No, this was wasn’t Downton Abbey. But it is a vivid reflection of the society created as much by New Labour as by the Conservatives over the past 30 years. I don’t think anyone would  challenge the statement that the gulf between the rich and the  poor must be as wide in 2012 as it was 1911. The old society that was – in effect, swept away that year with the passing of the Parliament Act which curtailed the powers of the House of Lords – was built on a noblesse oblige between classes. Neither Miliband nor Cameron has offered any vision to take us forward out of this mess . There was the ladder of ascent – working class, lower-middle, middle-middle and upper-middle class, then gentry and then aristocracy. It was a society based on birth and bound by obligation but it was not immutable. People could and did ascend through . achievement and education. You can see it in action in Downton, where . everyone knows their place in a mechanism that by and large worked, . although there could be dislocation. However, the option was always for . evolution rather than revolution. Having . swept that away as feudal and undemocratic, a very different society . was created by the final decades of the last century. Its successor, which is everywhere around us, is a society no longer founded on lineage and brought up with the burden of obligation based on inherited Christian moral values, but one whose sole criterion is money and what it can buy. It has produced what long ago I labelled the new ‘trashocracy’. Money as never before can buy social status, a title if you give enough away and positions on various boards. The first attribute to get anywhere these days is has whoever it is got money or, if not, does he or she know anyone who has any? That was not true 40 years ago. Everything is about money: how to make it, how to keep it, how to spend it and how to recruit people who can lay their hands on it. And so now we come back to Ed . Miliband who, it was noticeable when asked whether or not he was a . millionaire, was evasive. Perhaps he too is among those  he accused of . getting Cameron’s £40,000 tax handout next April. Miliband . sees the country as being in a wartime crisis situation. But, alas, . there’s no Maynard Keynes putting together ideas  for a programme of the . kind  that framed the post-war Welfare State. Miliband’s rhetoric was . great but there was little, if  any, substance. So how to create this ‘one nation’? There is no money and the country is still borrowing and running up debt at a furious rate. With devolution and adumbrated Scottish devolution, the ‘one nation’ has already fragmented. Money has meant  that as soon as anyone has made any, the first thing they do is abandon the decaying organs of the post-1945 state. They opt for private healthcare rather than the NHS and private education over the comprehensive system. They also buy themselves into the property ladder. This increasing gulf is rubbed into those less fortunate by the often thoughtless, extravagant and vulgar lifestyle of those who’ve got it. And there’s little if any sign there of the Victorian fervour of do-gooding or any moral structure in a society that glorifies relativism and the me-me code of ethics. Neither Miliband nor Cameron has offered any vision to take us forward out of this mess. The best that can be said is that things look a good deal worse on the European mainland. Any solution, I need hardly write, is seen solely in terms of money. As Margaret Thatcher once said: ‘You don’t solve a problem by throwing money at it.’ The country’s overall malaise goes much deeper, calling for what in times past used to be labelled a reform of society. The fact that we can’t even think in those terms any longer is an index of how far we’ve slid downhill. It explains why often a younger generation finds any form of committed religious belief weird. Years ago I recall that great man Sir Isaiah Berlin saying to me: ‘No great men any more.’ Sadly, how true that is.","Benjamin Disraeli's original vision relied on the rich looking out for the poor .

A two-year-old girl who died after she was wrongly diagnosed with swine flu was failed by emergency services, a coroner has said. Georgia Keeling, from Norwich, died from a meningitis-like infection following the incorrect diagnosis at the height of the 2009 national pandemic. The inquest in Norwich heard that paramedic Patricia Perfect had examined her at home but sent an ambulance away because it was 'another case of swine flu'. Four hours later, following a second 999 call, the toddler was rushed to hospital where she died. Returning a narrative verdict today, Norfolk coroner William Armstrong ruled Georgia died following an 'erroneous diagnosis' and the fact she was not immediately admitted to hospital reduced her chances of survival and contributed to her death. He said: 'She died from a condition that was previously undiagnosed and the examination by Miss Perfect was inadequate and deficient and there was a failure to recognise the severity of her condition. 'Is is possible Miss Perfect was over-influenced by the fact there was at the time a prevalence of swine flu? 'There is no doubt at all that Georgia should have been sent to hospital immediately and she would have had a better chance of survival.' A fantastic girl: Georgia was misdiagnosed with swine flu when she was suffering from meningitis . Georgia's parents (pictured left) Paul Sewell and Natasha Keeling have spoken out to highlight a catalogue of failings that led to the death of their daughter Georgia (pictured right) He added that the East of England Ambulance Trust had already taken action to reduce the likelihood of future tragedies. Earlier in the hearing it was suggested Georgia’s death on August 4, 2009 was the result of meningitis. Today, pathologist Xenia Tyler said a . post-mortem showed she died from a group A streptococcal infection, a . rare form of blood poisoning which can develop into meningitis. Georgia was first seen by Miss Perfect at about midday on August 4, 2009 following a 999 call. Her mother, Natasha Keeling, said she . had initially felt relieved that she had been diagnosed and given the . swine flu medication Tamiflu. Georgia’s father, Paul Sewell, said he had been reassured it was not life-threatening. But her condition continued to . deteriorate and Ms Keeling again dialled 999 shortly before 4pm. Georgia . was pronounced dead at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital at . 4.24pm. Georgia was taken to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, but she was pronounced dead on arrival . Meningitis symptoms to look out for . Professor John Kroll told the inquest . that, on the balance of probabilities, it was likely Georgia would have . survived if she had been taken to hospital sooner. He added: 'The diagnosis of swine flu was clearly inappropriate. The circumstances here go far outside . what any clinician would diagnose as swine flu. If it was swine flu, it . was swine flu with complications.' Dr Jeffrey Perrin, a paediatric and . intensive care consultant who examined the circumstances around her . death, said “red flag” warning signs were missed. Paramedic Patricia Perfect said she visited the family's home and made the swine flu diagnosis after a 45-minute examination . He added: 'I would not necessarily . have expected an emergency care practitioner to have diagnosed the . illness but it is more important to recognise the severity of the . condition. 'The failure of an emergency care . practitioner to recognise the severity of Georgia’s illness resulted in . her having a reduced chance of surviving the illness.' Miss Perfect yesterday told the . hearing she regretted the incorrect diagnosis but said “most clinicians” would have made the same mistake given the unprecedented circumstances. She described how medics had been 'distracted' by the pandemic. 'Swine flu was at the forefront of . everybody’s mind. Had that not been a factor I would have been looking . at other reasons,' she said. Speaking outside the inquest, Mr Sewell said the last three years had been like ""going through hell"". But he said the family accepted that the ambulance service had learnt from the mistake. He added: 'We were failed by one person and we can't blame the whole NHS for that.' He and Ms Keeling issued a statement saying: 'Nobody knows a child like their parents and we are saddened that despite our best instincts the ambulance service failed to provide adequate care to Georgia. 'We are pleased the ambulance service has apologised for the failings of its emergency care practitioner - we are only sorry that it has taken three years.' Speaking after the inquest, Dr Pamela Chrispin, medical director and deputy chief executive at the East of England Ambulance Service, offered her ""deepest condolences"" to Georgia's family. She added many children with fever and a rash are safely seen, treated and left at home. Dr Chrispin said the ambulance service had apologised for the shortcomings and was pleased the coroner had acknowledged the progress that had been made. 'In Georgia's case we accept that, although the paramedic carried out an assessment and followed national guidance, she could have identified the potential for Georgia to become more seriously ill and arranged urgent admission to hospital,' Dr Chrispin said. 'She has since undergone a period of retraining and evaluation and has returned to frontline duties. 'This is a difficult area for all healthcare professionals involved in the assessment of children in the community and, as in this case, sadly there is occasionally a tragic outcome. 'Since Georgia's death the East of England Ambulance Service have taken additional steps to help our staff recognise and manage seriously ill children. 'We are the leading ambulance service in the UK to work with the international Surviving Sepsis campaign, which promotes the early identification and treatment of sepsis.'","Coroner returned a narrative verdict and ruled Georgia died following an 'erroneous diagnosis'

A teenaged girl received 60 lashes in Timbuktu after Islamist extremists convicted her of speaking to men on the street. The girl, believed to be 15 years old, was allegedly caught speaking with men by Ansar Dine, the militant Islamist group who control Timbuktu and much of northern Mali. One resident claimed the girl was warned repeatedly by the Islamists to stop what she was doing, but persisted in talking to men in public.

Ousmane Maiga, a Timbuktu resident, said: ‘The Islamists said that the girl was warned five times by Islamist police but she continued to speak to men in the street. ‘After the hearing, the Islamists gave 60 lashes to the girl. The population did not turn out in large numbers to attend this flogging.’ The public whipping took place at around 11am local time in front of the new headquarters of the Islamic police in downtown Timbuktu, next to Independence Square. Ansar Dine (Defenders of Faith) is the most prevalent of a number of Al-Qaeda-linked groups that have seized northern Mali after a power vacuum opened by a military coup in the south in March.

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 09:36 EST, 15 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 16:01 EST, 15 October 2012 . Thousands of employees at companies owned by billionaire Republican fundraisers were told to vote for Mitt Romney in packet mailed to them warning of the dangers of an Obama re-election. The mailer is easily traced back to David and Charles Koch, the notorious multi-billionaire brothers who have largely financed the Tea Party movement and served as effective Romney bundlers. In These Times released excerpts from a letter sent to 45,000 employees at Georgia Pacific- a Koch-owned paper company based in Washington state- that was signed by the company's CEO Dave Robertson. This is the third time in the past week that the head of a major corporation sent out a letter pressuring employees to vote for Romney in the upcoming election. Scroll down for video . Brothers in charge: Charles (left) and David Koch (right) have supplied billions in political funding to conservative Republican candidates and have now told their employees who to vote for . 'While we are typically told before each Presidential election that it is important and historic, I believe the upcoming election will determine what kind of America future generations will inherit,' the letter reads. It goes on to say that the dangers that loom with the wrong presidency would include 'unprecedented regulatory burdens on businesses' and threaten 'many of our more than 50,000 U.S. employees and contractors may suffer the consequences, including higher gasoline prices, runaway inflation, and other ills'. The excerpts from the letter show that while the CEO never explicitly said that Obama would be the one to cause said ills, the point is made very clear by the inclusion of a list of Koch-supported candidates. Needless to say, Obama did not make the list. The letter says that the list comes at the request of 'many employees' who wanted to know what state and local politicians are supported by 'Koch companies or by KOCHPAC, our employee political action committee'. Famous friends: Mitt Romney is seen shaking David Koch's (tallest on left) hand at the Republican National Convention . The full text of the letter- and of . the supporting list- were not made public by In These Times, but the . site reports that in addition to Mitt Romney, 14 other Republican state . politicians were highlighted. Though the cover letter was signed by . Mr Robertson, the driving force was explicitly clear: an anti-Obama . editorial penned by Charles Koch and a pro-Romney editorial by his . brother David were included in the packets. While we are typically told before each Presidential election that it is important and historic, I believe the upcoming election will determine what kind of America future generations will inherit. If we elect candidates who want to spend hundreds of billions in borrowed money on costly new subsidies for a few favored cronies, put unprecedented regulatory burdens on businesses, prevent or delay important new construction projects, and excessively hinder free trade, then many of our more than 50,000 U.S. employees and contractors may suffer the consequences, including higher gasoline prices, runaway inflation, and other ills. At the request of many employees, we have also provided a list of candidates in your state that have been supported by Koch companies or by KOCHPAC, our employee political action committee. We believe any decision about which candidates to support is—as always—yours and yours alone, based on the factors that are most important to you. Second, we do not support candidates based on their political affiliation. Exerting such pressure on employees . was not always legal, but recent Supreme Court decisions no longer . prohibit companies from telling their employees who to vote for. For appearances sake, however, the . letter did include one line gesturing towards partiality: 'We believe . any decision about which candidates to support is—as always—yours and . yours alone, based on the factors that are most important to you.' Longtime Koch Industries employees are likely familiar with the move, as workers at the same Georgia Pacific plant received a similar packet two years ago during the midterm elections. At the time, then-COO Mr Robertson wrote that 'as Koch company employees, we have a lot at stake in the upcoming election'. The letter was published in its entirety by The Nation and one of the sheets included voter registration deadline information and also a list of all Koch-supported politicians. On the list of 19 candidates, all but four were Republicans. One current employee who received the packet said that it is just one of the ways that the Koch brothers are exerting undue influence on their workers. 'They are destroying the planet. They are trying to buy the votes. They think they are so high and mighty. They have their principles. They just think their way is the only way and they think everyone else is wrong,' the man told In These Times. He spoke anonymously for fear of being fired. 'If you don't believe in their philosophy, you can find a job somewhere else. I have worked there for 30-plus years. I have no training; I have worked in a factory. What am I going to do?' This . is the third time in a week where an influential CEO warned his . employees about the prospect of an Obama win come November. Gawker published . the letter written by Westgate Resorts owner David Siegel where he . clearly said that if Romney won the presidential election, they would be . more likely to keep their jobs. Well financed: Charles (left) and David (right), seen here in 1970, are now ranked as the fourth and fifth wealthiest Americans respectively with personal net worth of $31billion . 'The economy doesn't currently pose a threat to your job. What does threaten your job however, is another 4 years of the same Presidential administration. Of course, as your employer, I can't tell you whom to vote for, and I certainly wouldn't interfere with your right to vote for whomever you choose,' he wrote. Prosperity: David Koch, pictured, and his brother were major funders of the Americans for Prosperity, a group that helped finance Republicans in the 2010 midterm elections . MSNBC's Chris Hayes reported that Arthur Allen, the CEO of Florida-based ASG Software Solutions, sent an email to more than 1,000 employees saying that the company needs a new administration to remain 'independent' in order to keep from cutting costs and firing employees. 'I can tell you, if the US re-elects President Obama, our chances of staying independent are slim to none,' he wrote. 'If we fail as a nation to make the right choice on November 6th, and we lose our independence as a company, I don't want to hear any complaints regarding the fallout that will most likely come.' When it comes to the Kochs, the brothers prefer to remain behind the curtain rather than in the spotlight. As a result, no members of the press were invited to their seaside $50,000-per-plate fundraiser for Romney in their Hamptons home this July. There was a brief break in that privacy lately, however, as their other brother William now faces a lawsuit after he allegedly held a former employee hostage for two days. Ranked fourth and fifth respectively on Forbes' list of the richest Americans, Charles and David Koch made their money in industrial markets. Their company- Koch Industries- is the second largest privately held company in the country with 67,000 employees. Shady: David Koch, pictured in 1996 . Charles, 76, and David, 72, are both worth an estimated $31billion and are jointly ranked as the 45th most powerful people in the world. Known for their political connections to Republican groups that support lightened regulation and free markets, Charles is thought to donate more than $40million per year to his libertarian foundation. While many political analysts have understood their power for years, the pair made their biggest foray on the public stage when they helped to found the political advocacy group Americans For Prosperity, which played a significant role in the Republican takeover of the House of Representatives in 2010 and the surge of the Tea Party movement. They have focused their attention to specific political campaigns in the past and had successful results. The clearest of those successes was the gubernatorial campaign of union-busting Governor Scott Walker in Wisconsin. Though the pair are famous for the secretive way in which they do business, their name has become something of a stereotype when it comes to labelling the questionable connections between private enterprise and public works. 'The Koch brothers are the poster children of the effort by multinational corporate America to try to redefine the rights and values of American citizens,' Democratic Wisconsin Representative Gwen Moore told The New York Times. Hollywood took notice of the Koch’s public perception, and a shady pair of billionaire brothers (the ‘Motch brothers’) were made the villains in The Campaign, a comedy starring Zach Galifianakis and Will Ferrell. Making the point more clear, Mr Galifianakis was asked about the Kochs during the press tour for the film, and he said: ‘I disagree with everything they do. They are creepy and there is no way around that. It's not freedom what they are doing.’ In turn, the Koch press representative responded by taking a shot at the Hangover star’s career: ‘Last we checked, the movie is a comedy. Maybe more to the point is that it's laughable to take political guidance or moral instruction from a guy who makes obscene gestures with a monkey on a bus in Bangkok.’ Raising the alarm: The Kochs have served as the silent financial partners of many Tea Party groups .","David and Charles Koch are well-known Republican supporters .

If former Los Angeles Dodger owner Frank McCourt thought he can put his bitter divorce behind him, he may be in for an unpleasant surprise. The ex-wife of the 59-year-old businessman filed a motion to set aside the couple's divorce settlement, accusing McCourt of committing fraud by vastly understating the Dodgers’ value. Jamie McCourt's attorney, Bertram Fields, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that attempts to modify what he called a ‘massive imbalance’ in the settlement failed, forcing her to return to court. Power couple: Frank and Jamie McCourt were married for nearly 30 years, before their separation sparked one of the costliest divorce fights in California history . The motion filed Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court claims Frank McCourt misrepresented the couple's Dodger assets as worth less than $300million before their divorce in 2010. The team sold in May 2012 for $2.15billion to a group that includes former NBA star Magic Johnson. Under the terms of the divorce settlement finalized in October 2011, Jamie McCourt agreed to give up on her share of the Dodgers in exhcnage for $131million. She was also allowed to keep four of the couple's six homes. Representatives for Frank McCourt could not immediately be reached for comment. A hearing for the motion has been scheduled for November. Big league legal brawl: Jamie McCourt had sought half of the Dodgers franchise after a judge deemed her post-nuptial agreement with Frank McCourt invalid . In late March, McCourt finalized a record-breaking deal with a group of investors called Guggenheim Baseball Management to sell the troubled Los Angeles team. 'This agreement with Guggenheim reflects both the strength and future potential of the Los Angeles Dodgers, and assures that the Dodgers will have new ownership with deep local roots, which bodes well for the Dodgers, its fans and the Los Angeles community,' McCourt said at the time. The businessman paid $430million in 2004 to buy the team, Dodger Stadium and 250 acres of land that include the car parks, from the Fox division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, a sale that left the team with about $50million in cash. The Dodgers filed for bankruptcy protection in late June 2011, just days before the team was expected to miss payroll. McCourt finalized a deal with a group of investors to sell the Dodgers in March . Major investment: Frank McCourt paid $430million in 2004 to buy the team, Dodger Stadium and 250 acres of land . The filing came after baseball Commissioner Bud Selig refused to approve a 17-year agreement between the Dodgers and Fox's Prime Ticket subsidiary that would have been worth $2billion or more. Prior to their divorce, the McCourts had six homes and enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, paying a $225,000 monthly lease for a private jet and $10,000 a month for Jamie's hair stylist. They also spent tens of thousands of dollars on designer clothing and Frank once shelled out $80,000 on a Caribbean vacation.

Happier times: Los Angeles Dodger manager Joe Torre shakes hands with Dodger owner Frank McCourt . The McCourts announced in October 2009 that they would be ending their 30-year marriage - and Frank fired Jamie as CEO. The former couple continued their feud over the team’s ownership and then the MLB took control of the club's day-to-day operations in mid-April. The Dodgers filed for bankruptcy in June 2011 and lawyers for Jamie alleged that Frank was running the team into the ground. But Frank McCourt’s counsel claimed it was Jamie who was refusing to accept any settlements and was allowing the case to drag on. Comfortable living: This a Los Angeles property of Frank McCourt. The couple lived a lavish lifestyle, paying a $225,000 monthly lease for a private jet . The Dodgers blamed a cash-flow crisis on the MLB's refusal to pass the television deal that Frank was counting on to keep the team afloat. A judge ruled last December that a post-nuptial marital agreement that gave Frank sole ownership of the Dodgers was invalid. That allowed Jamie to seek half the team under California's community property law.","Frank and Jamie McCourt filed for divorce in 2010 after 30 years of marriage .

As tensions rise in the replacement referee debacle in the NFL, some comedians can't help but have a laugh at the expense of the NFL's inept officials. The videos have been tearing up the internet as uproar grows over the replacements and what has been seen by analysts and former players as unbelievable blown calls. One of them borrows the sample from Flo Rida's summer anthem Whistle, with a parody video of the same name. Scroll down for videos . YouTube sensation: Parodies like the 'Whistle' video, seen above, have been tearing up the internet as uproar grows over replacement referees and what has been seen as a series of blown calls . Poking fun: A 'referee' does a Major League Baseball 'safe' sign during a hilarious parody borrowing music from Flo Rida's 'Whistle' The lyrics go like this: 'Is it a fumble or a dropped pass/Is it cool to pull a facemask/It may take me a little longer/To get every call a little wronger.' The song is the latest catchy parody from Network of Champions (NOC), the same group that gave the world 'Call Me Lochte' (to the tune of Call Me Maybe) at the height of the Olympic rivalry between swimmers Ryan Lochte and Michael Phelps. And speaking of Call Me Maybe, the Carly Rae Jepsen tune is the basis for yet another song poking fun at the replacement refs. 'Call It Maybe' features the lyrics: 'Hey, I just met you/that play was crazy/what’s his number?/ I’ll call it maybe.' Says it all: Two replacement referees came up with two opposite calls after Seattle Seahawks receiver made a catch in the end zone Monday night. Most observers say a Green Bay defender had the ball first . Botched: The referee on the left called the play a touchdown for Seattle, even though most fans believe Green Bay had intercepted the ball. The ref on the right called for a stoppage of play . The song was written and performed by Seth Haake, and first played on the KFAN FM 100.3 in Minneapolis, Minnesota last week. Across the league, players admit the state of play has changed under the referees who aren't as observant and lack the authority of the full-time officials. The controversy appeared to hit its breaking point on Monday night, when the Seattle Seahawks beat the Green Bay Packers on the final play of the game that was highly questionable. Packers guard TJ Lang was especially furious, tweeting: 'Got f***ed by the refs.. Embarrassing. Thanks nfl' and 'F*** it NFL.. Fine me and use the money to pay the regular refs.' Fury: Denver Broncos coach John Fox screamed at officials last Monday when they wouldn't allow him to contest a penalty . 'These games are a joke,' Hall of Fame quarterback Troy Aikman tweeted. 'I love this league and love the game of football, but tonight’s debacle hurts me greatly. This is NOT the league we’re supposed to represent,' New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees wrote. Even President Obama took a break from his presidential duties to weigh in on the debate, saying via Twitter: 'NFL fans on both sides of the aisle hope the refs' lockout is settled soon.' The situation has gotten so bad that team coaches are also being hit with punishments over their response to what they perceive as a blown call. Broncos coach John Fox was fined $30,000 on Monday and defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio $25,000 for verbal abuse of the officials during a Monday night game against Atlanta on September 17. Outrage: Packers players surrounded a referee after they were 'robbed' of a victory against the Seahawks on Monday . Angry: Packers guard TJ Lang was not the only player who publicly complained about the replacement referees -- but he was likely to most explicit . More fines are likely for New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick and Redskins offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, and perhaps for others after a comedy of errors this past weekend. Fox and Del Rio were hit for their sideline histrionics, particularly when Fox was told he couldn't challenge a call of 12 men on the field - he was correct that he could challenge, although replays showed the Broncos were guilty. Before grabbing the arm of an official, Belichick wanted to know why Ravens kicker Justin Tucker's field goal was called good in Baltimore's 31-30 victory Sunday night. He couldn't tell from his angle on the sideline, Belichick claimed. 'So when the game was over, I went out and I was really looking for an explanation from the officials as to whether the play was under review,' he said, 'and I did try to get the official's attention as he was coming off the field to ask that, but I really wasn't able to do that.'

Multi-millionaire Ann Romney appeared on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno last night, professing her love for wholesale retailer Costco, gushing, 'we love Costco!' The wife of Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney told the NBC host that the pair regularly visits the chain, where customers can buy any number of products in bulk. She also said that the election of her husband, a Mormon, would signal that 'prejudices are left behind' just as the election of President Obama had done. Scroll down for video . Pride and prejudice: Ann Romney, who appeared Tuesday on the Tonight Show with host Jay Leno, said that having a Mormon president would signal that 'prejudices are left behind' Leather have it: Mrs Romney decided on an all-black leather ensemble with peep-toe heels . The mother-of-five took time out of her campaign schedule to speak with the late night talk show host, saying, ‘I love that we have the first African-American president.' Asked . by Leno to reflect on the significance of the first Mormon president, . Mrs Romney said she hoped that if her husband were elected, 'We would . see more of the same, that prejudices are left behind.' She had said at last month’s Republican National Convention that she had recently purchased an $18 three-pack of Costco Kirkland dress shirts, which Mr Romney wears ‘all the time now.’ Speaking at the RNC, she had said: ‘It’s great. You take a sharp right and you go way down to the back of the store and just shop the outside of the aisles, and boom, boom, boom.’ The Romneys have been criticised as elite. Recently released tax returns from 2011 showed that the couple earned $13.7million last year alone, mostly from investments. She first spoke of her harrowing ordeal last Friday, when the aircraft she was on filled with smoke. ‘I was just watching a movie, there was a lot of hustle and bustle,’ she said. Retail love: Mrs Romney told Leno that she and Mitt love shopping at Costco wholesale, a place that many associate with budget shopping . The plane’s pilot declared the electrical issue an emergency, and the plane was forced to land. Leno quipped: ‘Being a swing state, of course you picked Denver.’ He also asked about what her husband meant when he told reporters he didn’t know why plane windows didn’t open, which he said was dangerous, because ‘you can’t find any oxygen from outside the aircraft to get in the aircraft.’ Mrs Romney responded that his comment was a joke, and it was simply ‘his way of dealing with the panic.’ The conversation then inevitably segued into the leaked footage from a fundraising dinner, where Mr Romney said his job ‘is not to worry about’ the 47 per cent of Americans who don’t earn enough to pay income taxes and are likely to support President Obama come November. Emergency: Ann Romney, pictured on the campaign plane in August, had a dramatic landing on Friday after her aircraft caught fire . On the scene: The Romney campaign tweeted their thanks to fire crews who rushed to help them following the emergency landing in Denver . ‘Last week was not a good week,’ she said simply, smiling. ‘You try so hard to get your message out, you don’t like things to get misconceived – we care about the hundred per cent.’ She and Leno also touched on Mrs Romney’s own comments last week, where she told reporters at Radio Iowa, ‘Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it? Get in the ring.’ The grandmother shrugged it off and said, ‘It’s the ups and downs of the campaign.’ The interview took a decidedly more light-hearted feel from there, with Mrs Romney discussing how she and her husband met in high school. ‘We met at this party,’ she said, ‘and I will tell you, my heart was just like, womp-womp, womp-womp. I mean, for me, it was love at first sight. I think for him too.’ Leno inquired whether her husband has become a better dancer, leading into a clip of a man with Mr Romney’s face superimposed dancing Gangnam-style. During the interview, Mrs Romney also talked about her struggles with multiple sclerosis (MS), her love of Costco, and what her causes would be as first lady. Bargain hunter?

In recent weeks, Mitt Romney’s campaign has had to do significant damage control following the release of a leaked video. Now, a video from 2005, surfaced by Buzzfeed, shows another apparent gaffe from the then governor of Massachusetts. In the closing remarks while at the St. Patrick’s Day breakfast, the GOP hopeful said, ‘When I was a boy, I used to think that becoming rich and becoming famous would make me happy. Boy, was I right.’ Scroll down for video . Leaked: A video surfaced by Buzzfeed shows then-governor Mitt Romney, centre, speaking at a St Patrick's Day breakfast in 2005 . Conclusion: At the end, Mr Romney remarked: 'When I was a boy, I used to think that becoming rich and becoming famous would make me happy. Boy, was I right' Leaked: The video comes after Mother Jones leaked footage from an anonymous person who attended a fundraiser in Florida where Mr Romney said 47 per cent of Americans believed themselves to be 'entitled' The video was from a comedy breakfast on St. Patrick’s Day in 2005, showing a less-grey Romney, wearing a green tie and an Irish-themed boutonniere. According to a 2005 article from the Boston Globe, Mr Romney had joked with local politicians at the light-hearted breakfast, the Boston equivalent of the White House Correspondent’s Dinner. When Mr Romney said, ‘I’ll be here until you get funny,’ then-speaker and Democrat Salvatore DiMasi quipped back: ‘You being president of the United States. That’s a joke.’ While this clip is innocuous enough when viewed on its own, it adds to the pressure Mr Romney’s already facing over his newly-released 2011 tax returns, as well as the now-infamous leaked tape in which he said that 47 per cent was ‘dependent’ on the government and didn’t pay federal taxes. Mr Romney, flanked by vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, are campaigning in the crucial swing state of Ohio, where they are hoping to gain the necessary electoral college votes to secure the seat of the White House. Stumping: Mr Romney is in Ohio, and is pictured speaking during a campaign rally with running mate Rep. Paul Ryan, left, at Wright Brothers Aviation in Vandalia . Quiet time: Romney took a moment Tuesday on his campaign bus to sit in silence . According to Politico, new polling shows that President Obama is quickly gaining ground in the state, leading by eight per cent. On Wednesday, Mr Obama will visit the college towns of Kent and Bowling Green, and Romney's bus tour will stop in the Columbus, Cleveland and Toledo areas. Still, the Fox News poll suggests there's room for Romney to advance. Nearly one in three Ohio voters said they are 'not at all satisfied' with the way things are going in the country, and an additional 26 per cent are 'not very satisfied.' Only seven per cent are 'very satisfied,' and 34 per cent are 'somewhat satisfied.' Mr Romney is trying to tap that discontent. But he's having mixed success with his chief target: white, working-class voters who are socially conservative and often have union backgrounds. A generation ago they were called 'Reagan Democrats.' Showing support: Ohioans hold up signs as the plane of the Republican presidential candidate arrives at the rally . The Washington Post poll showed that 36 per cent of all Ohio voters said they had been contacted by the Obama campaign, and 29 per cent said they had heard from Romney's camp. Romney campaign political director Rich Beeson told reporters Tuesday that Romney's campaign has 40 offices in Ohio to Obama's 100, but he said Republicans are keeping pace. 'We have an equal number of contacts on the ground,' Mr Beeson said. He urged reporters and others to 'take into account the quality of the contacts, the number of contacts, not just the staff and offices.' Mr Beeson said Romney has one pitch for all of Ohio's voters: America can't afford four more years of Obama. 'We don't have to go in and package a message to different groups,' Mr Beeson said. Pro-Romney TV ads, however, target voters in the coal-rich eastern part of the state with spots criticizing Obama's environmental regulations affecting coal-fired power plants. And other Ohio working-class voters are courted in GOP ads saying Obama hasn't been tough enough on China's protection of its exporters.","GOP nominee said remarks as governor of Massachusetts during St Patrick's Day breakfast .

The Franco-German aerospace giant which plans to take over BAE Systems benefited from almost £56million of tax credits from the UK government – while paying just £10.5million in tax. This is despite EADS raking in more than £3billion in revenues from its British operations during 2010, according to corporate documents seen by the Daily Mail. They also reveal a complex global maze of 276 EADS offshoots, including a string of ventures based in tax havens, such as the Cayman Islands and Jersey. Peanuts to the Treasury: The Franco-German company attempting to take over BAE systems made £3bn in the UK during 2010, but paid just £10m in tax . EADS, whose headquarters are in the Netherlands, also runs subsidiaries in the low-tax Republic of Ireland. The firm, which employs 17,000 staff in Britain, is currently in talks over a  £31billion deal to merge with the former British Aerospace. The revelations have sparked fears that BAE’s contributions to Government coffers could dry up after it is folded into EADS, which owns Airbus. Tax accountant Richard Murphy said: ‘Here’s another example of a UK company fleeing our shores for foreign ownership with the inevitable consequence that less tax will be paid in the UK. ‘We’ll be paying for the fighter jets and they’ll be making no contribution. It’s time to change our tax system to make sure every company pays fair tax where it really earns its profits.’ 'Public purse could pay a massive price': EADS, whose headquarters are in the Netherlands, also benefited from almost £56million of tax credits from the UK . According to its own accounts, EADS carves up its operations into subsidiaries, with each one a separately registered company. It boasts 31 such operations in the UK – each one paying a different amount of tax. Some have not updated their records since 2010. If all of its British arms were put together, the company made a pre-tax loss of £166million during 2010 in the UK and received a tax credit of £46million. Some divisions paid no tax at all, while many of the others paid less than full corporation tax, which in 2010 was charged at 28 per cent. Documents filed at Companies House show that Airbus Operations Limited, its main UK division employing 10,000 workers, made a £206million loss in 2010 despite making sales of £2.4billion. The firm received a generous £56million in tax credits from the Chancellor, relating to a ‘deferred tax credit’. Other divisions paid just a tiny amount of tax. Predator: Inside the model of a jet for space tourism designed by EADS, which employs 17,000 staff in Britain and is in talks over a £31bn deal to merge with the former British Aerospace . One, Cimpa Limited, reported £5.5million in turnover and £66,000 in  profits. But it contributed a miserly £254 to the taxman – a tax rate of just 0.003 per cent and the same as anyone earning £7,745 in Britain during 2010. Another arm, Cassidian Test and Services Limited, made a pre-tax profit of £525,000 yet only paid £6,224 to HM Revenues & Customs. The EADS UK Limited division, which deals with offices and services, had revenues of £23million yet made a loss of £1.5million. It paid just £14,000 in tax during 2010 relating to a prior year. Other UK arms also saw vast  revenue streams evaporate into tiny profits. Further afield, the EADS has a string of operations based in the Cayman Islands, which is renowned for its status as a tax haven. It is not believed that EADS has any material operations – such as assembly plants, factories or research facilities – there. GMB union boss Jim Moohan . EADS has its corporate headquarters in Leiden in the Netherlands, despite being part-owned by the French, German and Spanish governments. It is not known whether the merged company, including BAE, would move its tax domicile there. BAE is currently registered in London. In most large companies, some offshoots pay tax, others do not and some receive tax credits or refunds from the government, so money flows both ways between the firm and the tax authorities. EADS has 31 UK subsidiaries but a number are holding companies and do not file accounts or pay tax. According to the latest figures available, firms based in the UK paid a total of just under £10.5million in corporation tax in 2010. But the largest British  business, loss-making Airbus Operations Limited, received a tax credit of £56million. Two military satellite subsidiaries received tax credits of just over £304,000. These credits far outweighed the payments made to the Exchequer, meaning that overall EADS’s UK operations were nearly £46million to the good in their dealings with HMRC. Painful reading: Documents filed at Companies House show that Airbus Operations Limited, EADS's main UK division employing 10,000 workers, made a £206m loss in 2010 despite making sales of £2.4bn . Jim Moohan, of the union GMB, who represents the engineering and shipbuilding industry in Scotland, said: ‘The public purse could pay a massive price. ‘We need proper sound judgment from all the political parties so that they look after the nation’s long-term interests. ‘Caution should certainly apply to where the company is registered, how it is controlled and the taxation aspects, as so much of the skills needed for the defence of our nation are tied up with this firm. ‘The fear of mergers is that there will be downsizing and the public purse might have to pick up the tab for lost jobs as well.’ Ian Waddell, Unite’s national officer for aerospace, said: ‘We believe all companies should pay their fair tax. This raises questions that need to be answered.’ A spokesman for EADS in the UK said: ‘We pay tax in accordance with the laws of the countries in which we operate.’ He added that the group has created 4,000 UK jobs since 2007 and is the largest exporter of commercial aircraft from Britain. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - . By . Tim Shipman, Deputy Political Editor . Wants merger: David Cameron has been dealt a serious blow in his attempt to see through the deal to merge BAE Systems with EADS after a revolt by shareholders . David Cameron’s hopes of pushing through Britain’s biggest defence deal were hit by a series of setbacks yesterday as anger spread about the threat to jobs and national security. Shareholders staged a revolt over  plans to merge BAE Systems with Franco-German aviation firm EADS, demanding a say over the deal. In a further blow, Labour politicians said they will not back the deal unless they receive reassurances that British BAE jobs are safe and a guarantee the US will not ditch its defence contracts. Senior government sources also warned  last night that No 10 will have to fight  proposals by France and Germany to grab a controlling interest in the new firm. The UK Shareholders’ Association has written open letters to BAE Systems chairman Dick Olver and Sir Peter Mason, its senior independent director, asking them to ensure that private investors in BAE can vote on the proposed merge. One MP in touch with the biggest personal shareholders said: ‘They don’t like the deal. They don’t see the logic of it.’ Eric Chalker, policy co-ordinator of the UKSA, added: ‘To listen to politicians, one might think this proposed merger will be decided by governments, as there has been almost no reference to shareholders – those who actually own the business.’ He said it was ‘shocking’ that many private shareholders who keep shares in ISAs and pension funds have no voting rights. Security fears: In a further blow, Labour has demanded reassurances that jobs will be safe at BAE, which makes the Typhoon Eurofighter jet (above) The Prime Minister is supportive of the merger and officials had hoped it will be approved in the next couple of weeks. But now the French and German governments want the right to buy shares in EADS - something which is unacceptable to Downing Street, the Department of Business and the Ministry of Defence. A No 10 source said: ‘We have very strict red lines and we aren’t coming off them.’ The Government is backing the deal because it will allow BAE to win a foothold in the lucrative European defence market and the civil aviation arena. Three sources in Germany familiar with the negotiations said last night that it was likely the deal would now collapse.","Franco-German firm EADS also took £56m in tax credits from Britain .

Israel faced being dragged into the Syrian civil war on Monday night after it destroyed an armoured vehicle of president Bashar Assad’s army. In the first direct confrontation between the countries since the uprising broke out, an Israeli tank scored a 'direct hit' in retaliation for mortar shells that have landed on Israeli-held territory. Israel has tried to avoid getting sucked into the conflict, but it has grown increasingly worried after a series of stray mortars have struck territory in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights. Direct hit: An armoured vehicle belonging to Bashar Assad's army (not pictured) was destroyed by Israel in retaliation . Israeli military officials say they believe the mortar fire is spillover from intense fighting near the frontier between the Syrian army and rebel forces trying to oust Assad, and not an overt attempt to hit the Jewish state. But a senior Israeli official said Israel is starting to question that assessment. 'We thought it was spillover, but today we’re not sure,' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because the issue is still being debated among intelligence commanders. Syria’s civil war also shook the country’s northern neighbour Turkey, after a Syrian fighter jet bombed a rebel-held area near the frontier, killing at least six people, a Turkish official said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media. Israeli officials have long feared that . the embattled Assad might try to draw Israel into the fighting in an act . of desperation. Close to the edge: Residents of the Syrian town of Ras al-Ain run as smoke rises after an air strike on the town, just metres from the Turkish frontier . In a statement, the military said Israeli tanks targeted the 'source of fire' in Syria after the mortar shell landed in an open area of the Golan Heights. It confirmed 'direct hits' on the targets. Israeli military officials, speaking on condition of anonymity under army guidelines, said an armoured vehicle carrying 'Syrian mobile artillery' was hit. There was no immediate word on casualties on the Syrian side, but Israeli officials said the vehicle was believed to belong to the Syrian government. Set to continue: Israel promised greater force would be used if attacks on their men persist . A number of mortar shells have landed in the Golan over the past week, and early this month, Syrian tanks accidentally crossed into a buffer zone along the frontier of the Golan for the first time in nearly 40 years. Israel captured the Golan, a strategic plateau, from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war and subsequently annexed it. After weeks of standing still, Israel responded for the first time on Sunday, firing what it called a 'warning shot' into Syria after another mortar shell strayed across the frontier and landed near an Israeli military post. Israel also warned of a tougher response if the attacks persisted.","Israel have tried to avoid the conflict but retaliated to mortar attack with 'direct hit' on vehicle .

Rail passengers face fare rises of up to 11 per cent next year after a higher-than-expected jump in the inflation rate. The increases will add hundreds of pounds to annual season tickets, with some commuters seeing season ticket fares to London crash through the £6,000 barrier. And there is no end in sight to the inflation-busting hikes, as ministers admitted they will continue every year until at least 2015. Scroll down for video . Shock rise: This graph plotting rates of inflation month by month for the past two years shows how both CPI and RPI inflation were falling - until July . Rail passengers will be hit with another big increase on fares, this time as much as 11 per cent . Train company bosses, whose firms will . pocket much of the extra cash, passed the buck by insisting it was not . their decision to hike the fares – it was government policy. From next January 1, train firms can . raise their ‘regulated’ fares – which include rush-hour commuter travel, . season tickets and off-peak fares – by three percentage points more . than the RPI inflation figure for July, which was revealed yesterday as . 3.2 per cent. That means commuter and other . ‘regulated’ fares will be allowed to rise by 6.2 per cent. But the . companies also have the flexibility to add another 5 per cent to respond . to changes in demand for particular services – meaning some fares could . rise by 11.2 per cent. If they do so, they will have to make fare cuts elsewhere in compensation. Ministers said the extra cash from fare-payers was needed to fund billions of pounds of rail investment. But passenger groups, campaigners and unions said it was a ‘rip-off’ and yet another ‘Great Train Robbery’ that would benefit only rail bosses and their bonus pots at the expense of hard-pressed travellers and commuters. Rail fares have risen by more than inflation every year for the past ten years. Rail passenger groups, transport campaigners and unions yesterday held protests at more than 40 stations. They called on Transport Secretary Justine Greening to rein back on the rises, which come at a time when Britain has some of the highest fares in Europe and when passengers spend up to 15 per cent of their income on commuting. The Campaign for Better Transport said commuters from Ashford International in Kent could see their annual fare rise to £4,872 from next year, a £284 increase. Those commuting from Bournemouth face a £356 rise to £6,104. A season ticket from Manchester to Liverpool will increase by £167 to £2,855; Newcastle to York will rise by £331 to £5,663; Bristol to Swindon will go up by £183 to £3,127; and Leeds to Sheffield by £133 to £2,281. By 2015 the annual cost of commuting to London from Birmingham will have soared from £9,004 to £10,663, which accounts for 28 per cent of the average London salary, says the campaign group. 'Cut rail fares, not rail staff': Protesters at Waterloo Station this morning hold a banner as part of a demonstration against the continued hikes in rail fares . The group’s chief executive Stephen . Joseph said: ‘If the Government sticks by its policy, rail fares will . rise three times faster than salaries. With the economy flat-lining, . this is untenable. Our railways need to be affordable to ordinary . people, not just “train-toffs” on high incomes.’ Miss . Greening said she would try to persuade the Chancellor to cut the . ‘inflation plus 3 per cent’ formula down to ‘inflation plus 1 per cent’ for the next two years. Treasury sources indicated last night that there . was no scope to make the cut. Bob Crow, leader of the Rail Maritime and Transport union, said: ‘This is a bigger rip-off than the Great Train Robbery. ‘This money will not be invested back in services, it will be trousered by the greedy train operators.’ Michael . Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating . Companies, said: ‘The Government decides the average increase of . commuter ticket prices and other regulated fares which train companies . will be required to introduce in January.’ The . row comes as Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Rail Group is expected to . lose its franchise to run the West Coast mainline to arch-rival First .

A teenage assassin who murdered a 15-year-old girl for just £16 over an argument on Facebook could face just one year behind bars. Joyce Winsie Hau was stabbed to death at her home in Rotterdam, Holland by the 15-year-old boy, identified only as ‘Jinhua K’, who was sent to kill her by her best friend and her boyfriend in January. In what has become known as the ‘Facebook murder’, Joyce had allegedly gossiped about the sexual escapades of her friend ‘Polly W’, 16, on Facebook and other social media. 'Facebook murder': 15-year-old Joyce Winsie Hau was stabbed to death by a 15-year-old boy hired by her best friend because Joyce was posting comments about her sexual escapades on Facebook . Polly conspired with her boyfriend ‘Wesley C’ to kill her friend as revenge. Holland’s Chinese-Dutch community has been left shocked by the gruesome crime and the country is questioning how young teenagers are capable of such violence and brutality. Jinhua appeared in court on Tuesday where the prosecutor is seeking one year imprisonment for him followed by involuntary juvenile commitment. In Holland, 12 months is the maximum sentence for juveniles between 12 and 16. The pair hired Jinhua to carry out the crime for a sum of money, reportedly £16 and the promise to pay for drinks when he went out. According to the Dutch Justice Ministry, the offenders spent weeks planning their plot, communicating with the assassin and providing him with information about Joyce including her address and when she would be home. In convincing the assassin to go ahead with the plan, Polly and Wesley allegedly threatened to kill him if he did not complete their mission. Jinhua told judges that he was ‘enormously sorry’ for murdering Joyce. In a letter to the judge, Joyce’s father Chun Nam Hau wrote: ‘I ask myself every day how these people could have killed her just because of a dispute. ‘I notice that children are becoming more and more violent. They’re not respectful. They don’t think about others.’ Planned murder: 'Polly W' got so angry with Joyce's Facebook comments about her she planned Joyce's murder for weeks with her boyfriend 'Wesley C' The father’s plea has highlighted the question of whether the police and social services are doing enough to prevent teenage violence, putting it on the political agenda for the upcoming general election on September 12. Director of charity My Child Online, Remco Pijpers said it was unreasonable to label Facebook as part of the crime because it suggests that the social networking site was in some way at fault. He said: ‘Facebook may have been involved in this particular case, but in reality this was a case of bullying on the internet. It could have happened anywhere. ‘Parents need to be aware that it is very hard for teenagers if derogatory things are said about them in front of their friends. ‘This is an opportunity for parents to talk about it to their children.’ Jihua’s court case comes as three teenage boys, two aged 14 and the other 15, were arrested in connection with the death of a 17-year-old girl who went missing earlier this month. Sehriban Akpinar was also found dead with multiple stab wounds in bushes in Rotterdam after she was last seen riding her bike. Reportedly her throat had also been cut.","Joyce Winsie Hau, 15, was stabbed to death in her home .

Promise: Ed Miliband claims he will force big energy companies to pass on price cuts to customers . Labour leader Ed Miliband will pledge today to crackdown on profiteering energy companies as millions of families face soaring gas and electricity bills this winter. The firms are reportedly preparing to boost profits from households from £45 to £65 - a jump of almost 50 per cent. But they will be forced to pass on price cuts to customers by an incoming Labour government, Mr Miliband will tell a gathering of voters in Manchester. He intends to axe the regulator Ofgem and introduce a new watchdog to order energy giants to reduce their prices. He is quoted in the Daily Telegraph: 'The current system of regulation is not working. We'll rip it up to stop you getting ripped off. 'We will make sure that when the big companies pay less for the power they buy, you pay less for the energy you buy.' Five million households will be affected by last month's announcement from SSE that prices will rise by 9 per cent for a typical duel fuel bill. This will mean an increase from £1,172 to £1,274. British Gas  -one of the 'big six' energy companies - has told 10 million households that their bills could go up by as much as £100 next year. Within the new few weeks other suppliers are expected to follow their lead as experts predict the average energy bills could hit a record £1,428 next year. Warning: British Gas has told 10 million households their energy bills could jump £100 next year . Mr Miliband will tell voters: 'You know what it’s like when the envelope hits the doormat with the gas bill or the electricity bill. 'The companies know you can’t choose not to pay it. They are making us pay more than we should.' At this week's party conference, shadow energy . secretary Caroline Flint will formally launch Labour plans to . organise mass bargaining for energy bills. In an hour-long question and answer session this afternoon, Mr Miliband will also appeal for voters to give him a chance to 'rebuild Britain'. Poll winner: David Miliband is more popular than his brother, according to a Tory survey . He will seek to show he could govern the country more fairly by unveiling consumer-friendly policies. Although Labour has been riding high in the opinion polls, the leader is under pressure to improve stubbornly poor personal ratings. The Tories have highlighted the problem by releasing Populus research that found nearly two-thirds of Labour supporters would prefer Mr Miliband’s brother David in charge. Some 73 per cent of those questioned agreed that Mr Miliband did not have what it takes to be prime minister in tough economic times, and 72 per cent that he was too weak for the job. Mr Miliband will blame David Cameron and the coalition for destroying people’s trust in politicians, but admit that the challenges are 'severe'. 'Whoever wins the next election will be faced with a huge deficit,' Mr Miliband is expected to say. 'If it is a Labour government we will have to make difficult decisions. We will not be able to reverse all the cuts. 'We will take decisions about priorities like putting jobs ahead of pay rises. But don’t believe those who say that all politicians are the same. Because our decisions will be different. 'We would always put the interests of millions of working people ahead of tax cuts for millionaires,'Insisting Labour is 'on your side'. He will also propose capping pension fund management fees, amid complaints that people saving for their retirement are being ripped off. Accusing the coalition of failing to protect pensioners, Mr Miliband will say: 'Millions of working people are doing the right thing and putting money aside. 'The least they expect is for it to be there for them when they retire. But too often people are finding there is much less in the pot than they expected. Policies: Labour's Liam Byrne will unveil a youth jobs initiative and Harriet Harman is looking at discrimination against women with the help of TV celebrities Arlene Phillips and Miriam O'Reilly who were dropped by the BBC . 'What’s been happening is while you were saving, the company which was supposed to be helping you, the company you trusted, has actually been taking thousands of pounds out in hidden fees and charges.' The SwitchTogether scheme has been hailed as proof that Labour can be a 'positive force for change' even out of government. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Liam Byrne is announcing a Youth Employment Taskforce, a network designed to help more young people find work and monitor the impact of coalition policies. The party is also creating a new 'policy hub' to widen involvement. Activists and the general public will be able to post responses to party policy documents. Meanwhile, deputy leader Harriet Harman has brought in former Countryfile presenter Miriam O’Reilly and former Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips to look at the issue of discrimination against older women. The TV celebrities - both famously dropped by the BBC - will help draw up proposals for preventing ageism and sexism and consider whether legislation is necessary.","'The system isn't working...we'll rip it up to stop you getting ripped off'

Toyota is recalling 75,000 vehicles in Britain because of a steering wheel fault which could result in a ‘loss of steering ability’ affecting 2.7 million cars worldwide. Part of the lower steering column innards near the driver’s knee may ‘deform’ under certain conditions, said Toyota. The UK recall affects the best-selling petrol-electric hybrid Prius, Corolla, and British-built Avensis  models, though globally some nine models are affected. Recall: Around 2.7 million Toyotas have been recalled worldwide, including the popular Avensis (pictured) Concerns: A total of nine models have been recalled worldwide, including the Prius (pictured) all of which were built between August 2000 and April 2009 . Safety: Toyota insists the problem thought to be affecting some of the vehicles - including Corolla models (pictured) is not a safety risk . The steering-wheel fault can lead to ‘a reduction in steering  response’ and a ‘loss of steering ability’, said Toyota which insisted no accidents had yet been reported. The Avensis is built at Burnaston in Derbyshire. The recalls follow nine complaints across Europe about faulty  steering and three reported cases of separate water-pump problems which are specific to the Prius hybrids alone. It is the latest in a long line of Toyota recalls and comes just four weeks after the firm recalled more than seven million vehicles worldwide, including some Corolla and Camry models, over faulty window switches. Toyota GB said it had registered recalls for certain Avensis and Corolla models (July 2001 to March 2009) and for Prius (July 2003 to April 2009) with the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA). All models are ‘previous generation’ and not new models currently on sale, it said. The models affected were built between August 2000 and April 2009 according to Toyota. The 'hybrid vehicles' may have problems with their water pumps while the other cars affected could have faults with their steering columns. The models affected in the UK are the best-selling Avensis, Prius and Corolla. Other hybrid models affected worldwide include the Crown Sedan, the Estima and the Alphard. The popular Isis, Corolla Runx, Corolla Alex, Corolla Spacio, Corolla Fielder, the Wish and the Will VS have also been called in by the the car giant. Setting out the problem, Toyota GB said: ‘On certain Avensis, Corolla and Prius models (July 2001 to April 2009) there is a possibility of an issue with a component in the steering system, prompting a  knocking or rattling and possibly a reduction in steering response.' Components called ‘splines’ – a form . of tubular locking device - which ‘connect the extension shaft to the . steering gearbox may deform if the steering wheel is frequently and . forcefully while . driving at slow speeds. Toyota . says affected vehicles 'remain safe to drive' - and that there have . been no reports of accidents caused by the problem. Nine cases of the . problem have been reported in Europe. Toyota dealers will carry out inspections to see if parts need to be replaced - which will take around an hour. Explaining the technical problem with the faulty steering, Toyota said there was ‘insufficient hardness of the steering shaft’. ‘This deformation may create increased internal clearance and the splines may eventually, over time, wear out.’ Japanese executives said this ‘could result in loss of steering ability.’ Toyota dealers will inspect the extension shaft to determine if it needs to be replaced and, if confirmed, will replace it. The inspection and repair will take approximately one hour. On the water pump fault affecting only the Prius, Toyota said:’ There is an electrically driven water pump that circulates coolant through  the  hybrid  components. There is a possibility that the electric motor  installed  in  the  water  pump  may  stop  functioning, leading to illumination of various warning lights in the instrument panel. In limited instances, the water pump electric  power supply circuit fuse may open causing the hybrid system to stop while the vehicle is being driven.’ ‘Should  this happen it will be indicated by a warning light being illuminated on the dashboard.’ It noted: ‘It is possible that some Prius will require attention for both issues.’ Toyota GB  said: ‘Customer  satisfaction  is of paramount importance to Toyota. Consequently, Toyota  has decided to conduct recall activity to replace the hybrid system water pump and check steering shaft performance on the affected cars.’ Checks: The affected Toyotas will be checked for the problem at official dealerships (file picture) Toyota GB said it will contact the . owners of all affected vehicles within the next six weeks, asking them . to make an appointment to bring their car to their nearest Toyota . dealer. Dealers . will replace the hybrid system water pump and/or inspect the steering . shaft: ‘If the steering shaft does not meet Toyota inspection criteria, . it will be repaired.’ It said the water pump replacement ‘should take no more than an hour-and-a-half’. If required, the steering shaft repair should be completed in an hour. This work will be carried out free of charge. Owners are being directed to the Toyota GB web site (www.toyota.co.uk)  where they can check their   registration number and VIN  numbers to see if  their  vehicle is within the affected range of production. Toyota is Japan's biggest carmaker and for a period became the world’s biggest. British made: The Avensis is made at Toyota's assembly plant in Burnaston, Derbyshire (pictured) But experts say that dash for growth led to Toyota ‘taking its eye off the ball’ in terms of quality – something on which the Japanese car-maker had established a reputation so strong its ethos was taught in business schools – the ‘Toyota Way’. Toyota's latest announcement pushes the number of recalls this year to more than 10 million, not far short of the number recalled in 2009 and 2010 over floormat and accelerator pedal issues. That recall involved more than  12 million vehicles and led to  fines from US regulators and reputational damage for Toyota whose sales suffered badly. The Japanese carmaker is still trying to rebuild its reputation and regain customer trust after that fiasco, which saw the firm's head apologising to consumers. But its efforts to do so have been dealt a blow over the past few weeks, as it has announced recalls totalling nearly 10 million vehicles. However, some analysts said that while the latest recalls, which are voluntary, were a setback, they might not cause as much damage to its reputation as the ones in 2009. Koichi Sugimoto, a motor industry analyst with BNP Paribas in Tokyo said: 'Nobody is perfect. Vehicles nowadays are very complicated. The company is taking appropriate measures to fix the problems, so I don't think this will cause significant damage to Toyota's reputation.' But critics say Toyota's image as a producer of high quality cars has nevertheless been dented once again.","Recall affects nine models including best-selling Pirus, Corolla and Prius .

More than one million motorists from around the world have exchanged their foreign licences for a British one in the last 15 years, it emerged today. According the figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the number of licences exchanged per year . peaked at 96,935 in 2007, before falling to 79,187 in 2009. Over the . past three years, the number has risen steadily once again, reaching . 83,553 in 2011. Currently, the UK recognises the driving licences awarded to drivers by 50 . other countries, meaning they . can be exchanged after 12 months of residency for a UK licence without . the holder needing to pass any UK test. Drivers from 50 countries can exchange their licence for a British one after 12 months without taking a test . Almost half of the licences swapped . since 1997 have been gained in a country where the driving test doesn't . include driving on the left. Robin Reames, chief claims officer at . swiftcover.com which uncovered the figures, said: 'These figures reflect Britain's . multi-cultural society demonstrating that we are welcoming an increasing . number of motorists to our shores who are choosing to live and drive . here. 'However, UK roads are very different to those overseas so it's . vital that new motorists learn as much as they can, which could include . taking a few lessons from an instructor if necessary.' Since 1997, drivers from South Africa and Australia accounted for the highest number of licences exchanged with 149,897 and . 103,053 respectively. However, as more countries entered the EU in 2004, . allowing licences to be exchanged from eastern European countries, . Polish (135,079 – average of 8,442 per year), Bulgarian (18,719) and . Hungarian (21,714) motorists are actively exchanging their licences. About 88,000 Polish drivers exchanged their licence for a UK version in the . five years between 2004 and 2008. The data goes on to show that on . average each year since 1997, 2,334 drivers exchanged Japanese licences for UK one. Figures also show . 2,895 drivers exchanged Hong Kong licences and 836 drivers exchanged . South Korean licences for full British permits. Research carried out by the BBC earlier this year highlighted a scam where drivers obtained a UK driving . licence by exploiting the arrangement that the UK has with Hong Kong – . which saw more than 6,000 exchanged every year for the past five years, . even though the average is much lower. Agreements also exist with some African . countries. Around 950 Zimbabwean licences were exchanged in 2011, down from . 1,282 in 2010 and a peak of 6,168 in 2002. Nearly half of the licences exchanged since 1997 are from countries where the test does not require driving on the left hand lane . The UK's agreement with Kenya . was suspended in 2002 then later reinstated, resulting in 242 Kenyan . licences being exchanged in the early part of 2012. Robin Reames added: 'While the fact . that the UK recognises licences issued in certain countries shows that . driving tests in those countries are likely to be of a high standard, . it's important to recognise that driving in the UK is unique in many . ways. 'As such, it's important for everyone planning to drive in the UK . to take the time to become familiar with UK road signs and speed limits, . as well as driver etiquette – exactly as British motorists should when . driving abroad.' Nick Perry, driving instructor at . Bristol-based Oasis Driving School, commented: 'People who learned to . drive abroad will often face difficulties driving in the UK. 'The obvious . differences include driving on a different side of the road and new . signs and speed limits, but there are also more subtle differences such . as etiquette on the road that seem obvious to us, but are extremely . important. 'I've taught a range of drivers who have originally learned . to drive outside the UK, some of whom have settled in with no problems . and others who've needed a little help. 'It's a good idea for anyone new . to UK roads to take a short lesson or two with an approved driving . instructor in order to be on the safe side.'","Around 80,000 licences exchanged in 2011 alone, three times the amount exchanged 15 years ago .
South African, Polish and Australian drivers account for highest number of licence exchanges since 1997 .
UK licence exchanging has almost doubled in past ten years – up 37,057 since 2001 ."

This is the dramatic moment when a drunk driver's car barrel-rolled through the air, demolished a wall and landed right way up on a garden lawn. CCTV footage from a neighbouring house captured the incredible crash of Eliot Nutt’s blue Peugeot 206 after he lost control following a night out drinking. The 20-year-old, who walked away amazingly uninjured, was found to be almost twice the legal drink-drive limit when he crashed his car in Marlow, Berkshire, magistrates heard today. Scroll down for video . Airborne automobile: Eliot Nutt's incredible crash, where he ran into a garden wall and flipped his car just outside a house, was captured on CCTV . Safe landing: After smashing through two garden walls and flipping, the Peugeot 206 incredibly landed right way up and Nutt was amazingly uninjured . The footage shows an approaching car breaking hard as the driver sees Nutt’s car travelling toward him. Moments later Nutt's Peugeot swerves and the bonnet ploughs into a garden wall before flipping and smashing into another wall and landing right way up. Severe swerve: A car was seen breaking (far right) as Nutt's car swerves and ploughs into the garden wall after dropping his friends off after a night drinking . Drink-driving: Nutt's car then becomes airborne in the crash in which he admitted a single charge of drinking excess alcohol . Not okay: Nutt said in court today that he thought he was okay to drive 'but clearly I wasn't'. He told police at the time that he had his last drink at 11pm .

"The speech has drawn angry criticism from former pupils and governors who have come forward to defend their school . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 06:35 EST, 25 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 19:22 EST, 25 October 2012 . When Fiona Phillips was invited to a ceremony at her former secondary school, organisers expected the usual speech full of fond reminiscences and messages about the value of hard work. They got quite the opposite. The 51-year-old TV presenter bitterly accused Millbrook Community School in Southampton of crushing her aspirations and turning her into a ‘vile teenager’ who was arrested for shoplifting. Miss Phillips claimed that before leaving with one O-level she expressed a desire to become a doctor but was asked by teachers: ‘Have you thought about hairdressing?’ Scroll down to watch Fiona's speech . Rant: Fiona Phillips slammed the education she received at Millbrook School in Southampton when she was invited to be a guest speaker at a ceremony celebrating their rebranding as an Academy . She described then headmaster Fred Lowry as a man who ‘commanded no respect whatsoever’. And she recalled how she and her classmates locked a teacher in a cupboard and threw another over a bush. Miss Phillips, the former anchorwoman . with GMTV, was born in Canterbury where her parents ran a pub but moved . to Southampton after primary school. Blame: The TV presenter said the school turned her into a 'vile' shopping-lifting teenager . She delivered her broadside at a ceremony rebranding Millbrook as the £16million Oasis Academy Lord’s Hill. ‘It was a school rampant with hormones and no discipline, no aspiration and no encouragement,’ she said. ‘I can remember being in classes . throwing furniture around. We locked a fashion teacher in a cupboard and . threw one over a bush, and that was normal behaviour. ‘My mother was in despair because I . was so vile to her. They used to come and pick me up from the police . station after I had been caught for shoplifting. I was in fights after . school – I won’t even go into what else went on.’ She said her mother could not believe that her conscientious daughter had ‘turned into this vile teenager’. ‘I left with one O-level in English language, purely because I read a lot and all my education came from home.’ Miss Phillips said she had left primary school at the ‘top of her class’ and her arrival at Millbrook had been an ‘eye-opener’. Guest speaker: Fiona Phillips with founder of the Oasis Trust, Steve Chalke, left, and principal Ian Golding. She left many outraged by the content of her speech . Back in time: Fiona Phillips aged 14 . She went on to say the teaching staff did ‘nothing’ to shore up educational standards. ‘I’m proud to say I went to Millbrook . School. I’m not proud of the education I had there.’ She added that she . was angry the Millbrook area had seen ‘hardly any investment in nearly . half a century’. Her harsh remarks upset many of those . connected with the school. A contemporary of hers said: ‘There was . nothing wrong with the school nor the pupils who worked hard at their . education. Perhaps if she had not spent so much time throwing furniture . and teachers around she may have got more out of her time there. I left . with seven O-levels. I went to college and worked for my A-levels and . went to university and worked for my degree. ‘I know from personal experience that . many of my fellow Millbrook pupils did the same – more than the . national average for the time.’ Retired former headmaster Mr Lowry, . now 85 and living in Ashurst, Hampshire, declined to comment on Miss . Phillips’s accusations. But the Mayor of Southampton, Derek . Burke, a former governor of Millbrook, accused her of ‘dramatic . licence’, saying it ‘wasn’t nearly as bad as she painted it’. Innocence lost: A young Fiona with her brother Mark in 1969. She said her secondary school transformed her from a promising pupil into a vile teen . 'Not proud of the educuation I had there': The TV presenter was invited to celebrate the opening of the school's new building, pictured, and used it as an opportunity to criticise her time at the school in the 70s . Attack: Fiona branded her former head, Fred Lowry, pictured, a man who 'commanded no respect whatsoever' Of Mr Lowry, he said: ‘I knew Fred. He was a good head teacher of the school. I believe he had respect.’ He added that his own daughters had attended the school and, along with their classmates, achieved success in GCSEs. Don Thomas, a councillor, said: ‘It’s . not appropriate for her to be criticising a former local-authority . school which did a good job in difficult circumstances.’ He said he had been contacted by one resident who was very angry at Miss Phillips’s outburst. ‘They were upset at Millbrook being badmouthed. They said it was a good school and they were proud to go to it.’ In the 1970s and 80s, Millbrook was . one of the largest schools in Southampton with more than 1,200 pupils. After leaving, Miss Phillips worked for a short time at Mr Kipling’s . bakery in Eastleigh, but decided to give education another try and . gained a BA in English at Birmingham Polytechnic. She began her . journalistic career at independent local radio stations in Sussex. Success: Fiona went on to be a presenter on GMTV and is pictured here interviewing Tony Blair when he was the Prime Minister . Fiona Phillips talked about her 'lack of education' at her secondary school in her biography, Before I Forget, published in 2010... 'I found myself dealing with 12-year-olds who had talked about things I didn’t even know the name of. Girls in the fifth year were pregnant, boys were in borstal, and the school seemed to be a hotbed of carnal curiosity and knowledge,' she wrote.'I was in the top set for everything, but that didn’t mean much in a school that struggled so much with discipline and lack of ambition. We were supposedly the elite of the school, yet our maths classes consisted of being given an exercise book and told which pages to work on, before the teacher left and returned at the end of the lesson to go through the answers, when she hadn’t explained how to tackle the questions in the first place.'There wasn’t much point in trying to learn when most of the pupils were set against it and their parents didn’t care.'","TV presenter said teachers at .

"By . William Cook . PUBLISHED: . 07:59 EST, 9 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:01 EST, 9 November 2012 . A teenage motorcyclist who killed an Olympics engineer when he did a 60mph wheelie into his car has been locked up for almost five years. Ryan Birkett, 16 at the time, was ‘showing off’ on the stolen Triumph Sprint ST 955CC at more than twice the 30mph speed limit. He had never taken a motorcycle test. Birkett failed to brake and smashed into a Peugeot 206 at a junction, injuring driver Bradley White and killing passenger Peter Tickner. Peter Tickner (left) died instantly when Ryan Birkett (right) hit the car he was travelling in on a stolen motorbike . Mr Tickner, 23, was a childhood friend of Mr White and had helped set up CCTV cameras for the London Olympic Games. He died immediately when the bike completely embedded into the car, causing the door to buckle outwards and rip off the hinges, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Mr White, now also 23, suffered serious internal injuries including broken ribs. He was hospitalised for four days after the smash, said prosecutor Jocelyn Leward. Birkett, now 17, has numerous previous convictions including driving without insurance or a licence in 2010. He was on bail for robbery at the time of the smash. The construction worker broke his back and suffered nerve damage to his left arm, which is now partially paralysed. The bike had been stolen from Barking and Dagenham College just hours before the collision, which happened as Mr White was turning right into Starmans Close from Goresbrook Road, Dagenham - a road notorious for accidents. Carolina Guiloff, defending, suggested that Mr White, who has a clean licence, may have contributed to the likelihood of the crash by failing to look as he was turning into Starmans Close. Black spot: Bradley White was turning right from Goresbrook Road into Starmans Close when the stolen motorbike ridden by Birkett hit the left side of the car, killing passenger Peter Tickner . But traffic collision experts agreed that ‘excessive speed’ was the primary cause of the smash and there was no evidence that Mr White did not look properly, the court heard. Ms Guiloff added that Birkett was deeply remorseful and wished to apologise to the families of Mr Tickner and Mr White. Sentencing Birkett to 56 months in a Young Offenders’ centre, Judge Nigel Peters QC said: ‘You were no doubt showing off to your friends and seeking simply to drive dangerously. ‘The Crown cannot say if it was you who stole the bike but it must have been obvious as it had no key . ‘The evidence that has been put before me is that you rode at an excessive speed then crashed into the side of the Peugeot driven by Bradley White. ‘Tragically in the passenger seat was young Peter Tickner. Mother Dee Tickner, pictured with her son, said her world had been 'turned upside-down' by his death . ‘Nothing said in this court can be of any assistance to the mother of Peter who sits in court and has suffered gravely and continues to suffer as a result of what happened. ‘This most horrific tragedy will be with her forever and the sentence I am obliged to pass can never deal with her grief. ‘The crash, it seems to me, occurred because you were driving a powerful bike without experience in a built up area at a greatly excessive speed.’ Judge Peters also banned Birkett from the road for six years and ordered that he must take an extended driving test. Speaking outside the court, Mr Tickner’s mother, Dee, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, told how her son and his two sisters, Karol, 26, and Laura, 27, were her ‘little miracles’. ‘My son had everything to live for. He was at a stage in his life where he was extremely happy,’ she said. ‘He had a very good job as an engineer working at the Olympics and he loved his girlfriend, Nancy, to bits. ‘I knew from speaking to him the day before that he felt she was the one. ‘Every single day of his life, my son would never go out of the house without telling me how much he loved me and I have got those memories. ‘I had an incredibly difficult time having children and each one is a miracle. ‘Peter loved us all so much. Just before this happened, I felt everything was coming together, despite me being so ill. ‘In that morning, when he got up, he had no idea that his life was going to end that day.’ Ms Tickner, who lives moments away from the crash scene in Starmans Close, told how the family are constantly reminded of their loss. Speaking about Birkett’s sentence, Ms Tickner added: 'It is far better than we expected, the judge did us proud and went as far as he could go. ‘Justice has been done as far as the courts are concerned. Justice for Peter will be if that lad comes out and is a good person, and learns from what happened.’ ‘To this day, Bradley will always be heartbroken. Bradley and Peter grew up together and went to school together. ‘He had a huge number of friends, more than 250 people attended his funeral. ‘He was the kind of boy you couldn’t help but smile, he was cheeky, a lad that people loved. ‘Often people would say to me “You have done well, he is a cracking lad.” ‘Our world was turned upside down that day and there is a hole which can never be filled.’ In memory of Mr Tickner, his family and friends have so far raised £4,000 for road safety charity Brake. Birkett, of Dagenham, east London, admitted death by dangerous driving and causing aggravated vehicle taking. Judge Peters allowed Birkett's name to be publicised, despite his age, 'to discourage others who may feel the need to ride powerful bikes in built up areas'.","Ryan Birkett, 16, smashed into car at a junction in Dagenham, east London .

As a comedian, he should probably have learnt when to give up on a joke. But instead of making amends for his jibe about Hillsborough, Alan Davies has dug himself in deeper – by joking that he wanted to dress up as a ‘comedy Scouser’. The 46-year-old received death threats after he mocked Liverpool Football Club’s refusal to play on the anniversary of the 1989 disaster, out of respect for the 96 fans who died. He apologised for the remarks – only to aggravate the situation yesterday by poking fun at Liverpudlians. Risk: Despite enduring a barrage of insults and death threats, Alan Davies joked on Twitter about disguising himself in a costume (right) inspired by Harry Enfield's Liverpudlian stereotypes . Critics have accused Davies of deliberately making the controversial remarks to create ‘free publicity’ as he prepares to go on tour for the first time in 12 years. After receiving a barrage of abuse on Twitter for the comments he made about Hillsborough on Tuesday, he wrote yesterday: ‘Going out later. I’ve decided to get a disguise.’ He then posted a link to a fancy dress costume of a ‘comedy Scouser’ including a 1980s shell suit, permed wig and bushy moustache. The £33.98 ensemble is modelled on a sketch from television show Harry Enfield and Chums, in which caricatured Liverpudlians use stereotypical phrases such as ‘Eh, eh!’ and ‘Calm down, calm down!’ But his joke certainly did not have a calming effect on the Hillsborough furore. Russ McNally said it was wrong to apologise and then ‘reply with this stereotypical jibe’, while Megan Worrall said, ‘That really isn’t funny. You’re digging a hole. Why mock others’ right to commemorate tragedy. #noheart.’ Lia Kelly wrote: ‘Digging a hole so deep he’s en route to China.’ On The Tuesday Club football podcast, Davies ranted about Liverpool’s insistence on playing Merseyside rivals Everton in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday, rather than on the anniversary of Hillsborough the following day, April 15.

Do Rangers play on the date when all their fans died in that disaster whatever year that was – 1971?’ He received a furious backlash on Twitter, including dozens of death threats. The comic is due to appear at the Liverpool Empire Theatre on September 23 as part of his Life is Pain tour – his first stand-up dates for 12 years.

Former Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson stood to profit from Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB takeover through shares he held in News Corporation, it had been claimed. Mr Coulson is understood to have been awarded the stock in the U.S. company when he resigned as News of the World editor in 2007 over phone hacking claims. He went on to become Downing Street Communications Director with close links to Mr Cameron, who would later become the Prime Minister overseeing the deal. Mr Cameron has previously admitted that he and Mr Coulson were 'close friends'. The revelation could cause further damage to Mr Cameron as Mr Coulson prepares to give evidence to the Leveson Inquiry this Thursday. Former News International boss Rebekah Brooks will give evidence on Friday. Giving evidence: Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, left, and former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson, right, are due to give evidence at the Leveson Inquiry into the phone hacking scandal . Difficult week: Correspondence between the Prime Minister David Cameron with Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson could be revealed this week . According to the Independent on . Sunday, Mr Coulson was given the shares when he resigned as editor of . News of the World over the phone hacking scandal in 2007. As a special advisor and civil servant Mr Coulson would had to have declared the holdings when he joined Downing Street in 2010. In the run-up to the anticipated acquisition of BSkyB the share price of News Corp soared to almost $19. But after it emerged that News of the . World staff had hacked the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler the . share price plummeted to around $14 - wiping tens of millions of . dollars off the value of the firm. Any shares that Mr Coulson held would have also been affected by the loss. A spokesman for the Cabinet Office said: 'On appointment, Andy Coulson complied with recruitment processes, including declaration of any interests to the Cabinet Office.' The revelation came as it emerged that . David Cameron’s aides will pore over his text messages to Mrs Brooks . this week amid fears he will be embarrassed by fresh details about his . links to the Murdoch empire. A two-year graph of News Corp share prices shows how the value of the firm was increasing up until June 2011 amid anticipation of a BSkyB takeover. The red circle shows how far the share price plummeted after it emerged Milly Dowler's phone was hacked . The . Prime Minister, with his lawyers and special advisers, have set up a . unit to study the texts to the former News of the World editor to search . for ‘landmines’. No 10 is . braced for a difficult week as Mrs Brooks and Mr Coulson will both be . giving evidence to Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into press standards. It has been . claimed that Mr Cameron was so close to Mrs Brooks that he texted her up . to a dozen times a day – and that Mrs Brooks has kept all the . communications. Mr . Cameron and Mrs Brooks are said to sign-off some of their text messages . to intimate friends with the friendly ‘x’ preferred by many habitual . phone texters. If they did so in messages to each other, it could add to the Government’s growing discomfort over the Leveson disclosures. According . to some sources, Mr Cameron sent text messages of support to Mrs Brooks . and her husband, race-horse trainer Charlie Brooks, before she was . forced to resign over the phone-hacking affair. Mrs . Brooks is expected to be asked about her relations with politicians and . senior police officers when she appears before Lord Leveson on Friday. She . could also be pressed over Mr Cameron’s admission that he had ridden a . horse loaned to Mrs Brooks by the Metropolitan Police. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt is facing questions about the nature of his relationship with the Murdoch empire . The inquiry’s . lawyers will not be able  to question Brooks or Coulson about anything . that could prejudice the continuing police investigation into phone . hacking. Both have been arrested and bailed. Mr . Cameron and seven other Cabinet Ministers will be given advance sight . of witness statements from Mrs Brooks and Mr Coulson after successfully . winning ‘core participant’ status at an emergency hearing on Friday. The ministers are David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Vince Cable, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Theresa May, Ken Clarke and George Osborne. This latest worry for the Prime Minister comes hot on the heels of the Jeremy Hunt scandal. According to The Independent on Sunday, David Cameron agreed to a meeting with one of Rupert Murdoch' senior executives, that was arranged by the lobbyist now at the centre of the scandal. Jeremy Hunt's culture secretary has already had to step down over emails sent from the same senior executive Frederic Michel about a BSkyB contract he was overseeing at the time. Mr Michel set up the meet in 2009 between the Prime Minister and Jose Maria Aznar, the former Prime Minister of Spain, and a member of New Corporation's board. His involvement in the meeting - that came just weeks after The Sun switched its support from Labour to Conservatives - brings into doubts claims by Mr Hunt and that Prime Minister that he is just a lobbyist. The meeting further demonstrates the Prime Minster's close relationship with the Murdochs and members of their organisations. But a Number 10 spokesman told the newspaper: 'All contact with News International and News Corp has been declared in the correct way. The Prime Minister has had no inappropriate discussions about the BSkyB bid either as Prime Minister or before.'","Former NotW editor 'held stock in U.S. company' while working in Downing Street with 'friend' David Cameron .

The father of former boxing champion Ricky 'Hitman' Hatton was arrested for attacking his son the day before he announced his comeback, police have said. Sources claim Hatton, 33, had to protect himself after his dad Ray, 61, attacked him during a heated row in the car park outside his Manchester gym. Police were called during the row and Hatton senior was arrested and cautioned. Father and son: Ex-world boxing champion Ricky Hatton (left) and his father Ray who was arrested for attacking his son the day before he announced his comeback . A Greater Manchester Police  spokesman said: 'Shortly before 11.45am on Thursday, police received reports that there had been a fight involving two men outside a health and fitness club on Market Street, Hyde. 'A 33-year-old man was assaulted by a 61-year-old man, who was arrested on suspicion of common assault and subsequently given a police caution.""The 33-year-old man was not injured in the incident.' Hatton's agent declined to comment on the incident.

The fighter was the subject of allegations of cocaine abuse two years ago and within days he was admitted to a rehabilitation facility. Out of retirement: The boxer has been plagued with publicity about issues in his personal life . Drink and depression were major issues for Hatton at the time. Hatton said he did not want to see those demons tarnish his legacy in the sport, with another world title belt in his sights. 'I don't want people telling my kids that I blew it,' Hatton said as it was announced he would return to the ring on November 24 in Manchester. 'I want my kids to be able to say, 'He was a world champion, he had his problems, but my did he bounce back'. 'I want people to be proud of me again.

Britain's fattest teenager Georgia Davis has told how she has lost an incredible 14 stone since firefighters broke down a wall to rescue her from her home in a £100,000 rescue. The obese 19-year-old now weighs 42st 6lb - down from 56st - after doctors put her on a strictly controlled diet. Breaking her silence, the teenager revealed she was left asking herself 'how has it come to this?' as she waited for rescuers to break into her first floor bedroom in Aberdare, Wales. Obese: Georgia Davis, 19, has lost 14 stone since being rushed to hospital - but still weighs 42st 6lb. She is pictured here with her mother Lesley . Now she has walked again for the first time and had a proper shower again in a hospital diary, The Sun reports. She writes how she dreams of going to Tokyo to sample the food and having her own flat as she turns her life around. And she revealed she has received cards and letters of support from people across the country which have helped her win her battle against the scales. Her diet now consists of cereal and toast for breakfast followed by a healthy dish of meat and vegetables for lunch and dinner. The teenager used to order up to 20 kebabs each week from a takeaway and gorge throughout the day on chocolate, crisps and two litre bottles of Coca Cola. Initially her weight was given as 63st - but it was officially recorded at 56st when she was taken to hospital. Rescue: A specially-built ramp at Georgis Davis' home which was built in a £100,000 operation after she was left unable to walk because of her weight . Georgia said her lowest moment was waking up to hear firefighters building a ramp to rescue her in a £100,000 operation. A team of 50 workers broke down a wall to get her out of her first floor bedroom in the terraced home on May 24. The teenager was forced to wear a bedsheet - because none of her supersized clothes were big enough. Bulge: Georgia, pictured in February 2011, has spoken of her dream to have a flat of her own and to travel to Tokyo . She told The Sun: 'What could I do except switch on the TV and wait? I asked myself ""How has it come to this? 'I felt nervous and uneasy because I knew I was the biggest I had ever been - and the most dangerous for my health.' The teenager said she felt panicky and embarrassed - but was treated kindly by hospital staff. Her mother Lesley, 57, was forced to raise the alarm after Georgia was unable to stand up because of her weight. The teenager said the day she realised she was unable to use her legs was the most frightening. Lesley and her stepfather Arthur Treloar were forced to move out of the property temporarily while the wall was rebuilt. Georgia added in her diary: 'Mum says the council will not allow me to live upstairs again so if I return home I will have to have a bedroom on the ground floor. I don't want to live like that.' She added that she dreamed of one day having a flat of her own and 'share it with a girlfriend'. After weeks hooked up to oxygen in a special £4,000 bed she has taken her first steps again - walking from her bed to a nearby chair as she begins to win her battle against her weight. She was forced to have bed showers rather than proper showers because of her weight.

"By . Colin Fernandez . UPDATED: . 10:04 EST, 9 December 2011 . With a home Olympics fast approaching, not to mention a £200million budget, you would expect a Government agency to be able to have a sizeable impact on the number of us playing sport. And Sport England can certainly claim to have made a difference to participation in a huge variety of sports, from football to judo. The only problem is that the effect appears to have been a largely negative one, it emerged yesterday. Less of a splash: The number of swimmers has shrunk from 3.25m to 2.81m since 2007 . Out of play: The amount of people playing football, our second most popular sport, in this country has also reduced from 2.12m from 2.14m . Analysis of 28 major sports targeted by Sport England shows that public participation has fallen over the past four years in 19, remained constant in five and risen in only four. The survey of 166,000 people by the agency, which funds grass-roots sport, examined the number of adults participating in at least half an hour of moderate exercise in each of the various sports. It found major falls in participation in some of Britain’s most popular sports including swimming, football and tennis. Between 2007 and 2011, there was a steep fall in the number of people going swimming – the country’s most popular sport – from 3.25million to 2.81million. In the same period, the number of us playing football dropped from 2.14million to 2.12million and tennis fell from 487,500 to 375,800.Golf sank from 948,300 to 833,200. Other sports in decline were: badminton, horse-riding, bowls, basketball, snow sports, hockey, weightlifting, sailing, rugby league, rugby union, rowing, gymnastics, volleyball, rounders and judo. Only four sports showed  increases: boxing, table tennis, mountaineering and athletics, which includes jogging. Participation in athletics increased from 1.6million to 1.8million. On the rise: Table tennis was one of few sports to see an increase in numbers, thanks perhaps to its celebrity endorsement earlier this year . Climbing numbers: Mountaineering was one of only four sports, along with table tennis, athletics and boxing, to see an increase in participation . Cycling, squash, netball, canoeing  and fencing showed no change. Among 18-year-olds, a key group being targeted by Sport England, the numbers taking part in sport overall fell from 189,100 in 2007/8 to 172,500 in 2010/11. Sport England has an annual budget of over £200million to promote grass-roots sport, with around half channelled through sports governing bodies. The agency said ‘economic factors’ were partly behind the trend as people were spending less money on recreation. It said severe winter weather last year had also deterred people from outdoor sport. But the figures are worrying given that the outlay on hosting the Olympics in London next year was supposed to benefit the nation by boosting public participation in sports and therefore the nation’s health. Disappointment: The outlay spent on the Olympics and the Olympic Stadium in London, pictured, was meant to benefit the nation by boosting public participation in sport . Sport England’s chief executive Jennie Price – a barrister by training who previously headed the Government recycling body WRAP – said yesterday there could still be a boost from the Olympics. She said: ‘It has not happened yet, but the Olympics was only ever an opportunity and we still have next year to come. I think when we get into the Olympic year we will see  an increase – I don’t see that the opportunity is lost. It was always more likely to have an effect around the Games and afterwards.’ Hugh Robertson, the Sports Minister, said: ‘Although not unexpected, these figures are  very disappointing.’ He added that the Government would be unveiling a new strategy to boost youth sport that will be announced in the new year, adding: ‘This strategy will be based on concrete results in return for Government investment and will ensure we create a real and lasting sports legacy after London’s Games.'","UK's two most popular sports see less participation .

Angela Merkel was greeted with Nazi jibes from protesters in Lisbon today as she arrived in the Portuguese capital to advocate the benefits of austerity and economic reforms. As with her recent trips to bailed-out Greece and debt-stricken Spain, demonstrators unhappy about tax hikes and pay cuts devised to improve public finances turned their anger on the German leader. Portugal needed a 78 billion euro ($99 billion) rescue package last year when it was engulfed by the eurozone's debt crisis and living standards have dropped sharply. Heated debate: Protesters burn a puppet of German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a demonstration against austerity cuts and tax increases in Lisbon, Portugal . Pulling the strings: A demonstrator holds two puppets representing Portuguese Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho and German Chancellor Angela Merkel during a protest in front of the Palace of Belem in Lisbon . A protest march in Lisbon featured dummies with Merkel's face and with T-shirts saying 'Adolf Merkel' and including a swastika. Banners said 'Merkel Nazi, Go Away!' and, in German, 'Merkel Raus' (Merkel Out). 'I think it's wrong what they are doing,' said Luis Miguel, an actor who was carrying puppets representing Merkel and Portuguese Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho. 'It's not right what they are taking from the people.' Merkel told a news conference with Passos Coelho she was 'not particularly bothered' by the Nazi references, saying people had a right to express their views. Germany is the eurozone's biggest and strongest economy and contributes more than the other 16 members to bailouts for financially troubled members. In return, it has demanded that rescued eurozone members adopt spending cuts and enact reforms that take away long-standing workers' entitlements in order to improve competitiveness. Feelings run high: As with her recent trips to bailed-out Greece and debt-stricken Spain, demonstrators unhappy about measures devised to improve public finances turned their anger on the German leader . On the frontline: Some hooded protesters pushed over a barricade keeping them away from a venue where Merkel was due to appear and riot police with shields and dogs were deployed to push demonstrators back . That has made Merkel a lightning rod for public discontent. In a startling example of how a consensus on deficit-cutting has broken down within the Portuguese establishment, a major business newspaper, Diario Economico, ran an opinion piece on Monday condemning Merkel for pushing the Portuguese government to impose austerity measures in the depth of a recession. 'Merkel has made an economic Frankenstein out of Portugal,' the newspaper said, warning of a downward spiral in activity. Reactions to Merkel's visit illustrated the split in Europe over how to handle the continent's debt crisis. Merkel and the Portugal's center-right government insist austerity policies must continue. Battle lines drawn: Reactions to Merkel's visit illustrated the split in Europe over how to handle the continent's debt crisis . Face-off: A protester gestures at police officers during a demonstration against German Chancellor Angela Merkel in central Lisbon . Portugal's main opposition Socialist . Party, like French president Francois Hollande, wants a softer emphasis . on cuts and greater focus on measures to improve growth. That demand has . won broad public support in Portugal.

Athens and Madrid, where demonstrations have drawn tens of thousands . and sometimes become violent. Some hooded protesters pushed over a barricade keeping them away from a venue where Merkel was due to appear, and riot police with shields and dogs were deployed to push demonstrators back. Merkel praised Portugal's coalition government for complying with the terms of its bailout agreement. Germany and other bailout lenders - the other eurozone countries, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank - are keen for Portugal to stay the course, sparing the continent more difficulties like those in Greece. In the firing line: Portuguese President Anibal Cavaco Silva (right) welcomes Mrs Merkel before their meeting at Belem Palace in Lisbon . The Portuguese government predicts a third straight year of recession in 2013, and the jobless rate has risen to almost 16 percent. 'I think Portugal's conditions for growth have improved greatly recently because of this adjustment program and the courageous action of the government,' Merkel told reporters. 'We have to keep our word' on promises to cut debt levels, she said, adding that austerity must go hand-in-hand with reforms to make eurozone countries more internationally competitive. 'It will be a tough path,' she said. The visit came at a tense moment for the government, which is steering another austerity budget through Parliament. The 2013 state budget includes what Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar has called 'enormous' income tax hikes that many observers say will choke growth and make it harder for the country to pay off debt. The government has an overall parliamentary majority, allowing it to force through the measures in a vote scheduled for the end of the month. Merkel's visit coincided with the start of the sixth regular assessment by international inspectors of Portugal's progress in implementing the bailout agreement. The assessment is expected to last about two weeks.","Demonstrators wore T-shirts saying 'Adolf Merkel' and including a swastika .

A 'completely unemployable' man who has been to university four times says he has been dumped on the scrapheap because he is too clever to work. Mark Schwalbe, 52, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, claims to have applied for more than 200 jobs and has been rejected for every one because he has too many qualifications. Each employer has told him his CV is too good and he is overqualified for the menial jobs he has applied for, he claims. This is because he has multiple A-levels, a degree and a masters degree as well as an HND and years of experience in the care sector. He says he has applied unsuccessfully for jobs at fast food chain McDonalds and also high street giants Primark, Wilkinsons and Morrisons. His frustrations have boiled over to such an extent he wrote to David Cameron and Nick Clegg to tell them about a situation he says is making him miserable. 'I have gone for factory and warehouse jobs where I have been told I am too qualified. Someone even said to me ""we don’t want a genius asking why they’re being asked to push a broom"".

A Scotland Yard police officer who spent three years in uniform before MI5 raised fears that he could be an Al Qaeda ‘sleeper’ agent is suing for compensation. Abdul Rahman, 33, resigned after senior officers revoked his security clearance when they were told of the damaging suspicions. Secret intelligence suggested he had attended a terrorist training camp in Pakistan before he was recruited to the force. Now the father of four, who admits . travelling to Pakistan but vehemently denies meeting terrorists, is . claiming a five-figure sum for alleged discrimination. But he has been unable to see the evidence against him because police and MI5 do not want to reveal their sensitive sources. It . is possible he was identified by an Al Qaeda supergrass who joined . militants at camps on the lawless border between Pakistan and . Afghanistan. The case raises serious questions about how he became a policeman and was able to work for three years and comes five years after the Daily Mail first revealed that up to eight police officers and civilian staff had suspected links to extremist groups including Al Qaeda. Their names featured on a secret list of alleged radicals said to be working in the Met and other forces. The dossier was drawn up with the help of MI5 amid fears that individuals linked to Islamic extremism are taking advantage of police attempts to increase the proportion of ethnic staff. Mr Rahman, who was born in Bangladesh and became a British citizen aged nine, joined the Metropolitan Police in 2003. The . claims came to light three years later as MI5 and counter-terrorism . detectives undertook a massive review of security following the July . 2005 terrorist attacks. Mr . Rahman was questioned three times about his movements before his . counter-terrorism clearance was suspended and he was put on restricted . duties. He went off sick. The . next year a hearing chaired by Deputy Assistant Commissioner Peter . Clarke, the then head of counter-terrorism, concluded he should be . sacked, and he resigned a short time later. Police officers without security . clearance cannot do their job as they are unable to access the Police . National Computer or other sensitive databases. Abdul Rahman, circled, pictured with other officers from the Metropolitan Police . It is understood Mr Rahman said he . attended a madrassah, a religious school, as a way of getting into . technical college in Britain, but did not meet any terrorists. No evidence was found against two colleagues who were also questioned. The Daily Mail revealed in 2007 that Al Qaeda fanatics had been found to be working in police forces across the country . Some madrassahs in Pakistan have a . reputation for attracting extremists and radicalising young Muslims. Shehzad Tanweer, the London suicide bomber, is said to have visited one . in the months before the July 7 attacks in 2005. Mr Rahman, who lives in Tower . Hamlets, declined to discuss  the case. His solicitor Jasmine van . Loggerenberg said her client denies the allegations against him and has . been left in a ‘ludicrous and inequitable’ situation by the secrecy . around his case. She said: ‘This case raises important . issues on whether practices which disadvantage innocent people on the . basis of their ethnic or religious background can ever be justified, . when the allegations that result are so serious.’ Patrick Mercer, a Tory MP and expert . on counter-terrorism, said he was astonished that Mr Rahman entered . police ranks in the first place. He said: ‘It seems extraordinary that . an individual with this sort of background would even be entertained by . the police.’ The Met confirmed that Mr Rahman is bringing an employment tribunal case for racial discrimination against the force.

Windfall: Walter Samasko Jr., who died with only $200 in his checking account, had at least $7million of coins in his Nevada home . When 69-year-old Walter Samasko Jr died in May he left behind just $200 in the bank and no friends or family to lay claim to the meager inheritance. He hadn't worked since 1968 and was living off stock accounts of $140,000 and $25,000. But the real treasure was found at his Nevada home, along with his decaying body, one month later after neighbours complained of a foul smell. There officials discovered box upon box of gold coins and bars stowed away in Samasko's garage, valued at a staggering $7million or more. The 69-year-old had died from heart problems, a coroner found, at least one month before he was discovered. Leaving no will, and with no known relatives, officials set about tracking down a list of people who had attended Samasko's mother's funeral after she died in 1992, the Las Vegas Sun reported. They managed to identify a first cousin, Arlene Magdanz, a substitute teacher living in San Rafael, California. Though Ms Magdanz declined to comment, her attorney said that the first words of of his client's mouth were: 'Oh my God, oh my God.' Scroll down for video . Quiet life: The reclusive millionaire lived in this modest ranch home and kept his coins in his attached garage . Everything's golden: Among the coins Mr Samasko collected were Austrian ducats, left, and South African Krugerrands, right, many dating from the late 1800s and early 1900s . Stockpiling: Officials said that much of Mr Samanko's wealth was from $20 gold coins from the U.S. (stock photo) Royal find: He also had a collection of British sovereign coins that depicted Queen Victoria, in both her earlier and later years on the throne (stock photo) She had not spoken to her cousin for a year. The gold, including . coins from Mexico, England, Austria and South Africa dating to 1872, was . hauled from the garage using a wheelbarrow and truck, then deposited for . safekeeping. Carson City Clerk Recorder Alan Glover told MailOnline that only coins were found in Mr Samasko’s house. ‘There were no bars at all. There were all sorts of coins, though – Mexican, British sovereigns, Austrian ducats, (South African) krugerrands, most of it was U.S. $20 gold pieces.’ The British sovereign coins, he said, had ‘both early and later Queen Victoria – from 1840s and the 1890s.’ He added that the county clerk’s office is in the process of recruiting Mr Howard Herz, a locally renowned jeweller, to appraise the coins for internal revenue. Mr Herz’s family has owned a jewellery store in the area for more than 130 years. Mr Glover told MailOnline that the $7million appraisal was ‘just on what we think the gold weight of it,’ meaning that the actual value of the coinage could very well be worth much more. ‘A lot of them were just bulk coins wrapped in aluminium foil,’ he said, adding that it may be some time until the world really knows Mr Samasko’s wealth. ‘No idea how long the appraisal will take,’ he said. Mr Glover said that Mr Samasko’s mother was the one who began collecting coins, a tradition that he continued after she died. ‘They were most likely taking money out of their stock accounts and buying gold with it,’ Mr Glover said. Gold rush: His cousin, Arlene Magdanz, will likely inherit the entire coin collection, though she hasn't had contact with him in more than a year . Other things . found in the 'anti-government' pensioner's home included a stash of . conspiracy theory books and several guns, Mr Glover . said. He rarely went out and never went to a doctor, Mr Glover said. 'He was obsessed with getting diseases from shots.' Samasko . had lived in the house since the 1960s. Records show that he hadn't . held down a steady job since 1968. His mother also lived there until her . death in 1992. And cases like this are rare within Carson City. ‘I’ve never had a case like this, and not in this amount,’ Mr Glover said, adding thoughtfully: ‘(Mr Samasko) had some definite survival tendencies.’ As for his first cousin Ms Magdanz? ‘She has disconnected her telephone,’ Mr Glover said, adding that his office will likely try mailing her to get in contact about her new estate. ‘It’s kind of like winning the lottery,’ he said.

Roland Loog appears smiling as he raises his hand in the salute associated with Adolf Hitler while standing in front of the symbol during a visit to Alabama . Loog, who is head of tourism for Gainesville and Alachua County, later removed the offending photograph that was taken outside the Jefferson County Courthouse in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The courthouse features eight of the symbols, believed to be derived from native american culture rather than Adolf Hitler's Nazi Party. Loog, who has been head of the Gainesville Tourism Department since 1999, was visiting the town in Alabama for a conference. He now faces a disciplinary hearing which could lead to his suspension. Loog was wearing a 'visit Gainesville' polo shirt when he posed for the photo on September 18. The tourist chief claims that by performing the Nazi salute he was mocking Adolf Hitler and his fascist movement . He denied he had any affiliation to Nazis or right wing movements. He said he was stunned to see the Nazi like symbol and his one arm salute gesture was meant to mock the emblem. 'I was in shock and responded in a mocking way, and I shouldn’t have done that. 'I just had to mock it and put it down,' he said. Loog wrote in his Facebook post that he thought people should consider removing the pattern from the building. 'I put a negative post on my personal Facebook (page), and I should know better,' he added. Loog also wrote on his Facebook site that the symbol, which can also be found in native Indian culture, wasn't offensive but admitted its association to Nazi Germany could offend people. He posted that he believes people have three reactions to a swastika: to embrace it, which he wrote is a sad response; to loathe it; or to poke fun at it. He said he chose the third option and 'did not see door #4 — ignore the fool thing.' County Commissioner Susan Baird said that residents had emailed and called her to complain about Loog’s photo, which she said she heard had been posted as a joke. 'Well that’s not funny to a lot of people,' she said. Acting County Manager Richard Drummond gave Loog notice that the county was considering disciplinary action and will meet with Loog on Friday in a closed hearing.","Roland Loog is being investigated after posting photo of himself making offensive sign outside couthouse .

But on other occasions Miss Hendricks, who is happily married to fellow actor Geoffrey Arend, has appeared flattered by the global admiration her body type has provoked. Speaking to an American website, she said: ‘It’s such a compliment, because of all those times I had agents who were like: ""you have to lose some weight"" and all of a sudden, people are celebrating it. 'It’s like: ""Oh thank you! Thank you for letting me be me"".' However the TV star also said that while she appreciates her admirers she wouldn’t encourage women to imitate her.

Or do they believe that passing a certain age defines a person as ‘over the hill’? According to a new study, neither  – a person is defined by how old they act, and how independent they are. For instance, consumers who can no longer shop for themselves, complete housework, or drive their cars are considered ‘old,’ the study claims. Independence is an important marker of age and strongly related to a person's 'ability to drive, shop, and cook for themselves' According to the new study by Oregon State University researcher Michelle Barnhart, activities that define one’s independence are the most important markers of age. In much of America, a person’s independence is closely tied to their ability to drive, shop, and cook for themselves. Because of these unwritten adages, those who are too feeble to carry shopping bags or operate their vehicle are looked at as someone in their twilight years. To conduct her research, Ms Barnhart conducted in-depth interviews with consumers in their late 80s, as well as their caregivers and family members – often the subject’s adult children in their 50s and 60s. Michell Barnhart of Oregon State University. Her new study looks into how perceptions of aging are changing . She found that the Baby Boomers, who are aging themselves, did not wish to be seen as old, but often treated their own parents as ‘old people’ – not allowing them to exercise independence where they could and assuming they’re scatterbrained as well as slow. Because of this, she writes that conflicts are ripe to occur between the parents, who don’t see themselves as old, and their adult children, who do. Ms Barnhart notes that those in their 80s and 90s are often dealing with negative connotations of old age. ‘Almost every stereotype we associate with being elderly is something negative,’ she said, ‘from being “crotchety” and unwilling to change to being forgetful.’ One woman she interviewed, ‘Abbie,’ is 89. When her adult daughters drove her to a routine doctor’s appointment and accompanied her into the exam room, the doctor addressed her daughters and wouldn’t talk to Abbie. Ms Barnhart claims that society tends to marginalize those who are advanced in years, rather than valuing them for their wisdom . At later appointments, Abbie told her daughters to remain in the waiting room while she was meeting with her physician. Ms Barnhart writes that part of the problem with ‘old age’ is that society tends to marginalize those who are advanced in years, rather than valuing them for their wisdom. ‘Unless we change the way we view old age, the generation younger than the boomers will treat them the same way as soon as they show a few more wrinkles, or seem a bit shaky on their feet,’ she said. Her full study will be published in the April 2013 edition of the Journal of Consumer Research.","Study from Oregon State University says that once an ‘elderly’ person cannot shop or drive for themselves, they are considered to be in ‘old age’

Some shoppers have turned away from their usual stores to do their shop - with many using budget chains like Lidl. The amount of new customers more accustomed to luxury goods who shop there now had has forced the store to produce a range of deluxe products. Nick Nairn, the youngest Scottish chef to win a Michelin star, has been employed to come-up with a Christmas menu based on the Lidl range. They are set to take on the upmarket likes of Marks and Spencer, Waitrose and Sainsbury's - at a fraction of the cost. Lidl said that it had greatly expanded its luxury range 'due to customer demand.' The budget chain says Christmas would not be the same for the middle classes without 'affordable luxury'.

The increase in sales seems to have been driven by retailers starting their Christmas sales push earlier than ever.

Separately, advertising watchdogs have received complaints from parents unhappy that early marketing is encouraging children to pester them far in advance of December 25.

At 6ft 8in tall, he would have been easily eligible to compete amongst those giants of sport in the U.S. basketball leagues today. In third-century AD Rome, where men averaged only about 5ft 6in, he would have been a giant the likes of which most people had never seen. It's no legend - archaeologists believe have discovered the first complete ancient skeleton of a person with gigantism near the capital of the ancient empire. Towering: The giant's tibia (shin bone), top, compared with one taken from a normal-sized male of the same era and location . Giganticism is extremely rare, these days affecting only about three individuals in every million worldwide; finding such skeletons dating back to ancient times is almost entirely unheard of. Although two partial skeletons, one from Egypt and another found in Poland, have been identified as possible cases, the Roman find is the first clear case of gigantism from the ancient past, National Geographic reported. Gigantism is a condition leading to excessive growth significantly above the human average. It is caused by overproduction of growth hormone in childhood, before growth plates in the bones have closed. Archaeologists excavating a necropolis in Fidenae, a territory indirectly managed by Rome, found the skeleton in 1991 buried in an unusually long tomb. But it was only in a later anthropological examination that researchers found the bones were also out of the ordinary. A team led by Simona Minozzi, a paleopathologist at the University of Pisa, analysed the bones and found evidence of damage to the man's skull consistent with a tumour on the pituitary gland. This would have disrupted the gland, causing it to overproduce human growth hormone and leading to the phenomenal growth. That was not all. Disproportionately . long limbs and evidence that the youth's bones were still growing even in . early adulthood supported the diagnosis of gigantism. The world's tallest man today: At 8ft 3in tall Sultan Kösen of Turkey is officially the world's tallest man. He also suffers from pituitary gigantism and the rest of his family are all of normal height . Gigantism is a condition characterized by excessive growth and height significantly above average. In humans, this condition is caused by over-production of growth hormone in childhood before the long bone epiphyses (growth plates) close, resulting in individuals between 7 feet and 9 feet in height. The term is typically applied to those whose height is not just in the upper 1 per cent of the population but several standard deviations above mean for persons of the same sex, age, and ethnic ancestry. Gigantism is usually caused by a tumor on the pituitary gland of the brain, although in some cases the condition can be passed on genetically through a mutated gene. Many of those who have been identified with gigantism have suffered from multiple health issues involving their circulatory or skeletal system. Dr Minozzi told National Geographic that evidence also showed the man died young - most likely between 16 and 20 - another finding that could point to the condition, which is linked to a number of health problems. With imperial Roman high society having what Dr Minozzi described as a 'pronounced taste for entertainers with evident physical malformations' it is more than likely the Fidenae giant was the subject of much curiousity during his life. However, little could be gleaned about what his life was like from the circumstances of his burial. He was found with no funerary artifacts, which often offer clues about the status of people in the Roman world, although the typical circumstances of his interment suggest he was not excluded from the daily life of his community. But researchers hope that further investigation of the body will help them better understand how gigantism has developed throughout human history. Charlotte Roberts, a bioarchaeologist at the Durham University, told National Geographic: 'Normally a doctor will be looking at a patient with a disease over short term span. 'We've been able to look at skeletons from archaeological sites that are thousands of years old. You can start to look at trends of how diseases have changed in frequency over time.' The study by Dr Minozzi and her team appears in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.","Skeleton of youth who stood 6ft 8in tall found near Rome in unusually long tomb .

It is usually patients who are afraid of dentists, but when a 75 stone polar bear needed root canal treatment yesterday, the dynamics of that relationship could easily have changed around. Arktos the polar bear had been suffering from toothache so vets from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland had to check over his 42 razor sharp teeth. Early yesterday morning Arktos was darted with tranquilisers and the three hour dental operation began. Polar bear Arktos during his three hour dental treatment and Highland Wildlife Park, in Kingussie, Scotland . Keepers had noticed that the usually playful polar bear seemed to be feeling sorry for himself and not hanging out with fellow bear Walker quite so much. Broken or infected teeth are a major cause of large carnivore debilitation and death in the wild. Walker and Arktos, the only polar bears on display in the UK, had been trained to open their huge powerful mouths to show their keepers their terrifying teeth. Jaw-some: Huge polar bear Arktos is given oxygen during the delicate dental operation to save his teeth . A small area of discolouration was spotted on Arktos’ upper left canine tooth and the Highland Wildlife Park called in external dental experts to fix the problem. When experts got four-year-old Arktos into the equivalent of a dentist’s chair - a specially reinforced table made from scaffolding poles and planks - they discovered he needed a root canal. Team effort: Arktos is rolled into position on the 'dentists chair' by experts including two dentists, two radiographers, two veterinarians, one vet nurse and three senior animal staff . One of his teeth had become damaged at the tip and rotted through, so it needed drilling out, cleaning and then packing with dental cement. Exactly the same procedure as in humans, just with a tooth canal almost six times the size. Polar molars: A team of vets from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland operate on Arktos . Douglas Richardson, Animal Collection Manager at the Highland Wildlife Park, said: 'Because we regularly train our polar bears and other large animals to take part in regular health checks, this means that we can spot issues like this before they become a problem and give our animals the best possible care available. An X-ray of the four-year-old polar bear's tooth shows dentists the extent of the damage . 'Arktos really is a lucky bear and we were delighted to be able to save his tooth; in the wild the infection would have tracked through his system, causing him a great deal of pain and discomfort and, over the longer term, it could eventually kill him. 'Although due to his size an operation like this is never straight forward, the dental work carried out is actually very similar to a root canal that we humans would have - although obviously on a much larger scale. Heavily-sedated Arktos is left to recover from the root canal treatment as experts check on him . 'Arktos needed a specially made and reinforced operating table and a team of 12 to carry out the procedure. 'As far as we can tell, the operation was a success. It took three hours in total and Arktos just took 20 minutes to come round. He was then up on his feet, although still a bit wobbly. 'He quickly had a drink and we expect him to start eating again this morning, when we will try him on some of his favourite soft foods as his mouth will still be a bit sore. Experts check Arktos is getting a good supply of oxygen during the precarious dental treatment . Arktos spent the night in a small holding area and then should be reunited with Walker later today.' The operation lasted three hours and involved a team of ten experts: two dentists, two radiographers, two veterinarians, one vet nurse and three senior animal staff. Arktos arrived at the Highland Wildlife Park in early April 2012 from Hannover Zoo. He was born in Vienna Zoo in 2007. A bear with a sore tooth: A groggy Arktos comes round after his root canal operation . After the operation it’s hoped he will soon be able to enjoy food again for his fifth birthday on November 30. Earlier last year the Park’s other polar bear, Walker, also underwent a dental procedure. In this case a tooth extraction, Walker had a canine tooth that had not developed properly, likely due to an injury when he was a cub, which had become infected.","Four-year-old Arktos has root canal treatment .

McAfee's mental state, saying: 'I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I . believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers.' Belize police have said they want to question McAfee, who they describe as a 'person of interest' in the slaying of fellow American Gregory Viant Faull. Faull, 52, was shot to death over the weekend on the Caribbean island where both men lived. From his secret location, McAfee,  67, has been in contact with reporters, including Wired editor Joshua Davis, who has been providing updates on the case through his Twitter feed. The latest update read: '[McAfee] says his hideout has a cathode ray tube TV and he watched an episode of Rawhide. His girlfriend thinks it's boring.' In the early 2000s John McAfee pioneered the invention of a new sport called aerotrekking out of his New Mexico property . Suspicious: Gregory Faull's home in San Pedro. Belizean police want to question anti-virus software pioneer John McAfee, 67, about the murder of his neighbor and fellow U.S. citizen, Faull, 52 . Pastime: Mr Faull posted several pictures of himself on his boat in Belize. He titled this photo 'new friends' McAfee, who had a run-in with police earlier this year, told The Associated Press by telephone that he didn't kill Faull, though he acknowledged he had differences with the dead man. 'I barely knew him, I barely spoke ten words to him in the last three years,' McAfee said, speaking on a cellphone. 'Certainly he was not my favorite person and I was not his.' 'He was a heavy drinker and an annoyance. But the world is full of annoyances; if we killed all of our annoyances, there would be nobody left,' McAfee said. Other expat residents of the island of Ambergris Caye, where San Pedro is located, have described Faull, the owner of a construction business in Orlando, Florida, as peaceful and well-liked. Lying low: McAfee, is pictured at his former home in Rodeo, New Mexico . Famous friends: Gregory Faull is seen here with basketball legends Michael Jordan, left, and Patrick Ewing, right . The dispute apparently involved several dogs that McAfee kept at his beachside villa and that drew complaints from neighbors. McAfee said that four of his dogs were poisoned late last week, but that he didn't initially suspect Faull of having killed them, though he knew Faull didn't like the dogs. 'He did threaten to shoot them once or twice,' McAfee said of Faull, adding that his neighbor was 'always angry at them.' But he said he now believes government agents or police poisoned the dogs. Wealthy: Mr Faull founded the first-ever restaurant to serve alcohol on a college campus at the University of Central Florida in Orlando . Bad blood: Mr Faull and McAfee reportedly were at odds after a police complaint Mr Faull filed . 'My assumption was it was some kind of government action again. This is more harassment - that was the first thing that went through my mind, and still is going through my mind. What else could it have been?' he said. Faull was found with a gunshot wound to his head inside his two-story home north of San Pedro. The housekeeper discovered the body Sunday morning and called police. Raphael Martinez, spokesman for Belize's Ministry of National Security, said no charges had been filed in the case, but asked that McAfee turn himself in, accompanied by someone else, if he felt safer that way. But McAfee said he feared that Belize's notorious Gang Suppression Unit, the GSU, a paramilitary-style squad that has been accused of rough treatment and that raided another property McAfee owns in Belize in April, would beat him and he would later die in custody.

Pictured are some of the weapons that Belize's Gang Suppression Unit claim they recovered from McAfee's home. He is now wanted for murder . 'The GSU will do what the GSU does, beat me soundly until I confess to a multitude of sins, including I guess the murder of Jimmy Hoffa, and then just execute me,' McAfee said. He accused authorities of detaining his friends and associates in a bid to pressure him to turn himself in. 'Of course, and it's almost working,' McAfee said. 'I'm sitting here, the young woman who is with me now and who has been by my side, and trying to keep me upbeat through this, I said, ""You know, I'll just call and say I'll turn myself in, just let these people go."" And she said, ""Absolutely not, they will kill you.""' 'I keep moving constantly, sir ... and I keep changing telephones constantly, this phone will expire shortly,' he said. McAfee, the creator of the McAfee antivirus program, has led a life of eccentricity since he sold his stake in the anti-virus software company that is named for him in the early 1990s and moved to Belize about three years ago to lower his taxes. Grim task: Police officers carry the body of US citizen Gregory Viant Faull following his murder this weekend . Yesterday, McAfee told Davis that his last-ditch effort to evade authorities was ‘radically alter(ing) my appearance,’ dying his salt-and-pepper hair and beard jet black. 'I'll probably look like a murderer, unfortunately,' he said, according to Davis. McAfee told the Associated Press via . email in May that ‘the government wants me out of the way. Too many . people have died in custody in this country so I intend to do nothing . that puts me in their custody.’ He has been in hiding since a raid on . his house in April where authorities accused him of running a . methamphetamine lab. Because he’s in an undisclosed location away from . his house, he told Wired that he’s afraid police have planted . incriminating evidence, perhaps guns or ‘four tons of cocaine.’ He said he heard Faull had been . shot but that he believed it to have been a case of mistaken identity . and it was in fact him who the shooter had intended to kill. Scene of the crime: This is the house where Faull was murdered in Ambergris Caye, Belize between the night of November 10th and Sunday November 11th . Insisting that the murder was carried . out by the police themselves, he added: 'They got the wrong house. Call . me paranoid [but] They've been trying to get me for months. They want . to silence me. I am not well liked by the Prime Minister.' He had earlier phoned the reporter to say: 'Power was just cut to . the house I’m in. I think this is it,' but hours later, called again to . say that he changed locations and that he was safe for the time being.' Millions: McAfee made millions on his antivirus software of the same name . The revelation came after it emerged McAfee had discussed experimenting with the dangerous drug known as . bath salts in extensive online postings on a drug-friendly Russian message board. 'I’m a huge fan of MDPV. I think it's . the finest drug ever conceived, not just for the indescribable . hypersexuality, but also for the smooth euphoria and mild comedown,' he . wrote. He posted on the online message board . between 2010 and 2011, but leaving and saying that his online . activities were interfering with his experimentation with drugs. Radar Online reports that McAfree bought the drugs online and worked in a makeshift lab in a hut to purify them. 'The . on-line world is more of a distraction than the self induced effects of . the many experiments I've done using my own body over the past year or . so, and I have work to do,' he wrote.

Tied together with a pale pink ribbon dozens of World War II-era love letters from a New Jersey woman to her fiance have washed ashore in New York after Hurricane Sandy’s destruction. Nearly hidden amid storm debris along an Atlantic Highlights beach, one day after Sandy, a 14-year-old boy discovered the box containing 57 letters in faded blues, purples and pink envelopes. 'I don't feel like sleeping so I thought I'd write you a few lines,' Katheleen Chaney whose son found the letters read to WNBC-TV. Scroll down for video . Love story: A stack of 57 love letters dating back to WWII is seen after washing ashore following Hurricane Sandy . Long distance: The letters chronicled the long-distance relationship between a New Jersey woman and her fiance who was in Vermont . They chronicled the life of Dorothy Fallon and Lynn Farnham from 1942 until the week before they married in 1948. 'Well Darling, two weeks from today and we will be married,' she read the start of another. Mr Farnham, a Vermont native served in the Pacific during the war placing some distance between the couple as she wrote from an address in New Jersey. Ms Chaney tells WNBC-TV she started playing amateur detective as her son dried the letters by their fireplace, their only source of heat in their home after the storm. Saved: Tied together with this pale pink ribbon the letters were protected by a box before dried by the fire by its finder, a 14-year-old boy . Their story: Written by Dorothy Fallon from 1942 until 1948, the young woman seen seated professed her love and excitement for her upcoming marriage to Lynn Farnham . Distance: Lynn Farnham, left, had served in the Pacific during the war placing some distance between him and Ms Fallon before their wedding in 1948 . Mystery: What's not known is how the letters were released into the storm, with family of the couple saying they know of no one in the area . 'I wanted to return them to whomever they belonged to,' Ms Chaney said. 'They're beautiful. She obviously adored him.' Her first success came after finding Mr Farnham’s name on website FindaGrave.com. It wasn’t an immediate answer, tragically discovering that he had died in 1991, but a message on the page reaching out to his surviving family led her to a niece. Writing Ms Chaney back, the niece said 91-year-old Dorothy Fallon Farnham was still alive as Mr Farnham's widower, however in frail health in Asbury Park. Careful eye: Kathleen Chaney's son, seen carrying the letters along the shore, made the remarkable discovery one day after Hurricane Sandy made landfall . Preservation: Ms Chaney shows off a picture of her son carefully drying the letters by their home fireplace, serving as their own heat source in the storm's aftermath . Manhunt: So moved by the letters Ms Chaney, pictured, said she had to try her best to find the letters' owner, leading her to a niece of the couple in Virginia . ‘She told me how wonderful her aunt was and her uncle and how absolutely in love they were,' she said of their first conversation which she said moved them both to tears. It's believed the letters floated from the Rumson area, down a river and into Sandy Hook Bay. What mystery still remains is who had been holding them before their release into the storm, with no known relatives said to be living in the area. Despite an offer from someone to purchase the letters from her, she said she plans to mail them back to Mrs Farnham’s family.

A taekwondo black belt used her martial arts training to fight off a deadly tiger shark while taking a leisurely swim off the coast of Maui. Mariko Haugen had been swimming with turtles and was just 25 feet from shore with her husband, Don, when she came face-to-face with the 12-foot shark. Her reflex reaction was to throw some punches at the predator, and she managed to catch it flush on the nose – forcing it to turn and swim in the opposite direction. Right on the nose: Mariko Haugen (left) demonstrated how she threw punches at the tiger shark to scare it away as she returned from a swim with her husband, Don (right) Leisurely: Mariko and Don had been swimming with turtles of the coast of Hawaiian island Maui . ‘All of a sudden, it was like Hollywood. You see the big jaws coming at you,’ Mariko said. ‘I can't say how terrifying that is.’ But Mariko, who was holidaying on the Hawaiian island, did not escape the scuffle unscathed. She needed 60 to 70 stitches in her hand after a punch slipped off the side of the tiger shark’s snout and into its jaws. Mariko was not bitten by the shark, but its razor-sharp teeth left a sizeable gash on her hand. Ouch: Mariko needed between 60 and 70 stitches after she landed a punch before her hand slipped into the shark's mouth . Brave: Mariko, a black belt in taekwondo, credits her martial arts training for teaching her how to throw a punch . A California surfer who survived a shark attack says he punched the beast in the head until it finally released him. Scott Stephens says the great white pulled him underwater on Tuesday at a popular surf spot and let him go only after receiving the blows to its head. Doctors say Stephens suffered at least seven deep lacerations, but none of his vital organs were damaged and was recovering well on Wednesday. The 25-year-old thanked the doctors who operated on him and strangers who came to his aid. Scott says the attack will not discourage him from getting back in the water and surfing again. ‘I punched it twice with this hand,’ she told ABC as she held up her bandaged wrist. She added: ‘I punched it this way, and that one contacted. But this (punch) kind of hit the side and slid into the mouth. ‘I credit my training in martial arts, my taekwondo, to prepare me to learn how to punch.’ After the shark had retreated, the couple, from Folsom, California, were able to swim safely to shore. Although Mariko thanks her quick reflexes and taekwondo training, Don believes the couple were fortunate to escape alive. He said: ‘I think we were really lucky.’ Tiger sharks, named because of the dark stripes found on the side of their bodies, have been known to attack humans before. These sharks have gained a reputation . for eating anything, and will target smaller fish, turtles and even . types of dolphin as food. But Don is refusing to let the terrifying experience he and Mariko endured keep them out of the sea for long. He . said: ‘I've always told my kids there's zero reasons to fear sharks . because what is scary is breast cancer. Breast cancer is scary. That is . one in eight. ‘Getting bitten by a shark is one in 4 million to visitors to Hawaii, so we should not have to worry at all.’ The one-two: Mariko hit the shark a couple of times before it decided to turn and swim away from the couple .

A close ally of former Arizona Representative Gabriel Giffords just secured a big win for their party and constituents, months after Giffords resigned due to a critical head wound from a near-fatal shooting in Tuscon. Democrat Ron Barber has won a full term representing Arizona's 2nd Congressional District, winning over Republican Martha McSally and giving Democrats a sweep of the state's three competitive races for U.S. House seats. Barber’s victory came as a recount of early-voting ballots began in a closely watched House race in Florida. Scroll down for video . Victory: Former Representative Gabrielle Giffords and Representative Ron Barber leave the the Pima County Recorder's Office in Tucson, Ariz., after turning in their early ballots on Monday, Nov. 5 . Voters in Arizona decisively picked Barber to fill out the remainder of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords term in a special election in June, but last week's election was for a full term and was so tight it took until Saturday before a winner was clear. Barber and McSally each held leads since election night, with a difference of only a few dozen votes at times, before Barber steadily began pulling ahead. By late Friday, Barber had a 1,402-vote margin with more than 285,000 votes cast in the race. Only about 15,000 provisional ballots remain to be counted in Pima County, although not all are in the 2nd District. An Associated Press analysis determined Barber's lead could not be overcome. Speaking out: Congressman Ron Barber speaks at a press conference following the sentencing of Jared Loughner in the Federal Court House in Tucson, Arizona November 8, 2012 . ‘I'm really proud and honored that I've been given another opportunity to serve,’ Barber told the AP on Saturday. ‘I never expected to be in Congress. When I won the special election I was thrilled about that and now I have two years to get some work done, and I really understand what the issues are nationally and locally and I'm going to be working hard on those.’ Barber said McSally called and congratulated him at midmorning, and conceded the race. McSally planned a 2 p.m. Saturday press conference in Tucson. Her campaign manager could not be immediately reached Saturday morning. Supportive colleague: Former U.S. congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords holds hands with her former aide, Democrat Ron Barber, as she appears in support of his bid at an election campaign event . Barber is Giffords' former district director and she endorsed his candidacy. He touted his lengthy history in the district, his moderate views and his strong backing for veterans and border security. He was with Giffords at a constituent meet-and-greet in Tucson in January 2011 when a mentally ill man, Jared Lee Loughner, opened fire, killing six and wounding 13 others. Giffords was hit in the head and ultimately had to step down from her seat, while Barber was hit in the thigh and cheek. McSally is a former Air Force pilot who was making her first run for political office. Her surprisingly close finish showed that the 2nd District remains a true swing district that either party can win with the right candidate. The district, which resembles Arizona's old 8th Congressional District before redistricting, covers parts of Tucson and Pima County and all of Cochise County. Barber's victory means Democrats have the majority of the state's congressional delegation, holding five of the state's nine U.S. House seats, while Republicans' only congressional victories in Arizona were in districts safe for GOP candidates. The Republicans had a 5-3 advantage in the state's U.S. House delegation going into the Nov. 6 election, which filled a new ninth seat. Democrat Krysten Sinema won the new Phoenix-area 9th District over former Paradise Valley mayor Vernon Parker, while Democrat Ann Kirkpatrick regained her old congressional seat by beating Republican Jonathan Paton in the 1st District. With Rep. Jeff Flake's victory over Democrat Richard Carmona, Republicans will continue to hold both of the state's U.S. House seats. Barber said he was not surprised that the race was so tight, considering the state redistricting commission intentionally designed it and two others — the ones won by Sinema and Kirkpatrick — to be winnable by either party. The other five Arizona congressional seats are basically winnable by only one party, four Republican seats and two Democratic. ‘We just worked really hard to get our message out, and to make sure that we could say who we are and what I'm about to voters,’ he said.

In a tragic off-season accident a 24-year-old woman working at the Alpine Meadows ski resort has died from injuries she suffered while skiing in the back-country near Lake Tahoe. Annalise Kjolhede sustained injuries to her head and neck after a 'serious incident' on Saturday. She was taken to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno, where she died on Tuesday. Thousands of tributes for the popular ski instructor were posted onto an online memorial page and the friends and family of the University of Rochester graduate held a commemoration service for her at the ski resort where she coached children. Annalise Kjolhede died from injuries she suffered in an accident while skiing in the backcountry near Lake Tahoe . Alpine Meadows doesn't officially open until December 7th but a spokesman for the resort Amelie Richmond said that because the ski-runs are mostly on U.S. Forest Service land they are open for public use. 'Alpine Meadows operates on forest service land,' Squaw Valley spokeswoman Amelie Richmond said. 'With few exceptions, it is open for public use. Meaning that over these past few weeks skiers and riders have been allowed to access the land despite the fact that the ski resort was not open.' The University of Rochester graduate was a member of Alpine Meadow's Kids Ski School and was taking advantage of the fact that skiers are able to treat the resorts runs as if they were hiking in a national park. The popular University of Rochester graduate was skiing with two friends when she suffered a freak fall on her skis . 'You can go skiing almost anywhere on forest service land,' said Dan Morris. 'It’s just like backpacking or hiking. You have to know the conditions and use due diligence.' The Unofficialalpine.com website updated their page with an update that said Kjolhede was skiing 'somewhere near Wolverine Bowl' when she suffered a 'traumatic brain injury' after hitting a 'submerged rock'. In a tribute page set up on Caring Bridge for Annalise, her mother Anna recounted the sudden accident her daughter suffered on the Californian slopes while skiing with two friends. 'She took a run to the left, went over a bump, fell and her head slid into a submerged rock,' said the post written by the distraught mother. 'She struck the left side of her face and head (she was wearing a helmet). And she was motionless, head (sic) downhill and her body arched backward because her ski is (sic) were caught in the snow. 'This is also the position that potentially kinked her neck and altered her breathing.' Majestic: Alpine Meadows ski resort, with a fog-shrouded Lake Tahoe, California, in the background .

'It helps me to know that Annalise was doing what she loved on a beautiful day at Alpine Meadows and she was happy,' wrote her mother Anna, who is a pediatrician. One friend of the family wrote a touching message despairing at the Kjolhede family's loss. 'Our hearts are broken!  We pray that Annalise's beautiful spirit will guide you in the healing process, remembering her smile and the way she lived her life.' Following her death -friends and family of Annalise gathered for a memorial celebration of her life at the Alpine Meadows resort . Following the popular students death, the University of Rochester issued a message praising Annalise. 'She was an exceptional student and will be missed tremendously,' said the statement. 'Annalise was a wonderful part of our campus community, and our thoughts and sympathies go out to Annalise’s family and friends at this time.' Following her death, her colleagues at Alpine Meadows held a commemoration service for Annalise and the resort lamented her passing.

A group of nude protesters marched to their courthouse on Wednesday to file a lawsuit against the city and county of San Francisco. They aim to stop city leaders from passing a law which would stop them appearing naked in public. Scroll down for video . Fighting for their rights: Nudists march past City Hall during a rally against a proposed law which would ban nudity in San Francisco . Under the law a first-time citation for nudity would mean a fine of up to $100. A second instance could lead to a $200 fine, while a third means a fine of up to $500 and the possibility of a year in prison. The nudists say the proposed law violates their right to freedom of speech. Scott Wiener, a city supervisor representing the Castro District, introduced the proposal which would stop backsides and genitals being exposed in public. Exempt from the law would be naked breasts and children under five, as well as events permitted by the city - including the annual gay pride parade. Punishment: The law would see nudists fined up to $100 for one violation, $200 for two and $500 with a potential prison sentence of a year for three . Former stripper turned stay-at-home mother of three, Gypsy Taub, is a plaintiff in the case. She also hosts a television show called 'My Naked Truth' on which both she and her guests go unclothed. The 43-year-old said: 'Being naked is a birth-given freedom, not a crime.' At a public hearing related to the new law on November 5 Ms Taub stripped while speaking and was led away by security. VIDEO: Gypsy Taub strips during a public hearing Warning - contains nudity . She wrote about it later: 'I have had it with sexual repression. I have had it with puritanism. I have had it with hypocrisy. 'I have had it with snotty stale dudes in suits telling me what I am allowed and not allowed to wear, inhale, enjoy, believe. 'Scott Wiener really tipped the scale. I came to his hearing and ripped my clothes off to prove to everybody that nobody is going to die if I do that. Opposites: Scott Wiener (left) says nudity in San Francisco has caused 'anger and frustration', while Woody Miller (right) is one of the nude protestors . 'Any victims reported? Did anybody need an ambulance? Does anybody need therapy now that they saw me naked?' Ms Taub continued: 'First of all, I had the biggest blast doing it! I would do it every day if I could. I felt so much joy after this act of civil disobedience, I can't begin to tell you.' Discussion: Michael Sundin, of Napa, talks with fellow nudists following the march . She added: 'It was so much fun to yell at Scott Wiener and call him a fascist right to his face. I wish I could do this to Hitler! The audience loved it.' Mr Wiener introduced the ordinance in October and said that nudity had caused a lot of anger and frustration in San Francisco. 'We’ve always had random and sporadic public nudity in San Francisco, and no one had a problem with that,' he said. 'In the last two years, things have changed. In the Castro, in particular, we now have men who take their clothes off and hang out every day of the week, and that has caused a lot of anger and frustration in the neighborhood.' Leaving: Nudist George Davis (left), of San Francisco, is asked to leave the US Federal Court Building after a police officer cited required clothing rules . 'The city is trying to legislate against . the naturalness of the naked body, and that is wrong,' said George . Davis, 66, another plaintiff. Mr Davis, who runs a website for 'urban nudists', has campaigned naked while running unsuccessfully for mayor and city supervisor in recent years and estimates he spends 120 days a year naked in public. 'I’d go more, but I get uncomfortable if it’s too cold or foggy,' he explained. 'Nude is not lewd,' Mr Davis added. 'That is our mantra.' Words of wisdom: Rusty Mills, of San Francisco, speaks to fellow nudists during the march . Christina DiEdoardo, the group's lawyer, said: 'The city is overstepping its authority. 'The act of being naked is not enough to be obscene or indecently exposed under California law.' The board of supervisors will vote on the measure next week but the nudists asked for a preliminary injunction to stop the law being implemented if it is passed until after their claims that it violates their rights are considered by a judge. One law which was passed last year saw nude citizens having to place a barrier, a towel for example, between their bare backsides and any public seats. Delay: The group want an injunction against the proposed law if it is passed next week, until their case is heard by a judge . Not obscene: The group's lawyer says the act of being naked is not enough to be judged 'indecently exposed' or 'obscene'","Law would see them fined increasing amounts with a third strike resulting in prison sentence of up to a year .

High street stores have slammed Brussels over decision to impose a 'Crockery Tax' on cheap cups, plates and bowls imported from China. A new duty will come into force within 24 hours and add between 17.6per cent and 58.8per cent to the wholesale dockside price of the cheap imports. This could feed through to a 20 per cent increase in the price of a basic set of dinner plates, side plates and bowls in the shops. Some 80 per cent of all British and European imports of crockery come from China, which benefits from low wages and production costs. The tax is expected to add £230million to importers' costs . The British Retail Consortium(BRC) warned that the increase will inevitably drive up shop prices, particularly for value crockery which appeals to households on a tight budget. The move by the European Commission is the latest in a number of trade measures designed to protect manufacturers in Europe against competition from cheap Chinese imports. Other targets have included shoes, bicycles, candles and even ironing boards. However, the net effect is to add to the cost of living for families hit by big increases in the cost of essentials from heat and light to food and petrol. It will also further drive up inflation in the UK, which is already rising more quickly than the incomes of many households. Anger at the move has been exacerbated because the Commission has given importers just 24 hours' notice of the new taxes. The duties are the result of a nine-month investigation by the Commission into claims by an anonymous European manufacturer that Chinese producers are selling these into the EU at artificially low prices. The EU market for ceramic tableware and kitchenware is worth £1.2billion with around half of that made up of products imported from China. It is estimated that the duties will add £230million to importers' costs which will be passed on to customers. The new is supposed to protect EU producers but will negatively impact high street retailers . Director general of the BRC, Stephen Robertson, said: 'This is the wrong decision badly handled. The principle here is that free trade is good for the customer. 'Let's be clear – these new duties will feed through to higher prices in stores. And, because China mainly supplies the value end of the market, they will deny less well-off customers access to affordable crockery.' He added: 'The irony is; making hard-pressed customers pay more will do nothing to support European producers who don't have the capacity to produce enough at low enough prices. 'Our members tell us that the only alternative for them, if they're forced to look elsewhere, will be to source from other low-cost Asian countries. 'What is particularly galling is that the European Commission – unelected Eurocrats – pressed ahead with this tax despite the majority of member states, including the UK, voting against. 'The way officials are treating businesses engaged in nearly three quarter of a billion euros of trade is utterly unacceptable. 'How can companies be expected to plan millions of pounds worth of buying with no certainty about whether their costs will rocket overnight?' The British Ceramics Confederation, which speaks for UK manufacturers, said the decision by the European Commission could help boost UK production and jobs. Its chief executive, Dr Laura Cohen, said: 'A lot of manufacturing was outsourced to China about eight to ten years ago.

The Royal Navy’s £1billion new hunter-killer submarine is riddled with technical problems and cannot sprint away from an attack, it was claimed last night. HMS Astute, supposed to be the most advanced ever built in Britain, has suffered problems with the propulsion which means it cannot reach its top speed. One source described the vessel as having 'a V8 engine with a Morris Minor gearbox'. Troubled: A diagram of HMS Astute revealing its catalogue of technical complaints . Warship: The Royal Navy submarine HMS Astute has been beset by design issues . The nuclear-powered submarine, which . is the first of a set of seven and is not yet formally ready, was 'launched' in 2007 by its patron the Duchess of Cornwall. But the warship - dubbed 'HMS Calamity' - has since been beset by misfortune - including a navigation . error which led to it running aground in 2010, and the murder of an . officer on-board in 2011 by a junior member of the crew. Yesterday a catalogue of technical failings were also revealed, including complaints that the periscope does not provide good enough images. The Guardian said there had been . complaints that the periscope, which goes up and down but carries a camera to beam pictures down into the vessel, was simply projecting images of waves washing over the camera. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) had stated that the submarine would be able to make 29 knots, but it has reportedly failed to achieve this. Stealthy: HMS Astute was hailed as a technological marvel when it was launched in 2010 . The issue is said to have been caused because - rather than building a new power plant for Astute - the MoD opted to use the reactor used in the much bigger Vanguard-class Trident submarines. HMS Astute also had to perform an emergency surfacing during a routine dive because of flooding, the Guardian reported. Other concerns highlighted include corrosion and the replacement or moving of computer circuit boards because they did not meet safety standards. The MoD confirmed the latter had not been fitted according to Naval Engineering Standards and have since been reinstalled. Responding to corrosion problems, which were identified on Astute and the second Astute class submarine HMS Ambush, a spokesman said: 'All Royal Navy submarines are subject to a continuous, thorough assessment of their components to minimise the risk of corrosion.' Concerns were also raised over the wrong type of lead being used in its nuclear reactor monitoring instruments, although the MoD said it would have no effect on the accuracy of any readings or any impact on the submarine's operation. On the issue of the submarine's propulsion and speed, the authority said it would not comment, although it explained any issues would be examined and used to improve the other submarines in production. The spokesman added: 'HMS Astute’s sea trials were designed to rigorously test all aspects of the submarine to meet the exacting standards required for operations. Grand opening: The Duchess of Cornwall with the Bishop of Carlisle and . BAE System's managing director of submarine solutions Murray Easton in . Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, where she launched the vessel . Powerful: Britain's first 'super-sub' HMS Astute when it was first launched . Weapon: The missile storage room of 'jinxed' vessel HMS Astute, which had to be fixed after a series of technical faults . ‘It is normal for first of class . trials to identify areas where modifications are required and these are . then incorporated into later vessels of the class. ‘These will be the most . technologically advanced submarines ever to serve with the Royal Navy . and will provide an outstanding capability for decades to come.’ It . is understood that the leakage incident, which happened during . exercises off the east coast of the United States, saw several litres of . sea water entering the submarine . A . Ministry of Defence spokesman said of the incident: 'During . trials last year HMS Astute experienced a leak which was immediately . isolated and the submarine returned safely to the surface. Calamity: HMS Astute after it ran aground . off the Isle of Skye in . October 2010 . Able Seaman Ryan Donovan (left), who was handed a life sentence for shooting Lieutenant Commander Ian Molyneux (right). He was reportedly angry over losing the chance of deployment on a surface ship after disobeying an order to help scrub HMS Astute. 'An investigation found one small part which had not been made of the correct material had corroded. 'A replacement was fitted at sea and the submarine continued with her programme. 'BAE Systems has carried out a full assessment which concluded all similar parts were fitted correctly.' Each of the the seven vessels, which are all due to be completed in . 2024, costs £1.3billion. With their new capabilities, they have been designed to progressively replace the Trafalgar Class currently in service. HMS Astute is yet to start formal service. Tragic: Police at the scene in Southampton docks after the fatal shooting . The HMS Astute is the first of new seven boats designed to bring the Royal Navy into a new era of seafaring. Eight were originally commissioned, but only seven will be made due to budget restrictions. The National Audit Office (NAO)  last year warned of the spiralling cost of the Astute programme. HMS Astute was supposed to have been . launched in 2005, but technical difficulties pushed back its completion until 2009. The NAO are predicting the programme is now . almost £2bn over budget. It also said that each of the Astute class submarines will . be 28 months late, with the seventh boat not being in service for . another decade. BAE Systems, which is responsible for . building the Astute fleet, told the Guardian: 'Safety is of paramount . importance to every stage of the design, build, test and trials of a . submarine and is at the heart of everything we do. 'Before entering full service, every . submarine is required to complete an exhaustive period of sea trials, . which are designed to prove the vessel's capabilities. 'These trials also present an . opportunity to improve performance by resolving any issues that may come . to light during this time, which is not uncommon on a first-of-class . submarine.' The technical failings are the latest in a series of misfortunes in the ship's short history. When it ran aground in October 2010, it emerged the commander was taking a shower only minutes before. The embarrassing detail was included in an official inquiry which found a catalogue of errors had led to the incident. It was also revealed the officer on the bridge at the time was not using the correct radar, did not have a chart and was not used to navigating in the dark. The Navy's humiliation was compounded when a rescue vessel crashed into HMS Astute, causing even more damage. The cost of repairs to the sub is understood to have run into hundreds of millions of pounds. Above water: HMS Astute leaving Barrow-in-Furness in 2009 for the first of her sea trials . Nobody was court martialled over the . incident, but the Navy said three officers had been disciplined. The . Ministry of Defence refused to name those who were blamed, but Cdr . Coles, 47, lost his post a month after the incident. Last . year, Able Seaman Ryan Samuel Donovan, admitted murdering Lt Cdr Ian . Molyneux, 36, of Wigan, Greater Manchester, on the submarine. Sentencing him, a judge at Winchester Crown Court told Donovan, 22, of Hillside Road, Dartford, Kent, that he must serve at least 25 years . Donovan also admitted the attempted murders of Lt Cdr Hodge, 45, Petty Officer Christopher Brown, 36, and Chief Petty Officer David McCoy, 37. At work: HMS Astute's crew carrying out checks on the warship's missiles prior to them being loaded (file picture) The court heard how he was resentful after after being told he would not be attached to the . Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Cardigan Bay because he had disobeyed orders to clean . part of the submarine. The incident cast a shadow over a ship that was intended as the forebear of a new generation of billion pound machines set to bring the Royal Navy into the 21st century. In spite of being four years late and £900million over-budget, HMS Astute was hailed a technological marvel when she was first unveiled to the public in 2007. With machinery more complex than a space shuttle, and the ability to circumnavigate the globe without surfacing, the 7,400-ton piece of equipment was the largest and deadliest hunter-killer submarine ever built. As long as a football pitch, at 318ft, and as wide as four double-decker buses, it was a third longer than any sub which had gone before. In spite of its speed, the stealth warship makes less noise than a baby dolphin, making it undetectable to enemy ships. Her sonar is so advanced that if she was lying in the English Channel she would be able to detect ships leaving New York harbour 3,000 nautical miles away, although the details of how this is done are classified. The sub carries 38 Tomahawk cruise missiles, with a range of 1,240 miles, and can attack targets in North Africa with pinpoint accuracy while sitting off the coast of Plymouth.

A former police inspector killed his wife and six-year-old daughter before stabbing himself with a kitchen knife a week after he being sacked from his force, an inquest was told today. Toby Day, 37, strangled and stabbed wife Samantha, 38, and six-year-old daughter Genevieve before turning the knife on himself. Day also attacked his two older children Kimberley, 16, and Adam, 14, with a knife at their home in Melton Mowbray last December. Kimberley was stabbed in the neck but managed to escape and raise the alarm at her nearby school. Her younger brother was found in time and survived a stab wound to the chest. Tragic: Toby Day, second from left, stabbed and strangled six-year-old daughter Genevieve, far left. and wife Samantha, second from right. Children Kimberley, 16, and Adam, 14, whose identities have been protected, were both also stabbed but survived the attack . Devastated: It is believed former Leicestershire Police inspector Toby Day, right, rowed with wife Samantha, pictured left on holiday in August 2011, before the attack began . Both children were at the hearing today, accompanied by members of their family. The coroner for Rutland and North Leicestershire Trevor Kirkman said: 'No one here or in the wider community could fail to have been touched by these tragic incidents.' He recorded a verdict of unlawful killing for Samantha and Genevieve and one of dying at his own hands for Day. The inquest was told that Day had appeared before a disciplinary panel and been dismissed from Leicestershire Police for misconduct a week before the attack on December 8 last year. The nature of the misconduct was not . revealed during the inquest but reports at the time said he had been . sacked for misusing police systems and matters 'concerning honesty and . integrity'. Detective Inspector Matthew Healey, from Nottinghamshire Police, told the hearing that on the day of the attacks the couple had met nursery worker Samantha's parents for coffee before dropping their youngest child at school. While they shopped, Day was told that newspapers had contacted Leicestershire Police asking for information about his dismissal. Later that day, officers were called to the family home after Kimberley ran to Swallowdale School having been stabbed in the neck. Sacked: Former Leicestershire Police inspector Toby Day turned on his family days after being sacked from the force . Raised the alarm: Oldest daughter Kimberley managed to escape to her nearby school and call the police, who set up a cordon around the family home and tried to negotiate with Day . Home: Day, Samantha and Genevieve were discovered in an upstairs bedroom at their house in Melton Mowbray. Teenage son Adam was found downstairs and survived his injuries . Misconduct: Hours before they died, Day had been told newspapers were asking about the reason for his dismissal from the police force - believed to be misconduct of misusing police systems and matters 'concerning honesty and integrity' A police cordon was placed around the house as officers tried to negotiate with Day. When armed police forced their way in about an hour after the alarm was raised they found Adam in the living room with a stab wound to the chest. His mother and younger sister were found on a double bed in an upstairs bedroom. The former inspector was found on the floor next to them, with a kitchen knife in his hand. The inquest was told Samantha died from strangulation and stab wounds. She also had marks on her eye that Home Office pathologist Guy Rutty was caused by an 'initial assault' earlier in the day. He said it was believed Samantha may have already died or been unconscious when she was stabbed four times. Professor Rutty said Genevieve died from three stab wounds to the left hand side of her chest. However, he added that ligature strangulation was a contributory factor. After killing his wife and daughter, Day then stabbed himself six times in the chest. The hearing heard how during a search of the property police found a second knife, with Samantha’s blood on it, in the dishwasher. Genevieve and her older sister and brother were taken to Queen’s Medical Centre for treatment but the six-year-old was confirmed dead at the hospital. 'Deep care': Mother Samantha, left, pictured with Kimberley. The 16-year-old managed to escape and raise the alarm . Hospital: Kimberley, whose identity has been protected in the picture with her mother Samantha, spent ten days recovering in hospital, as did her brother Adam . The hearing heard no one else was arrested in connection with the deaths. Summing up, the coroner said: 'To say the least - and this is a dramatic understatement - the evidence is very traumatic. 'It’s difficult for anyone dealing with it and it is almost unimaginable to think of the thoughts of the family who seek to come to terms with the events. 'It is a case that causes particular anguish because of the circumstances.' Adam looked at the floor while Kimberley stared straight ahead as the coroner read out his verdict. The coroner added to members of the family at the hearing: 'No-one affected by these events will ever forget what has happened but I hope you will be able to journey on with the help and support.' Addressing Adam and Kimberley, he said: 'I hope in some way that hearing what happened at first hand will help you to move forward. 'It’s hard to imagine anything much more traumatic than this.' Speaking after the verdict today, Canon Lee Francis Dehqani, the family’s parish priest and vicar of Oakham, said: 'It is now over 11 months since the tragic death of these parishioners. In all this time I have been conscious of the resilience of the family and their deep care for one another.' He said the inquest is 'one more step' in their battle to come to terms with the deaths. Deputy Chief Constable Simon Evans, of Leicestershire Police, said the deaths were 'truly tragic, in every sense of the word.'","Former Leicestershire Police inspector Toby Day was sacked days before killings for misconduct .

He has admitted charges against him . Former Shameless and EastEnders actor Jody Latham has admitted growing cannabis and has been told he could face jail. Latham, 30, was due to face trial after growing 24 plants worth about £14,000 at an address in Bacup, Lancashire, in May 2011. But he entered a last minute guilty plea at Burnley Crown Court today. He is due to be sentenced on 17 December and has been told he could face up to a year in prison. His former girlfriend and accomplice Sarah Melia, 31, of Cotman Close, Bacup, has admitted allowing cannabis to be grown on a premises. Pre-sentence reports are now being prepared on her and Latham, who was once romantically linked to X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos. The actor, played 'Lip' Gallagher in Channel 4 drama Shameless and also starred as pimp Rob Grayson in the BBC soap EastEnders. He was arrested in May after up to 24 plants were found behind a false wall inside a garage at a house in Bacup. Burnley Crown Court was told Latham was growing the drug at Melia’s home and she allowed it to go on. Latham, who has a caution for producing cannabis, apparently had a 'bad' addiction to the drug at the time but had since had weekly treatment at The Priory. The hearing was told the prosecution had alleged 24 cannabis plants, worth about £14,000, were being grown. But Latham claims there were 16 plants worth £9,820. Latham of Market Street, Bacup, who has convictions for assault and threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, admitted producing cannabis between March 31 and May 14 2011. Melia, 31, of Cotman Close, Bacup, pleaded guilty to permitting premises at Acre Park to be used for the production of the drug, between the same dates. Both were unconditionally bailed until sentence at the court on December 17. Judge Beverley Lunt told the actor he could be sent to jail, for a maximum of 12 months. She added: 'I am not saying I will. I need to know more about you.' Facing prison: Jody Latham (blue shirt) arriving at Burnley Magistrates Court in Lancashire alongside Sarah Melia . The star first shot to fame as Lip Gallagher in Shameless (left). He has since starred in Holby City (right) and EastEnders .

Asked by Wayne Jackson, Latham's lawyer, if she knew who she was dealing with, Judge Lunt said: 'I know nothing about him. 'Am I supposed to know something about him? I have never heard of Shameless. I have heard of EastEnders.' The actor’s career took off at the age of 12 when he was spotted during performances at Burley Youth Theatre. He played the intelligent and outspoken eldest son of Frank Gallagher in Channel 4’s acclaimed drama Shameless between 2004 and 2008. He appeared as Grayson in EastEnders between February and March last year. But he has also starred in ITV’s The Fixer and had a stint as a trainee chef in Gordon Ramsay’s Hell’s Kitchen.","Entered a last minute guilty plea at Burnley Crown Court today .

A brave teenage girl today told of how her father raped her in a sickening attack when she visited him for the weekend. Twisted Robert Hawksworth, 54, plied daughter Emily, then 17, with wine at his Derbyshire home before putting her to bed and then climbing in with her. The teenager had been sexually abused by Hawksworth since the age of 14, but had remained silent until the rape last year, when she reported the crime to the police. Sick: Emily Hawksworth, left on her 18th birthday, was plied with wine by her father Robert, right, before he attacked her in June last year . The 18-year-old, whose parents divorced when she was seven, has now waived her right to anonymity to bravely speak out about her ordeal to help other teenagers in similar situations. 'When I woke up in the morning I felt sick and I felt like something had happened,' said Emily, who was a virgin until the horrifying attack. 'I felt violated. 'I stayed in bed all day and on the Sunday he kept asking me to go to town with him and make me take the Pill. 'I refused to take it because I did not want to believe what had happened. 'I was blunt with him and I didn't want the conversation to be brought up. 'When I went home on the Sunday night, I wasn't going to say anything to my mum but as soon as I walked in I burst into tears. 'She knew something had happened so I told her. She was distraught and rang the police.' On Wednesday Hawksworth, who denied rape and sexual assault, was caged for nine years after a trial at Derby Crown Court. Moving forward: The teenager, who was a virgin until the attack last year, has burnt all photos and gifts from him and is changing her surname from deed poll . Emily said she had not initially reported what had happened because she felt scared. 'I was young at the time,' she said. 'I did not know how to handle it.' Hawksworth, from Findern, Derbyshire, denied raping his daughter when he was arrested, forcing her to give evidence at his trial. Closure: Emily's father denied rape and sexual assault but was caged for nine years at Derby Crown Court on Wednesday . Jailing him, Judge John Burgess told Hawksworth: 'She was visiting you as she regularly did for the weekend. 'During the course of that Friday evening you and she were drinking both wine and cider, alcohol you provided. 'She became very drunk and was very sick. You tended to her and she was put to bed. 'During the night you came into her room, removed her underwear and had full sex. 'She was a virgin until that happened. This was a gross breach of trust and the violation of a vulnerable girl.' Hawksworth split up with Emily's mother in 2001 after he subjected her to an 'extremely abusive' relationship, the court heard. Today Emily's mother Karen Atalay, 53, described her daughter's ordeal as 'terrible and heart-breaking'. She said: 'I felt quite guilty. I felt it was my fault. 'My marriage to him [Robert] was extremely abusive but I was too frightened to tell anybody anything. 'I'm relieved that at last we have some justice. 'We have all found it very hard to lead a normal life. 'I think we have got through the worst but we are just trying to come to terms with what has happened.'

Not so Radio 1’s Nick Grimshaw, the station’s latest breakfast show presenter. Grimshaw, 28, has been in the job for barely a few weeks but he has already caused outrage with a series of foul-mouthed comments on his Twitter account. As a result, parents have set up an online petition claiming he is a poor role model for younger fans. Foul-mouthed remarks: Nick Grimshaw (pictured left with Kate Moss and right with Pixie Geldof) has caused outrage on Twitter. Parents have set up an online petition claiming he is a bad role model for younger fans . In one recent tweet to his 680,000 followers, the presenter wrote: ‘Guess what I want for Breakfast? A TOTAL MINDF***.’ The Facebook group – Get Grimmy off the Radio by Xmas – now has more than 700 members. Campaigner Richard Sherwood, 28, who has been a Radio 1 listener all his life said: ‘This particular comment was brought to my attention by a friend’s 13-year-old daughter who was until recently a fan of Nick Grimshaw. ‘Like a lot of youngsters she wants to know everything she can about the celebs she follows. She stumbled across this comment on Twitter and was very shocked. She showed it to her father who passed it to me.’ Mr Sherwood, a male nurse, added: ‘He’s supposed to be a role model for kids but using this sort of language is surely inappropriate’. In other tweets, Grimshaw – known to his fans as Grimmers – makes an unsavoury reference to Lily Allen and Lewis Hamilton. Outrage: Parents are disgusted at the Radio 1 DJ's comments . The row came as the radio presenter joined the BBC’s biggest stars to broadcast to millions for Children in Need. Father-of-one Ben Baker, who helped set up the Facebook group, said: ‘As a dad I’ve got to say I’m pretty concerned he’s saying this sort of thing on Twitter and that kids can very easily read it.’ Mr Baker, 34, a club DJ, continued: ‘We have nothing against Nick Grimshaw personally but don’t think he’s right for this show. The BBC have got a lot wrong here – they’re alienating listeners and upsetting parents who pay the licence fee.’ The changeover demonstrates how obsessed with young audiences the BBC are, he added. ‘A lot of people in our group have listened to Radio 1 for years. They’re in their 20s but now feel they are no longer welcome at the station as listeners. They’re too young to go to Radio 2 so where do they go?’ In an emailed response to Mr Sherwood, Radio 1 content manager Chris Humphrys said: ‘Radio 1 has a very clear social media policy to distinguish between “official” BBC accounts on services like Facebook and Twitter – which we ensure meet our expected editorial standards – and individuals’ private pages. As such, we do not regulate Nick’s personal comments, but we will certainly pass your concerns on to him and remind him of the need to be aware that he is likely to be attracting new, sometimes younger, followers.’ As they are in a personal capacity, Grimshaw’s tweets are apparently not covered by new regulations to stop staff making online comments about the broadcaster’s current problems. Grimshaw took over from Chris Moyles as the breakfast host in September and has had a rocky transition. He has been pictured out boozing with celebrity friends such as One Direction star Harry Styles and socialite Pixie Geldof, just hours before the early morning radio show. And earlier this month he caused uproar when he declared that Robbie Williams was too old for Radio 1. In an interview with 5 News, he said the pop star was ‘irrelevant’ to his listeners. Williams has topped the charts with both his latest single, Candy and his album Take the Crown. A BBC spokesman said: ‘Nick has proved incredibly popular since taking over the Breakfast Show and we have received lots of positive feedback among our target audience. There has been one comment regarding language on Nick’s personal Twitter feed which has been raised with him.’","He has only been in the job a few weeks but has already caused outrage .

In an age where games focus on showcasing feats of graphical accomplishment, it's refreshing when a series pumps all its energy into gameplay. Enter Just Dance 4, the latest of the successful saga where players mimic dance moves that appear on screen - scoring points related to their accuracy. Colourful: The game boasts a wonderful artistic style, backed up with fun gameplay. Some may find, however, that is too similar to the other Just Dance games. Thankfully, Ubisoft have ensured there are plenty of songs worth dancing to. Classics such as Elvis Presley's Jailhouse Rock feature, while newer pop hits from the likes of One Direction and Flo Rida ensure plenty of variation. Some songs, however, are covers, and this can jar with the overall high-quality feel of the game. All of the songs are available from the start, with unlockable playlists, alternative dance routines and more attainable with sufficient mojo - the game's equivalent of experience points. Immediately noticeable is just how well the game works with the Kinect. Often navigating menus in this way is cumbersome, but Just Dance's virtual hand works wonderfully, letting you jump from track to track with minimum interruption. Gameplay is strong, too. Best played with friends, there are a number of songs with dance routines tailored to up to four players. Dance Battle sees two dancers battle through a series of songs, each with their own health bar, which diminishes when they lose a round. Dance Mash Up allows you take on routines from the previous games, using the updated track list. But the real star of the show is the Just Sweat mode. Here, calories as counted as you dance to the tracks, telling you how many have been burned. There are pre-made workouts, but you can also make your own - enhancing longevity, and providing an attractive option for those scared off by workout-specific games. This is made all the more enjoyable with the game's wonderful, cartoon-esque visuals. It's a shame, then, that Just Dance 4 may leave some wanting more. Ubisoft have promised plenty of downloadable content, however, the game simply emulates its predecessors' recipe, without adding any new ingredients - new game modes, for example. But why change a winning formula? For this remains a brilliant family game...and a perfect stocking filler this Christmas.

A self-confessed 'loner' has been arrested after planning to launch a murderous shooting spree in a movie theatre during the opening weekend of the new Twilight film. Blaec Lammers had already bought a ticket to a screening of Breaking Dawn Part 2 in Bolivar, Missouri on Sunday night, and was stockpiling weapons to use in his assault. The 20-year-old admitted to police that he was inspired by a number of well-publicised mass shootings, such as James Holmes' attack on a theatre showing The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado in July. Arrested: Blaec Lammers, 20, is accused of planning to launch shooting sprees in Bolivar, Missouri . 'Mentally ill': The 20-year-old is said to have suffered from depression and been off his medication . Lammers was reported to police by his mother yesterday, according to the Springfield News-Leader, after she became concerned when he bought two guns despite never having been shooting before. She said they reminded her of the weapons used in the Aurora shooting, in which 12 audience members were killed, and feared her son might be planning a similar atrocity. He voluntarily attended an interview with Bolivar police, and initially claimed that he had bought the guns in order to go hunting. But when officers brought up well-known gun massacres, Lammers 'stated that he had a lot in common with the people that have been involved in those shootings', according to a police report. He also described himself as 'quiet' and 'kind of a loner', and admitted that he had been plagued with 'homicidal thoughts'. 'Quiet': The suspect described himself as a 'loner' and admitted he had had 'homicidal thoughts' Lammers then confessed he had bought two assault rifles and 400 rounds of ammunition with the intention of shooting movie-goers at the Twilight screening on Sunday, to which he had already bought a ticket. He visited a nearby town earlier this week to practice shooting at a range. The suspect also said he was thinking about going to the local branch of Walmart to 'just start shooting people at random', so that he would have access to extra ammunition if he ran out of bullets. On Friday morning, Lammers was charged with first-degree assault, making a terrorist threat and armed criminal action, according to court documents. Death: Lammers had bought a ticket to the new Twilight film where he planned to launch his massacre . Inspiration: Lammers planned to imitate James Holmes, who killed 12 movie-goers in Aurora, Colorado . 'Thankfully we had a responsible family member or we might have had a different outcome,' Bolivar police chief Steve Hamilton said. He said Lammers is under a doctor's care for mental illness, and court documents said he was 'off of his medication.' Mr Hamilton said it appeared that Lammers obtained the firearms legally but that police were continuing to investigate 'to determine how in fact he was able to obtain a permit.' Ashley Miller, who lives in a nearby town, said she has known Lammers for about a year and described him as 'one of the sweetest guys I had ever met' but 'very emotional,' noting he would periodically stop talking to her. She said he told her that he had bounced between relatives growing up. As an adult, he bounced between girlfriends, she said. 'He was never actually happy,' she added. 'I think he had depression or something.'","Blaec Lammers said he was inspired by recent reports of mass shootings .

Security-conscious: George Harrison's widow Olivia had applied to install razor wire fencing outside her Oxfordshire mansion . George Harrison's wife has been forced to abandon attempts to erect more razor wire around her mansion amid anger from neighbours who claim it makes the exclusive area resemble a 'war zone'. The late Beatle's widow Olivia Harrison had applied to the council for permission to install galvanised razor wire on a section of the fence surrounding her palatial Oxfordshire home, but was told the unsightly security measure had 'no place' in Henley-on-Thames. It is the second time Mrs Harrison has clashed with neighbours on the issue; three years ago actor Rodney Bewes objected to the 64-year-old's plan to renew an existing 1,000 yard section of razor wire on top of a tall fence, claiming it had 'nearly killed' his cat, Maurice. Mr Bewes, who played Bob Ferris in the comedy series The Likely Lads, said at the time that injuries to his pet had cost him thousands in vet bills, and added that he knew of several other neighbourhood cats that had been 'practically gored' on the wire fence at £20million Friar Park. 'It makes me sad when I come home to this beautiful place and see this thing that makes it look like a war-zone, the actor said in 2009. Security-conscious Mrs Harrison is . said to remain haunted by a terrifying break-in at Friar Park in 1999, . when she fought off a schizophrenic who stabbed her husband . in the chest. Mr Harrison was stabbed seven times in the chest in a frenzied attack that ended only when his wife knocked the intruder, Michael Abram, unconscious with an oil lamp. Abram was later found not guilty of attempted murder by reason of insanity, and was sent to a secure psychiatric hospital. He was released in 2002. Razor wire fencing was erected around the sprawling mansion following the attack as a means of deterring any further trespassers. George Harrison died of cancer in 2001.

A property tycoon, once estimated to be worth more than £400m, has been ordered to disclose his true assets or go to jail after claiming he is too poor to pay his wife’s divorce settlement. Scot Young, who made a fortune as a fixer for British businessmen and Russian Oligarchs, has been accused by wife Michele, 48, of hiding ‘enormous assets’ to get out of paying the £30,000 a month she had been awarded. Mr Young, 51, who once owned a dazzling portfolio of properties, claims he has been left penniless after a large Moscow real estate deal collapsed. Acrimonious: Former property Tycoon Scot Young, 51, has been accused of hiding his true wealth by his estranged wife Michelle, 48,  during their bitter and long-running divorce settlement . But at a High Court hearing this week, he was ordered to make a full financial disclosure or serve the six month sentence originally handed to him in 2009 which was then suspended. He has been ordered to produce tax returns and complete a detailed questionnaire on his finances and told to return to court mid January when he could face jail. The bitter divorce hearing, one of the biggest in British legal history, has been rumbling on since 2006. The couple once owned some of the finest homes in England, fabulous cars and a yacht in Monaco. They travelled the world by private jet and were waited on by a battalion of servants. New love: Mr Young has since fallen for 29-year-old model Noelle Reno, who he has reportedly promised to marry once he gets through the acrimonious divorce battle . Once, Mr Young bought his wife a Range . Rover filled with tens of thousands of pounds worth of couture dresses . by designer Maria Grachvogel. For her 40th birthday, he lavished her . with £1 million worth of Graff diamond jewellery. But the couple, who have two daughters, separated in 2006 after 11 years of marriage. He . has now fallen for 29-year-old model Noelle Reno, who he has reportedly . promised to marry once he gets through the acrimonious divorce battle. At a previous session, a judge accused Mr Young of repeatedly failing to produce evidence of his true finances. The case has been delayed after Michelle, a former model, struggled to find the money to pay her legal team and to fund a forensic analysis of her husband’s accounts. In July she was involved in a separate High Court case with  some of her solicitors over a no win - no claim arrangement said to be worth around £3.5m. She is already believed to have spent over £1m in the settlement. This week she successfully got an earlier ruling overturned after arguing the case had come to an effective standstill due to a lack of money as well as the illness of a judge as well as her husband’s health problems. A trial, expected to last for a month, had been scheduled to start this week but has now been delayed until October next year. Mr Young told the court his wife has been represented by ten different law firms over the years, but she claims this is an exaggeration. His passport was confiscated at a previous hearing and he has been told he will not get it back until after the January hearing. Mr Young had said he wanted to travel to Africa to do charity work, but Mr Justice Mostyn said this was ‘implausible’. According to the Times Newspaper he told an earlier hearing: ‘I want to get back to work and to provide for my family. I have two daughters I love. 'I am working to get my life back in shape. I need the opportunity to travel. I want to get my life back in shape.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Scot Young, 51, made a fortune as a fixer .

A father of seven whose arms and legs were amputated after doctors allegedly repeatedly failed to properly diagnose and treat an infection is suing the hospital he claims is responsible. Robert Downey, 48, said staff at Sutter Memorial Hospital in Sacramento, California failed to spot that he had MSSA - a cousin of MRSA - even though they had treated his son for a similar just infection weeks earlier. He claims that their oversights led to the amputations of his hands, his right leg at the knee and his left leg below the knee, leaving him to rely on his wife Cheri to carry out the simplest of tasks. Life-changing: Robert Downey is suing a hospital after staff allegedly failed to spot and treat an infection that eventually led to the amputation of his arms and legs. He is pictured undergoing rehabilitation . 'I'm a very independent person,' he said. 'Now I'm a very dependent person.' Robert and Cheri Downey are suing the hospital and Sutter Health for medical malpractice, the Sacramento Bee reported. Their attorney, Moselely Collins, said they want the hospital to take responsibility for its alleged mistakes and to 'warn hospitals not to let this happen in their emergency room'. 'We want to make sure that hospitals know that they have to treat these infections more seriously,' Collins told Fox40. 'They have to be better.' Support: His wife Cheri had to make the agonizing decision to amputate his limbs as he was in a coma . MSSA, or methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, is typically treatable with antibiotics if it is caught early. It is referred to as the cousin of MRSA - the deadly infection found in hospitals that is resistant to numerous antibiotics. MSSA bacteria can be passed through skin-to-skin contact and contact with towels, sheets or clothing used by an infected person. It can affect tissues when the skin or mucus barriers have been broken, potentially causing infections, septic arthritis, pneumonia or infections of the heart valves. Once its presence is confirmed through tests, it can be treated with penicillin. Yet some strands are resistant to penicillin, sparking a need for combination therapy. Sutter Health said officials would not comment on the case, citing the ongoing litigation. Downey, . who spent two decades in law enforcement before jobs as a prison . correctional officer and a car salesman, first noticed something was . wrong in summer 2011. He . and his wife had taken their 11-year-old son to Sutter Memorial after . noticing the boy had developed a sore. Tests found he had MRSA, and he . was treated and fully recovered, they said. Yet . a few weeks later, Downey found he had a similar sore and became worried that . he had contracted the infection. He visited the same physicians assistant, . who remembered his son, but did not undergo tests and was given oral antibiotics, he said. After the sore failed to heal, he returned to the physician's assistant - but was sent home again. By . his third visit, he had developed severe pain in his shoulder, which he . feared might be 'MRSA arthritis' - a symptom of the deadly infection. He saw a different physician's . assistant and told him about his symptoms, but the doctor said the sore . and infection were not related and that he had bursitis, an inflammation. Old days: Cheri and Robert are pictured before he is believed to have contracted the infection from his son . Struggle: He has prosthetic hands fitted but will need to undergo more rehabilitation before he can use prosthetic legs, pictured. He said that the hospital's failures have taken his independence away . 'I did feel a little relieved,' Downey told the Sacramento Bee. 'I thought, ""OK, I have bursitis"". Hindsight is 20-20. I probably should have pressed harder.' Days later, he collapsed at home and was taken to Mercy San Juan Medical Center in Carmichael. Two weeks later, on August 4, he underwent his first amputation. As her husband was in a coma, Cheri was the one to make the decision to go ahead with the life-changing operations. He said he remembered going to sleep holding his wife, and his next memory was waking up to be told that he had lost his hands and legs. After more than a year of rehabilitation, he has been fitted with prosthetic . hands to help him gain minimal independence. He will need more . rehabilitation before he can be fitted with legs. Scene: He was rushed to hospital after staff at Sutter Memorial, pictured, failed to take samples from a sore, even though they remembered treating his son for MRSA just weeks earlier, he said . Despite his astonishing progress, he is still struggling to come to terms with losing his limbs, he said. 'My mind hasn't caught up with my body,' he said. 'My mind needs to catch up with my body so I can be at ease.' Cheri Downey, who set up a respite care business following the recession, has quit to care for her husband full-time. The couple has seven children between them, aged seven to 26. The infection, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, is typically treatable with antibiotics if it is caught early.","Robert Downey's hands and feet amputated after 'doctors failed to properly diagnose and treat MSSA infection'

Vicksburg Superintendent Charles Glaes told the Kalamazoo Gazette that the boy was a 13-year-old student at Tibbetts' school when the alleged abuse began in 2010. It allegedly continued until earlier this year when he was 16. Tibbetts, 42, was placed on leave in late September. The boy is now a student at Vicksburg High School now, Glaes said. Tibbetts is facing one count of second-degree criminal sexual conduct, five counts of using a computer with child sexually abusive material, five counts of possessing child sexually abusive material, one count of using a computer to solicit another to commit distribution of child sexually abusive material, and a count of exhibiting sexually abusive material to a minor. Glaes  told Michigan Live that the investigation took him and other Vicksburg officials  by total shock. 'Greg has been a very trusted and very capable administrator,' he said.

A tragic loss: Savita's parents have installed a shrine to her in their home, in accordance with Hindu tradition . The parents of an Indian woman who died of blood poisoning after Irish doctors refused her an abortion have met officials to demand justice for their daughter. Savita Halappanavar, 31, was 17 weeks pregnant when she began miscarrying, and died of septicaemia a week later. Her husband Praveen Halappanavar, 34, has told how he begged doctors at Galway University Hospital to terminate the pregnancy, but they refused to do so because she was 'in a Catholic country' and the foetus's heartbeat was still present. The tragedy has provoked soul . searching in the Republic of Ireland, where abortion is illegal, as well . as considerable anger in some quarters. Campaigners are demanding a change in the law to allow abortion in the case where the mother's life is in danger. Savita's parents Anadappa Yalgi, 62, and . his wife Akka Mahadevi Yalgi, 54, met with municipal government . officials late on Friday afternoon at the family home in Belgaum, South . West India.

Echoing comments made by her parents, India's ambassador to Ireland said today that Mrs Halappanavar might still be alive today if she had been treated in India. Debashish Chakravarti told RTÉ radio that he hoped the Irish government would take steps to ensure the circumstances which led to her death never arose again. Abortion is not illegal in India when the mother's life is at risk, the ambassador noted. Meanwhile Ireland's ambassador to India, Feilim McLaughlin, was officially summoned by the Delhi government on Friday to discuss an inquiry into Mrs Halappanavar's death. Madhusudan Ganapathi, secretary (west) in the external affairs ministry, told the Irish envoy he hoped the inquiry into the tragedy would be independent. He also conveyed the sadness felt by people in India as 'a young life had come to an untimely end'. India's External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid said of the tragedy: ""Saving the life of the mother is of prime importance, if you can't save the life of the child."" Devastated: Praveen Halappanavar (pictured with his wife Savita at their home in Galway) says he watched helplessly as she died from blood poisoning from a miscarriage after doctors refused to perform an abortion .

At noon on Wednesday, Keith Kirk, a homeless man, took an expensive bicycle from outside a One Stop Food Mart in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Yet the bike’s owner, Calvin McDougal of Lauderhill, was watching his property closely. While waiting in line, he noticed it was no longer where he left it. So he left the store to apprehend the thief. According to police reports, McDougal pursued and tackled Kirk. This led to a fight which left Kirk with two black eyes, one which is swollen shut, and several cuts, one requiring stitches. After stealing a bike, Keith Kirk was apprehended by the owner and then came off worse in the fight that followed . Keith Kirk has been accused of burglary and theft in the past, but he didn't get away with it on this occasion . It is unclear if McDougal was injured in the altercation, but Kirk was taken to a local hospital. There he admitted trying to steal the bike and charged with one count of grand larceny. The badly-beaten Kirk appeared in first appearance court in Thursday. As reported by the Sun Sentinel, Broward County Judge John 'Jay' Hurley told him: ‘I believe there was a little bit more than just a tackle. Now, sir, you allegedly steal someone's bike and it looks like there was some street justice carried out.’ Judge Hurley charged Kirk with grand theft and the disfigured man was released on his own recognizance. 'Street justice': Judge Hurley told Keith Kirk that he had experienced a 'little bit more than just a tackle' Florida law states that if there is reasonable suspicion that a felony has been committed, a citizen's arrest can be made and the suspect detained until police arrive. Yet a citizen’s arrest is subject to the same laws as any police arrest. What might be deemed as excessive force, for example, cannot be used. The authorities have made their decision on whether excessive force was carried out in this case.

Megrahi's claims came as he tried to . explain his presence in Malta to investigators, and are detailed in . secret documents which have been seen by BBC Scotland. He said he was able to visit . and leave Malta without a passport or identification because of his . position at Libyan Arab Airlines. Malta was key to the case which saw Megrahi, convicted, in January 2001, of murdering 270 people in the plane explosion. Prosecutors believe the suitcase in which the bomb was hidden, was loaded on to a plane in Malta, which then travelled on to Frankfurt, and Heathrow, before finally detonating on Pan Am Flight 103 in the sky above southern Scotland. A hero's welcome: Libyan Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, top left, is greeted by cheering crowds upon his arrival at airport in Tripoli, Libya, on August 20, 2009 . Denial: He has always maintained his innocence, and an investigation by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) found he may have suffered from a miscarriage of justice . The 821 page report, includes Megrahi's statement, given to defence lawyers before his trial in which he boasted how easy it was for him to travel between Libya and Malta as well as claiming he had a mistress in the country. 'As a Libyan Arab Airlines employee . and as someone well known, both at Tripoli airport and at the airport in . Malta,' he told the lawyers. 'I could get away with not using a passport or an identification card . at all, but simply by wearing my Libyan Arab Airlines uniform. Defence lawyers realised if the . original trial had known how easily Megrahi could travel undetected to . Malta it may have strengthened the prosecution case. After interviewing Megrahi in Greenock Prison, investigators . discovered he had a mistress in Malta that he may have visited twice in . that month of the bombing, including the night before the plane blew . up. He told them he could not have sex with his wife so the SCCRC report stated it was possible he travelled to Malta 'on 20 December to meet a woman for this purpose.' The report says it was the same woman he said he might have met during his visit to Malta on 7 December.

'If I wanted to do something clandestine in such a way that there would be absolutely no record at all of me going from Tripoli to Malta and back again, I could do it.' A Maltese shopkeeper, Tony Gauci, identified Megrahi as the man to whom he sold clothes which were later found in a suitcase which had contained the bomb. He confirmed that Megrahi visited his shop, Mary's House, on December 7, 1988. But it was the controversial and differing statements about this date which was one of the reasons that led the SCCRC to refer the case back to the Appeal Court. Malta: A Maltese shopkeeper, Tony Gauci, identified Megrahi as the man to whom he sold clothes at Mary's House shop which were later found in a suitcase which had contained the bomb . Devastation: Prosecutors believe the suitcase in which the bomb was hidden was loaded on to a plane in Malta, and eventually ended up on Pan Am Flight 103 in the sky above southern Scotland, before exploding and causing this gash in the ground . Bringing out the dead: One of the 270 victims is carried away from the wreckage of the bombing of Flight 103 that exploded over Lockerbie on December 21, 1988 . He was returned to Libya on compassionate grounds in August, 2009, after serving 10 years of a life sentence, when he was given just three months to live. The . bomber, who has terminal prostate cancer, is still alive in Libya . two-and-a-half years after his release, to the embarrassment of the . Scottish Government. Megrahi has always maintained his . innocence, and an investigation by the Scottish Criminal Cases Review . Commission (SCCRC) found he may have suffered from a miscarriage of . justice. Megrahi was last seen in December, apparently with just days to live, when he gave an interview from his death bed. A book entitled Megrahi: You Are My Jury alledges Kenny MacAskill, left, told . Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi indirectly that he would be let out of jail in . 2009 if he dropped his court case after he was given just three months . to live . Speaking from his family home in Tripoli, he protested his innocence and asked to be left alone to die from the ravages caused by prostate cancer. He said he had little knowledge of the circumstances surrounding Gaddafi's overthrow and claimed Libyan opposition fighters had invaded his home and mistreated him. Some people are adamant that he is guilty and should not have been released from prison, regardless of his illness. Relatives of those killed in the bombing have tirelessly campaigned against him and last month a spokesman for David Cameron said that the Lockerbie bomber should never have been released. He said: 'This is yet another . reminder that Alex Salmond’s government’s decision to free the UK’s . greatest mass murderer was wrong.' Whereas other parties have claimed, . as does Megrahi himself, that he was 'the innocent victim of dirty . politics, a flawed investigation and judicial folly.' Meanwhile in the last few weeks allegations have arisen that Scotland’s Justice Secretary told the Lockerbie bomber to drop his appeal to smooth the way for him to be released on compassionate grounds. Kenny MacAskill allegedly told Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi indirectly that he would be let out of jail in 2009 if he dropped his court case after he was given just three months to live. Shortly before the official announcement Al-Megrahi did mysteriously abandon the appeal against his conviction - even though he was under no legal obligation to do so. The allegations - strongly denied by the Scottish government - appeared in a new book published today about the release entitled Megrahi: You Are My Jury. It claims Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi was the 'innocent victim of dirty politics, a flawed investigation and judicial folly'. A Scottish Government spokesman branded the book, published today, as 'third-hand hearsay'. He stated: 'We can say categorically that neither the Scottish Government had any involvement of any kind in Mr Al-Megrahi dropping his appeal, or indeed any interest in it.

A slavery-era law that allows for prisoners in Jamaica to be whipped with a cat o' nine tails is to be abolished on the island. The Caribbean country's justice ministry has said the 'degrading' corporal punishment will be removed from the penal code. The punishment allows for prisoners to be whipped with a cat o' nine tails - which consists of nine knotted cords - or a rod made from the branches of a tamarind tree. 'Degrading': The news that the flogging of prisoners with a cat o' nine tails (pictured) is to be banned in Jamaica has been welcomed by human rights activists . Courts in the former British colony stopped ordering the punishment in 2004, but ministers want to see the law abolished entirely. Jamaica's Justice Minister Mark Golding said flogging was a 'degrading' anachronism that violates the country's international obligations and is preventing the government from ratifying the U.N. convention against torture. 'Anachronism': Jamaica's Justice Minister Mark Golding said it was time to get the law 'off our books once and for all' 'The time has come to regularise this situation by getting these colonial-era laws off our books once and for all,' Mr Golding said in a statement. The move to repeal the whipping law has already been approved by the cabinet in Jamaica, where plantation slavery was particularly brutal. The . announcement was welcomed by human rights activists who view flogging as . a barbaric throwback in a nation populated mostly by the descendants of . slaves. Susan Goffe, chairwoman of Jamaicans for Justice, said: 'We don't really see that [the flogging law] has any part in the approach of dealing with crime in a modern democracy.' But . there are no shortage of crime-weary Jamaicans who feel that . authorities should not drop the old statutes but instead enforce them, . arguing that thieves who steal livestock or violent criminals who harm . innocent people should receive a whipping to teach them a lesson. 'The . worst criminals need strong punishing or else they'll do crimes over . and over,' said Chris Drummond, a father of three from Kingston. 'Getting locked up is not always enough.' The . last person to suffer the punishment in Jamaica was Errol Pryce, who . was sentenced to four years in prison and six lashes in 1994 for . stabbing his mother-in-law. Pryce . was flogged the day before being released from prison in 1997 and later . complained to the U.N.

A mother whose son was mauled by a dog today called for a change in the law after police said they could not take any action because the attack happened on private property. Mother-of-four Alana Chambers, 32, was horrified when Keiran, nine, was savaged by the German shepherd cross at a friend’s house. The dog clamped its jaws around the boy’s face before tearing a chunk out of his top lip and slashing his cheek with its paw. Dog clamped its jaws around his face: Keiran Goddard (left) bears the scars of a horrific dog attack while staying at a friend's house and (right) after receiving stitches in hospital . Alana reported the incident to Cambridgeshire Police, but was told they were powerless to act because the incident occurred on private property. Currently, police can only prosecute owners of dogs who harm people if the attack happens in public and they can only forcibly remove illegal dogs. But the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is now trying to change the law to allow prosecutions to take place. After the unprovoked attack on October 4, Keiran was rushed to hospital where he was put under anaesthetic for an hour and needed several stitches to his face. Mrs Chambers slammed Cambridgeshire Police for 'not caring' about her son and called for an immediate change to the law. 'It could have killed him': Keiran's mother Alana Chambers (right) is calling for a change in the law which at present does not make dog attacks on private property a criminal offence . She said: 'The law is ridiculous. It basically means that if a dog attacks someone on private land nothing can be done to put the animal down. 'At the end of the day, it should be on merit of the bite not where the attack happens. 'If the bite had happened 8ft from where it did, the dog would have been taken and put down because it would have been on a public path. It’s just ridiculous.' Mrs Chambers claims the attack was 'completely unprovoked' after her son went to stroke the animal. 'Unprovoked attack': Keiran was rushed to hospital where he was put under anaesthetic for an hour and needed several stitches to his face . She added: 'I want the owner and the . police to do what’s right by my child and stop the dog from attacking . anyone else in the future. 'The way the police treated us was disgusting. They would not even come out to see us to make sure he was OK. 'They . did not care about my son and just said there would never be a law . change because they would get too many calls from postmen. 'If my son had been attacked by a person the attacker would be arrested so why can't action be taken against an animal.' Keiran was at the home of a friend in Cambridge when he was attacked by the animal. Mrs Chambers said she was shocked when the couple, who were her friends, refused to take any action against the dog. She added: 'They were great at first. But when I told them they needed to do something about the dog they just ignored me - it is a dangerous creature and might attack someone else. 'It could have killed my son and it is still roaming around. 'It is just so shocking if it was by my pet I would have it put down immediately - it is a real risk to other children.'

A 17th century stately home has been left partially destroyed after it was ravaged by a fire. Nearly 100 firefighters battling to save Grade I listed Sydenham House, in Devon, were forced to evacuate the area at one point because it was feared the burning property would collapse. The roof and much of the first floor have been left in ruins after flames tore through the house yesterday, and the owner now faces having to rebuild parts of the property at a cost of millions. Battle: At one point yesterday evening, firefighters working to quench the flames at Sydenham House, Devon, were forced to evacuate due to fears the entire building could collapse . Nearly 100 firefighters rushed to tackle the flames when the blaze broke out at historic Sydenham House . An investigation has been launched into what caused the fire, which broke out in a first floor bedroom at around 4pm yesterday . An investigation has been launched into what caused the devastating fire, which broke out in a first floor bedroom inside Sydenham House at around 4pm. Owner Graeme Hart who bought the property and the surrounding 1,200 acre estate in 1992, learned of the blaze when his secretary telephoned him to say his home was in flames. He said the fire was 'tragic'. 'I was phoned by my secretary to say there were flames coming out of the window' Owner Graeme Hart . 'It could not have been more severe,' said Mr Hart, who had rushed home to see flames 'coming through the roof'. 'I was out during the day. I was phoned by my secretary to say there were flames coming out of the window. Immediately I returned to find the situation. It was tragic.' Mr Hart said he was determined to restore the building to its former glory in the wake of the blaze. 'It has got to be rebuilt,' he said. 'It is a historic Grade I listed building.' 'Dangerous scene': Firefighters perched on a ladder spray water onto the flames at the house, which is thought to have been built between 1600 and 1612 . He also praised the efforts of firefighters who battled to bring the fire under control. 'The firefighters have come from all corners of Devon and Cornwall,' he said. 'They have done a brilliant job.' A spokesman for Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said the glow from the flames would have been visible for miles around as the roof and most of the first floor of the stately home near Launceston had been 'well alight'. After: Part of the Elizabethan stately home in Devon has been destroyed by the blaze, which 15 fire crews battled to put out . Fire crews used eight jet hoses to blast water pumped from a nearby lake onto the flames . 'Fortunately the house was evacuated when the alarm was raised so there are no injuries,' said the spokesman. A total of 15 fire crews used eight jet hoses to quench the flames, using water pumped from a nearby lake. 'It . was a dangerous scene. At one point there was a risk the building would . collapse, so we had to withdraw the firefighters,' the fire service . spokesman said. Area commander Chris Bridgeman said 'hidden voids' inside the rambling property meant the fire spread rapidly. 'With it being heavily wooden inside it was very unsafe, so we were unable to work inside for any length of time,' he said. Fire crews said 'hidden voids' inside the rambling, largely wooden building caused the blaze to spread rapidly . Ruins: Charred and blackened tiles on the roof of Sydenham House, near Launceston . Aftermath: Fire trucks outside Sydenham House after yesterday's fire . Before: Sydenham House is seen before the fire broke out on the first floor of the Grade I listed building . Sydenham House was built some time between 1600 and 1612 for Sir Thomas Wise, an MP. The privately-owned property forms part of the Sydenham Estate, which organises farming and shooting functions. The sporting history of the building can be traced back to the early 1900s, when it played host to pheasant shoots. When Mr Hart and his wife Hilary bought the estate in 1992 they were determined to restore it to its former sporting glory, and they introduced shoots once again. An investigation is now underway at the house to establish what is salvageable following the fire and whether parts of the property may be unsafe.

A drunken thug who attacked a teenager had downed nearly 50 cans of lager and two litres of vodka during a day-long binge. It means 24-year-old Russell Large had drunk around 40 times the daily recommended alcohol limit for men when the attack took place three days before Christmas last year. Large, a former mechanic and chef who has been unemployed for more than a year, admitted attacking the 17-year-old stranger in a Plymouth shop following an entire day of drinking, which involved him consuming 48 cans of Foster’s lager and two litres of vodka. Binge-drink assault: After Russell Large, 24, downed nearly 50 cans of Foster's lager and two litres of vodka in a day, he would have been 40 times over the recommended daily alcohol limit for men when the attack took place . Although it was not specified which size can Large was drinking on the day of the attack, a 440ml can of Foster’s contains 1.8 units of alcohol, while a two-litre bottle of standard vodka contains 75 units, making a total of 161.4 units. The UK Chief Medical Council advises a daily limit of four units for a man, meaning Large had drunk just over 40 times that recommendation in one day. According to the NHS, binge drinking also leads to the body not being able to process all the alcohol, meaning the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) rises. A BAC of more than 400milligrams per 100 millitres of blood can result in severe breathing difficulties, coma and even death. However, a person's BAC is dependent on a number of factors including weight, the type of alcohol they have consumed, whether they regularly drink and how much food they have in their stomach. Large, of Budshead Road in the city, told magistrates in Plymouth today that he was sorry after admitting one charge of common assault. “It’s sad,” he added. The court heard Large had recently broken up with his girlfriend and had gone on a drinks binge in a local park. He got into an argument with his victim, who took refuge behind the counter of a nearby corner shop, but Large found and attacked him. Large grabbed his victim by the throat before headbutting him, leaving the teenager with injuries to his left eye. Defending, Michael Crumley described Large’s alcohol consumption as “quite staggering”. Russell Large pleaded guilty at Plymouth Magistrates for attacking the teenager following a drinking binge . He said: “That goes some way to explaining his actions. He is very ashamed and deeply regrets his actions. ""He wishes to apologise to this poor, unfortunate young person (victim)."" The court was told Large had started drinking at the age of 14 and came from a family with a ""heavy drinking culture"". His consumption of alcohol had also increased in the time leading up to the attack. Large's defence also told the court that he had no memory of the actual assault. Chairwoman of the bench, Dr Sonia Sidhom, sentenced Large to a 12-month community order, and ordered him to pay £50 compensation and £40 court costs.","Russell Large had consumed 40 times the daily recommended alcohol limit for men .

His parents had planned their wedding day - and they desperately wanted Oscar to see them get married. He underwent gruelling chemotherapy treatment and although he lost the sight on one eye, surgeons managed to save the other. This picture of Oscar Cotton was taken just before he was diagnosed, and you can see the unusual white shadow in his left eye, which is a symptom of an eye cancer called Retinoblastoma . Oscar's chemotherapy lasted several months and ended in January this year. Afterwards doctors confirmed he is blind in his left eye. But his right eye was fine . It meant that he was finally able to see his relieved parents tie the knot in an emotional ceremony. His mother Emma, 31, said: ‘We were desperate to save Oscar’s sight and more than anything we wanted our son to see us getting married. ‘He was so brave throughout his treatment and we can’t thank the surgeons enough for saving his sight.’ Oscar was born healthy in July 2010, but when he was nine months old, Mrs Cotton noticed that his left eye was looking the wrong way. It corrected itself, but then it kept happening when Oscar was stressed or concentrating. Mrs Cotton said: ‘I thought it was unusual, but it always corrected itself so we didn’t worry initially.’ At his 12 month check, the health visitor suggested Oscar might have a squint. She arranged an appointment with an optometrist. It was discovered that Oscar had a patch on his retina and he was referred to a specialist. Oscar is still having regular check ups but is going from strength to strength, according to his proud mother Emma Cotton . Despite battling through chemotherapy, brave Oscar managed to attend the wedding of his parents, Emma and Nick Cotton in December, eight weeks after he had started treatment . Mrs Cotton said: ‘At home I researched ‘patch on retina’ on the internet. One result mentioned retinoblastoma, cancer of the eyes. I told myself that it couldn’t possibly be that as it was incredibly rare. But three weeks later doctors at Birmingham Children’s Hospital discovered that he did have retinoblastoma -  and he had tumours in both of his eyes. Mrs Cotton, who lives with husband Nick, 31, a customer services representative for a mobile phone company, and their two other sons . Tyler, ten, and Zakk, four, in Stoke on Trent, said: ‘It was our worst nightmare. If it was just in one eye they would try and remove the eye, but as it was in both, they told us they would try and save the sight in both with chemotherapy. ‘He started treatment in September 2011. All his hair fell out and he’d wake up screaming in pain. It was terrible to watch him and I felt helpless that I couldn’t help him. But despite the side effects, he responded well, and he was so brave throughout it all. Oscar looking smart, pictured with his mother and grandfather, all dressed up at his parents wedding ceremony . ‘A few weeks later we set a date for our wedding. We were desperate for Oscar to see us get married, but would the doctors be able to save his sight. We had to hope and pray that he could. I couldn’t bear the thought of my little boy not being able to see us get married.’ Despite battling through the chemotherapy treatment, brave Oscar managed to attend the wedding in December, eight weeks after he had started treatment. Mrs Cotton said: ‘We had 30 guests at our wedding. But the most important person of all was Oscar. He matched his brothers in his tiny pinstripe suit,  and he watched us both say ‘I do.’ It was the most emotional day of our lives. ‘All the guests knew about Oscar’s battle. We were so proud of him. He was the bravest little pageboy we could have asked for.’ In January this year Oscar finished his chemotherapy. Afterwards doctors confirmed he is blind in his left eye. But his right eye was fine. The tumours were inactive. Mrs Cotton said: ‘We are thrilled he is doing so well. He still has regular check ups but he’s going from strength to strength, and we just can’t thank the doctors enough for saving his sight. Now we’re looking forward to Oscar seeing in our one year wedding anniversary with us.’ For more information about retinoblastoma, visit the Childhood Eye Cancer Trust website at www.chect.org.uk .","Oscar Cotton was referred to hospital with a squint, only to find he had retinoblastoma, cancer of the eyes, and had tumours in both eyes .

After finishing nine seasons with the NFL some might expect Terry Tautolo to be living the high life. Few might expect the 58-year-old to instead be living beneath a Los Angeles freeway, homeless, while feared to be suffering a lasting affect by the professional sport: Brain damage. Today the former linebacker for the Philadelphia Eagles, San Francisco 49ers, Detroit Lions and Miami Dolphins appears frail though as his former 49ers roommate George Visger says, still 'very proud.' Scroll down for video . New life: Former NFL linebacker Terry Tautolo, 58, is seen near an overpass in Los Angeles, a site he says he frequented after a concussion sustained in a game led to his removal from the sport . Heavy hitter: Seen left running against the New York Giants as #50 of the San Francisco 49ers, Tautolo was a star in the 1980s up until his injury which he said he never reported to the NFL . 'You look at him and, the teeth missing, the eyes sunken in, but you ask him, and, ""Oh, I don’t have any issues,"" Mr Visger told CBS Sacramento. Mr Visger, who played alongside Mr Tautolo until his own career was ended early due to a series of concussions, successfully sued the NFL for workers compensation after a gruelling battle. He has had nine brain surgeries since, pointing to a hidden tube running through the side of his head to a pump in one instance, and says he could require more. 'None of us want to ask for help, but there’s some things that he’s earned,' Mr Visger said of his old friend whom he's since encouraged to be tested for similar injuries. Mr Tautolo however has acknowledged that a similar blow to his own head, making him what he called ‘a paper head,’ is what ended his career. He says he never reported the injury to the NFL, though it was enough to make him quit, fearing he could end up paralyzed if hit just one more time. Momentos: In his daughter's home photos of the father and twice married husband are seen with his children as well as a team photo of his days with the 49ers . Full responsibility: He admits his concussion causing him to quit the NFL, fearing he could become paralyzed if hit just one more time, but refuses to blame the sport on his life's troubles . Since ending his NFL career in the 1980, Mr Tautolo has run through two failed marriages, suffers anger problems he’s seen counselling for and has been in and out of homelessness. They're all clear signs of brain damage according to doctors. 'I had stayed with friends now and then but I didn't want to burden them,' he told CBS of his decision to move beneath the overpass. When asked how others living beneath there reacted to hearing that he was once a NFL star, he interrupts to say: 'Oh, I didn't tell them.' Reaching out: Mr Tautolo's former 49ers roommate George Visger has undergone nine brain surgeries since his own leave from the NFL prompting him to motivate his old friend to see a doctor . Repercussions: Mr Visger successfully sued the NFL for workers compensation after his injuries that in one surgery required a tube, he gestures on his head's right side, to be inserted along with a pump . His physical injuries are a bit different, though ones he mutually tries to get by with. Holding out his hands, his fingers are permanently bent, unable to stretch them out straight. He admits to having exited games and taping them up himself, not seeking medical treatment like most players more readily see today. 'Getting old, things are breaking down, but it’s all due to me, you know,' he said. 'Maybe it speeded up because of football.' In a rare moment revealing his vulnerability, standing beside that overpass he asks the CBS reporter quizzically: 'Do you think something's wrong with me?' Warped: Among Mr Tautolo's other injuries, his hands are visibly skewed after merely wrapping his fingers in tape after games rather than his injuries addressed by doctors . Price to pay: After visiting a doctor with Mr Visger, Mr Tautolo, seen center during his NFL hay-day, says he hasn't ruled out having a full assessment done but he's still not sure it'd be worth the financial burden . That little bit of doubt is what led him to a doctor at Mr Visger's imploring side. 'Any concerns at all about how you feel or how you function,' Dr Daniel Amen asks him with the CBS reporter in the room. 'Ah, no. Nope,' Mr Tautolo quietly replies. He didn't open up to the doctors that day but since leaving the office he has told CBS he hasn't ruled out the possibility of having a full assessment. It just requires money he doesn't have, he said, as well as a continuing push. But perhaps one day, he said.

'Now I'm not saying that I haven't put . my arms around someone and I'm not saying that any of this is right or . wrong at the moment. But I'm just trying to get the facts out...' The 67-year-old DJ continued: 'Things were different in those days…Those were lax days.' Several claims have already been made . that Travis groped women colleagues in the 1970s and 1980s. TV and radio . broadcaster Vivien Creegor claimed he 'jiggled her breasts' while live . on Radio 4 in the 1980s. Mrs Creegor, 55, claimed Travis . clamped his hands over her jumper as she made a live announcement. Travis categorically denied any wrongdoing and said he was surprised the . allegations were being made now. Upset: DJ Travis came out of his house in Bedfordshire and said he spoke out because he didn't want to be 'linked to something that bloody evil' He said: 'We are not talking about . rape or attack or anything like that. It's not as if someone has to keep . this quiet. If something like that happened you say, “Hey, he grabbed . my boobs”. You'd tell somebody.' He added: 'Of course I've groped women's breasts, Jesus Christ I'm a man. Women have groped me as well. This is what happens. Anxious: Dave Lee Travis said he had to speak out because he did not want to be mentioned in the same breath as Jimmy Savile . 'I'm a human being I'm a man. But I have never walked up to a woman and groped her without her knowing.' The former DJ's main anger was the way . his arrest had been linked to the investigation into paedophilia . involving some of his fellow former celebrities. He said: 'My name appeared in papers . alongside Gary Glitter and Jimmy Savile – that's not on.' He added: . 'This is nothing to do with kids, all right? I don't want to be even . mentioned in the same breath as Savile.' He said he had no warning that he was . about to be arrested at his home in a small village in Buckinghamshire . at just before 8am on Thursday. He spent over 12 hours at the station where he drank hot chocolate and ate a cheese and tomato sandwich. He said he had given the opposite of a . 'no comment' interview. 'It's not my style. I have lots of comment. I . answered every question they asked me.' Yesterday it was announced that Travis . has been taken 'off air with immediate effect' by radio station Magic . AM after his arrest. A spokesman for Bauer Media which owns . Magic AM said: 'While we can make no judgment on the matters under . investigation, we believe it would be inappropriate for him to broadcast . until they are resolved.' Police said the allegations against . Travis did not directly involve Savile, and were classed under the . strand of their investigation termed 'others'. ÷ Two more celebrities are to face legal action from Lord McAlpine for falsely implying he was a paedophile on Twitter.

David Cameron called in under-fire Andrew Mitchell  for a face-to-face meeting after news broke that he had called police ‘plebs’ during his foul-mouthed Downing Street rant, it emerged tonight. The Prime Minister told Mr Mitchell his behaviour was unacceptable, and the Government chief whip  said that he did not use the words attributed to him in reports but accepted he needed to apologise. He 'looked him in the eye', insisting he didn't use the word, sources said. Mr Cameron has since read an official police log showing he called officers 'f****** plebs', but is expected to stand by Mr Mitchell. Scroll down for video . Beleaguered: Andrew Mitchell, the Conservative Party Chief Whip speaks to the media outside the Cabinet office in Whitehall, central London, yesterday to address allegations he hurled abuse at a police officer . Boris Johnson today claimed it would . have been 'common sensical' for police to have arrested Mr Mitchell for . his outburst, which the police log says left members of the public ‘visibly shocked’. But . to further undermine Mr Mitchell’s explanation for his rant, it also . emerged today that the ‘long and extremely frustrating day’ which he . blamed for his foul-mouthed tirade at police officers included lunch at . London’s poshest curry house, the Cinnamon Club. The full police log for the confrontation reveals details of the moment . Mr Mitchell was told by officers to use a side gate to leave Downing . Street, and not the main gates reserved for ministerial cars. Mr Mitchell repeatedly stated that he was the chief whip and demanded the main gates be opened, the log says. After several refusals he eventually made his way to the side gate, where he let rip at officers. The police log states: ‘There were several members of public present as is the norm opposite . the pedestrian gate and as we neared it, Mr Mitchell said: “Best you . learn your f****** place... you don't run this f****** Government... You're ******* plebs.” ‘The members of public looked visibly shocked and I was somewhat taken . aback by the language used and the view expressed by a senior Government . official. I cannot say if this statement was aimed at me individually, . or the officers present or the police service as a whole.’ In a hugely embarrassing escalation of the stand-off, officers then . threatened Mr Mitchell with arrest under the Public Order Act for . swearing, a move backed by Mr Johnson. London Mayor Boris Johnson used a visit to South Ruislip Library to say police should have arrested Andrew Mitchell . The London Mayor said today: 'In my book you shouldn’t abuse police officers and I’ve made that clear loads of times. 'If I read the papers correctly there was a proposal to arrest Mr Mitchell for what he said. That seems to be wholly common-sensical. 'The public order act does allow for police officers’ discretion in this matter. They’ve obviously decided not to go ahead with it. But it shows the gravity of this offence.' A YouGov poll found more than two-thirds of voters accepted the police account that Mr Mitchell called officers 'plebs' after they refused to let him cycle through the main gates of Downing Street. More than half the 1,739 adults questioned in the online survey - 52 per cent - said they thought he should resign. Earlier today one of Mr Mitchell's daughters told reporters outside the family home: 'I can tell you one thing - my father is an honest man.' The official police log of what Andrew Mitchell said to officers in Downing Street . Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Treasury Chief Secretary, today condemned the outburst. 'Andrew Mitchell has apologised for what he did. It was clearly totally wrong for anyone to go around swearing at police officers but certainly for Cabinet ministers. 'He has apologised for that, I gather he has apologised directly to the police. I think we should draw a line under the matter now."" However the full police log, reported by the Daily Telegraph, will dash any hopes . among senior government figures of drawing a line under the row. Mr Mitchell has pointedly refused to deny using the word ‘pleb’ – a politically . damaging remark which reinforces the impression of an out of touch Tory . elite. But the contemporaneous note from an on-duty police officer makes for devastating reading. To make matters worse, it also emerged that Mr Mitchell had spent part of the day at one of Westminster's smartest restaurants. Andrew Mitchell's 'long and incredibly frustrating day' included lunch at the Cinnamon Club in Great Smith Street, London which is within walking distance of several government departments . Famed for its upmarket Indian cuisine, the Cinnamon Club menu includes fillet steak of Wagyu beef with stir-fried morels and saffron sauce, costing £95 . Mr Mitchell has in part blamed a 'long and frustrating day' for losing his temper, but The Sun newspaper today claims he spent part of that day enjoying lunch at the Cinnamon Club where main courses start at around £20, but the fillet steak of Wagyu beef with stir-fried morels and saffron sauce costs £95. Ex-government adviser George McGregor told The Sun he was dining at the restaurant at the time near Mr Mitchell, and said: 'He didn't seem to be having a long and frustrating day to me.' It is thought he was there for around an hour and a half. Downing Street confirmed that Mr Mitchell had eaten at the curry house, but stressed: ‘It was a lunch, not a long lunch.’ Mr Mitchell yesterday broke his silence with an apology outside the Cabinet Office. There was speculation he might be on the verge of saying something dramatic, or even offering his resignation. But, in the event, a clearly . uncomfortable Mr Mitchell denied using the ‘words that have been . attributed to me’ – but refused to say exactly what he had told the . police. This stubborn reluctance to discuss . the precise language last Wednesday evening meant he was bombarded with . fresh questions. Claims: Mr Mitchell denied using the words attributed to him, but pointedly refused to deny he had using the classist slur 'pleb' against the officers . Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood . last night rejected Labour’s call for a full inquiry into the incident, . and attempted to close down the affair. In a letter to shadow home secretary . Yvette Cooper, Sir Jeremy said Mr Cameron had spoken to Mr Mitchell and . ‘made very clear that his behaviour fell short of what he expects of his . ministers’. Sir Jeremy said there was a ‘genuine difference of view’ about what Mr Mitchell had said. He said he had discussed the incident . with Metropolitan Police Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe who was also . ‘very disappointed at the lack of respect shown towards the police’. But . he said Mr Hogan-Howe did not wish to pursue the matter as the officers . concerned had accepted Mr Mitchell’s apology. The Met however faced a backlash when . it emerged it was launching a leak inquiry to find out how details of . the clash were passed to the media. Downing Street backed the Chief Whip, saying Mr Cameron accepted his version of events and believed it was time to ‘move on’. But their stance infuriated the . police, who said their officers were effectively being accused of lying. John Tully, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, called on . Mr Cameron to hold an investigation. ‘Clearly Mr Mitchell is denying using certain words, effectively now impugning the integrity of the police officers,’ he said. Two-wheeled terror: Mr Mitchell had reportedly been stopped from riding his bike into Downing Street when he made the outburst at police . Yvette Cooper, Labour's shadow home secretary, today demanded the truth about the incident from the Mr Cameron. She told ITV's Daybreak: 'You read these reports and you have got a cabinet minister not just swearing at the police but also sneering at them, calling them plebs, saying they should know their place. 'I don't think the prime minister can just dismiss this and try and sweep this under the carpet.' Yesterday Mr Mitchell acknowledged . that he had not shown the police ‘the amount of respect I should have . done’ but said the incident had come at ‘the end of a long and extremely . frustrating day’. One senior Tory said colleagues had . been ‘surprised’ by Mr Mitchell’s grudging statement, adding: ‘We . expected him to be far more contrite.’ Shortly after his tirade at the . police, the minister headed off to dine at the Carlton Club, a private . club for Conservative members in the exclusive St James’ area of London, . where he was guest speaker. Yesterday Deputy Prime Minister Nick . Clegg said it was ‘really important that Andrew Mitchell explains fully . and in detail his version of events’. And Jeremy Browne, the Lib Dem Home Office minister, said the apology left unanswered questions. He added: 'I think people want to know what was said. Explaining to the media what was not said is not the same as explaining to the media what was said, so there is a sort of sense of all the loose ends not being tied up.' Friends of Mr Mitchell last night said . he was ‘categoric’ that he had not used the  word pleb. One ally . claimed officers may have misheard him say the word ‘plod’. Last night it was suggested that the . firearms officers at the centre of the row face being moved from Downing . Street when they return to duty today to keep them out of the . spotlight.

This five-month-old kitten risked losing one of his nine lives today on his very first outing - when he had to be rescued from a chimney stack 30ft high. It took the RSPCA, seven firefighters, an aerial platform and a very worried owner to coax Archie, a British blue cross, down from the roof of the three-storey house. He had only been recently adopted from a rescue centre by owner 47-year-old Andy Gillies when he tried to make a dash for freedom. Stuck: Mischievous moggy Archie found himself in an unfamiliar position during his first foray into the outside world after being recently adopted from a rescue centre . Platform: East Sussex Fire and Rescue needed an . aerial platform to capture Archie. They said they only come out to cat . rescues if called by the RSPCA . Tired out: Archie's owner Andy Gillies said his pet had been subdued since his adventure . Instead the mischievous moggy ended up trapped on top of his new home in Brighton and it took more than 40 minutes for him to be rescued. RSPCA animal welfare officer Steve Wickham said: 'I think he must have been attracted by the warm chimney stacks or was possibly chasing a bird.' Mr Gillies, an accountant from Brighton, East Sussex said: 'Archie wasn't allowed out as he hadn't yet had his vaccinations. 'We realised he had gone missing last night when we couldn't find him in the house, I went outside looking for him and eventually saw him on the roof. 'I was convinced he must have climbed up the chimney and was calling for him up there and he was meowing back - but he didn't budge. Must escape: Archie does not take kindly to his so-called rescuers as he tries to climb back down the chimney . Got ya: The firefighter, from East Sussex Fire and Rescue, is just about to capture Archie after his 40 minute adventure up the three-storey building . Firefighters can be seen in the top left hand corner of the picture maneuvering their aerial platform into place . 'I called the RSPCA who told us to wait till morning and see if he moved. 'We started to worry when we heard the seagulls circling this morning in case they pecked him but the RSPCA came round straight away with the fire service.' East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service confirmed they had a call from the RSPCA this morning. A spokesman said: 'After a request from the RSPCA we sent a fire engine and an aerial ladder with seven fire-fighters to the address. 'We don't normally attend cat on roof rescues unless the RSPCA contact us.' Mr Gillies said it is still a mystery how his cat managed to get on the roof. He said Archie did not smell of soot and may have climbed out of the window. He added: 'I have no idea how he did it. 'He is much more docile today. I think he realises he has had a bit of an adventure.'","The kitten became trapped on his very first outing from his home in Brighton .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:44 EST, 31 July 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:46 EST, 31 July 2012 . A sex attacker convicted of raping and murdering a mother-of-two whose body has never been found has been jailed for life. Martin Stafford, 44, abducted female security guard Michelle Gunshon from a pub in December 2004, before carrying out the brutal sex attack and killing. The body of the 38-year-old has never been found since she went missing and Stafford has refused to give a location. Evil: Martin Stafford abducted Michelle Gunshon from a pub in Digbeth, Birmingham, in December 2004 before raping and murdering her . A two-week murder trial at Birmingham Crown Court heard that Stafford was employed as a glass collector in the Dubliner pub in the Digbeth area of the city when he met Mrs Gunshon. The court heard Stafford then murdered her before 'spiriting her body away' and fleeing the country. Birmingham Crown Court heard Stafford took Gunshon away 'against her will' in her own car before raping her, murdering her and disposing of her body so that she has never been seen since. Hours after the killing, Stafford was caught on a speed camera driving Mrs Gunshon’s Ford Escort around Birmingham city centre with 'something in the car' strapped in the passenger seat. Mrs Gunshon’s last contact with anyone was when she telephoned her long-term partner, who she regarded as her husband, and daughter on December 4. The next morning her colleagues noticed she was missing and when they entered her room they found her clothes and personal belongings, including her wallet, were still there. Mystery: Stafford, pictured in the dock at Birmingham Crown Court during his murder trial, has refused to reveal the location of the body . Search: Tracey Richardson, the daughter of Michelle Gunshon, makes an emotional plea for information in 2005 after her mother's disappearance . She was reported missing and police found that she had parked her car, a Ford Escort, in Mill Lane, near to the Dubliner after returning from work, police said. CCTV captured from December shows two figures, very close together, approach the car, before it is driven away towards Digbeth. Following a 13 day trial, jurors at Birmingham Crown Court today found Stafford guilty of murder - as well as false imprisonment, rape and preventing the burial of a body. Depraved: Stafford was working as a glass collector when he met Gunshon in December 2004 . After sentencing, Detective Inspector Simon Astle of West Midlands Police, who led the case said: 'This has been a long and complex inquiry and we welcome the verdict of the court today. 'We will not give up in our efforts to trace Michelle’s body. 'Clearly Martin Stafford can assist us with that and we will make every effort to provide him with that opportunity.' Police family liaison officer, Bev Wright, also delivered a tribute on behalf of Mrs Gunshon’s family. She said: 'Martin Stafford is a danger to people and should not be allowed out. 'We may have justice but our mum is still out there somewhere and only Martin Stafford knows where. 'Our only wish for the future is that mum is found and this can finally be over and we can grieve properly.' Harinderpal Dhami, from the West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, added: 'The successful conviction of Martin Stafford today marks the end of a very difficult and complex journey for the prosecution team in this case, which began over seven years ago and included the extradition of Martin Stafford following his conviction for rape in the Republic of Ireland. 'Michelle Gunshon’s body has never been found and the only person who could answer that question is Martin Stafford, who was asked this specific question during the trial having denied being responsible for Michelle’s murder. ' Mrs Gunshon, from Mill Hill, North London, worked for Special Events Security (SES), a firm which provides security at high-profile events across the country such as Cheltenham Races and trade fairs.","Martin Stafford abducted Michelle Gunshon after meeting her in a pub in Birmingham .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:28 EST, 16 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:29 EST, 16 November 2012 . Locked away: Adis Medunjanin, 28, has been sentenced to life in a federal prison for the foiled 2009 terror plot on Manhattan's subways . A New York City man who recited verses from the Quran rather than express remorse was sentenced to life in prison on Friday in a foiled 2009 plot that authorities labelled one of the closest calls since the 9/11 attacks. Adis Medunjanin, a 28-year-old U.S. citizen from Bosnia, had faced a mandatory life term following his conviction last year of conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction and several other terrorism charges. His plot stemmed from an al-Qaida-sanctioned scheme hatched with two former high school classmates. Appearing in federal court in Brooklyn, Medunjanin read from the Quran in Arabic for several minutes before U.S. District Judge John Gleeson interrupted and asked him if he intended to say anything in English. The defendant politely asked for more time to finish one verse, then shifted into a critique of American society and foreign policy. 'What kind of system endorses torture?' he said, as some of his relatives wept in the gallery. 'Is this really the best system that humanity ever produced?' He closed by saying, 'I had nothing to do with any subway plot or bombing plot whatsoever. I ask Allah to release me from prison.' Judge Gleeson told Medunjanin that his remarks made him appear more like a robotic 'exhibit' of extremism than the college-educated person who escaped war-torn Bosnia as a child and grew up in a stable immigrant family in a working-class section of Queens. Family's support: Adis Medunjanin's family, his parents and sister, are seen exiting federal court after his sentence hearing on Friday . 'You create the impression that you're asking me to sentence you like the committed, anti-American jihadist you seem to want to be for the rest of your life,' the judge said. Medunjanin showed no emotion as the sentence was announced. His parents and sister declined to speak to reporters as they left the courthouse. 'Adis Medunjanin sought martyrdom for himself and death for innocent New Yorkers as part of al-Qaeda's plan to spread terror within our shores,' U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch said in a statement. 'Scores of innocent New Yorkers would have been killed or maimed had Medunjanin succeeded in his plot.' At a trial earlier this year, the former classmates, Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay, testified that the three men sought terror training after falling under the influence of inflammatory recordings of U.S.-born extremist cleric Anwar al-Awlaki that they downloaded and listened to on their iPods. Zazi and Ahmedzay, who testified as part of a plea deal, told jurors that the scheme unfolded after the trio travelled to Pakistan in 2008 to avenge the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan by joining the Taliban. Life in New York: The couple's son was a college-educated young man who escaped war-torn Bosnia as a child and grew up in a stable immigrant family in a working-class section of Queens . While receiving terror training at outposts in the South Waziristan region of Pakistan, al-Qaida operatives encouraged the American recruits to return home for a suicide-bombing mission intended to spread panic and cripple the economy. Among the targets considered were the New York Stock Exchange, Times Square and Grand Central Terminal, the men testified. In a later meeting in New York, the plotters decided to strap on bombs and blow themselves up at rush hour on Manhattan subway lines because the transit system is 'the heart of everything in New York City,' Zazi said. Zazi told jurors how he learned to extract explosives ingredients from nail polish remover, hydrogen peroxide and other products sold at beauty supply stores. When leaving Pakistan, he relocated to Colorado, where he perfected a homemade detonator in a hotel room and set out for New York City by car around the eighth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks. The plot - financed in part by $50,000 in credit card charges - was abandoned after Zazi noticed that everywhere he drove in New York, a car followed. 'I think law enforcement is on us,' he recalled telling Ahmedzay. Later, he said, he told Medunjanin in a text message, 'We are done.'","Adis Medunjanin, 28, sentenced for his involvement in the foiled 2009 attack that plotted to use suicide bombers on trains running through Manhattan ."
"By . Emily Allen . PUBLISHED: . 03:59 EST, 28 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:43 EST, 29 August 2012 . The firm behind the Olympics security fiasco admitted today that its loss on the bungled contract will be in the region of £50million. G4S is conducting an internal review after its failure to provide all of the 10,400 contracted guards for London 2012, which forced the Government to step in with military personnel. Today G4S said it had delivered just 83 per . cent of contracted shifts and that it was confident the Paralympic Games . - starting tomorrow - would be fully staffed with a security workforce. Members of the Armed Forces stepped in to make up the shortfall after G4S failed to provide all of the 10,400 contracted guards for London 2012 . The company's Olympic contract was . worth £284million but the firm told the government less than a month . before the opening ceremony that it would only be able to provide 8,000 guards. Figures released today show G4S's failure to supply all the staff it promised, plus the money it has had to pay for the deployment of 3,500 soldiers, had cost the firm about £50million. Regret: Chief executive Nick Buckles said G4S was 'deeply disappointed' with the mess over the Olympics contract . The announcement came as the firm's . share price plummeted shortly after 9am to 256p. It also revealed a 60 . per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the six months until June to £61million from £151million a year earlier, although profits were held . flat on an underlying basis after sales increased 5.8 per cent to £3.9billion. G4S is the largest employer on the London Stock Exchange and employs more than 650,000 staff in . 125 countries worldwide. More than a quarter of its income comes from . government contracts. There had been fears that the Olympics contract issues would hurt the group’s prospects for future Government work. Chief executive Nick Buckles confirmed that the resources G4S had put into sorting out the debacle meant it withdrew from bidding for a Department for Work and Pensions contract worth £20 million a year. But he said no contracts had been lost as a result of the Olympics deal woes and insisted the group would continue to play a 'major role' in the public sector, with an overall £3.8billion-a-year contract pipeline. Losses: G4S has announced 1,100 job cuts as part of a restructuring programme although fewer than 100 roles have been axed in the UK . March 2011: G4S is made the official 'security services provider' for London 2012 and agrees to provide 10,000 staff. 12 July: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announces up to 3,500 extra troops will be needed for security duties during the Olympics amid fears that G4S will not be able to meet the needs. Home Secretary Theresa May tells MPs there was 'no question of Olympic security being compromised' following the decision to draft in the army. 13 July: Shares in G4S plummet and more than £150 million is wiped off the company's market value in two days. 14 July: G4S chief executive Nick Buckles says the firm will be facing fines of £10 to £20 million as a result of the failure to meet its commitments. He said: 'We were deeply disappointed . that we had significant issues with the London 2012 Olympics contract . and are very grateful to the military and the police for their support . in helping us to deliver a safe and secure Games.' He added: 'Clearly it is a big setback and we need to rebuild the brand over the coming months and years.' Mr . Buckles has been left fighting to save his career after the debacle and . an intense grilling by MPs which saw him agree that it had been a . 'humiliating shambles'. Reports . in recent days suggested he had the support of major shareholders and . he said today that he hoped to keep his job, having been with the group . for 28 years, 10 of them as chief executive. He . is preparing for a second appearance in front of MPs on the Olympics . contract next month, while the results of the internal review are due . towards the end of September. G4S also announced 1,100 job cuts as part of a restructuring programme started in December. Most of the cuts have been made across continental Europe and developing markets, with fewer than 100 roles axed in the UK. G4S will provide the majority of security for Paralympic venues as the number of troops and police officers on duty is scaled back, organisers confirmed today. Locog chief executive Paul Deighton said the private firm will use 4,000 to 5,000 workers. Mr Deighton said: 'We’re fully confident. The military contingent this time will be 3,500 soldiers, with 1,000 in reserve and typically G4S will be between four and 5,000. 'In very simple terms, we’re switching from an approach which had a slight majority of military during the Games to one which will have a slight majority of private sector security for the Paralympics.' The number of military personnel has been drastically scaled back from the 12,200 troops involved in venue security during the Olympics. Police numbers will also be halved, with around 7,000 officers on duty across the country, compared with 14,500 previously.","Firm loses money on staff it failed to provide and must also pay for soldiers forced to step in .

A climber who plunged 100ft from England’s third highest peak was told he will be back on his feet in just days - despite breaking his neck and back. Pete Flint, 60, slipped and fell from Swirral Edge on Helvellyn in the Lake District breaking several ribs, his neck and his back in three places. The tourist, from Branston, Lincolnshire, was trekking with his daughter Rosie at the weekend when he fell from the 3,117ft edge. After a daring helicopter rescue he was flown to hospital, where his recovery stunned medics - who say they expect him to be well enough to walk out of hospital in just days. Doctors at Newcastle’s Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) said he has been so lucky he 'should buy a lottery ticket.' Pete’s close friend John Stephenson, 41, who serves in the Royal Navy, said: 'The doctors have said Pete really should go and buy a lottery ticket as soon as he comes out. 'They say the fall should have killed him and his injuries should have left him paralysed. 'It was just shock and horror knowing that someone you know as a close personal friend was lying in a hospital bed fighting for his life, and so the latest news that he will walk again soon is amazing. 'The family wishes to thank all the rescuers and doctors who helped save his life.' Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team was called out at around midday on Saturday, November 10, to a man had fallen 30m from the famous mountain edge. Two helicopters, one from the Great North Air Ambulance Service (GNAAS) and a Sea King from HMS Gannet at Prestwick, Scotland also joined the rescue. But the location and low cloud prevented either aircraft from directly evacuating suffering Pete. Instead, mountain rescuers lowered him several hundred metres down a loose gravel slope so that the Sea King helicopter could fly in below the cloud and winch the stretcher. Local cricket club chairman, Pete, was then rushed to Newcastle’s RVI and endured a 14-hour operation. A team spokesperson for Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team, said: 'Due to the location and low cloud it was not possible for either helicopter to directly evacuate the casualty. Swirral Edge from Hellvyn in Cumbria where Pete Flint fell 100ft . 'The team lowered the casualty down a loose scree slope for several hundred metres until they were below the cloud and the Sea King could fly in to winch the stretcher.

Violent killings: Aerospace engineer Saad al-Hilli, from Surrey, and his family may have been the victims of a 'lone psychopath' A British engineer and his family brutally murdered in the French Alps were likely to have been the victims of a random, deranged killer, investigators have said. Baffled officials investigating the deaths of Saad al-Hilli, his wife Iqbal, her mother Suhaila al-Hilli, and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, are yet to uncover a motive for the shootings in September. While previous lines of inquiry have ranged from a contract killing to a family feud, the prosecutor leading the probe has now said it is suspected the killings were the work of a lone, crazed gunman. Eric Maillaud, who said all lines of inquiry remain open, said investigators were looking for 'unbalanced people - capable of extreme violence'. Mr al-Hilli, 50, his 47-year-old wife Iqbal, his 74-year-old mother-in-law and cyclist Mr Mollier, 45, were killed when a lone gunman opened fire at an isolated layby close to the village of Chevaline, near Lake Annecy. Mr al-Hilli's daughters Zainab and Zeena survived the shooting in September. There was no DNA at the scene, but shell casings from the weapon suggest the gun used was an antique Luger, of the type issued to the Swiss army before the First World War. A collector's item, a Luger is unlikely to be the weapon of choice for a contract killer, experts have said. 'If it was done on a contract it was very badly done,' Mr Mailaud told the BBC. He did not comment on the weapon used. He said police were looking for people who had access to guns, such as hunters, collectors or members of shooting clubs - in particular those with psychiatric problems. 'Without doubt we are looking for someone who has killed before, someone who puts no value on human life,' he said. At one point investigators were looking into whether cyclist Mr Mollier was the target, but the theory has now been all but ruled out. Murder scene: Saad al-Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and his mother-in-law were all killed in an isolated lay-by near Lake Annecy in Eastern France . Scene of a deadly crime: Officers are seen inspecting the forested region near Chevaline and Lake Annecy . Officers are still looking into the . possibility that Mr al-Hilli was involved in a serious financial . dispute with his brother, Zaid, over a family will. There were even claims in Le Monde . that former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had paid £840,000 into a . Swiss Bank account set up in the businessman's name - however these were later denied by the French police. The al-Hilli are originally from Baghdad, having moved to Britain in 1971. Mr Maillaud said last month that the theory a lone and psychologically disturbed killer was behind the murders was 'gaining ground'. Prayers: Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her 74-year-old mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, was laid to rest in the same grave last week . Mr Maillaud confirmed at the time that the French . cyclist had at more bullets in his body than any other victim. There . have also been reports that he was shot first. A source told Le Monde: 'The theory of a . family feud is being pushed aside by investigators, who are now looking . at the possibility of a lone and psychologically disturbed killer. 'They . have carried out checks at all psychiatric hospitals in the region and . are tracking down all patients who may have been recently released or . were on day release. 'They are especially focusing those with previous convictions for gun violence or who were known to be attracted to firearms. 'Investigators . are on this basis also contacting gun clubs and hunting clubs in the . region. But so far they have had no satisfactory results to their . inquiries.' The prosecutor has previously described the huge challenge facing officials investigating the complex case. 'It's a long task and there's nothing that gives hope of a result in the near future,' he said. 'We're investigating everything but it all takes a lot of time, trying to piece together the lives of all the people who have died, trying to understand a real motive for these killings. 'Perhaps if we can understand why they were killed we can work out who killed them but at the moment there are many questions. 'I think the investigation will take a very, very long time, unless we discover something that will suddenly enable us to understand everything. 'There are lines of inquiry but each raises so many questions and nothing suggests there will be a quick solution.'","Aerospace engineer Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife, his mother-in-law, and a French cyclist were shot near Lake Annecy in September .

Mr Heath, 63, torched the 96 ft (29m) wide scale model of the palace after spending five months painstakingly crafting the impressive structure from 1,000 wooden pallets. And although he might share his name with the former Prime Minister - Mr Heath insisted there was no political motive to burning down his intricate creation. Scroll down for video . Five months of hard work goes up in flames as the model palace is finally set alight . The model was built from wooden pallets for a charity bonfire evening at the Royal Oak pub in Dilhorne . Mr Heath said the main building of the replica took about an hour to burn down . Around 2000 spectators crammed into a nearby ca park to watch the spectacle . Proceeds of the charity burning will be divided up between Air Ambulance and a local primary school . Mr Heath's wife jokingly threatened to leave him if he committed to building another replica such as the Palace . The replica palace featured the famous front gates, a Union Flag and even a copy of the balcony where Prince William and Kate Middleton shared their first kiss as a married couple. Mr Heath -who has previously burned replicas of Wembley Stadium and the White House to raise money for charity - even wrote to the Queen to ask for her approval to burn the model. He received a reply from the Queen’s secretary to say that Her Majesty was ‘interested to learn’ about his charity bonfire but it was not a ‘matter she could give or withhold her permission’ to.

'She wished me all the best for the future and my adventures raising funds for charity. I read this as a seal of approval.'

But MailOnline can reveal that Jill Kelley was taunted over her large nose in high school - and vowed to get plastic surgery to make it look better – and perhaps the episode points to an inner frailty about her looks that drove her determination to have a string of powerful men in her thrall. The woman who is at the center of the scandal that has felled two top generals told fellow pupils when she and her twin sister Natalie were 18, that they were ‘going to get a nose job and when we you do you’ll all be in awe of us’. Then and now: In her teens, Jill Kelley allegedly was defensive of her nose saying she would get plastic surgery . She was also ‘flirtatious’, gave boys . she met a big grin and used to wear tight blue jeans which brought many . an admiring male gaze. It is not clear if Mrs Kelley followed through on her promise to get plastic surgery. The claims show that Mrs Kelley’s interest in carefully crafting her image started at an early age. Since . the scandal broke she has appeared in public ‘looking a million . dollars’, notably in a bright yellow dress and three inch heels as she . climbed into her Mercedes outside her mansion in Tampa, Florida . yesterday and today in a polished pink and gold heels ensemble. Judging by pictures in her high school yearbook, she was glamorous and well aware of her charms even at a young age. In her official 1993 graduation photo for Lower Moreland High School in Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania she posed wearing a black dress and pearls around her neck with her jet black hair tumbling over her left shoulder. Close ties: Kelley (right) exchanged emails and IMs with General Petraeus daily but those were on his official account and were monitored by staff members . Her body is turned to the left and has a radiant grin on her face . Mrs Kelley, 37, has become the central . figure in the scandal which has caused General David Petraeus, 60, to . step down as head of the CIA and forced General John Allen to stand down . from his post leading US troops in Afghanistan. General Allen, who is married, sent her between 20,000 to 30,000 e-mail messages, some of which were of an inappropriate nature. General Petraeus’ mistress, Paula . Broadwell, an Army reservist who was also his biographer, is said to . have emailed Mrs Kelley and warned her to back off because she was . jealous, which led to the affair becoming public when the FBI got . involved. Mrs Kelley’s former high school friend . told MailOnline that in her youth she was ‘studious’ and would help . others out with their maths studies if they asked her. The friend said: ‘She and her sister were joined at the hip, we hardly ever saw them apart so we called them ‘The Twins’. From right: Holly Petraeus, Jill Kelley and her husband Scott, Gen David Petraeus and Jill Kelley's sister Natalie Khawam far left . Jealous: Broadwell sent Jill Kelley, far right, threatening emails warning her to stay away from Petraeus. Pictured with Kelley is her husband, Scott, and Holly Petraeus . ‘They joined in year 11 so there was . just one year before we went to college, and they didn’t have much time . to make lots of friends. I’m not sure they even went to the prom and I . don’t think they went to any of the parties that happened. ‘I’m stunned they are involved in all . this. I guess some people get their partying out of the way when they . are younger - they were pretty quiet at school so I guess it’s all . coming out now’. The friend added that both Mrs Kelley and her sister ‘used to get teased about their noses’. The friend said: ‘People used to say things. It did come out and it was quite pronounced and thick. ‘I remember her making a comment, it . was something like: ‘We are going to get a nose job and when we you do . you’ll all be in awe of us. I was like: ‘Errr, ok’. ‘Jill was flirtatious. She didn’t touch you or anything but she would look you in the eye and smile. ‘She would wear shorts in the summer . and she and her sister would wear matching jeans that were usually . pretty tight. She looked good. ‘She didn’t date anyone to my knowledge while she was at Lower Moreland. MailOnline can also reveal that Mrs . Kelley might have had access to ‘influential figures in the global area’ even before she left high school. All smiles: Jill Kelley, right, poses with Petraeus' wife, Holly, and daughter, Anne, with her sister Natalie . Family affair: Kelley, who throws parties for the military in Tampa, poses with the Petraeuses and her sister . She was a student member of the World . Affairs Council and would have been given the opportunity to meet . dignitaries at the highest level including presidents, prime ministers . and princes. According to the Philadelphia branch . of the nationwide non-profit organisation, it was founded in 1949 to . inform people of all ages ‘on matters of national and international . significance’. Among the guest speakers in the past . have been Prince Albert of Monaco, Mikhail Gorbachev, Ronald Reagan, . George H W Bush, George W Bush and Tony Blair. Its website says: ‘The Council . provides its members and the greater Philadelphia community with access . to influential figures in the global area as well as opportunities to . visit fascinating destinations through its unique travel program.’ Petraeus also made an appearance, but it was in 2010 and long after she had left school. Mrs Kelley - who appears in the . yearbook under her maiden name Khawam - was a ‘Mathlete’ and would have . competed against other schools in maths competitions. Career man: US General John Allen (left) and David Petraeus (centre) greet US Secretary of Defence Leon Panetta (right) as he lands in Kabul in 2011 . Successor: Allen last year took over from Petraeus as head of Western troops in Afghanistan . She claims to have written for student . newspaper Lion’s Roar which allowed students to ‘freely vent their . creative juices’, the yearbook says. The newspaper also started up a world . news section because, according to its 1993 editor Sharon Herring, there . was concern students were ‘lacking in their knowledge of the outside . world’. Another string to Mrs Kelley’s bow was . the Future Business Leaders of America whose members took part in . competitions where they learned skills that would be useful at work, . such as typing and accounting. In the yearbook Stephanie Simon said: . ‘I believe that FBLA not only exposes students to the important field of . business, but it also aides the community. ‘Students are able to get a taste of the real world in more ways than one’ Mrs Kelley also appears to have had a . strong moral compass and was a member of SADD - Students Against Drunk . Driving - another group called Students For a More Conscious Society, . the student council, a community outreach program called Operation Smile . and the Red Cross . Her other activities were computer . club, science club, orchestra basketball, cross country running, field . hockey, softball, swimming, tennis, track and field and orchestra. Mrs Kelley grew up in Philadelphia with her family, who emigrated there from Lebanon in the 1970s.

In her yearbook entry, Mrs Kelley’s twin sister Natalie Kwaham wears the same clothes as her sister and is also smiling. Her activities included concert choir, the World Affairs Council and Students For A More Conscious Society. The sisters moved to Tampa, Florida around ten years ago where they both became regulars on the social circuit. Mrs Kelley’s husband Scott works as a . surgeon, while Natalie Khawam is a lawyer who specialises in dealing . with whistleblowers, which has newfound irony considering Jill was the . one whose contact with the FBI led to the resignation of a . well-respected general and the investigation into another. A friend, who has known Kelley for . almost a decade, said that the revelation that Mrs Kelley exchanged . between 20,000 and 30,000 pages of communications with General John . Allen comes as a surprise. Scandal: Kelley stands out in a canary yellow dress as she leaves her Tampa home on Monday . Family: Allen is pictured with his wife Kathy (left) and daughter Bobbie (right) at a hearing examining the situation in Afghanistan in Washington, DC in March . 'This has come as a complete shock. You never know what goes on behind closed doors, but no one in her . circle saw this coming,' the friend told MailOnline. 'Jill was well known for throwing . parties where the military attended and she reveled in her role as . honorary ambassador but sending all those emails to a general is another . thing.' Her brother, David Khawam, has also revealed their fear that she will be branded the 'other woman'. Speaking to the Today show, he said: 'This is something that is going to brand her for life. 'My sister, number one, is a mother. She has three kids and is extremely dedicated to those kids. 'Number two she is a wife. She is . extremely dedicated to her husband and he to her. For her to have an . affair with General Petraeus is ludicrous. Mrs Kelley regularly kept in touch . with then-Gen. Petraeus when he became commander of the Afghan war . effort, the two exchanging near-daily emails and instant messages, two . of his former staffers say. But those messages were exchanged in . accounts that his aides monitored as part of their duties and were not . romantic in tone, the staffers said. Mr Khawam added that he expected his . sister, who has hired the crisis management firm employed by Monica .

Hodgson, who was only appointed last month to replace Fabio Capello, revealed his full squad as they head into battle in Poland and Ukraine. As well as including Arsenal winger Oxlade-Chamberlain, he also opted to call up another rookie - Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy, who will battle Robert Green to be Joe Hart's understudy. Ruddy will go ahead with his wedding on June 2, which was booked last year when he wasn't even considered for international duty.

The 18-year-old has started just six Barclays Premier League games for Arsenal and interim manager Stuart Pearce opted against bringing the winger into his squad for the February friendly with Holland.

They meet in Manchester on Wednesday before training at City's Etihad Stadium ahead of their flight to Oslo to play Norway on the Saturday. Seven days after that, England face Belgium at Wembley - although Ruddy will be missing, having been given special dispensation to leave for his wedding. The snub for Ferdinand is likely to signal the end of his international career. On Ferdinand's omission, Hodgson - who was under no pressure from the FA regarding Terry's inclusion - said: 'He is a man I respect. I had to make a football decision on the basis of what I have seen in recent months. It was a hard phone call to make. It was based purely on football and nothing else.'

Disappointment: Ferdinand, who lined-up for United in Tuesday night's testimonial for Harry Gregg in Belfast, will not be going to Euro 2012 . Talks were held between Terry and Hodgson at Chelsea’s Cobham training ground on Tuesday - and the England boss has resolved the issue of having Ferdinand and Terry in the same dressing room when Terry is awaiting trial for the alleged racial abuse Anton. The FA stripped Terry of the captaincy, which led to Fabio Capello quitting as England manager in February. On Friday, Sir Alex Ferguson did suggest the 33-year-old was not capable of playing two matches in four days, which might have played a part in Hodgson's eventual decision. Ferdinand has been a regular for United this season though and was fit enough to play 45 minutes in Tuesda night's testimonial match for Harry Gregg in Belfast. Out: Peter Crouch . In: Andy Carroll . Out: Micah Richards . The defender had made himself available despite the obvious potential for conflict with Terry.Ferdinand is known to be unimpressed with today's news though, which is likely to mark the end of his 81-cap England career and mean he will never have appeared at a European Championships. He was not selected in 2000, missed out through suspension four years later and was part of an England squad that failed to qualify for Euro 2008 under Steve McClaren. Hodgson also presented his new employers with a logistical headache when he cancelled next week’s training trip to Malaga in Spain. He had already decided to give the Chelsea players involved in Saturday’s Champions League final the week off, as well as Wayne Rooney, and has now decided it is not worth going.","Arsenal rookie named in 23-man party for Poland and Ukraine .

Doctors discovered Bobby-Jo had  suffered a ruptured aneurysm at the back of her brain. They fought to save her life for two hours but their efforts were in vain. Her father said: ‘The doctors said it could have happened at any time. It was horrendous, absolutely horrendous. The only small bit of comfort was that she was with people she loved. ‘I think she’s in the house all the time because I can feel her here. She always had a smile on her face. I used to pick her up from school and could tell straight away by looking at her face when she came through the doors what mood she was in.’ Her mother added: ‘Everything used to amuse her, she was always laughing and now the house is just dead without her.’ Bobby-Jo (left, aged four) had never been ill.

A runaway pet bunny rabbit was rescued by firefighters after an adventurous escape bid from his hutch that saw him climb onto the roof of a three-floor block of flats. Logan Witchell, aged three, was distraught when he found Barney the bunny had gone missing from his second-floor flat in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, before his mother spotted him above their home. Sophie Witchell, 28, and her partner Grant Wyatt, 29, spent nearly two hours attempting to entice the white and grey one-year-old bunny to safety using lettuce leaves and carrots. Back in safety: Sophie Witchell and her son Logan's pet rabbit Barney had to be rescued by firefighters after he escaped onto the roof of their block of flats in Southend, Essex . But the couple were forced to call for help from firefighters battling a blaze in a neighbouring street. Miss Witchell said: ‘Barney was hanging on for dear life. I kept thinking he was going to fall down because he was slipping down the roof tiles as he got higher and higher. ‘I was really worried about Logan too. He was saying we weren’t going to be able to get him down and was trying to reassure him. ‘Afterwards, he was giving the firemen high fives though and saying “Fireman Sam saved Barney”, which was really lovely.’ Barney is thought to have escaped from his hutch before climbing onto the gutter and up to the roof. Adventurous: The three-storey block of flats where Barney was rescued from in Southend-on-Sea, Essex . Ricky Jones, of Southend Fire Station, explained that firefighers had trouble because they could not get the aerial ladder platform in, so instead had to use a roof ladder to get to the stranded bunny. He said: ‘We had to bring it down as it belonged to a three-year-old little boy. We’ve got two guys on the watch who are retiring soon and they’ve never been to anything like it in 30 years. 'Barney was hanging on for dear life. I kept thinking he was going to fall down because he was slipping down the roof tiles as he got higher and higher' Sophie Witchell . ‘Normally, when we work at heights, we have the aerial ladder platform out but we couldn’t get it in so that proved to be a problem. Working at height is a problem in itself. ‘We have to make sure we’re safe as well. After a bit of a run-around, we managed to corner the rabbit and grab it. The child and his parents were obviously thrilled to get it back.’ Two firefighters used the ladder while residents held towels between balconies to block any escape routes. The crew cornered Barney, placed him in a pillow case and returned him to his owners. The rescue bid happened shortly after 7.40pm last Saturday at a block of flats on Pleasant Road, which are located a two-minute walk from the town's seafront.","Logan, 3, left distraught when Barney the bunny escaped second-floor hutch .

In court: Angela Owen, 46, pleaded guilty at Bradford Crown Court to concealing the birth and preventing the burial of the child, whose body was found in 2006 . A 46-year-old woman has admitted secretly giving birth to a stillborn baby boy and burying his body in a bin liner in the grounds of a 300-year-old mansion once owned by an Emmerdale actor. Angela Owen pleaded guilty to concealing the birth and preventing the burial of the child, whose body was found in 2006 by workmen at Howroyd Hall, near Halifax in West Yorkshire. Owen, who had not been seen since 2004 and was arrested in Somerset earlier this year after an appeal on BBC Crimewatch, also pleaded guilty to a number of fraud charges. Those related to using different names in order to obtain a car, a passport, a driving licence and financial services. Owen spoke to confirm her name and enter pleas at Bradford Crown Court. Owen, who appeared in court with dyed red hair, a grey coat and pink striped scarf, admitted trying to conceal the birth of the child, between 2001 and 2006, by secretly disposing of the dead body. She also pleaded guilty to preventing the lawful burial between the same dates by putting the baby boy’s body in a black plastic bin liner and concealing it in the grounds of Howroyd Hall, in Barkisland. Owen used the name Angela Hobson to obtain a Lotus Elise car by deception, from November 2002 to December 2003 - and Co-op Bank credit services, from October 2002 to January 2003. She used the name Emma Smith to run a pub in Oldham, Greater Manchester, between December 2003 and January 2004 - and to try to get a driving licence in January 2004. Forensics tent: Workmen dug up the body in the garden of Howroyd Hall, near Halifax, in July 2006, which used to belong to Emmerdale actor Richard Thorp. The actor sold it more than a decade before the baby was found . She claimed to be Carla Geissler to try to get a passport in March 2004. In April 2003, she made off from a Huddersfield hotel, without paying for £325.40 of accommodation, food and telephone calls. Owen, of Glastonbury, Somerset, pleaded not guilty to four charges, including obtaining property or services by deception and conspiracy to obtain property by deception. 'Miss Owen says that she was a victim of domestic violence at the hands of a former partner and the majority of her actions were the result of his behaviour' Christopher Tehrani, prosecutor . But prosecutor Christopher Tehrani said no trial will sought on the counts with not guilty pleas. He said Owen had entered a basis of plea that she committed the crimes as she was a domestic violence victim. He said the Crown did not accept this at the moment and would probe the claims. ‘Miss Owen says that she was a victim of domestic violence at the hands of a former partner and the majority of her actions were the result of his behaviour,’ Mr Tehrani said. Workmen dug up the baby’s body of in the garden of Howroyd Hall in July 2006, which used to be owned by Emmerdale’s Richard Thorp, who played Alan Turner in the soap for more than 25 years. Mr Thorp sold the house more than a decade before the discovery of the baby and Owen had been living there before the body was found. A post-mortem found it was a newborn, full-term baby boy. West Yorkshire Police said the death was not suspicious but appealed for help to find Owen. Before her arrest this year, Owen was last seen in June 2004 when she visited the Weston-super-Mare area. She was known to have many aliases, including Ann Hall and Helen Gee. An appeal to find Owen was issued on Crimewatch in May this year. She was arrested in Avon and Somerset a short time later. Owen will appear before Bradford Crown Court again on December 14.","Angela Owen pleaded guilty to concealing his birth and preventing burial .

Serial object destroyer Alan Sailer has turned his twisted attention to exploding much-loved toys with explosive results . Mr Potato Head gets a baking and Pikachu, from much loved series Pokemon, looks a little worse for wear . Poor old Mickey Mouse blows his top after Mr Sailer turns his attention to him . Tweety Pie clings on to a flowerpot for dear life as he is destroyed with firecrackers . And thanks to his . photographic expertise, the 57-year-old has managed to capture the . moment the poor playthings were blown apart. Unfortunate toys and characters include a Mickey Mouse mug blowing its top, Tweety Pie losing his head, a troll head cracking up and a Rubik's Cube exploding into pieces. Mr Sailer, from Camarillo, California, explains: 'The poor defenseless toys are common so I pick them up from garage sales. I try my best to keep the costs under a dollar per shot. 'I will admit that it is fun to mess with toy archetypes. I have to smile when an icon of sweet innocence like My Little Pony crumbles to pieces in rather horrifying way.' To blow up the objects Alan uses a firecracker modified so that it can be fired using an electrical signal. Mr Sailer said he smiles when toys such as dolls (left) and My Little Pony (right) are destroyed in a 'horrifying way' It is not just toys like Dora the Explorer (left) that fall foul of Mr Sailer's wrath. A Christmas ornament gets the explosion treatment too . Serial object destroyer Alan Sailer has turned his twisted attention to exploding much-loved toys . He then has to synchronise the opening of the camera shutter with the explosion. It does not need to be really accurate, but it does need to be better than lighting a fuse. 'The camera is unimportant, it's not a special camera. I use a Nikon D90 for most of my shots. I have also used an old Nikon F3 film camera, a Canon G6, Rebel XT etc. 'The camera must have a manual focus and manual settings is all. 'The flash is the key, that and the detector/trigger. 'I use a home built flash based on a model built in the 1950s by Harold Edgerton. 'The flash is really fast about 1 millionth of a second and it stops the action. 'The detector/trigger is also critical. 'It detects that the debris from the explosion has arrived and fires the flash at just the right moment.' And it is not just toys which appear to test Mr Sailer's patience. The eccentric photographer has in the past turned his lens, and his gun, to a range of different foods, shooting items such as Brussel Sprouts and Camembert cheese at close range and catching the fall out on camera.
