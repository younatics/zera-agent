"New research has shown that Aussie travellers have stashed away over $800 million in leftover currency from their overseas trips. The MasterCard Money Management Index estimates that $813 million in foreign currency is stuffed away in bedside tables and filing cabinets after being thrown aside by Australian travellers. The research found 45% of Australians have travelled overseas in the past 12 months and on average have $221 in foreign currency sitting at home as a result. New research has shown that Aussie travellers are sitting on more than $800 million in leftover currency from their overseas trips . The study predicts the habit of leftover currency will decline in coming years, as travellers embrace prepaid travel cards, which allow them to get a refund on leftover currency or save it until the next trip. According to MasterCard Australia Country Manager, Andrew Cartwright, Australians love the convenience and safety of prepaid travel cards. 'Australians love a bargain when it comes to travel, and we're often conscious of our spending while we're away, he said. 'Yet, when we come home and empty our wallets, it turns out we are sitting on significant sums of leftover currency,' The research found 45% of Australians have travelled overseas in the past 12 months and on average have $221 in foreign currency sitting at home as a result . 'MasterCard has seen a 70% growth in prepaid cards since the beginning of 2013. In fact, 1 out of every 5 dollars Australians spend overseas on their MasterCard cards is now on a prepaid travel card. 'People don't need to rifle around in desks and drawers every time they head overseas, trying to find their leftover notes and coins,' Mr Cartwright said referring to the prepaid travel cards. Mr Cartwright said people feel safer when they aren't carrying around large amounts of cash and he believes prepaid cards avoid the hassle of dealing with conversion rates and commission costs while on holiday. The study predicts the habit of leftover currency will decline in coming years, as travellers embrace prepaid travel cards, which allow them to get a refund on leftover currency or save it until the next trip . The Australian dollar has fallen from 95c against the US dollar in July, to around 87c today prompting would-be holidaymakers to act now and start using travel cards. 'Another benefit of a Prepaid travel card is that it allows you lock in the exchange rate on the day the card is loaded. As Australians watch the dollar decline, many are deciding to buy now before it drops any further,' Mr Cartwright said.","Australians are sitting on more than $800 million in foreign cash .

"Weapons that dominated Europe for more than 3,000 years were introduced by the ancient Minoan civilisation, according to a new study. Swords, metal battle axes, long bladed spears, shields and possibly even armour were brought to Europe by the Minoans who ruled Crete. The finding overturns the popular perception originally put forward by archaeologists that Ancient Crete was one of the most peaceful civilisations in history. Scroll down to video . The palace of Knossos reveals an advanced and organised society. Since towns and palaces in Crete, the home of the mythical Minotaur, were first dug up and studied a century ago the Minoans have been widely regarded by archaeologists as an essentially peaceful people. The reputation was built up because of what was perceived as a lack of images of war preserved in jewellery, frescoes and other artifacts at the Palace of Knossos and other key sites. But a reassessment of the role of warriors and weapons in Ancient Crete, which was at its peak from 1900BC to 1300BC, now concludes that the Minoans were a violent and warlike people. Dr Barry Molloy, an archaeologist at the University of Sheffield, carried out the study and concluded that there was ‘a staggering amount of violence’ in Minoan society. ‘Their world was uncovered just over a century ago, and was deemed to be a largely peaceful society,’ he said. ‘In time, many took this to be a paradigm of a society that was devoid of war, where warriors and violence were shunned and played no significant role. Bull-leaping shown in a Minoan fresco was a skill that would have been prized by a military elite, Dr Molloy says. ‘That utopian view has not survived into modern scholarship, but it remains in the background unchallenged and still crops up in modern texts and popular culture with surprising frequency. ""In fact it is to Crete we must look for the origin of those weapons that were to dominate Europe until the Middle Ages, namely swords, metal battle-axes, shields, spears and probably armour also.’ The double-headed battle-axes would have made a lethal close-quarters weapon that could hook over and drag down an opponent's shield, while a spear-head that was designed to punch through armour. Write caption here . He said most of the weapons started appearing in Crete in about 1800BC and continued until the introduction of gunpowder in about 1500AD. Such military hardware, he said, was honed by the Cretans before being taken up by other European civilisations, including the Ancient Greeks. He started looking at just how peaceful or warlike Ancient Crete was and soon realised there was not just a wealth of evidence of violence but that warfare was ‘a defining characteristic of the Minoan society’. Images of bull-leaping, boxing, wrestling and hunting were accompanied by symbols of a warrior elite, he said, and that it was an expression of male identity. Artistic impression of the bustling market place at Knossos. ‘ Ideologies of war are shown to have permeated religion, art, industry, politics and trade, and the social practices surrounding martial traditions were demonstrably a structural part of how this society evolved and how they saw themselves,’ he said. ‘There were few spheres of interaction in Crete that did not have a martial component, right down to the symbols used in their written scripts.’ In a paper - Martial Minoans? War as social process, practice and event in Bronze Age Crete - published in the Annual of the British School at Athens, he said Cretan weapons illustrated the transition from ‘the use of the tools of hunting’ to ‘purpose-designed weapons of war’. He added: ‘The introduction of the sword represented a quantum leap in combat practice.’","Minoan culture was permeated by warfare and violence .

"Some of the world’s most troubling times, which have included periods of intense racism, have occurred during economic downturns. And now a new study has found that people really do have a tendency to become more racist during a recession. Researchers found that faces seem ‘blacker’ and have stronger racial features during an economic downturn, and this in turn increases the likelihood of discrimination. A new study has found that people have a tendency to become more racist during a recession. In an experiment, participants judged faces have having a darker skin tone and stronger 'Afrocentric' features during a financial downturn (bottom left graph). When they were asked to distribute money, people allotted less money to a face with stronger 'Afrocentric' features in times of financial scarcity than to the same face in normal economic conditions (right) The study by New York University claims that conditions of ‘resource scarcity’ alter people’s perception of race. Their work follows a study last year, which suggested racism is on the rise in the UK, fuelled by financial strife. In four experiments, involving 285 non-black Americans, scientists David Amodio and Amy Krosch found people see faces different during an economic downturn. ‘It’s well known socioeconomic disparities between white Americans and racial minorities expand dramatically under conditions of economic scarcity,’ Professor Amodio said. ‘Our findings indicate scarcity changes the way people visually perceive another person’s race - and this perceptual distortion can contribute to disparities.’ In the first experiment, participants were shown pictures of faces which varied along a continuum from black to white, before being asked to state whether the face in the image was black or white. Individuals who held strong beliefs that white people suffer financially when black people make economic gains were more likely to perceive mixed-race faces as black, than individuals without such beliefs. The study by New York University claims that conditions of 'resource scarcity' alter people's perception of race. Here, graffiti is shown on the side of a derelict warehouse in Detroit, which has been largely distressed since the collapse of the motor industry . In the second experiment, the concept of economic scarcity was unconsciously introduced with subliminal messages like ‘scarce’, ‘sparse’ and ‘limited’. The scientists found that more people were likely to perceive mixed-race face images as black than when economic scarcity was not introduced. Krosch said: ‘People typically assume what they see is an accurate representation of the world so if their initial perceptions of race are actually distorted by economic factors people may not even realise the potential for bias.’ Those who more strongly believed in resource competition between both racial types had a lower threshold for identifying mixed-race faces as black, than did subjects who did not hold these views. People under financial strain generated images of faces with darker skin and stronger ‘Afrocentric’ features than people without tight budgets, in the third experiment. And in the final test, participants allocated less money to faces that were perceived as ‘more black’ when money was scarce. According to the study, which is published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, ‘the results suggest that economic scarcity may alter individuals’ visual perception of black Americans, likely eliciting increased discrimination and that this process may worsen socioeconomic disparities.’ Professor Amodio said: ‘Together our results provide strong converging evidence for the role of perceptual biases as a mechanism through which economic scarcity enhances discrimination and contributes to racial disparities.’ A recent international study found that white people develop 'passive tolerance' of minorities in mixed areas, such as central London (pictured) even if they have no direct contact with them . People can be made less racist by simply moving to live in ethnically-mixed areas, a recent study claims. International research found that white people develop ‘passive tolerance’ of minorities in mixed areas, even if they have no direct contact with them. Professor Miles Hewstone, director of the Oxford Centre for the Study of Intergroup Conflict, said governments could create more ‘harmonious neighbourhoods’ by doing more to encourage different ethnic groups to mix. ‘If two white people with identical views went to live in different postcodes for a year, the person in the neighbourhood with more mixing between ethnic groups would likely leave more tolerant,’ he said. ‘We would see this effect even if they never personally spoke to people from other ethnicities. The Oxford University-led study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal, is based on seven studies carried out in England, mainland Europe, the United States and South Africa between 2002 and 2011. It found that even highly prejudiced people who did not mix with those of different ethnicities became more tolerant the longer they lived in mixed areas. The scientists suggest simply seeing white strangers ‘interacting positively’ with ethnic minorities is enough to reduce racial prejudice.","Study by New York University found that faces seem ‘blacker’ and have stronger racial features during an economic downturn .

"Racism still exists when cutting a deal, according to a new study. Black people had to put more money on the table for a white person to accept their offer in comparison to offers from people from other ethnic backgrounds and other white people. The study carried out at New York University was set up to test if racial tensions came to the surface in financial deals. The study found that black people had to put more money on the table for a white person to accept their offer in comparison to offers from people from other ethnic backgrounds or other white people . Researchers believed that prejudices linking black American men with ‘aggression, hostility, and untrustworthiness’ would affect their chances of getting a fair deal when negotiating with a white person. They set up a series of experiments where 49 participants from different ethnic and racial backgrounds engaged in an ‘ultimatum game’, where players either rejected or accepted split offers of money. The participants were paired off and researchers designated one of the pair as a ‘proposer’, who was given $10 to split with their partner. If their partner accepted the offer the money would be split accordingly, but if it was rejected then both the participants had to walk away from the failed deal empty handed. Research showed how on the whole the participants were more likely to accept a monetary offer from a white proposer than a black proposer . The results, published in the journal Psychological Science, showed how on the whole the participants were more likely to accept an offer from a white proposer than a black proposer. Further analysis showed than black people had to offer more money in order for their opposite numbers to accept the deal. Researchers believe the effect was down to ‘specific stereotypes or prejudices associated with black Americans’. The study was inspired by the U.S. Government's debt ceiling debates in 2011 where political parties were prepared to reject a deal even if it appeared to damage their own supporters. Psychologist Dr Jennifer Kubota, who led the study, said: ‘Many members of both the House and Senate seemed willing to incur costs that would hurt their own constituents in order to vote along political lines. The study was inspired by the U.S. Government's debt ceiling debates in 2011 where political parties were prepared to reject a deal even if it appeared to damage their own supporters . ‘The debate led us to wonder: Are people willing to punish members of another group when they perceive their behaviour as unfair, even when exacting that punishment comes at a personal cost? ‘It has been suggested that race bias in economic decisions may not occur in a market where discrimination is costly, but these findings provide the first evidence that this assumption is false. ‘Our work suggests that after offers are on the table, people perceive the fairness of those offers differently - even when they are objectively identical - based on race.’ The study highlighted the fact that the amount of money changing hands was small in the experiments and, had the potential financial gain been greater regardless of how ‘fair’ the deal was, the participants may have been less likely to reject it. However, Dr Kubota and her colleagues said their findings have 'broad implications' for other situations where people punish others because they think they are being unfair. She said: ‘These findings may be especially relevant for legal and economic decisions and serve as a potential example of how people punish unfair or negative behaviour in real-life.’","People from other races, however, didn't suffer the same discrimination .

"A radical new sensor could detect Ebola in blood samples within 30 minutes. Experts say the shoebox-sized gadget can be operated by anyone, and could be shipped to west Africa to help monitor the spread of the disease. It works by reflecting light, and has been shown to be effective in spotting the Ebola virus. Ebola (pictured) was discovered in 1976 and is a member of the Filoviridae family. Now researchers say they have developed a cheap, quick test for it . One of the big problems hindering containment of Ebola is the cost and difficulty of diagnosing the disease when a patient is first seen, researchers say. Conventional fluorescent label-based virus detection methods require expensive lab equipment, significant sample preparation, transport and processing times, and extensive training to use. The Boston University team has spent the past five years advancing its solution. They say the device could be used to diagnose Ebola and other hemorrhagic fever diseases in resource-limited countries. The first demonstration of the concept, described in the American Chemical Society journalNano Letters in 2010 and developed by an ENG research group led by Selim Ünlü, a professor of biomedical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and materials science and engineering, in collaboration with Bennett Goldberg, a College of Arts & Sciences professor of physics, showed the ability to pinpoint and size single H1N1 virus particles. Plans are afoot for a future, simple to use version of the system with a touchscreen interface . The shoebox-sized battery-operated prototype diagnostic device is known as the single particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (SP-IRIS). It detects pathogens by shining light from multicolor LED sources on viral nanoparticles bound to the sensor surface by a coating of virus-specific antibodies. Interference of light reflected from the surface is modified by the presence of the particles, producing a distinct signal that reveals the size and shape of each particle. The sensor surface is very large and can capture the telltale responses of up to a million nanoparticles. After four years of refining the instrumentation with the collaboration of John Connor, a School of Medicine associate professor of microbiology, and other hemorrhagic fever disease researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch, the team has demonstrated the simultaneous detection of multiple viruses in blood serum samples—including viruses genetically modified to mimic the behavior of Ebola and the Marburg virus. Mentioned in Forbes magazine as a potentially game-changing technology for the containment of Ebola, the device identifies individual viruses based on size variations resulting from distinct genome lengths and other factors. The current BU prototype requires little to no sample preparation time and delivers answers in about an hour. Funded by the National Institutes of Health, the research appears in the May 2014 ACS Nano. 'Others have developed different label-free systems, but none have been nearly as successful in detecting nanoscale viral particles in complex media,' says Ünlü, who is also ENG associate dean for research and graduate programs, referring to typical biological samples that may have a mix of viruses, bacteria, and proteins. 'Leveraging expertise in optical biosensors and hemorrhagic fever diseases, our collaborative research effort has produced a highly sensitive device with the potential to perform rapid diagnostics in clinical settings.' Whereas conventional methods can require up to an hour for sample preparation and two hours or more for processing, the current BU prototype requires little to no sample preparation time and delivers answers in about an hour. 'By minimizing sample preparation and handling, our system can reduce potential exposure to health care workers,' says Connor, a researcher at the University's National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories (NEIDL). 'And by looking for multiple viruses at the same time, patients can be diagnosed much more effectively.' The shoebox-sized battery-operated prototype diagnostic device, known as the single particle interferometric reflectance imaging sensor (SP-IRIS), detects pathogens by shining light from multicolor LED sources on viral nanoparticles bound to the sensor surface by a coating of virus-specific antibodies. By late January, 1.4 million people in Liberia and Sierra Leone could be infected with the Ebola virus. That's the worst-case scenario of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa recently offered by scientists at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC warns that those countries could now have 21,000 cases of the virus, which kills 70 percent of people infected. Interference of light reflected from the surface is modified by the presence of the particles, producing a distinct signal that reveals the size and shape of each particle. The sensor surface is very large and can capture the telltale responses of up to a million nanoparticles. SP-IRIS devices are now being tested in several labs, including a Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) labat the University of Texas Medical Branch that's equipped to work with hemorrhagic viruses. Other tests will be conducted at BU's NEIDL once the facility is approved for BSL-4 research. Based on the team's current rate of progress, a field-ready instrument could be ready to enter the medical marketplace in five years.","Shoebox-sized gadget can be operated by anyone .

"Not long ago, when talking about computer storage, the gigabyte was considered an enormous amount of space to have on a personal computer. The likes of terabytes (1,000 gigabytes) were the domain of scientists and tech giants. But in an increasingly online world companies such as Facebook and Google are storing never-imagined quantities of data. So now they currently deal in terms of petabytes. And beyond that there are exabytes, zettabytes, yottabytes and... nothing else; there is no language to describe at amount of data larger than that. Scroll down for video . Google's data centre in Douglas Country, Georgia: The amount of data held by the internet giant means there may soon need to be a new number created to measure the quantity . The largest current number with a recognised designated prefix is a 'yotta' - a digit with 24 zeroes. It was recognised at the 19th International Committee for Weights and Measures in 1991 along with zetta, for 21 zeroes (and their submultiple counterparts, zepto and yocto). In March 2010 ago a campaign to name the number 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 'hella' attracted strong support from scientists. An online petition that started in . California - where the word 'hella' is slang for 'many' - called for . the word to become an internationally recognised prefix, joining the . likes of mega, kilo and giga. The word would apply to figures with 27 zeros after the first digit. Supporters of the campaign believe . recent breakthroughs in science mean the International System of Units . (SI) needs to go further with its classification of long numbers. Campaign organiser Austin Sendek, from the University of California, said at the time that the name hella would be an appropriate choice. 'Since the SI system has traditionally adopted the last names of accomplished scientists for unit nomenclature, it follows that prefix designation should do the same,' he said. 'From this tradition comes the chance for the SI system to use nomenclature to honor a constantly overlooked scientific contributor: Northern California.' The area is also notorious for the creation and widespread usage of the English slang 'hella,' which typically means 'very,' or can refer to a large quantity (e.g. 'there are hella stars out tonight'). Long way to go: The number would not be needed by Sesame Street's Count . The campaign has attracted the interest of a British chemist who helps advise the International Committee for Weights and Measures. Professor Ian Mills of the University of Reading said at the time: 'The prefixes we introduced 20 years ago are still not widely used. There is no point making changes that nobody pays any attention to which would only make things more complicated. 'At the moment we are focusing on more pressing issues, such as redefining the weight of the kilogram. But he is correct to say that we will need prefixes to express a greater range of magnitudes as science advances. The very fact that a student is asking a question like this is very encouraging.' Prof Mills suggested that a simpler option would be for the committee to relax rules banning compound prefixes, so that, for instance, a hella could be expressed as a kiloyotta.Some suggest the next prefix will be 'xenna', after the Greek 'ennea' for nine, though they could also go with 'nonna', 'enna', or any other similar variation of the Greek or Latin. But nothing can be decided until the International Committee for Weights and Measures convenes again. And until such time Google and Facebook can continue their march into the unknown.","Currently the largest measurement is a yottabyte .

"There are many reasons why an increasing number of people are classified as obese - and now racism could be one of them. Frequent experiences of racism are associated with a higher risk of obesity among African American women, a new study claims. Scientists found that women who were more frequently victimised for their race, were more likely to be obese. Frequent experiences of racism are associated with a higher risk of obesity among African American women, a new study claims. Scientists found that women who were more frequently victimised for their race, were more likely to be obese. Here, a teenager in Virginia is examined in hospital before gastric band surgery . The study, by Slone Epidemiology Centre at Boston University, found the relationship between racism and obesity was strongest among women who reported consistently high experience of racism over a 12 year period. The research was based on the Black Women's Health Study, which enrolled 59,000 African-American women in 1995 and has followed them since. While rates of obesity in the U.S. have risen rapidly over the past few decades, the greatest increases have been seen in African American women, half of whom are currently classified as obese. Obesity is a risk factor for numerous health conditions including cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and orthopaedic problems. Scientists said that racism is a form of psychosocial stress that African Americans experience disproportionately. It is thought that experiences of racism contribute to obesity. Data suggests that chronic exposure to stress can result in dysregulation of important neuroendocrine functions, (interactions between the nervous and endocrine systems) which can influence the accumulation of excess body fat. The study found that women who reported everyday racism in and outside of work in surveys conducted in 1997 and 2009, were 69 per cent more likely to become obese compared to those in the lowest category . The Black Women's Health Study collected information on experiences of racism, height and weight and other lifestyle factors via biennial questionnaires. The participants were asked in 1997 and in 2009 to rate the frequency of ‘everyday’ experiences of racism, such as receiving poorer service in restaurants and if they had been treated unfairly because of their race in their job, in housing or by the police. Researchers analysed the results of women under the age of 40 in 2009 because most adult weight gain occurs during the reproductive years. They found that women in the highest category of reported everyday racism in both 1997 and 2009 were 69 per cent more likely to become obese compared to those in the lowest category. Women who reported more lifetime racism were also at increased risk of obesity, according to the study, which was published in the American Journal of Epidemiology. ‘Experiences of racism may explain in part the high prevalence of obesity among African American women,’ said Yvette Cozier, assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University who led the research. She believes that workplace and community-based programmes to combat racism are an important component in strategies to prevent obesity, especially in high risk communities. Another new study found that a sample of mostly white American children think that black children feel less pain than white children. Scientists from the University of Virginia found that children as young as seven hold the belief and their study, published in the British Journal of Developmental Psychology, builds on previous works on bias among adults involving pain perception. They testest children at ages five, seven, and 10 by asking them to rate the severity of pain that they believed would be felt by other children of the same gender in different situations, such as bumping their head, or slamming a hand in a door. When shown pictures of black children, the seven and 10-year-olds tended to rate the pain as being less severe than when they were shown pictures of white children. ‘Our research shows that a potentially very harmful bias in adults emerges during middle childhood, and appears to develop across childhood’ said Rebecca Dore, a PhD candidate in developmental psychology at the university. She thinks the finding is important because many kinds of explicit biases emerge in early childhood - such as children wanting to play with friends of their own race - but those types of biases often decline in later childhood. However, the racial bias in children’s perceptions of others’ pain appears to strengthen from early to late childhood. ‘Talking to children about racial issues early may be important for preventing the development of biases that could have consequences in adulthood,’ she said.","Researchers found relationship between racism and obesity was strongest among women who were frequent victims of prejudice .

"Ibuprofen can make your lungs look younger - and could even help fight tuberculosis, researchers have found. New research shows that the lungs become more inflammatory with age. However, an Ohio team found that ibuprofen can lower that inflammation. Scroll down for video . An X-ray showing the lungs in a 16 year old healthy male. researchers say that Ibuprofen can make your lungs look younger - and could even help fight tuberculosis. The researchers gave old and young mice ibuprofen in their food for two weeks and then examined their lung cells. Old mice in the study were 18 months old – equivalent to about 65 in human years – and young mice were 3 months old, a similar age to human young adults. After this diet modification, several pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of old mice had been reduced to levels identical to those in the lungs of young mice, and the macrophages in old mouse lungs were no longer in a primed state. In fact, immune cells from old mouse lungs fought tuberculosis bacteria as effectively as cells from young mice after lung inflammation was reduced by ibuprofen. The ibuprofen had no effect on the immune response to TB in young mice. 'Very few researchers have linked inflammation to infectious disease in old age, even though TB in particular will drive that inflammation even further,' said Joanne Turner, associate professor of microbial infection and immunityat Ohio State and senior author of the study. 'The inflammation-associated changes that we saw in the lung were a small finding, but an important finding because the implications are great,' Turner said. 'We should be able to modify the environment in the lung. 'If we can reverse the inflammatory environment in a very straightforward way, that is a positive.' The research is published in the Journal of Leukocyte Biology. Though this line of work might someday support the use of ibuprofen as an adjunct therapy for elderly people with TB, researchers said they are not recommending use of the drug for the purposes of lowering inflammation. 'You can actually reduce your inflammation as you age by being lean, eating well and exercising. And we know that in the elderly, people who are fitter live longer,' she said. 'Inflammation is associated with sickness and frailty.' Though the research was conducted in mice, Turner co-led a previous study indicating that both mouse and human lungs develop the same profile of pro-inflammatory proteins and fatty molecules with age, creating an environment that impairs the immune response to infection. 'Essentially, ibuprofen made the lungs of old mice look young, Turner said. Researchers said they are not yet recommending use of the drug for the purposes of lowering inflammation . 'Putting young mice on ibuprofen had no effect because they had no lung inflammation, which implies the ibuprofen reduced the inflammation and changed the immune response in the old mice,' Turner said. 'It might be that ibuprofen works on specific pathways to lower inflammation, and that might help with control of TB.' More than 9 million people worldwide are estimated to have active TB infections, and about 1.4 million people die of tuberculosis each year. The researchers gave old and young mice ibuprofen in their food for two weeks and then examined their lung cells. After this diet modification, several pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lungs of old mice had been reduced to levels identical to those in the lungs of young mice, and the macrophages in old mouse lungs were no longer in a primed state. Most previous research establishing inflammation's links to aging and disease has tested blood for elevated proteins that signal an inflammatory environment. These researchers found the same proteins in the lungs of old mice. Research has already established that the inevitable inflammation that comes with aging is linked to such conditions as Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Turner and colleagues have extended the work to test whether ibuprofen affects the elderly mouse immune response to TB infection.","Researchers found lungs become more inflammatory with age .

"Many of us were taught that Native American populations were almost wiped out by diseases such as tuberculosis, brought to the New World by European explorers. But a new theory suggests the arrival of seals and sea lions could in fact be to blame. Scientists believe the marine animals brought the disease to South America where it spread - long before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. Scientists believe that seals  and sea lions brought tuberculosis to South America where it spread to people long before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492 . While estimates vary, it is thought that 95 per cent of the 20 million people living in the Americas before the Europeans arrived were killed by ‘new’ diseases carried by explorers. Anthropological geneticists Anne Stone of Arizona State University and Johannes Krause of the University of Tubingen in Germany have studied pre-Columbian Mycobacterial tuberculosis genomes. The team examined TB DNA from 1,000-year-old skeletons found in Peru as well as other samples and compared them to a dataset of modern genomes. They found a clear relationship to TB lineages in animals - especially seals and sea lions. Tuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person. It is caused by a bacterium called mycobacterium tuberculosis. TB mainly affects the lungs but can attack bones and the nervous system. Symptoms include: A persistent cough for more than three weeks, weight loss, night sweats, a fever and tiredness. Now-a-days it is treated with antibiotics. In the last 20 years TB cases have gradually increased in the UK - and elsewhere in the world. In 2011, 8,963 cases of TB were reported in the UK. Of these, more than 6,000 of these cases affected people who were born outside the UK. It is estimated that one-third of the world's population is infected with latent TB. Of these, about 10 per cent will become active at some point. Their study, published in the journal Nature, describes ‘unequivocal evidence’ that TB spread to American Indian populations before any explorers arrived. ‘Skeletal evidence of tuberculosis is present in the archaeological records in both the Old World and New World,’ said Elizabeth Tran, of the National Science Foundation's Division of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences. ‘The source of tuberculosis in the New World long has been a question for researchers. ‘This paper provides strong evidence that marine mammals may have been the likely culprits, bringing tuberculosis to South America long before Europeans arrived there.’ Scientists think that once European tuberculosis strains arrived in the Americas, they completely replaced the strains brought over by seafaring animals. This confused diagnosis of the impacts on Indian populations as researchers struggled to identify which tuberculosis strain was involved in American Indian deaths. ‘We are not sure what the timeframe was for the replacement of American strains by European strains after contact,’ said Dr Stone. ‘It is likely that the new European . strain, which is more virulent, was a culprit - particularly since . tuberculosis is really good at spreading during times of social crowding . and distress.’ Scientists think that once European tuberculosis strains arrived in the Americas - carried by explorers such as Christopher Columbus (illustrated), they completely replaced the strains brought over by seafaring animals . Africa has the largest variety of TB strains, suggesting the pathogen likely originated there and spread. This study supports the theory that humans gave the disease to animals and within the last 2,500 years, marine animals carried the disease from Africa to South America where they gave it back to humans. Dr Krause said: ‘The connection to seals and sea lions is important to explain how a mammalian-adapted pathogen that evolved in Africa around 6,000 years ago could have reached Peru 5,000 years later.’ It is hoped that the study could help to understand the recent emergence of the disease.","Geneticists from US and Germany analysed 1,000-year-old skeletons in Peru .

"An ancient synagogue unearthed on the shoreline of the Sea of Galilee may have been a temple where Jesus preached, according to the Christian organisation that owns the site. Archaeologists have been excavating the 2,000-year-old ruins, which date from the 1st century, in the town of Migdal in northern Israel. The town is thought to sit on top of what was the ancient town of Magdala, the birth place of Mary Magdalene, one of Jesus' most devoted followers. The synagogue ruins, pictured, were first uncovered in 2009 and they are thought to date back 2,000 years . During excavations in preparation for the construction of a new hotel on beachfront on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, archaeologists uncovered a delicately carved stone featuring menorah, a seven branched candelabrum that is a symbol in Judaism. Migdal is the modern-day name for the village of Magdala,  situated on the northwestern shore of the Sea of Galilee at the foot of Mount Arbel. Magdala is said to have been the hometown of Mary Magdalene, one of . Jesus' most loyal followers. She is referred to in the gospels as Mary, and it is believed that her name was a variation of 'Mary from Magdala'. Researchers are studying the site looking for clues about how and when Magdalene first met and began following Jesus. Now the Legions of Christ, the Catholic organisation which owns the land where the synagogue was discovered, are now claiming that Jesus himself may have preached there. Father Eamon Kelly, vice chargé of the Pontifical Institute Notre Dame of Jerusalem Centre, told Israeli news website Haaretz that there was now strong evidence that Jesus had preached there. He said: 'This is the first synagogue ever excavated were Jesus walked and preached. 'He was a clever rabbi. He knew where to set up shop. If you walk from Nazareth to Bethsaida to Capernaum, you're going to come out here.' Father Kelly said that although Jerusalem and Bethlehem are more commonly associated with Jesus, he actually spent 80 per cent of his life in what is now northern Israel. The book of Matthew in the bible also mentions Jesus setting food in Magdala, saying: 'He took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.' Until the town of Tiberias was built, the only town on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee was Magdala, which sat along an ancient trade route from Egypt to Syria. The site of the ancient synagogue had been covered in litter and weeds for years before excavations began . It is thought to be here that he met with Mary Magdalene, or Mary of Magdala as she is also known. Father Kelly said that the ancient synagogue would have served as a meeting point where people in the town would have gathered. He said: 'If a strange rabbi came to town, a new rabbi, a new preacher, a new teacher, the logical place was to meet here.' The synagogue is thought to have existed during what is known as the Second Temple period. Experts believe it was originally built in the 1 CE and was a simple structure before being refurbished in 40 CE. This stone, with carvings on each site and the top including one of a seven-branched candelabrum, was found in what was the main hall of the synagogue, which also had a mosaic floor and plaster walls . Archaeologists have discovered a main hall that is around 1,291 square feet, with stone benches built up against the wall of the hall. The floor is made of mosaic and the walls appear to have been treated with coloured plaster. It is in this hall that the engraved limestone block featuring the menorah, along with carved images of amphora, was discovered. The reliefs are the oldest menorah ever found on stone. Archaeologists believe the block was probably used for reading or writing the Torah. According to archaeologists, the synagogue was probably destroyed in around 67 or 68 CE by the Romans during their first war with the Jews. In addition to the synagogue, excavations around the site have also uncovered ancient baths and fishing pools. 'Actually what the archaeologists are saying now is we're digging up an entire 1st century city,' said Father Kelly. The site will ultimately have a visitor's centre, hotel, restaurant and inter-faith chapel built around the ruins . There is still another 12 acres of the site to be excavated. The Legion of Christ, which is creating a Magdala visitors centre on the site, are also planning to build a hospice and restaurant along with an inter-faith chapel. Some 5,000 people have visited the site, according to the Magdala Centre. According to the excavation director, Dina Avshalom-Gorni, excavation director with the Israel Antiquities Authority, said: 'We are dealing with an exciting and unique find. 'The synagogue that was uncovered joins just six other synagogues in the world that are known to date to the Second Temple period.'","Synagogue is thought to have been focal point when Jesus visited Magdala .

"Earlier this week a pilot and his co-pilot spotted a mysterious orange and red glow while flying over the Pacific Ocean. The strange lights baffled the pilots, with no obvious explanation available. But a Nasa researcher has told MailOnline that he thinks the answer may lie in an 'energised bubble' in Earth's atmosphere caused by either solar wind, a powerful microwave beam or even a controversial research station in Alaska. Strange lights have been spotted near the Russian peninsula of Kamchatka (image by Dutch pilot JPC van Heijst). The sighting was made by pilots flying from Hong Kong to Alaska. The glow came about 20 minutes after a vertical lightning bolt was seen . The High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp) is an ionospheric research program in Alaska. It is funded by the US Air Force, the US Navy, the . University of Alaska and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). Its purpose is to analyse the ionosphere and investigate the . use of ionspheric enhancement technology. Its main instrument is the Ionospheric Research Instrument . (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility. Haarp has been the subject of numerous unfounded conspiracy theories. It has been blamed for hurricanes, thunderstorms, major . power outages and more, but no convincing evidence supports any of the claims. 'I could imagine that something from the solar wind, possibly a small highly energised bubble that penetrated the protective shield of the magnetosphere, hit the Earth's uppermost atmosphere and produced this very local effect,' Nasa researcher Dr Friedemann Freund, told MailOnline. 'Alternatively the ionospheric research station Haarp [High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program] in Alaska might have sent some powerful microwave beams to the ionosphere and created this local instability.' Haarp is an ionospheric research program jointly funded by the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the University of Alaska, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). It was established to analyse the ionosphere - a region of the upper atmosphere - and investigate the development of ionospheric enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance. The station regularly uses a tool called the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility operating in the high frequency band. It is used to temporarily excite a limited area of the Ionosphere. Haarp has been the subject of numerous unfounded conspiracy theories. It has been blamed for hurricanes, thunderstorms, major . power outages and more, but no convincing evidence supports any of the claims. The strange . lights were spotted south of the Russian peninsula Kamchatka during the . flight of a Boeing 747-8  from Hong Kong to Anchorage, Alaska. Previously, it has been thought that they may . have originated from the explosion of a huge volcano under the surface . of the ocean. On the nature of the lights themselves, Dr Freund adds: 'The dominant colours in the photographs are green and red. 'The green appears to be the same as aurora lights which are known to arise from an electronically highly excited state of oxygen atoms, decaying to the ground state by emitting light at 557.7 nanometres. 'The red appears to be likely due to atomic oxygen emitting at 630 nanometres. 'In both cases energetic particles, probably electrons, hit the oxygen atoms and caused them to become electronically excited.' Nasa astronomer Dr Freund says the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program (Haarp) in Alaska may have been the cause. Its purpose is to analyse the ionosphere. Its main instrument is the Ionospheric Research Instrument (IRI), a high-power radio frequency transmitter facility (shown) After the initial vertical lightning bolt it was thought the phenomenon could have been a thunderstorm, but that was ruled out when none were reported in the area. The favoured theory by pilot van Heijst at the moment is that the lights were caused by an underwater volcano. Such . eruptions are not unprecedented; on 21 November 2013 an submarine . volcano famously created a new 'island' off the coast of Japan. Another explanation is they were caused by lights from fishing boats. Last . week astronaut Reid Riseman was left baffled by a similarly bizarre . green flurry of lights (shown below) off the coast of Bangkok, created by fishing boats using LED lights to attract squid. However . that explanation has been ruled out for the latest mystery glow, as . more than 50 boats would be needed to produce light of this magnitude - . but no fleet of fishing boats was thought to be operating in the area. Dutch pilot JPC van Heijst explained on PBase how, five hours into the ten-hour flight, they spotted an intense flash of light like a lightning bolt, directed vertically up in the distance. This was then followed by a deep red and orange glow 20 minutes later. And the experience left van Heijst somewhat perturbed, owing to the lack of an explanation for what happened. ‘Last night over the Pacific Ocean, somewhere South of the Russian peninsula Kamchatka I experienced the creepiest thing so far in my flying career,’ he said. There were no thunderstorms on their route or weather-radar, suggesting the lightning did not originate in a storm. The glow is also a mystery; similar lights have been spotted from squid-fishing-boats, but van Heijst says this ‘would not make sense in this area’. ‘The closer we got, the more intense the glow became, illuminating the clouds and sky below us in a scary orange glow, in a part of the world where there was supposed to be nothing but water,’ he continued. ‘The only cause of this red glow that we could think of, was the explosion of a huge volcano just underneath the surface of the ocean, about 30 minutes before we overflew that exact position.’ He was then nervous of encountering an . ash-plume in the middle of the night, but fortunately they did not . encounter anything of the sort. Before the flight they had heard via radio about earthquakes in Iceland, Chile and San Francisco. But . despite their being a few volcanoes on their route, they had had not . been alerted to any new activity - although this doesn't necessarily . include unseen underwater volcanoes. The strange lights (shown at the pink dot) were spotted south of the Russian peninsula Kamchatka during a flight from Hong Kong to Anchorage, Alaska (flight path in blue) Van Heijst ruled out squid-fishing-boats as the origin. He says the cause may have been an underwater volcano. An ongoing investigation is taking place to find out what happened . Together with his co-pilot van Heijst says they felt ‘everything but comfortable’, while no other aircraft were nearby to confirm the sighting. ‘We reported our observations to Air Traffic Control and an investigation into what happened in this remote region of the ocean is now started,’ he added. ‘Now I'm just hoping that if a new island has been formed there [from the eruption], at least it can be named after me as the official discoverer. ‘That would be pretty cool!’ ‘The closer we got, the more intense the glow became, illuminating the clouds and sky below us in a scary orange glow, in a part of the world where there was supposed to be nothing but water,’ said van Heijst . Around the Pacific Ocean is a region known as the Ring of Fire, where a large number of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions occur that may have been the origin of glow. The horseshoe shape is 25,000 miles (40,000 km) and, with 452 volcanoes, is home to more than 75 per cent of the planet's active and dormant volcanoes .","Earlier this week unexplained lights were spotted near Kamchatka, Russia .

"A fascinating interactive map from security firm Norse serves as a stark reminder to just how dangerous the web can be. The live graphic plots every attack taking place on the internet, in real-time and reveals the number of attacks, where the attacks originate, and which locations they are aimed at. And the map highlights the staggering number of attacks that take place between the U.S. and China - who are said to be locked in a cyper-spying war. Norse's interactive live map, shown above, allows viewers to watch as live attacks unfold around the world. The most popular target seems to be the U.S., with many attacks originating in China. At certain times, a large attack will take place when hackers try to take a website offline, known as a DDoS attack. The map was designed to work in Chrome and loading times may vary depending on your browser . To gather the data, Norse uses a worldwide 'honeypot', which is, essentially, a vulnerable network purposefully set up to knows when it is being attacked. DDoS stands for 'Distributed denial-of-service' attack, when hackers use a network of 'zombie' computers to sabotage a specific Web site or server. The . idea is pretty simple - a hacker tells all the computers on his . botnet to contact a specific server or web site repeatedly. The sudden increase in traffic can cause the site to load very slowly for legitimate users. Sometimes the traffic is enough to shut the site down completely. This lets the company tell when and where an attack is originating from, creating a live map around the world. It also lets the company detect when a huge attack is taking place, perhaps to take down a website or render a service inoperable. ‘Every second, Norse collects and analyses live threat intelligence from darknets in hundreds of locations in over 40 countries,’ the company wrote. A darknet being a private network. ‘The attacks shown are based on a small subset of live flows against the Norse honeypot infrastructure, representing actual worldwide cyber attacks by bad actors. ‘At a glance, one can see which countries are aggressors or targets at the moment.’ To gather the data Norse uses a worldwide honeypot, in essence a purposefully vulnerable network that knows when it is being attacked.

Earlier this month, a security . report by security firm McAfee found that cybercrime is . now such big business, it is worth more than the wealth of some . countries. As . a business, cybercrime would be ranked 27th in the world based on . revenue, and the attacks are currently costing the world more than £238 . billion ($400 billion) a year.

"Scuffle: Solomon Yemane-Berhane, 21, got into an approximately three minute scuffle when two convenience store owners catch him trying to steal beer from their store . An Oregon man left a convenience store with less than he walked in with when the store owners caught him trying to steal two beers and wrestled with him for nearly four minutes until he fled the store in nothing but his boxers and sneakers, authorities say. Twenty-one year old Solomon Yemane-Berhane was arrested last Sunday and charged with resisting arrest, assaulting a police officer, third-degree robbery, third-degree criminal mischief, third-degree theft, and fourth-degree assault, according to The Oregonian. A more than four minute surveillance video captured the scene Nov. 9 at a Best Mart in Beaverton beginning when one of the store's owners raced to the front door to block Yemane-Berhane from leaving with the stolen beers. The owner manages to keep Yemane-Berhane away from the door long enough for her husband arrive. The three then wrestle around the store for about three minutes knocking down displays and tossing candy and other items onto the floor. Two other store-goers were inside at the time, but out of the camera's view during the scuffle. Yemane-Berhane manages to slip out of the owner's hands, only after being wrestled out of his jacket, t-shirt, and shorts. He flees the store in his boxers with the owners not far behind. After a short lull in the video, suveillance footage catches Yemane-Berhane returning to the store and snatching his jacket and shirt off the floor before leaving again.

"Flexing his pecs and admiring his glowing stage tan, Cosmo Taylor begins his posing practice. He recently competed in his very first bodybuilding show against an impressive line-up of muscular physiques from all over the UK. But unlike his fellow competitors, Cosmo leaves the house every morning with his school lunch-box and a kiss on the cheek from his mother - because he's only 14 years old. Scroll down for video . Ripped: Cosmo is the youngest competitive bodybuilder in the UK and started training at just 11 years old . With his ripped, striated physique and on-point stage routine, Cosmo, from Inverness, Scotland, could easily be mistaken for a bodybuilder twice his age. He started training at just 11 years old and as the youngest competitive bodybuilder in the UK, Cosmo lifts weights for an hour every day. He also does cardio before school to help keep his body fat below eight per cent. And as the youngest member of a super-fit family of four, he enjoys firm support from his biggest fans - his mother and father. Cosmo says: 'My dad's a bodybuilder and he's always been my inspiration. Ever since I was a little boy, all I've wanted to do is step on stage. 'Dad has encouraged me every step of the way- he's my coach, my gym buddy and my training partner. 'My sister comes to the gym with us too - she's a competitive power lifter and has even won gold medals - I'm really lucky to have such a good support network around me. 'Next year all three of us will all be competing in the same season - mum will help to prep our food and will be there to support us at our shows. 'The gym is my life - I love lifting and I love the buzz I get when I hit a personal best or see growth in my muscles. At the moment, I weigh 73kg, but eventually I want to hit around 90-95kg.' Discliplined: The 14-year-old, who trains constantly, could easily be mistaken for a bodybuilder twice his age . Cosmo competed in the Silver City Classic Bodybuilding show in Aberdeen on November 9. The competition was his very first, and was a 'test' to determine whether bodybuilding is the sport he wishes to pursue long-term. While some parents may think Cosmo is too young to train as a bodybuilder, his mother Florence and father Andrew believe he has everything it takes to be a star in the sport, and prepare his meals accordingly. Florence says: 'Cosmo is on a very strict diet to ensure he is the best he can be come competition time. 'Bodybuilding is a very unforgiving sport, and every muscle in Cosmo's body must be developed to demonstrate size, symmetry and condition. 'He currently eats four meals a day, consisting mainly of lean meat, brown rice, sweet potato and oats. 'Cosmo snacks on chicken and salad throughout the day at school, and whenever he can he will come home for lunch so he can have a hot meal too. 'Andrew (his father and coach) gives him one cheat day a week - which means he's allowed to eat whatever he wants - after all, he is only 14 and still growing, and we have to recognize that. Breakfast: Scrambled eggs and porridge oats . Mid-morning: Roast chicken and salad . Lunch: Chicken, pork, steak or fish with vegetables and brown rice . Dinner: Chicken, pork, steak or fish with salad and sweet potato . 'Cosmo's body fat sits at around 10% which is extremely low for a child of his age, so we have to be careful. 'It will come down even further for the day of his show, but during the off season it will probably go up to around 12%.' A keen swimmer, BMX rider, and skateboarder, Cosmo enjoys pursuing a wide range of physical activities during his time out from the gym. But when he does push iron, there's no messing around. Cosmo says: 'I can bench press more than my own body weight but it's not all about how much you can lift. 'Bodybuilding is not all about size and strength- it's an aesthetic sport so you have to train all your muscle groups to complement each other correctly. 'For example, it's no good having a huge chest if you have no arms- that'd just look weird. 'My favourite muscle groups to train are arms because I tend to see quick progress in those areas, and my worst is back- I need to work on that some more. 'It can take years and years to build a good physique, and there's always room for improvement- there is no 'perfect' body- plus, it's a very subjective sport and you never know what the judges might be looking for. The teenager competed in the Silver City Classic Bodybuilding show in Aberdeen on November 9 . 'The day before my shows I cut my water right down to dehydrate myself - this helps to bring my muscles to the surface and give me a vascular look. 'It's amazing how much you can change your body through making small tweaks like fluid intake. 'My friends at school are fascinated by my physique because most of them haven't started going to the gym yet. 'They ask me questions all day long about how to get bigger arms and how to pump up your chest. 'Some of my male teachers laugh and joke about how they'd love to have a body like mine too.' Despite having no shortage of admirers, Cosmo insists he's still too young for love. He said: 'I don't have a girlfriend at the moment, but the time will come. At the moment I'm too focused on my diet and training to think about dating girls. 'I'm only 14 - most of my friends don't have girlfriends yet either. Family business: Cosmo is pictured with his sister Bronwyn, 16 - who is a prize-winning power lifter . 'When I do meet someone they will most definitely have to be into fitness, enjoy going to the gym and most importantly- impress my mum and dad.' Cosmo's proud mother Florence said: 'We are extremely proud of Cosmo for having achieved so much at such a young age. 'His body is earned, not given, and his hard work and dedication has certainly paid off. 'Both our children are extremely active- his sister Bronwyn is a very successful power-lifter- it's how we encourage them to be. 'Some parents might think Cosmo's regime is radical for a boy of his age, but it's his choice, he absolutely lives for his training. Fan club: The bodybuilding schoolboy's biggest supporters are his parents Florence and Andrew . 'He is extremely mature for his age, both physically and mentally. 'His father Andrew is particularly looking forward to competing with him at the British Natural Bodybuilding Federation show next spring - they will be a father and son duo. 'We will always support Cosmo in whatever career or sport he decides to pursue as an adult and can't wait to see him up on stage.' Graham Park, organizer of the Silver City Classic event said: 'Cosmo is certainly the youngest competitor we've seen, and to my knowledge the youngest competitor in the sport to date. 'He competed against men seven years his senior in his class, which is very ambitious. No matter how good your genes may be, it takes years to build an impressive physique. 'I don't foresee any health problems with someone of Cosmo's age competing. 'I'd encourage more youngsters to take up the sport- it's certainly better than living on crisps and chocolate like many school kids seem to do nowadays. 'The great thing about bodybuilding is we get people come to us of all ages and it doesn't discriminate against the young or the old. 'It's the friendliest, most welcoming sport you could ever take part in.'","Cosmo Taylor, of Inverness, spends one hour every day lifting weights .

"PM David Cameron said ‘red warning lights’ are flashing in the global economy as Japan slid back into recession and eurozone growth stutters . Public spending cuts must continue for years to secure Britain’s recovery as the world faces a new financial crisis, David Cameron warned last night. The Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne said ‘red warning lights’ are flashing in the global economy as Japan slid back into recession and already-anaemic growth in the eurozone stuttered. With official forecasts in next month’s autumn statement expected to show the Government’s efforts to shrink the deficit have stalled, Mr Cameron told MPs: ‘We have made clear that after the next election will be further reductions in spending. The alternative of simply putting up taxes would destroy the recovery.’ Britain was outperforming most of the rest of the world but could be dragged down by failure of other countries – particularly European neighbours – to rein in spending, make their economies more business-friendly and use monetary policy effectively, the Prime Minister said. Labour leader Ed Miliband accused him of ‘getting his excuses in early’, saying: ‘You used to tell us that the problems in the British economy were all to do with the British Government and nothing to do with international factors. ‘Now, you want to tell us that on your watch they’re all to do with international factors and nothing to do with the British Government.’ The mood about the global economy has darkened in recent weeks, with growing fears about the state of the eurozone. Official figures last week revealed the countries in the single currency managed only feeble growth of 0.2 per cent in the third quarter of this year, with deflation in a number of nations including Greece. Economists fear the single currency bloc could be heading for another slump incorporating falling prices, mounting real debt levels and stagnant growth. Yesterday, the Japanese economy unexpectedly shrank for the second quarter in a row, pushing the world’s third biggest economy into recession. China is growing more slowly than at any time in the last five years, while even the US economy has been expanding robustly only in the last six months or so. Chancellor George Osborne's (pictured) autumn statement is expected to show that the Government’s efforts to shrink the financial deficit have stalled. It comes as an already-anaemic growth in the eurozone stuttered . The Tories’ intervention appeared calculated to correct a growing assumption by voters that the job of austerity is complete now the UK has turned a corner following the biggest crash since the Great Depression. Mr Cameron, who returned yesterday from a G20 summit of world leaders in Australia, said: ‘I’m very happy to defend and take some credit for what is happening in the British economy – growing at three per cent, the biggest fall in unemployment on record, 400,000 new businesses. ‘Because of the difficult decisions we took, the British economy is doing well. ‘The difference I would say is now while there are problems in the world economy, you can actually see that Britain is outperforming other countries in the world and the figures speak for themselves.’ But he said the eurozone was ‘teetering on the brink’ of what would be its third recession – and called on the European Central Bank to do more to shore up its economies. Mr Osborne said: ‘We’ve discovered Japan has gone into recession, Europe remains very weak, and although the British economy is performing well we’re not immune to these things. ‘It’s all the more reason why we’ve got to go on working through our long-term economic plan.’ Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘What’s going on here is a government that in two weeks’ time is going to have to make an autumn statement where they would like to say the economy is getting stronger, the deficit is coming down, and people are better off. ‘But they know they’re going to have to say that the economy is weakening, the deficit is getting larger, and for four years people have got worse off.’","Public spending cuts to continue to secure Britain's recovery in economy .

"The young woman who spent an entire flight in the cockpit hanging out with the pilots of a Malaysian Airlines plane in 2011 says it was 'scary and eerie' to learn one of the men was flying MH370 when it disappeared. Jonti Roos, a South African currently living in Melbourne during a year-long stay in Australia, revealed last week she and her friend Jaan Maree were plucked from the queue while waiting to board a flight from Phuket to Kuala Lumpur and asked if they would like to ride up front. Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, the co-pilot of missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370, spent the flight smoking in the cockpit and chatting with the two girls, Ms Roos claims. Scroll down for video . Defending her story: Jonti Roos says she only came forward to share the information on the co-pilot and was not seeking fame . Jonti Roos (centre) claims she and her friend were entertained by Fariq Abdul Hamid, 27, who is one of the pilots of the missing Malaysia Airlines flight (right) As the search for MH370 continues and authorities investigate the possibility that Mr Hamid and Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah were involved in the plane's mysterious disappearance, Ms Roos says she feels like her life was in his hands. 'It’s scary and it's a bit eerie, and I think that it makes me think about it a bit more than anyone else would,' she told Channel Nine's Inside Story on Wednesday. 'It's um...  If the pilots were at fault here then it's scary knowing that my life was in the hands of those pilots.' Ms Roos has defended her decision to come forward and reveal on A Current Affair last week her controversial encounter with Mr Hamid. She and Ms Maree, who were teenage backpackers at the time, posed for pictures with the pilots and were invited to extend their trip so they could hang out again. In the cockpit: The girls took numerous photos of themselves with the Malaysian Airlines co-pilot . Jonty Rossi posed with the other pilot on the plane and spoke of also meeting Fariq Abdul Hamid, when they struck up a friendship in 2011 . Jonty Roos has told A Current Affair of her friendship with Fariq Abdul Hamid, the first officer of Flight MH370 when she and her friend Jaan Maree(above) were invited into the cockpit during a flight in 2011. Mr Hamid's family - hurt by Ms Roos' television appearance - have since contacted the young woman, who has also been accused of showboating during a serious and complex investigation. 'They told me that they felt he'd been painted in a bad light. But that wasn't my attention,' Ms Roos added. 'My heart goes out to them and breaks for them, but it's just what happened in the cockpit.' 'People say that I was doing it (appearing on TV) for attention... they said that the information was completely irrelevant, they said that I should have come forward with this information two years ago when it happened.' Despite an extensive search that has spanned large expanses of Asia and the Indian Ocean and dozens of unproven theories, the Boeing 777-200 is still missing. Flight MH370 disappeared on March 8. Before takeoff: Jonti posing next to the Malaysian Airlines flight in 2011 before her flight . Plucked from the queue: Jonti and her friend were invited by the pilots to join them for the flight, and says it is 'scary' to think her life was in their hands . The pilots entertained the girls and posed for photos without them throughout the 2011 flight from Phuket to Kuala Lumpur . One question that emerged after Ms Roos came forward last week: 'How was she even allowed near the cockpit?' It's commonplace, particularly since September 11, for airlines to completely bar access to the cockpit except for essential personnel. But Ms Roos says it never raised any eyebrows at the time. 'It certainly didn't seem unusual,' she said. 'No-one seems from what I noticed, shocked by it and it did seem like it may have happened before. I do agree that safety measures weren't followed completely at the time I didn't realise. 'I assumed if everyone was so comfortable with us being in there it was something that was done, something that was allowed, but now that I know how strict safety measures are supposed to be.’ Happy snap: Fariq Abdul Hamid, co-pilot on the ill-fated Malaysia Boeing 777 Airlines flight bound for Beijing from Kuala Lumpar .

"A housemaid in Dubai has been jailed for life for murdering the 11-month-old daughter of her British employer. Dubai Criminal Court found the 29-year-old Indian woman guilty of strangling the girl by wrapping a scarf around her neck after gagging her to stifle her cries. After initially confessing the crime to prosecutors, the nanny switched her plea to not guilty to premeditated murder saying she loved the girl ‘like her own children’. Trial: The 30-year-old Indian nanny is accused of strangling the 11-month-old baby girl with a scarf in their Dubai home as an act of revenge on her British employer when she was not allowed holiday (stock image) She said that following her arrest she suffered torture while in custody and made her confession under duress. But the court decided that she had in fact killed the child out of anger at her employers for not giving her time off to go to her mother's funeral. The maid's mother had died a month before the murder. But her employers, who were unable to get time off work, told her to delay her trip until her residency documents for staying in the United Arab Emirates were completed. The prosecution alleged that after being refused time off, the maid killed the baby to ensure she would not be needed for childcare duties and would therefore be allowed to travel. On January 18 the maid waited for her sponsors to leave their Al Nahda, Sharjah, home for work at 10am. She then wrapped the scarf around the baby's neck, strangling her. The court hear that the maid continued with her chores as the child lay dying. The victim's aunt told the court in May how the maid had called her to say the baby was not waking up and had breathing difficulties. The aunt had called her sister and rushed to the home, where she found the girl unresponsive. 'I tried to wake her up, calling her name, but she did not respond,' she told the court in May, according to The National. Pleading: The babysitter told presiding judge Ezzat Abdul Lat at Dubai Court of First Instance that she had loved the 11-month-old 'like her own' Doctors at Zelukha hospital in Dubai reported the matter to police, suspecting foul play. A post-mortem examination found a bruise around the child's neck from a tightened scarf. It also found bruising around her mouth that indicated she had been gagged to stop her from crying out. The 36-year-old mother of the baby, who is also originally from India but who holds a British passport, told a previous hearing of her relationship with the nanny. The mother said: 'We treated her so well, she was like a sister to me, we ate on the same table.' Her husband, who has asked for the death penalty added: 'We celebrated her birthday and took her out for an ice-cream treat after we bought her some gifts. 'I often told her that I would pay for whatever her children need back in India and I was even looking for a job for her husband to bring him here so they can be together.' The verdict remains subject to appeal within 15 days.","Babysitter strangled 11-month-old girl with a scarf after gagging her .

"For the last two years, Dale Decker has suffered 100 orgasms a day - but has not enjoyed one. The 37-year-old is the first man to speak out about suffering persistent genital arousal syndrome. He developed the condition in September 2012 after slipping a disc in his back while getting out of a chair. Scroll down for video . Dale Decker, 37, from Wisconsin, pictured with his wife April is the first man to speak out publicly about suffering persistent genital arousal syndrome . While he was en route to the hospital, he suffered five orgasms. Since that moment he has been plagued by the condition, he describes as 'disgusting and horrendous'. According to medical literature, trauma to the pelvic nerves can trigger hypersensitivity in this area. The painful pelvic condition has left him housebound and isolated, through fear of suffering a public orgasm. The condition that causes him to suffer more than 100 orgasms each day after he slipped a disc in his back two years ago. Since that moment he has been plagued by the condition, he describes as 'disgusting' He said: 'Imagine being on your knees at your father's funeral beside his casket - saying goodbye to him and then you have nine orgasms right there. 'While your whole family is standing behind you. It makes you never want to have another orgasm for as long as you live. 'There's nothing pleasurable about it because even though it might feel physically good - you're completely disgusted by what's going on.' He added: 'If you're in public, if you're in front of kids - it's disgusting and it can break you real fast. 'It happened to me at the grocery store and when it was over there were around 150 people looking straight at me - why would I leave the house when something like this can happen.'

April and Dale Decker pictured today (left) and in happier times on their wedding day in August 2002 (right) Mr Decker lives in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, with his wife April and two sons Christian, 12, and Tayten, 11. While doing all she can to support her husband, Mrs Decker said his condition is 'hard to live with'. She said: 'We really struggle right now as he is unable to work and supply for his family and I feel like all the strain is on me. 'It's really upsetting, we don't do things that man and wife should do and we argue over things that should not be affecting us. 'Because he sometimes has episodes at night we took the decision to sleep in separate beds. Dale Decker pictured as a young man, left, before he developed the condition and right as a child . 'That can be very frustrating. You want the comfort from another person, particularly your husband, but we don't have that. 'I really miss the old Dale, we used to have a lot of fun and one day I pray that he will come back to me. 'Maybe the doctors will find a cure for this - I don't know - I just really hope that they do.' The horrific condition has cost Mr Decker many of his friends and the relationship he shares with his sons has also been affected. Dr David Goldmeier, an expert on sexual medicine at Imperial College in London said: 'Persistent genital arousal disorder is a condition, where the sufferer complains of long periods of genital arousal that are not associated with sexual desire. 'PGAD sufferers experience intrusive, unsolicited and spontaneous genital arousal that can be unrelenting. This arousal can persist for hours, days or even longer. 'This can be highly distressing for a woman and despite attempts to relieve it with sexual activity or orgasm, this often doesn't help or can worsen the symptoms. 'Spontaneous genital arousal is quite common but it's those women who can't control the arousal which is uncommon. 'I see around 20 women a year with this condition, it may be as common as one in 100 we just don't know. 'Sometimes it may resolve on its own, there is no cure but there are a number of ways to manage the symptoms such as meditation and pelvic floor exercises along with pain medication for the patient.' 'He struggles to be a good father to the children because they obviously don't understand what is happening,' his wife added. 'He can't take them to practice - can't play ball with them, it's really hard.' Despite suffering from a near constant erection Mr and Mrs Decker rarely have sex. 'Occasionally we will but it's very frustrating for both of us,' Mr Decker said. 'I've tried reading about it, tried going to doctors but nobody can help me - I don't know what I'm going to do. 'I just want to get my old life back - I just want to get back what this condition has taken from me.' Despite many medical professionals being unable to even diagnose the condition, there are some specialists in the field. Dr Dena Harris is a gynecologist who has mainly worked with women who suffer with PGAS. Speaking from her office in New York City, she said: 'It's clear Dale is really suffering and I'm sure there are some people who will say that this is just in his head. 'But it's not - it's a serious medical condition and I just hope he gets the help he so desperately needs. 'Being aroused can be a wonderful thing but this is not like arousal, it's not even sexual. 'It's a horrendous spasm and it can be terribly painful. 'Dale looks like he is in pain - not just emotionally but physically as well. 'I've got to be honest, there is help available but if Dale doesn't get help soon then there could be huge risks in the future. 'Suicide is always a concern when people suffer from this condition - they feel like they have no other way to escape it.'","Dale Decker developed persistent genital arousal syndrome two years ago .

"Predator: The remains of Kevin Patrick Stoeser, 41, who escaped from a halfway house in Austin, Texas, in October 2012 were found in a field more than a year after he fled . A skull found in a Texas field belongs to an Army veteran convicted of a string of child sex offences who escaped from a halfway house more than a year ago, officials have revealed. Kevin Patrick Stoeser fled the Austin Transitional Center in October 2013 just weeks before the completing a 10-year prison sentence for multiple offences. The 41-year-old had sex with girls as young as 13 while stationed at Fort Hood, and was also convicted of abusing five victims as young as 12. The predator was also caught in possession of child pornography. Following his escape Stoeser, who was dishonorably discharged from the Army following his conviction, was then placed on the U.S. Marshal's 15 most wanted list. A $25,000 reward was offered for any information leading to his capture. In September a yellow Labrador brought the skull to its owners front yard two miles away from where Stoeser was incarcerated. The bones were so weathered they were sent to a genetics lab for DNA testing. The results revealed the remains belonged to the former soldier, according to KUVE. His 'wanted' pages on the US Marshals' and Texas Department of Public Safety were changed on Monday, confirming that he was dead. As he came to the end of his sentence, his cellphone was said to have 30 pictures of underage girls. He then managed to escape and was not seen by authorities until his remains were found. Robert Almonte, U.S. Marshal for the Western District of Texas, said in a statement: 'With the untimely death of Stoeser, we can now bring closure to this case.' 'On behalf of the United States Marshals Service, we appreciate the assistance of our law enforcement partners throughout the nation who contributed a great deal of time and energy to see this investigation through.' Stoeser was dishonorably discharged from the Army in 2003 after he pleaded guilty to carnal knowledge of a child between the ages of 12 and 16, sodomy, possession of child porn and indecent liberties with a child under 16. Police are now investigating what happened to the predator. Deputy U.S. John Clifton, the lead criminal investigator on the case, said: 'The physical description of the human skull and where it was found sparked U.S. Marshals interest in the case, because it was very similar to key facts concerning our fugitive investigation for Kevin Stoeser.' End of hunt: Stoeser's page on the Texas Department of Public Safety was updated to say he was 'captured' confirming it was his skull that was found in the Austin field by a Labrador in September . Facility: He managed to escape from the Austin Transitional Center after a member of staff found 30 pictures of underage girls on his cell phone.

"Jailed: Pawnbroker Harvey White, pictured, used his business to cover up the proceeds of the scam . A pawnbroker helped launder £1million for a gang of rogue builders who conned elderly and vulnerable victims out of their life savings. Harvey White, 49, used his business in Clacton, Essex, to cover up the proceeds of the scam, which saw the gang of six builders overcharging their customers for work to their homes. Most of the cheques used to pay for the building work - which was often left incomplete - were paid out at White's pawnshop, where he had a licence to cash cheques. Roughly £9million passed through the business over a five-year period, but police could only trace £1million back to the gang of builders, who operated in north Essex, Chelmsford Crown Court heard. But, as more than half of the suspected 140 victims contacted were unwilling to help and others died before enough evidence was collected, police believe that the actual amount of money laundered was much higher. White, from Clacton, was jailed for nine years after being convicted of laundering money and six gang members were sentenced in July for their roles in the scam. Judge John Dodd QC said: 'Some £9million passed through your accounts between 2008 and 2013, but it has not been possible to find the provenance of all that money, . 'What we do know is you did have a completely dishonest side to your business where the principle money laundering for this gang of rogue builders took place. You were an absolutely vital part of this.' Two of the gang members were caught on tape celebrating the death of one of their victims, who had been duped out of £123,000, because she wouldn't be able to testify against them. And widower Andrew Millar, who is blind, believes the gang stole at least £300,000 from him. The 68-year-old had known the gang's ringleader, James Brown Snr, for 25 years because the builder had carried out work for his late wife, Marjorie. While 92-year-old Helen Reeve-Smith, from Clacton, paid more than £10,000 in cheques for work that was left incomplete. Detectives found CCTV of Brown Snr taking Mrs Smith to a bank to withdraw money in a clearly in a confused state. She died in June last year. Cover: Roughly £9million passed through White's business in Colchester, Essex (pictured) and police believe he would have laundered more than the £1million that was traced to the gang of six rogue builders . Ringleader James Brown Senior, 45, of Colchester, was jailed for 10 years for his part in the scam. His son, James Brown Jnr, brother, William Brown, and accomplices, Peter Biddle and Van Purdy, were jailed in July for their involvement. Anthony Symes was handed a two-year suspended prison sentence. Andrew Shaw, prosecuting, said White was trusted by the gang. He said: 'These sort of men were not using an innocent dupe. They did not go to someone they did not know or trust. Scam: Ringleader James Brown Snr (left) was jailed for 10 years for his part in the scam, which saw the men overcharge elderly victims for building work. His brother, William Brown (right), was jailed for seven years . 'Harvey White is a professional criminal, a professional villain. They used a professional.' White did not give evidence in his trial. When he was interviewed, he told police he did not know the cheques were the proceeds of crime. Two of the builders involved in the scam were recorded celebrating the death of one of their elderly victims. Ringleader James Brown Snr and his accomplice William Brown had tricked 87-year-old Grace Gibbs into spending £123,000 on unnecessary building work. And they celebrated the fact that she couldn't give evidence against them after discovering that she had died on Christmas Eve in 2012. In a recording, William Brown said: 'She’s gone, Jim, it’s good news init.' James Brown Snr replied: 'It is, isn’t it.' The men then discussed that it was 'cancer that killed her' before they agreed that it was the reason why the police hadn't contacted them again. Mrs Gibbs was one of a suspected 140 victims who were conned by the gang, who targetted victims in north Essex.","Harvey White, 49, laundered money through pawn shop in Clacton, Essex .

"President Barack Obama is expected to rein in spying on foreign leaders and is considering restricting National Security Agency access to Americans' phone records, according to people familiar with a White House review of the government's surveillance programs. Obama could unveil his highly anticipated decisions as early as next week. On Thursday, the president is expected to discuss his review with congressional lawmakers, while his top lawyer plans to meet with privacy groups. Representatives from tech companies are meeting with White House staff on Friday. The White House says Obama is still collecting information before making final decisions. Scroll down for video . Feeling the heat: Obama could announce his decision to restrict NSA spying program as early as next week . Among the changes Obama is expected to announce is more oversight of the National Intelligence Priorities Framework, a classified document that ranks U.S. intelligence-gathering priorities and is used to make decisions on scrutiny of foreign leaders. A presidential review board has recommended increasing the number of policy officials who help establish those priorities, and that could result in limits on surveillance of allies. Documents released by former National Security Agency systems analyst Edward Snowden revealed that the U.S. was monitoring the communications of several friendly foreign leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The revelations outraged Merkel as well as other leaders, and U.S. officials say the disclosures have damaged Obama's relations around the world. Obama and Merkel spoke by phone Wednesday, but U.S. officials would not say whether they discussed the NSA issues. Leaked: The controversial NSA spying program was leaked to the media by former defense contractor Edward Snowden . The president also is said to be considering one of the review board's most aggressive recommendations, a proposal to strip the NSA of its ability to store telephone records from millions of Americans and instead have phone companies or a third party hold the records. The NSA would be able to access the records only by obtaining separate court approval for each search, though exceptions could be made in the case of a national security emergency. It's unclear whether Obama will ultimately back the proposal or how quickly it could be carried out if he does. Before making his final decisions, the president was supposed to receive a separate report from a semi-independent commission known as the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, which was created by Congress. However, that panel's report has been delayed without explanation until at least late January, meaning it won't reach the president until after he makes his decisions public. Members of that oversight board met with Obama on Wednesday and have briefed other administration officials on some of their preliminary findings. In a statement, the five-member panel said its meeting with the president focused on the NSA phone collection program and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which oversees the data sweeps. Betrayed: It was revealed that the NSA spied on German Chancellor Angela Merkell . It's unclear why Obama will announce his recommendations before receiving the report from the privacy and civil liberties board. One official familiar with the review process said some White House officials were puzzled by the board's delay. The report would still be available to Congress, where legislators are grappling with several bills aimed at dismantling or preserving the NSA's authority. That official and those familiar with the White House review insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the process by name. Obama also met Wednesday with members of the U.S. intelligence community, which largely supports keeping the NSA surveillance programs intact. Shortly after receiving the review board recommendations last month, Obama signaled that he could be open to significant surveillance changes, including to the bulk collecting of phone records. 'There are ways we can do it, potentially, that gives people greater assurance that there are checks and balances - that there's sufficient oversight and sufficient transparency,' Obama said at a Dec. 20 news conference. He added that programs like the bulk collection 'could be redesigned in ways that give you the same information when you need it without creating these potentials for abuse.' Violation: A judge ruled last month that the NSA's bulk collection program appeared to violate Fourth Amendment . The president also has backed the idea of adding a public advocate position to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which rules on many of the domestic surveillance decisions. The court typically hears only from the government as it decides cases, and the advocate would represent privacy and civil liberties concerns. That review followed disclosures from Snowden, who leaked details of several secret government programs. He faces espionage charges in the U.S., but has been granted temporary asylum in Russia. While Obama has said he welcomes the review, it's unlikely it would have occurred without Snowden's disclosures. Last month, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled that the NSA's bulk collection program appeared to violate Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches, but he didn't issue a preliminary injunction against unreasonable searches because of expected appeals. Late Wednesday, Justice Department lawyers asked Leon to halt further proceedings in his court on the NSA case and a second NSA-related lawsuit until the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit hears the government's appeal of his December ruling. Government lawyers said they were asking for the judicial stay from Leon because they were concerned that further court proceedings could jeopardize classified information about the surveillance program. Larry Klayman, the conservative lawyer who filed the suit, has said he plans to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case.","Obama is expected to limit the NSA's access to private citizens' phone records .
Under his plan, the NSA could access phone records but only with a court order .

"After some of the worst weeks of his leadership, he may have hoped that taking on a former pop singer in a TV debate would provide a welcome boost. But Ed Miliband was left humiliated last night after he was unceremoniously taken to task by Myleene Klass over Labour’s proposed mansion tax. The party leader looked lost and bewildered as the former Hear'Say singer tore strips out of his pledge to impose a tax on homes worth more than £2million. Today Mr Miliband tried to laugh the row off, writing on Twitter that the NHS needs a mansion tax 'Pure and Simple' - a reference to Hear'Say's biggest hit song. Scroll down for video . Ed Miliband was left humiliated last night after he was unceremoniously taken to task by Myleene Klass over Labour’s proposed mansion tax . In a reference to the Hear'Say song, Mr Miliband said the NHS needs a mansion tax 'Pure and Simple' TV viewers provided a running commentary on Twitter, describing how the singer was ‘doing a Paxman’ and ‘wiping the floor’ with the man who hopes to be the next prime minister. Appearing on ITV’s The Agenda, Miss Klass told him: ‘For me, it’s so disturbing – the name in its own right: “mansion tax”. 'Immediately you conjure up an image of these Barbie-esque houses, but in London, which is where 80 per cent of the people who will be paying this tax actually live, have you seen what that amount of money can get you? It’s like a garage. ‘When you do look at the people who will be suffering this tax, it’s true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long, long time. 'The people who are the super-super rich buying their houses for £140million, this is not necessarily going to affect them because they’ve got their tax rebates and amazing accountants. It’s going to be the little grannies who have lived in those houses for years and years.’ Mr Miliband responded: ‘I totally understand that people don’t like paying more in tax. The values of my government are going to be different to the values of this government.’ TV viewers provided a running commentary on Twitter, describing how the singer was ‘doing a Paxman’ and ‘wiping the floor’ with the man who hopes to be the next prime minister . Appearing on ITV’s The Agenda, Miss Klass told him: ‘You may as well just tax me on this glass of water. You can’t just point at things and tax them.' But former British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer joined in the debate and angrily told Mr Miliband: ‘You’re going to screw me royally.’ Host Tom Bradby tried to calm things down, saying: ‘Ed’s getting a bit isolated here.’ But Miss Klass, 36, interrupted: ‘Ed’s getting isolated because no one thinks it is going to work.’ Getting more frustrated, she added: ‘You may as well just tax me on this glass of water. You can’t just point at things and tax them. ‘You need to have a better strategy and say why is the NHS in this mess in the first place?’ The confrontation immediately started trending on Twitter. Host Tom Bradby tried to calm things down, saying: ‘Ed’s getting a bit isolated here.’But Miss Klass, 36, interrupted: ‘Ed’s getting isolated because no one thinks it is going to work’ Miss Klass sold her former marital home last year for £1.8 million – just below the proposed mansion tax threshold – after the breakdown of her marriage . Myleene and Ed enjoyed a quick drink with the other panel members and presenter Tom Bradby last night . Scott Reid tweeted: ‘You know it’s gone truly surreal when Myleene Klass goes full Paxman on Miliband.’ Edward Mayes wrote: ‘Ed Miliband is currently being schooled by Myleene Klass on his mansion tax policy. That political heavyweight.’ Caron Lindsay added: ‘Myleene Klass is wiping the floor with Ed Miliband on The Agenda – he could be making case so much better.’ Another user wrote: ‘Ed Miliband says he’ll take on terrorists, two minutes later he loses an argument to Myleene Klass.’ Miss Klass sold her former marital home last year for £1.8 million – just below the proposed mansion tax threshold – after the breakdown of her marriage. She currently lives with her daughters in a rented home in Highgate, north London, that is worth around £3 million. If she chooses to buy a house in future it is likely to fall into any mansion tax bracket that would be introduced by Labour. Miss Klass sold her former marital home last year for £1.8 million – just below the proposed mansion tax threshold – after the breakdown of her marriage - but she never got the £2.5m she wanted for the property . The DJ and model now lives on this leafy street in north London in a rented house believed to be worth £3m . Miss Klass was a member of the pop band Hear'Say, which was formed by the ITV show Popstars in 2001 . Ed Miliband admitted he has problems with photo opportunities, and suggested Kim Kardashian could help him improve his image. The Labour leader has insisted that the photo opportunity is ‘not where my talents lie' after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich. He has also been mocked for posing wearing a feminist t-shirt and awkwardly giving money to a beggar in Manchester. Appearing on ITV's Agenda last night, Mr Miliband held up a spoof newspaper front page, with the headline: 'Em plays the Kim Kard.' It was a reference to Kim Kardashian's expertise at the photo opportunity, and the extraordinary pictures released last week in which she posed naked on the front of Paper magazine, under the headline 'Break the internet'. The images sparked countless spoofs online. Explaining his front page, Mr Miliband said: 'You'll know she ‘broke’ the internet this week with a risque photo opportunity. 'Now all politicians have problems with photo opportunities, me more than most, so I have decided to hire Kim to help me with the photo opportunities.' Mr Miliband was widely mocked after being pictured struggling to eat a bacon sandwich in May this year. He suggested he could learn from Kim Kardashian, who appeared on the front cover of Paper magazine last week under the headline: 'Break the internet' Myleene says you can only buy a garage for £2million – in fact it's a sprawling mansion with an indoor swimming pool and a sweeping drive . Myleene Klass joked last night that in some parts of London buying a property sitting above the proposed £2million Mansion Tax limit would probably only stretch to a garage. But in fact it can stretch to a mansion  and outside the capital something even grander. However, the singer is right about garages, because last month one went up for sale for an eye-watering £550,000. Overall it is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in London and the South East – will be caught by the tax. This is what £2million can buy you: . Ed Miliband's own home near Hampstead Heath, was bought in his then girlfriend, now wife Justine Thornton's name in 2009 for £1.6million, but is now thought to be worth around £2million. In Islington a four-bedroom terraced property was on sale for £2,000,000. A similar house on the same street sold for £430,000 in 1999, and is now estimated to be worth £2,036,764.  Conservative MP Greg Hands said: 'Elderly people would find it impossible to pay amounts of up to £30,000 per annum to live in their family home which in many cases they have been in for 30 years or more.' A four-bedroom semi-detached riverside home in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was being sold with a guide price of £2,000,000, in an area where average prices have risen 19.34per cent in the last five years. There are also fears that, if the tax is introduced, the threshold could later be reduced as an easy way of boosting Government revenue. Just outside Glasgow, a four-bedroom former farm house is on sale with a guide price of £2,100,000. The property, which was completely rebuilt in 1999, boasts five acres of formal gardens and an open plan design. Other homes in the surrounding area have seen their value rise by an average of 2.88per cent in the last year. In Oxford, semi-detached town houses in desirable parts of the city, where homes sold for around £400,000 in the mid-90s, are on sale for more than £2million. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has branded the mansion tax plan as an attack on ordinary taxpayers whose family home has soared in value. This six-bedroom detached house in Formby, Merseyside is on sale for £2million, and boasts a heated swimming pool and a snooker room. Average prices on the street currently stand at £910,795 - an increase of 5.27per cent from five years ago. A neighbouring ten-bedroom property sold for £2million in 2005, and is now thought to be worth £2,152,966. A guide price of £2,095,000 would buy this four-bedroom farmhouse near Ilkley, West Yorkshire, which comes complete with its own swimming pool and spa. Homes in the area sell for an average of £962,016, an increase of 12 per cent from 2009. Critics have also expressed fears that introducing such a tax would require every home to be accurately valued, which would lead to potentially lengthy appeals should homeowners disagree with the valuation - all of which would come at a cost. Offers of around £2million are being taken for a four-bedroom farmhouse near Tregony in South Cornwall, an area where prices have gone up 7.56per cent since 2009. It could also put off wealthy foreign buyers from moving to the UK, and older people who purchased their homes before their value sky-rocketed and who now have a low-income could be forced to sell up and move as they would be unable to pay a new tax. A three-bedroom detached house in Heddon-On-The-Wall, outside Newcastle Upon Tyne is on sale for £2.2m. There are also fears a mansion tax could put people off making modifications to their homes that might push up the value, having a negative knock on effect on the construction industry. And for £550,000....

At a time when Ms Kirchner admits she felt she had nothing to live for, her unborn child, who she has named 'Pacey', saved her life. 'Right now this baby… My dream and Royce's dream is my reason for living,' said Ms Kirchner. Kristy and Royce Kirchner were deeply in love after ten years together. They desperately wanted a child . During her eulogy for her beloved husband, Ms Kirchner revealed that she had just learnt that they were having a baby. 'At the funeral I debated whether I was going to announce it in Royce's eulogy,' she told A Current Affair.

"Yo. If that wasn’t a satisfactory opening to this article, then you might not be too impressed with the latest app taking internet by storm. Appropriately named ‘Yo’, it lets you send exactly that word to friends and, despite launching on April Fool’s Day, is apparently not a joke. In just over two months it has gained £590,000 ($1 million) in funding and now has a growing userbase of about 50,000. An app called Yo (logo pictured) is currently taking the internet by storm. Since launching in April it has amassed 50,000 users and has apparently been given $1 million in funding. The app is available to download for free on both iOS and Android and lets users send the word yo to others - and nothing else . According to the Financial Times the app took just eight hours to build but is quickly proving a hit with its ‘single-tap zero character communication tool.’ The 'Yo' app can be downloaded from the iTunes store or Google Play for free. When the app is loaded up users are asked to pick a username. Friends can then be invited to the app by text, Facebook or Twitter. When a friend's username is added, tapping on it will send them a yo. They will then receive a notification saying they have received a yo - and that's it. An additional feature involves adding the user 'WORLDCUP', which will then send you a yo every time a goal is scored in the 2014 Brazil World Cup. But you won't know who scored without checking up elsewhere. Other functionality is promised for the app in the future. The company boasts that it takes 11 taps to send the word ‘yo’ on a rival messaging service like WhatsApp compared to just two on their app. However, critics suggest the app is a sign we’re well and truly in an internet bubble like the one at the turn of the century, and it could be set to crash in a similarly disastrous manner. Yo is available now on both iOS and Android for free. There is no ability to sync with Facebook, no email address needed and no search functionality. The app simply lets you pick a username for yourself, and then enter the usernames of friends. By tapping on a name it will then send that person a ‘yo’. They will receive a notification that it has arrived - and nothing more. Some of the tongue-in-cheek reviews on the iTunes store were quick to eschew the apparent qualities of the app. ‘Since downloading Yo, all my relationships have improved and I've regrown most of my hair,’ said one reviewer. ‘Receiving a yo is fast becoming the highlight of my day,’ added another on the Google Play store. ‘So much mystery! Why is this person yo-ing me? Should I respond?’ When the app is first installed you will be asked to pick a username. You can then add the names of friends to send them a yo (left). When a yo is sent the recipient will receive a notification that they have received it (right), and nothing else. The company says it is a ‘single-tap zero character communication tool' The app’s founder, Mr Arbel, said the simplicity of the app was the reason it had already grown its userbase to 50,000. ‘It’s zero characters - you can’t get any simpler than that,’ he said to the Financial Times. ‘We have decided this is an idea with great potential.’ And the app is still evolving - users can add the username WORLDCUP, for example, to get sent a yo whenever a football team scores at the 2014 World Cup. The identity of the player and team, time of the goal and the score will remain a mystery, though, unless the user checks up elsewhere. But the app is seen by some as a sign that the latest tech bubble is set to burst. Infamously in 2000 many technology stocks lost nearly 80 per cent of their value and Silicon Valley lost 200,000 jobs, according to Think Progress, when the last tech bubble collapsed. However, that hasn’t deterred investors from getting behind Yo. The initial $1 million was supplied by investors associated with Moshe Hogeg, a CEO involved in a social network called Mobli. Whether the app continues to wide its wave of success remains to be seen.","San Francisco company's app Yo is available free on iOS and Android .

"Just days after the Prime Minister met with world leaders at the G20 summit in Brisbane, the latest polls reveal Tony Abbott has dropped in popularity. Federal Labor has recorded its best Newspoll result in nine months, with the opposition opening up a 10-point lead over the coalition after preferences. According to the Newspoll, conducted for News Corp last weekend, Tony Abbott suffered a fall in satisfaction with opposition leader Bill Shorten again the nation's preferred prime minister. This follows Mr Abbott's embarrassing gaffe on Monday night where he confused China with Tasmania while toasting Chinese President Xi Jinping at a special dinner at parliament house. Scroll down for video . It's hard to confuse Tasmania and China, but Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) has managed just that - in the presence of the Chinese President Xi Jinping (left) China's President Xi Jinping (left) and Mr Abbott (right) shake hands after the signing of several memorandums of understanding to strengthen trade in Canberra on Monday . Mr Abbott confused the Australian island state with the Asian nation while toasting President Xi during a special dinner at parliament house on Monday night . Australia hosted this year's G20 summit last week with leaders from across the world attending the conference in Brisbane . Mr Abbott was summing up the day's developments after the two nations reached agreement on a free trade deal and a speech by Mr Xi to parliament, when he appeared to confuse the island state with the Asian nation. 'To mark President Xi's visit, Australia and Tasmania and, and - we've said a lot about Tasmania - Australia and China have reached agreements,' Mr Abbott said. 'It's hard to confuse Tasmania and China - but I have,' Mr Abbott said, jokingly shrugging off the error. Newspoll results showed the Abbott government's primary vote dropped to a four-month low of 36 per cent, while Labor's primary support was at 39 per cent. Support for the Greens dropped two points to 11 per cent, while minor parties, independents and others were collectively up one point to 14 per cent. In two-party-preferred terms, based on preference flows from last year's election, Labor leads 55 per cent to 45 per cent. 'It's hard to confuse Tasmania and China - but I have,' Mr Abbott said, jokingly shrugging off the error . On Tuesday morning it was revealed that opposition leader Bill Shorten (pictured) has taken a 10-point lead over the coalition . Last week, Mr Abbott met with world leaders at the G20 summit which was held in Brisbane. Following its conclusion, President Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan were welcomed at Government House in Canberra to sign a ground breaking trade deal which will eventually see 95 per cent of Australian exports enter China tariff-free. On Monday night, Mr Abbott took the opportunity to praise the Chinese president's 'remarkable' speech in parliament during the day. Never had he heard a Chinese leader declare that his country would be fully democratic by 2050. 'When I listened to the president today, some of the shadows over our region and over our world lifted and the sun did indeed shine brightly,' Mr Abbott said, citing an Australian proverb. 'I thank you, Mr President, for this historic, historic statement which I hope will echo right around the world.' Mr Xi returned the love, saying he's felt right at home on his latest visit. China stood as one of Australia's best friends in the region - but the key to maintaining that was with 'political trust'. 'We need to put one's self into the other's shoes and look at each other's intention from the other side's standpoint of view,' Mr Xi said. President Xi is due to visit Hobart on Tuesday, after which he will have been to every Australian state and territory.","Prime Minister Tony Abbott met with world leaders at the G20 summit in Brisbane last week .

"London’s Eccleston Square Hotel is billed as one of the most high-tech hotels in the world - with large 3D TVs, touch pad controls, a luxurious massage bed and a slick app that puts everything at guests' fingertips. That title is warranted as the cutting-edge boutique hotel in Belgravia offers the perfect blend of modern comfort, privacy and gadgetry that novice tech users will be able to master in no time. For a small, family-owned operation, it competes with larger hotels with similar features thanks to its warm hospitality, keen attention to detail and convenient in-room technology that is designed to provide a seamless stay. Eccleston Square Hotel in London's Belgravia neighbourhood offers the perfect blend of comfort, privacy and in-room technology . Each room boasts large 3D TVs, touch pad controls, a luxurious massage bed and an iPad with a slick app that manages guests' stay . Touch pads in every room control the lighting, floor-to-ceiling curtains, temperature and a do not disturb signal in the hallway . In terms of technology this was the smartest boutique hotel I have ever slept in, and that is going to pose a big problem going forward. Future stays in not-so-technologically advanced hotels are ruined thanks to my one-night stay at Eccleston Square Hotel. Almost everything is controlled by touch pads - the floor-to-ceiling curtains, room temperature and lighting included. Even the ‘Do Not Disturb’ signal can be activated with the press of a button on a panel next to the bed. The button activates a signal in the hallway outside the room, so there’s no need to get up and hang a sign on the door handle. Eccleston Square Hotel competes with larger hotels thanks to its warm hospitality, keen attention to detail and convenient in-room technology . Signature king guestrooms offer a private outdoor patio, a large desk area, a large bathroom or a balcony overlooking Eccleston Square . Of all the things controlled by touch pads, my favourite feature was one that offers privacy when nature calls or it’s time for a scrub. With the press of a button, the bathroom’s see-through glass wall and door instantly frost over. A second tap of the button makes the glass transparent again. It was a fun feature to play with and one that I would love to have at home. My signature king room had a generous walk-in shower that boasts three shower heads, including a high-pressure double rainfall shower head that provided an incredible relaxing soak. Signature king guestrooms at Eccleston Square Hotel include a relaxing rainfall shower and two additional high-pressure massage heads . Each room is supplied with an iPad that is pre-loaded with the hotel's app, which allows guests to order room service or request housekeeping . The marble bathroom is outfitted with heated floors and a steam-proof mirror that has a built-in TV screen synced to the 46in 3D TV. One of the biggest selling features - especially for those looking for a great night’s sleep - is the Rolls Royce of beds: a luxury, hand-made Hastens massage bed that retails for more than £12,000 and is fitted with comfortable Rivolta Carmignani fine bed linen. A remote control at the bedside switches on its massage feature - head, feet or both in unison - and adjusts the intensity of the vibration while allowing the bed to be raised or lowered to the perfect position for sleeping or watching TV. While the massage mode is pleasant I found the noise to be a bit too loud and distracting. The marquee feature in each room is a £12,000 Hastens bed - the Rolls-Royce of beds - fitted with comfortable Rivolta Carmignani fine  linen . A touch pad provides privacy in the bathroom; with the press of a button the see-through glass wall becomes opaque . When guests aren’t playing with the remote they can pick up an iPad (there’s one in every room) and swipe through the hotel’s concierge app, which manages almost every detail of their stay. Before I arrived I downloaded the app to my smartphone to get a better sense of the amenities and services offered at Eccleston Square Hotel. While it's one thing to play around with the app beforehand, one doesn't fully appreciate it until they walk through the hotel’s front door (which is equipped with sensors and swings open automatically, of course). Eccleston Square Hotel’s front door is equipped with sensors and swings open automatically when guests arrive and depart . Almost everything in the room is controlled by touch pads, including the floor-to-ceiling curtains, temperature and lighting . Guests can use Eccleston Square Hotel's official app or call the reception desk to have a 3D Blue-ray film delivered by staff . On my first night I used the app to request a wake-up call and to have a 3D Blu-ray film delivered to my room. An employee from the front desk arrived within minutes with the film in hand, plus two pairs of 3D glasses. The following morning I used the app to browse the breakfast menu – still in my pyjamas – and have a full English delivered to my room - without having to pick up the phone and call the reception desk. With the app guests can select the exact time that they want their order to arrive - a feature that is incredibly handy for those who want a hot meal or boozy drink delivered to their room when they return from a long day of shopping, touring or sitting in business meetings. For meetings or private functions Eccleston Square Hotel offers a media lounge with a 103in LED TV and enough space for up to 14 people . Eccleston Square Hotel's restaurant, Bistrot on the Square, offers afternoon tea with a selection of delicious finger sandwiches . Open daily, the restaurant features theatrical black crystal chandeliers and an open fireplace and large comfortable chairs . Guests can also use the digital concierge to make reservations at Eccleston Square Hotel’s restaurant - Bistrot on the Square - submit housekeeping requests, organise health and beauty appointments, or arrange for a complimentary pot of tea to be delivered to them. It may seem lazy but it's right up my alley. I would rather tap a few buttons on an iPad or mobile phone than call down to the front desk when ordering room service or requesting a wake-up call. Of the very few negatives about my stay, it took some time to master the 3D TV’s smart remote and my room was located next to the lift. I regularly heard its chimes as it stopped on the first floor. Eccleston Square Hotel was ahead of the curve with its integration of technology and comfort (a lot of hotels are still playing catch-up) and it has earned high praise and a handful of awards. Bistrot on the Square serves refined bistro-style dishes with distinctive international flavours in a relaxed and intimate environment . Guests can use the digital concierge app to make reservations at Bistrot on the Square or request room service 24 hours a day . The restaurant serves a variety of cocktails, while guests can choose from an a la carte menu, weekend brunch menu or breakfast menu . With the app guests can select the exact time that they want their order - be it breakfast or a boozy drink - to arrive at their room . While it is perfect for tech lovers, it is also ideal for a romantic night in. For those who don’t want to leave the building, there’s a fair-priced mini bar stocked with spirits and wine, or staff can deliver bottles directly to the room when an order is placed via the app or telephone. My room was tidy, clean and tastefully decorated with darker accents and wooden cabinets, but I was far more interested in the technology than the decor. When I’m away from home I try to unplug and put my mobile phone down for more than five minutes, but the technology is what makes this hotel special and brings a new level of convenience to holidays or business trips.

"The 18-year-old New York University freshman who fell 15-stories to his death on Monday from the top of his dormitory was running around stark naked and high on mushrooms according to witnesses and police sources. Aspiring rapper, Titan Lee-Hai, was acting erratically only moments before his fatal fall and punched one witness in the face after he entered the same elevator which took the Trinadad student to the roof. Shazim Khurshid, 19, told the New York Post that it looked like Lee-Hai was on 'a lot of drugs' prior to his fall at 3.20 am from NYU’s Third North dorm at 3rd Ave and 12th St. Another student, who wished to remain anonymous told the New York Daily News that Lee-Hai had taken mushrooms and was reacting badly to their effects. 'He wasn’t a troubled kid,' the young woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said to the Daily News. 'It was a bad trip. He was alone, just chillin’. He was on mushrooms.' 'He was a good kid.' Tragic: NYU freshman,Titan Lee-Hai is now believed to have taken hallucinogenic drugs before his fatal fall on Monday morning . Fall or jump? 19-year-old New York University freshman Titan Lee-Hai jumped off the Third North Residence Hall early Monday morning and a witness said it seemed like he was on 'a lot of drugs' 'I was the last person to see him alive,' Kurshid said. 'I was in the elevator, and he just walked in and punched me in the face, and then he asked me where he was. He was naked when he walked in. So, it was pretty obvious he was not in his senses. He had no sense of where he was or what time it was.' When he reached the top floor of the building, Lee-Hai opened a door which triggered the building's fire alarm. After falling, he was taken to Bellevue hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police originally believed the death was a suicide, but now believe drugs were to blame and don't know if Lee-Hai jumped or fell. Toxicology reports won't be available for several weeks. Loss: Lee-Hai was from Port-of-Spain, Trinidad. The university issued a statement late Monday morning expressing 'deepest sympathies' for his family and friends . In his system: Toxicology reports won't be available for several weeks. Shazim Khurshid, right, says Lee-Hai punched him out of the blue before boarding the elevator going up to the top floor . University spokesman John Beckman issued a statement late Monday morning, saying: 'It is with great sorrow that we report that a freshman was found in an interior courtyard in the residence hall where he lived.' Mr Beckman said that the student's death seemed to be the result of a fall, but that police and University officials are investigating what led up to the event to determine the exact cause. 'The University expresses its deepest sympathies to the family and loved ones of this young man; they are in our hearts and our prayers this morning,' Mr Beckman said. A fellow freshman who lives in the dorm said the fire alarm went off around the same time the man jumped. 'We were evacuated from the building at around 3:15. My friends said they saw a body lying in the courtyard. It's sad,' she told the Post. Today marked the first day of the Spring . 2014 semester. Crisis counselors were brought in to provide support to . grieving students this morning. Barred: The university installed special gold bars to prevent students from jumping off the upper floor's of the school's library after a string of suicides in the 2003-2004 academic year . The top 50 college has received a . reputation for its high suicide rate after a string of four deaths in . the 2003-2004 academic year. This prompted the school to install special gold bars on the atrium of Bobst Library where many of the suicides occurred. Students . have argued that while the bars stop suicides from happening in the . library, the university isn't doing a good enough job at addressing the . root of the issue. In an opinion piece published in the student newspaper . a week after the library bars installation, Emma Dolhai argued that the . screen wouldn't stop determined students from finding a way to commit . suicide. 'All the screens really do is ensure that some of [the suicides] are quieter. Screens simply do not prevent self-destruction, in the same way that building prisons does not lower crime rates,' Ms Dolhai wrote. She pointed out that the wait in the university's Wellness Center to see a counselor can be 15 minutes to half an hour and involves a mountain of paperwork. 'The lack of effective health care for the struggling verges on the absurd. NYU Wellness seems to operate on the mantra that a student must make a conscious, devoted effort in order to receive help. Those struggling with suicide, however, are often the last to come forward of their own free will,' she said. According to the Suicide Prevention Resource Center, suicide is the third leading cause of death among young adults ages 18-24. No studies currently track suicide rates at the nation's colleges, but many campus professionals believe it to be the second leading cause of death among students. For support on suicide matters call the National Suicide Prevention Help Line on 1-800-273-8255 or go to www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org.

"Crooked bankers could be made to hand back some of their pay under plans floated by Britain’s bank chief Mark Carney. The Governor of the Bank of England said bonuses should not be the only thing regulators are able to ‘claw back’ if corrupt behaviour is uncovered. Mr Carney said ‘standards may need to be developed to put non-bonus of fixed pay at risk’ as well. Bank of England governor Mark Carney suggested regulators should be able to claw back bankers' pay and not just their bonuses . Mr Carney said fundamental change was needed to overhaul bankers’ behaviour in the wake of fresh financial scandals hitting the City. It comes days after six banks were fined £2.6 billion after global regulators found traders had clubbed together to rig foreign exchange markets. That came in the wake of the Libor-rate rigging scandal which had already cost firms billions in penalties. Mr Carney said: ‘The repeated nature of these fines demonstrates that financial penalties alone are not sufficient to address the issues raised. ‘Fundamental change is needed to institutional culture, to compensation arrangements and to markets. ‘The succession of scandals mean it is simply untenable now to argue that the problem is one of a few bad apples. The issue is with the barrels in which they are stored.’ Mr Carney's warning came after David Cameron warned that the 'red warning lights' were 'flashing on the dashboard of the global economy' In a speech in Singapore, Mr Carney said in some cases the link between those at the top of the bank who should have set out the ‘cultural norms’ among employees had been broken. The public had been ‘rightly angered’ that leaders who had been responsible for ‘sowing the seeds of the crisis’ and allowing wrongdoing to develop had been able to walk away. New measures to hold individual executives and board members to account as well as claw back bonuses after up to seven years are being introduced in the UK but Mr Carney said additional reforms may be necessary. ‘Senior manager accountability and new compensation structures will help to rebuild trust in financial institutions,’ Mr Carney added. It comes after David Cameron warned  that the global economy risked another crash. He said in an article that 'red warning lights' were 'flashing on the dashboard of the global economy' and the eurozone was 'teetering on the brink' of another recession. Mr Cameron's warning follows claims by International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde has also expressed fears that a diet of high debt, low growth and unemployment may yet become 'the new normal in Europe'. In an article in the Guardian, Mr Cameron said global instability such as the continued eurozone problems and the ebola outbreak threatened Britain's recovery. He wrote: 'In six months' time, Britain will face a choice: the long-term plan that has seen it prosper, or the easy answers that would surely have seen it fail. 'By sticking to our long-term plan at home and standing up for Britain's interests abroad, we will do everything possible to protect our economy and give hardworking families a secure future in a Britain they are proud to call home.'","Mark Carney said it was not enough to only be able to 'claw back' bonuses .

"It is billed as 'an apartment in the sky' and features an 84 inch double bed with Egyptian cotton sheets, full turn down service, seats made from the same leather as a Ferrari and an in-flight chef. But the icing on the cake for passengers willing to dish out £12,500 for the privilege to fly in The Residence, Etihad's brand new uber luxe three-room cabin, must surely be the personal butler to cater for their every whim - from full valeting a la Downton Abbey to pre-booking them a restaurant or hotel for their arrival. Hand-picked from a selection of the nation's best service industry professionals, the airline has employed 13 butlers, each of whom under went a specially tailored training course in at the University of West London, and The Savoy Hotel, under the watchful eye of its head butler, Sean Davoren. One of two newly trained female butlers, Georgina Henderson, 28, from Southport, spoke to MailOnline Travel about what it entails to be one of the world's first flying butlers... Rigorous training: Georgina Henderson recieving a certificate from The Savoy's Head Butler Sean Davoren . 'I do love Downton Abbey, but nowadays I would describe butlers as being lifestyle managers. You are there to think for the guests, you're like a PA. You’re doing a bit of everything,' Georgina says. The job starts from the moment a customer books their ticket. 'The guests will be contacted and we will build a profile on them – dining requests, beverage requests,  the reason for their travel. It might be a special occasion, it might be a once-in-a-lifetime trip for them, or it could be a business trip. 'We need to be able to read the guests. Some might want the full dining experience, some will want to maximise their rest time, so we need to understand.' Gulf carrier Etihad has employed 13 butlers, each of whom under went a specially tailored training course . The butlers learned everything from sewing and flower arranging to how to perfectly pack a suitcase . The Residence guests will receive tailor-made treatment. As as well as free reign over the first class menu, they will be able to build on it, with a spot of caviar  and afternoon tea, for instance. If they fancy a cocktail and canape reception, then that is what they'll have. Georgina describes the training as strict and thorough. At the university, lecturer Patricia Paskins, known for training service professionals who have gone on to work at Buckingham Palace taught the fledgeling butlers all of her trade secrets. 'She went through the valeting process with us: from sewing and flower arranging to how to polish shoes - everything a butler needs to know.' 'We even learnt how to pack a suitcase properly. That sounds like an easy task, but when a butler does it, it involves a lot of tissue paper. It ends up looking like a present when you open the case. Georgina with Sean Davoren. 'He’s been doing it a long time and his eye for detail is unbelievable,' she says . And at the Savoy hotel, Georgina and her colleagues met Head Butler Sean Davoren. 'He is very strict, but he gets the best out of people. He’s been doing it a very long time and his eye for detail is unbelievable. 'For example, in a guests bedroom, they take pictures of things so they know where people have left them. So when guests come back in, it looks like their items have never been moved.' The devil is certainly in the detail for Etihad's butlers. Georgina says: 'Something we picked up in London was knowing whether someone is left or right handed, so we always know where to put their drink down. Guests will have a tailor-made food experience including caviar, afternoon tea, cocktails and canapes . En-suite shower room: Customers in The Residence are referred to as 'guests' rather than passengers . 'We kept a diary of our time in London and everything down to our posture, the way we dressed and the service language we were using improved.' 'We learned the correct way to speak to guests, such as using ""may I?"" rather than ""can I?"" 'The favourite word is ""splendid"". While ""ok"" is not to be used. 'We should never use the word ""no"" - there is always something you can do, even at 40,000 feet, you can always think of something.' 'We have no ""passengers"", they are ""guests"". It’s about hospitality, bringing that hotel feel onto the aircraft. The airline's £12,500 VIP suite has already sold out for its first ten flights, which will begin next month . Style and image at Etihad is very important. The butlers have a strict code when it comes to their appearance . 'Style and image at Etihad are very important. We learned how to groom ourselves to a very high standard. 'We have three shades of eye shadow, wear red lipstick, and have a French manicure. Men need to be very clean shaven and have polished shoes and perfect uniform. You have to look absolutely immaculate. 'Every day we had an inspection, the trainers were very strict with us, checking our appearance and the way stood. Plush: The Residence features an 84 double inch bed with Egyptian cotton sheets and full turn down service . 'The vital thing is the 'magic box’ -  we all have one. We all have different things in our magic boxes, our little tricks to avoid having to say no to our guests. 'On an aircraft, you can’t just run down to Tesco, and pick something up, you need to have things available to you. I have everything down to fake eyelashes in mine. 'As a crew we ask how far can we wow people on flights and create memorable moments. 'We can provide their favourite flowers and even the soft furnishings can be personalised.' Is there anything a butler wouldn't do? 'Obviously we draw the line at anything that breeches security or that is illegal – we can’t say yes to everything and you are on an aircraft as well, safety is paramount,' Georgina says. 'But as far the service side of things goes, I do everything I can to make sure guests have a very special experience.'","Thirteen butlers were hand-picked to serve the airline's most affluent fliers .

"'Kir Royale?' calls out a man in pink shorts. He looks as if he could be one of those languidly dapper overly confident types with whom Dave Cameron spent so much time at Oxford. I don’t mind if I do - but, sadly, his generous offer is limited to his chums seated around a long outdoor table, where they all glow in the flattering evening light. Old-fashioned English appeal: The Gunton Arms charms with its leather armchairs and open fires . It is the most beautiful of sunsets, and I can think of few better places to enjoy it than at the Gunton Arms, a former lodge on the edge of the 1,000-acre Gunton Park deer park. Bucolic Norfolk at its best, with a few dollops of irreverence thrown in, courtesy, mainly, of some saucy Tracey Emin artwork in the bar. Simple yet sophisticated: Rooms boast lovely touches such as stand-alone bathtubs . This is a class act combining the skills and interests of art dealer Ivor Braka (the owner), designer Robert Kime (interior design), Kit Martin (architecture) and Stuart Tattersall (food). There are eight rooms. Ours is small but pretty, tasteful and elegant. No TV and nothing as rudimentary as 'tea and coffee making facilities.' Even the bed valance is made of woven fabric. Everything looks expensive, but in a understated sort of way. The main bar is all fun and games: pool table, telly on the wall, real ales, black and white photos of Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix. This is in marked contrast to a couple of residents-only parlours, where the vibe is studious, restrained. Country pursuits: Deer roam in the grounds of the Gunton Arms - which sits prettily in a leafy Norfolk setting . The Duchess of Cornwall could wander into the Gunton Arms and no one would be fazed. Come to think of it, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s new Norfolk pad is not too far away - but this is more of a Harry-and-Cressida (will she ever come back? Let’s hope so) place than a Wills-and-Kate. We sit at a long sharing table for dinner, next to a window looking out to the park - where a teepee stands in the distance. On the nibbles list is pork crackling, and it’s the best you will ever find. The fire in the main dining room is blazing in the morning, even though the temperature outside is in the 20s. There’s something not quite right about the coffee; my soft boiled eggs are hard and I’m not sure about make-your-own toast. But the Gunton Arms is still a bohemian rhapsody that sets the standard for all other inns with rooms.

"When you are in a helicopter, it only takes a heartbeat for your mood to change from awe to dread. Lifting off from the southern tip of St Lucia had been electrifying, with the Atlantic rollers crashing in on the coast to the right, and the azure Caribbean caressing the shore to the left. The knotted green expanse of the rainforest came up fast ahead, and we were on the hunt for the Jacquot parrot, our eyes raking the trees for a flash of green that would identify a bird found nowhere else on earth. A place among the palms: St Lucia offers splendid beaches, including the sands of Rodney Bay . Suddenly, clouds rolled over us as the highest peak loomed ever larger. First there were breaks in the gloom, and then... nothing. We could see perhaps 20ft in any direction. Where on earth was that mountain? But just as panic was creeping over us, the cloud broke and there was the rainforest below. Minutes later we were touching down at a seaside airport on the west coast, buoyed by a sheer rush of adrenaline. We'd saved an hour in a minibus, and experienced a ride that would make Alton Towers weep with jealousy. Ten minutes later, we were swinging through the gates of Windjammer Landing, a 60-acre estate with about 160 apartments and villas that cascade up and down vertiginous hillsides dotted with calabash and almond trees, with views across an unbroken expanse of ocean to the western horizon. A picture of Caribbean perfection: Soufriere sits on the island's west coast, in sight of the famous Pitons . We could feel ourselves starting to slough off the cares of the world the minute we arrived. But then how many hotels come with their own resident humming birds? Elusive: Jeremy failed to spot the St Lucia Parrot . On a verdant wall next to the reception, we watched rapt as these miniature miracles darted from flower to flower, the exquisite greens and blues of their feathers a blur of motion. When I told our ten-year-old son that we could go on a speedboat ride and then snorkel, he took a deep breath and said: 'OK, let's do it.' Which is how we found ourselves skimming across Labrelotte Bay with the impossibly laid-back Romanus at the tiller. When we arrived at the dive site, after a few words of guidance - 'Don't tread on the fire coral cos it's really gonna sting' - we plunged into what felt like a warm bath, and discovered a world of wonders. On the seabed, we spotted a moray eel, its bulbous head poking out of the sand, floating lazily with the current for all the world like a piece of seaweed, but with death lurking in its shadow. In the deeper water of next-door Rodney Bay, down to a depth of 20ft or so, we found the conch shell graveyard, an eerie wasteland of hundreds of giant shells, tossed overboard by the fishermen who bring in their catch from deeper waters. If morning dives were boys' time, afternoons were all about the lunatic that passes for my seven-year-old daughter going just a little crazy at the watersports beach. You can waterski or potter about on a pedalo. But we just wanted a ride on the Big Momma, a huge inflatable that seats eight and rockets along behind a speed boat, bobbing and crashing like a deranged cork across the wake. After that, it was usually time for a bowl of all-inclusive ice cream and a cocktail (non-alcoholic for her, restorative for me) at the Jammers beachside restaurant, the most relaxed of the five eateries in the resort, where you'll find a thumping reggae beat and a ready smile any day of the week. It's about £120 a day for all-inclusive (and £70 each for the children), which covers breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks and soft drinks. This isn't a cheap holiday by any means, but sitting at Jammers watching the sun set over the Caribbean Sea with a 14 x 61 cocktail at your elbow (named after St Lucia's latitude and longitude) is almost beyond price. Making a splash: The Windjammer resort offer an exciting range of water sports . We could have spent the week on the beach, playing giant chess and beach cricket. But that elusive Jaquot parrot was nagging at us, so one morning we took a drive up to the rainforest that spreads thickly across the centre of the island. Stretching up far into the trees is a network of cable cars that carried us through the huge tree ferns and vast buttress root systems of the Oceanic forest. I nearly gave into temptation and let out a Tarzan roar, but had to satisfy myself with watching the chicken hawks swooping above, the bright orange Flambeau butterflies darting among the trees and keeping a narrowed eye out for the slither of a boa constrictor below. But still no sign of that pesky parrot. St Lucia's motto is 'the land, the people, the light', and this is the place where the Nobel-prize-winning poet Derek Walcott has spent a lifetime capturing its unique beauty. You can have a slice of it, too. Just don't expect to see any of those parrots. Seven nights room-only at Windjammer Landing with Caribtours (020 7751 0660, www.caribtours.co.uk) costs from £1,109 per person, based on two adults and two children sharing a two-bedroom ocean-view room. The price includes return flights, private transfers and lounge passes at Gatwick.","Visitors to the fabled island can fly on to their resorts by helicopter .

"It was a clear, sunny day when Ben Schwartz attempted a death-defying BASE jump off the edge of the 486-ft tall I.B. Perrine Bridge in Idaho. And although his face may not have betrayed his nerves the sound of his thumping heartbeat recorded by the camera attached to his chest was undeniable. After psyching himself, he launches into a backward somersault off of the ledge, barrelling towards Snake River below. BASE jumper Ben Schwartz performed a backflip off of I.B. Perrine Bridge in Twin Falls, Idaho . The chest-mounted GoPro camera used to record the jump also picked up Schwartz's pounding heartbeat . 'I gotta do this before I think about it too much,' he says before counting down and plummeting towards the earth at the 25-second mark of the YouTube video. As his parachute deploys just seconds later, Mr Schwartz lets out a celebratory cheer as he sails to safety. 'My first attempt at a gainer while BASE jumping,' he wrote on YouTube. 'I was a bit nervous standing on the edge and the chest-mounted GoPro caught my heartbeat increase right before I jumped.' Before leaping off the 486-ft bridge, Mr Schwartz psyched himself up and counted down from three . Only seconds after backflipping, he deployed his parachute and sailed safely toward the ground . The I.B. Perrine Bridge is a popular BASE jumping site, where jumps are allowed year-round without a permit . A gainer is a reverse somersault in BASE jumping terms. The entire clip was shot on the new GoPro HD Hero at the I.B. Perrine Bridge in Twin Falls, Idaho. The bridge, which is a popular BASE jumping site, measures approximately 1,500ft long and 486ft high. It is believed to be the only man-made structure in the United States where BASE jumping is allowed year-round without a permit.","Ben Schwartz recorded his backflip off of the I.B.

"A hunter who received negative comments on Facebook after sharing photos of her next to a massive bear she killed has spoken out against her critics. The two photos that Eva Shockey shared on Friday and Saturday were from a North Carolina hunting trip taken alongside her television presenter father father Jim Shockey. They both appear on 'Jim Shockey's Uncharted.' One of Shockey's photo captions says the  bear she killed weighed 510.2lbs. Her photographs have since received thousands of comments and sparked a heated debate between pro-hunting and anti-hunting supporters. On Saturday, Shockey posted a selfie showing her with her dog and wrote 'An anti-hunter just told me, and I quote, to ""kill that little worthless dog you have instead"" of the bear I just hunted in NC. 'Apparently hunting a bear, eating/donating all of the meat and putting money towards conservation is a bad thing, but killing my puppy is ok. If this logic isn't totally insane, I don't know what is.' Scroll down for video . Hunter: Eva Shockey received criticism online after she posted images of a bear she killed . Controversy: The photos of Shockey with the dead bear have received thousands of comments and sparked a heated debate between pro-hunting and anti-hunting supporters . The online criticism aimed at Shockey, as well as her response over the user's alleged comment, were first reported by The Blaze. Among the thousands of comments posted online, one user wrote 'Such a beautiful animal shot dead for nothing but your pleasure , real nice, a real accomplishment you should be proud.' Another said 'Bear killer! That bear has more beauty alive than dead! So sad, and y would u even want to pose in a pic like this?!' Other commenters have congratulated Shockey for getting the bear and offered words of support. Multiple Facebook users have uploaded photos of animals they've killed while hunting. 'Stay strong girl there just trying to get u riled up .congrats beautiful bear,' one supporter wrote. A different user said 'Congrats on your hunt...sorry for all the negative words from others...just stay the course.' In a Monday interview with 'Fox and Friends' Shockey was asked about the 'sick' comments she received --  and responded 'It is sick, I agree with you. But unfortunately we actually have to deal with that quite a lot, so this comment particularly - I've never heard someone tell me to kill my puppy before, but comments like this - they definitely happen to us.' On the program, Shockey also spoke about her father's advice to her for handling online commenters, saying 'if they say something hurtful like my dad should shoot me in the head - I mean, that happens, that's what they say - and I'm like ""Oh my goodness"" but he says ""Stay above it, stay true to yourself and just show what you believe,"" and I believe with every part of me that what I'm doing is right, so there's nothing that I'm apologizing for. 'So in that sense, I mean I'm not going to apologize to them, but I will say that I'd love to explain to them, I'd love to show them everyday what I do, that hunting is a good thing.' Beloved pooch: Shockey says an online commenter suggested her dog be killed instead of the bear . Famous family: Eva Shockey went on the hunting trip with her father and television presenter Jim Shockey, pictured. They both appear on the program 'Jim Shockey's Uncharted' Shockey also said during the 'Fox and Friends' interview 'I think the biggest thing as far as being a proud hunter is that what we're doing is a good thing and I mean we're raising, huge, huge, huge amounts of money for conservation every year, something the anti-hunters - they're fighting hunters. But when they're fighting hunters, technically they're just fighting us raising money for wildlife habitat and that's not really doing anything for them. I mean, it's backfiring. 'So, if they understood how much money we're putting into hunting, how in North Carolina specifically the hunt I was just on, the bear population and the human population, they're both rising really fast and obviously we're not going to get rid of the humans so at that point you have no choice, it's human nature, you need to make room for the humans to live there so you have to keep the bear population in check. 'And if the hunters don't do it, then the bears are going to be increasing. There's highway collisions, there's huge, huge dollars in crop degradation every year, and if we don't do something the farmers are going to do it and it won't be as nice as the hunters and we won't be bringing in the money to this economy.'","Eva Shockey received negative comments on Facebook after sharing photos of her next to a massive bear she killed .

"How do you keep track of your cat’s health and well-being even when not at home? This £65 ($100) smart cat scale claims to be the answer, providing alerts on what your pet has been up to and monitoring their health, weight and waste. And the device will also be used to see if it’s true that cats can detect oncoming earthquakes. Scroll down for video . A San Diego-based company has designed a smart litter box for cats (pictured). Called Tailio the internet-enabled scale is placed under a regular box. It then sends information on a cat's habits to a smartphone app. It can monitor the health and weight of a cat and provides alerts . Called Tailio, the device was developed by company Pet Wireless in San Diego, California and has already reached its funding goal on Kickstarter. It is placed under a regular cat litter box and, when a cat climbs in to do their business, it tracks the weight of the cat and its time in the box. And it’s sensitive enough to measure the change in weight of the cat and box when the animal climbs in and out. The belief that animals can predict earthquakes and other natural disasters – and even the weather - has been around for centuries. In 373 BC, historians recorded that animals, including rats, snakes and weasels, deserted the Greek city of Helice in droves just days before a quake devastated the place. Accounts of similar animal anticipation of earthquakes have surfaced across the centuries since, such as catfish moving violently, chickens that stop laying eggs and bees leaving their hive in a panic. Precisely what animals sense is a mystery, but one theory is that wild and domestic creatures feel the Earth vibrate before humans. Other ideas suggest they detect electrical changes in the air or gas released from the Earth. In March 2012, fishermen in Japan reported a sharp increase in oarfish sightings following the massive magnitude-8.8 earthquake in Chile that same month, which marked almost exactly one year before the country was devastated by its own magnitude-8.9 quake in northeast Japan. The device syncs with a smartphone app on iOS and Android so that, when out and about, owners can see what their cat has been up to. It can also monitor multiple cats and provide information on how often each one is visiting the litter box. If it notices irregularities in a cat’s behaviour it can share information with a vet to diagnose and treat the cat. ‘Tailio will alert you if they haven't shown up to the litter box in their usual routine, so you can see what may be needed,’ the company writes. Tailio will also show trends over time to see if any pre-set weight loss goals are being met. Perhaps most interestingly, though, the company will use Tailio to see if cats have a ‘sixth sense’ when it comes to the natural world. ‘For instance, since ancient times many people have believed cats can somehow sense impending earthquakes hours or even days in advance,’ they write. Tailio has been awarded a grant by the National Science Foundation to in particular monitor the behaviour of cats along southern California fault lines. The team will look for clues to see if there is a correlation between changes in animal behaviour and seismic activity. The company is taking pre-orders for Tailio now, and expects to begin shipping in April 2015. The belief that animals can predict earthquakes and other natural disasters - and even the weather - has been around for centuries, and Tailio will also be used to see if cats can predict earthquakes. The team has a grant from the National Science Foundation to see if the pets have an ability to sense natural disasters . The device is Wi-Fi enabled so that all of its data can be synced. It is also easy to clean and has a splash resistant surface, while the non-slip mat ensures the litter box will not slide of the scale when the cat climbs in to do its business .","San Diego-based company has designed a smart litter box for cats .

"The Prime Minister’s own music collection is – apparently – packed with trendy new bands and obscure artists. But it seems his supporters have slightly more mainstream tastes. Those who admire David Cameron are likely to be fans of Cliff Richard, Dolly Parton and Kylie Minogue, according to a survey. The new YouGov survey reveals the personal tastes of different political supporters (pictured) Supporters of Ed Miliband, on the other hand, probably listen to John Lennon or Leonard Cohen – while those who favour Nick Clegg are keen on Norah Jones, and Nigel Farage’s followers like Kate Bush. Mr Cameron himself revealed earlier this year that he is a fan of little-known Swedish folk duo First Aid Kit and had been to one of their gigs. He has previously said he owns an album by British folk rock band Mumford and Sons, and on Desert Island Discs he picked tracks by Pink Floyd, REM and The Killers. The new research, by pollster YouGov, found voters who back the Prime Minister count actor Tom Cruise and Top Gear stars Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond among their favourite celebrities. The survey found fans of the Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) are likely to shop in Waitrose, drive a Mercedes and eat Malay Prawn Satay . The survey found fans of the Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured left) like the music of Kylie Minogue (left) Dolly Parton (centre) and Phil Collins (right) Admirers of Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg are likely to be fans of Evan Davis, the new host of Newsnight. And perhaps unsurprisingly, celebrities favoured by Mr Farage’s supporters include Mike Read, the former Radio 1 DJ who recently wrote and sang a controversial song in praise of Ukip, as well as Carry On star Sid James. When it comes to food, the preferred dishes of Mr Miliband’s supporters are vegetarian ones, with mushroom stroganoff at the top of the list. Those who like Mr Cameron favour a more exotic Malay prawn satay, as well as Beluga caviar and lobster. The survey – based on information from 200,000 respondents to YouGov’s online polls – found fans of pro-EU Mr Clegg enjoy watching the Eurovision Song Contest, as well as the BBC Ten O’Clock News and the Andrew Marr Show. People who like Labour leader Ed Miliband shop in Co-Op, drive a Citroen and eat mushroom strogonoff . Musically, fans of the Labour leader like John Lennon, Pete Seeger and Leonard Cohen (pictured left to right) Supporters of Ukip leader Mr Farage are more likely to shop at discount supermarket Lidl, drive a Land Rover and enjoy DIY as a hobby. Their favourite TV shows are Dad’s Army, Doc Martin and Top Gear. The programmes preferred by Mr Cameron’s supporters include, perhaps more predictably, Prime Minister’s Questions, along with Downton Abbey and Top Gear. Mr Cameron’s fans are also more likely to shop at Waitrose and drive a Mercedes-Benz – and to name driving as one of their favourite activities. Mr Miliband’s supporters own Citroen cars and watch game show Only Connect, while listing writing as their top hobby. Mr Clegg’s fans like to drive an Alfa Romeo, dine on Vichyssoise soup – a chilled leek and potato creation – and take an interest in computer programming. People who like Nick Clegg are likely to drive an Alfa Romeo, shop in Waitrose and enjoy Vichyssoise soup . Clegg enthusiasts named Hot Gossip, Norah Jones and Wings among their favourite musicians . The poll also found that fans of Margaret Thatcher probably shop at Tesco and enjoy game pie, while admirers of Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, who comes from Scotland, love roast venison, venison pie and venison casserole. Mr Davis yesterday seemed taken aback by his popularity among supporters of Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg, writing on Twitter: ‘Oh wow, I’m not sure what to make of that.’ But he should perhaps take heart from the fact that those who liked Mr Miliband also described themselves as being ethical, principled and compassionate, while Mr Clegg’s fans said they were analytical, clever and well-educated. Meanwhile, those who supported Mr Cameron and Mr Farage said they were leaders, dogmatic and firm-minded.

"Tragic: Joni Brace, 33, fell to his death after having a cigarette out his bedroom window . A smoker was killed when he fell out of his bedroom window while having a late-night cigarette, an inquest has heard. Young software engineer Jonathan Brace, 33, died after he fell 20ft to his death, hitting his head on the patio below. Brace was forbidden from smoking within the Newport home he shared with his mother, and would instead lean out of his bedroom window to avoid fumes circulating the house. As part of a money-saving drive he had stopped going out, preferring to drink and smoke at home in his room while playing Xbox games. The young professional had been hoping to save up enough money for a trip to Australia to see his brother. Heartbroken Mrs Brace, 61, who tragically discovered her son the next morning, said: 'I shouted up to Joni in the morning but I got no response. I walked into his room and I could see he wasn't [there] but that the window was open. 'My worst fears were realised.' Mrs Brace also told the inquest that she repeatedly warned her son to stop smoking while sitting on his window ledge.

"British ISIS jihadist Nasser Muthana should face execution, his father said . The British medical student suspected of involvement in an Islamic State death squad should face execution himself, his father said yesterday. Nasser Muthana, 20, deserved to die because it would be a ‘head for a head’. The 20-year-old from Cardiff is thought to be part of an Islamic State ‘foreign legion’ of at least 16 jihadis who were filmed beheading Syrian soldiers in the desert. As David Cameron last night claimed the ‘sick terrorists’ of IS must face the ‘justice they deserve’ including charges of treason, Muthana’s father Ahmed said he would disown his son if he is involved. The former electrical engineer, 57, told the Mail: ‘What they are doing is inhuman, this is not the son I brought up. ‘I cannot have him back. No father wants to disown their children but I have no choice.’ Speaking from his home in Wales, Mr Muthana said: ‘I am like any other father. I am trying not to believe it is my boy, but it looks like him. ‘If that’s what he has done to someone then that is what should be done to him. A head for a head. I am not going to make excuses for him. He is a grown man and he must face up to what he has done.’ Nasser Muthana, who appeared in a recruitment video for IS in June, has also been joined in Syria by his younger brother Aseel, 17. Scroll down for video . Mr Muthana said he called police after recognising Nasser in the video and South Wales police confirmed they were looking into the footage. The clip also shows the decapitated head of Peter Kassig, a 26-year-old American aid worker, who is the fifth Western hostage to be murdered by fanatics. In the Commons, the Prime Minister vowed that Britain would not be intimidated by IS. He told MPs: ‘We will not be cowed by these sick terrorists. They will be defeated and they must face the justice they deserve. ‘The threat is faced by countries right across the world. We must face it together.’ Terror: The sickening video showed the graphic beheading of at least 16 Syrian soldiers by ISIS jihadists . Nasser Muthana, a medical student from Cardiff, appeared in an online recruitment video for ISIS in June . Agreeing with Tory MP Philip Hollobone that British jihadis should face treason charges, he said that radicalised Britons made him ‘sick to the stomach’. He added: ‘It is not only the full force of the law that these people should face; they should also recognise that when they take up arms in this way in another country, they become enemies of the state.’ Analysts examining the sickening video believe the jihadis – led by the Briton known as Jihadi John – are from at least six countries. French intelligence officers identified one as Maxime Hauchard, 22, from Normandy and are trying to determine if a second fighter is French. A German was also identified – but neither were officially named. France’s interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said one of the killers was ‘almost certainly’ Hauchard – now known as Abou Abdallah Al Faransi. Friends said he was a quiet youth with a spiritual side who liked ‘partying with friends and drinking’. The video, released online on Sunday, shows how the jihadis are seeking to heighten the disgust they provoke. Jihadi John, dressed in black, is flanked by at least 15 other IS fighters dressed in desert fatigues and one brutal scene ends with an image of the captives’ heads on top of their bent-over bodies. Last night there were also unverified claims that Mr Kassig had been killed in a US-led air strike in Syria nearly two weeks ago. However, analysts said if the claims were true then IS militants would have used it as a propaganda victory. British journalist John Cantlie has featured in several propaganda videos but is yet to be named as the next to be killed.","British ISIS jihadist Nasser Muthana should face death, his father said .

"I may have looked like a petrified pterodactyl, but inside I felt like a fledgling sea eagle finding her wings. I was taking a turn at simulated skydiving on the new cruise ship Quantum of the Seas - and it wasn't just the most exhilarating thing by far that I have ever done on a ship, it was the most extraordinary experience of my life. I've often wished I could fly like a bird - but I wouldn't dream of jumping out of a plane, so I never expected to feel the sensation of soaring and swooping through the air in a vertical wind tunnel with no strings attached. Taking flight: Caroline does her best 'petrified pterodactyl' impersonation on the Quantum of the Seas . And the thrills kept on coming. Inside North Star, a glass pod on a long arm, I was raised upwards and outwards over the side of the ship, 300ft above the waves. Swaying in the wind, the pod rotated to show me people moving like ants around the blue postage stamp of the swimming pool on the deck far below. Next was a spin in the bumper cars, racing around the ship's huge SeaPlex indoor arena until I was giddy. None of these exciting activities has been offered on a cruise ship before and I was among the first to have a go on a pre-inaugural mini-cruise aboard Quantum, which has just started her winter season of Caribbean cruises. Good news for British holidaymakers is that identical sister ship Anthem of the Seas, with all the same wow factors, will be based in Southampton from next spring. Shades of the future: Quantum of the Seas is being marketed as the world's first 'smartship' Quantum of the Seas makes the most of new technology. A few taps on a tablet computer and my order for a cocktail was being mixed by one of two robots with bionic arms. They couldn't be trusted with real glasses, though, nor were they able to pop in a paper parasol, so my ungarnished drink slid towards me in a plastic cup. I saw a mesmerising show in the Two70 lounge, which has floor-to-ceiling panoramic windows by day that turn into a curved screen 100ft wide and 20ft high, creating an eye-popping backdrop for singers and acrobats. Even the musical in the main theatre was highly sophisticated by cruise-ship standards: a live orchestra in the pit accompanied the cast in a full-length version of West End hit Mamma Mia! Another 'screentastic' treat is in store for occupants of inside cabins. They get virtual balconies that have a vast screen showing the real-time view from the side of the ship. Among the score of restaurants is the first at sea for Jamie Oliver. No need to leave a tip with this barman: Robotic arms are on hand to dole out cocktails of your choice . Jamie's Italian offers the home-away-from-home comfort of the same menu as his chain on dry land. Another celebrity chef, American Devin Alexander, author of The Biggest Loser Cookbook, has created the Devinely Decadent restaurant, serving 'healthy yet indulgent' dishes that are far less calorific than they appear. Speed, efficiency and the end of queuing for the 4,900 passengers are promised thanks to online check-in, an app for everything, waiters taking orders on tablets, smart wristbands that do away with signing for all those extras, and the ship's own satellite providing internet connection that's as fast as broadband at home.

Other entries included a recreation of Leonardo Di Vinci's iconic The Last Supper painting with U.S. President Barack Obama as Jesus and German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Chinese President Xi Jinping as his disciples with a plaque which read: 'Check please?'

DesignCrowd community manager Jo Sabin said they had received submissions from all over the world - including Australia, France, the U.S., India and Guatemala. She said the site was looking for unusual creators who could have a bit of fun with a serious subject matter. 'You have some sort of idea with the reporting of media outlets, but we thought it would be fun to generate what happens behind the scenes at the G20,' Ms Sabin told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's an inherently comical scenario where world leaders - who are mainly men - come to town and talk about how they can retain and increase their wealth.

"A white van man is getting his hands dirty to create stunning works of art on the side of his unwashed van. Rick Minns, also known as Ruddy Muddy, has created pictures including winter landscapes, children playing in the snow and a ship on high seas by scraping away the dirt on the side of his van. The 39-year-old, who works for Norfolk-based floral wholesaler Flowervision, has dubbed his work 'grafilthy' and enjoys entertaining onlookers as he goes about his daily work making deliveries to florists. Creative: Rick Minns has created his 'grafilthy' artworks on the side of grubby florist vans . Detailed: As his work progressed, the dad-of-three started using cotton buds and tissues to help create different effects and shadows in the grimy Transit vans which are used for his work at a Norfolk-based florist . Fun: The 39-year-old said he started creating the masterpieces as 'just a bit of fun' He said: 'It just started as a bit of fun while I was at work. 'Work might prefer it if I washed my van more regularly but this is better than me driving around in a boring old dirty van.' Mr Minns, who has an A-level in art and attends adult art classes, started drawing on the vans using his fingertips. As his skills developed, he began using cotton buds and tissues to create more intricate effects. Merry Muddy Xmas: Rick, 39, said: 'Two of the guys I work with keep their vans clean but I draw on the others' Social media: Mr Minns posts pictures of his works of art on Facebook and Twitter and he has a loyal following . Landscape: The trees in this piece have been created in the muck . Each piece takes about 10 minutes and every few days he wipes the van down to create a fresh canvas for his creativity. 'It’s always a shame to wipe away a picture I’m proud of,” he added. 'Then again it’s nice to start afresh - it’s just frustrating waiting for the van to get dirty enough. 'Luckily I spend a lot of time on country roads, so it doesn’t take long.' The father-of-three from a village in South Norfolk posts pictures of his works of art on Facebook and Twitter where he is gradually developing a loyal following. 'I first did it two years ago and somebody stopped and remarked on it,' he said. 'My first picture was a mountain scene, a lot like the ones I do now but not as sophisticated. We have six vans at work. Two of the guys keep theirs nice and clean but I draw on the others. 'The reaction I get is great - it’s just nice to see the smile on people’s faces when they notice.' Mr Minns added he would like to find a way of raising money for charity through his hobby. He can be found on Twitter under the username @Ruddy-Muddy or as Ruddy Muddy on Facebook.

"Big Brother 2013 contestant Ben Zabel, 32, is recovering after being admitted to Royal Brisbane Hospital after an overdose on prescription drugs. The reality star on Friday uploaded an image of his hospital admittance wristband,  confirming the incident with the message, 'Thank you to all the staff at Royal Brisbane' alongside the hashtags 'depression' 'anxiety' and overdose'. In a statement released on Monday, Ben's representative Jeremy Hansen, said, 'On Saturday evening (15th November) Ben Zabel suffered a prescription drug overdose. He was treated by paramedics on the scene in his apartment and was later transported to the Royal Brisbane Hospital for further treatment. Ben was released from hospital yesterday afternoon and is now home recovering. We ask for privacy for Ben, his family and his friends at this time.' Scroll down for video . Emergency: Big Brother 2013 contestant Ben Zabel is recovering after being admitted to Royal Brisbane Hospital after overdosing on prescription drugs . Ben seemed to be in good spirits in his Instagram post on Sunday, adding the quote, 'As Mark Twain once said —''Reports of my dearth have been greatly exaggerated (sic)"". He was also the recipient of support from his friends and family, including Big Brother winner Tim Dormer, Ben’s close friend and fellow Big Brother housemate, told Daily Mail Australia that he hasn't spoken to Ben yet but offers him his support during this difficult time. ‘I’m really shocked and saddened,’ the 30-year-old told DMA. ‘I know Ben has been suffering with depression and anxiety for a long time and I’ve shared that journey with him for the last year since Big Brother.’ Best mates: Tim Dormer and Ben became close in Big Brother 2013 and Tim has publicly supported Ben . 'Sending love and light': Tim sends support to his mate . Support network: Ben's family ask for their privacy during this time - Zabel pictured with his mother Margaret . ‘It’s really sad when people who are suffering with depression feel that there’s no one else out there because there’s a lot of people,’ he continued. ‘I’ve known Ben has a lot of people that care about him,’ he said of his good friend, revealing he communicated with Ben just hours before he was admitted to hospital. He said he spoke with Ben on Friday and he 'seemed fine.' Hoping to speak to Ben again when it is possible, Tim said simply checking in with his mate and reassuring him is his biggest intention. When asked what he will tell Ben, the 2013 Big Brother winner said he’d ask Ben ‘How is he going’ before telling him ‘I’m always here for him when he needs me’. After hearing the news of his overdose, he posted an image of the pair together on his Instagram feed. 'Thinking of my mate and hoping to hear from him soon,' Tim wrote. 'Sending love and light'. Healing: The reality star on Sunday uploaded an image of his hospital admittance wristband, with the message 'Thank you to all the staff at Royal Brisbane' 'Greatly exaggerated': Ben took to Twitter to make a brief statement . Big Brother host, Sonia Kruger has been in contact with Ben and sent him her love, telling DMA: 'Ben is part of the Big Brother family and always will be. We have been in contact with Ben and he is recovering at home and has requested his privacy. We are here to support Ben on his road to recovery.' Fellow Big Brother housemate Tahan Lew who spent time with Ben in the Big Brother house told Daily Mail Australia: 'I have reached out to Ben but like I said to him I know I can't say or do anything to help him.' 'I wish I could but this is something he needs to be strong about and fix on his own with the help of professionals but I did let him know I am there for him if he needs or needs me to do anything,' she said. 'I just hope he can get the help he needs.' Last month, the lovable TV personality spoke to Daily Mail Australia about his struggles with depression and coming to terms with his sexuality and mental illness. 'I don’t know whether I’m happy with my life,' he admitted at the time. 'But it’s fuller and I don’t feel so alone. That’s the great thing about owning something, it allows other people to come forward.' He said going on Big Brother helped him to vocalise his depression, which made him feel like isolated. Recovering: Ben and Tim formed a close friendship on the Australian version of Big Brother in 2013 . Telling messages: Ben has been open about his struggle with depression, even posted though provoking pictures to his social media accounts . 'I struggled in the Big Brother house - Australia saw that. 'It did help though, because acceptance and love is not something I've been showered with in life, and that’s no reflection on my family... who was gay, anxious and a vegetarian in the 90s? 'I grew up just thinking that I was a criminal because you could go to jail for being gay until I was in year 12.' The former housemate has spoken about his battles with mental illness extensively in the past year, revealing that his diagnosis lead to discrimination in the workplace: 'I used to just make a joke and fob the question away, as I was too embarrassed to admit, anxiety and depression got the better of me in the workplace.' Love and support: Tim posted an Instagram message to Ben saying 'Thinking of my mate' after the news broke . Loved: The reality star and comedian built a huge fan base since leaving Big Brother . He was referring to a Facebook post in which he said Virgin Australia had dismissed him from his post because of his condition. He said: 'The main reason I broke my silence (some of you already knew) on how I left Virgin, was that many lovely folks stop me in the street and kindly ask me if I'll ever consider returning to flying, sometime in the future. 'I used to just make a joke and fob the question away, as I was too embarrassed to admit, anxiety and depression got the better of me in my workplace.

"Britain is the most vulnerable country in Europe to terrorist attacks, a new report has warned. The UK suffered 131 terror incidents last year, with three people killed including Lee Rigby, the soldier butchered in cold blood by cleaver-wielding Muslim fanatics outside his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London. The Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP) ranked Britain 27 out of 162 countries on its annual Global Terrorism Index. There were 131 terror incidents last year, including the murder of Lee Rigby by Muslim fanatics outside his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London . The UK is pushed up the list because of a number of terror attacks from dissident Republican organisations, including IRA splinter groups, in Northern Ireland. Some countries associated with disorder and random violence, such as Indonesia, where the 2002 Bali bombings took place, and Sri Lanka, which has fought a violent insurgency against Tamil Tigers militants, are lower down the list. The think-tank also said there were up to 370 British jihadists fighting with Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria – the second highest total after France which has up to 410 extremists in the warzone. Globally, the number of terror attacks hit a record high with 9,184 strikes last year – up 44 per cent. These incidents cost 17,958 lives – up 61 per cent from just over 11,100 in 2012. Terrorism is dominated by four organisations – Islamic State, Boko Haram in Nigeria, Al Qaeda and the Taliban, who are collectively responsible for 66 per cent of all deaths. Over 80 per cent of the deaths from terrorist atrocities were recorded in just five countries: Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. Russia was 11th on the list and Turkey – which borders Syria – 17th. France is 56th and Germany 83rd. There are up to 370 British jihadists fighting for ISIS, according to the Institute for Economics and Peace . More than 6,300 terror victims – one-third of all those killed – were in Iraq, which has been blighted by a wave of bloody sectarian attacks and the rise of Islamic State, responsible for beheadings, crucifixions and massacres. Steve Killelea, executive chairman of the IEP, said there had been a ‘significant and worrying increase’ in instances of terrorism. But he said a person was 40 times more likely to be murdered than killed in a terror attack, and in the UK an individual was 188 times more likely to be murdered than die in an extremist atrocity.","Britain is the most vulnerable country in Europe to terrorist attacks .

"If England are to have any chance in this World Cup they must play without fear or inhibitions. Their mindset will be crucial in reaching the scores of 300 that will be paramount against the best sides. A score of 250 simply will not be enough in this tournament. In Test cricket we now give players proper chances and back them, but we just don’t do that in the one-day game. That means chopping and changing, which can lead to an uncertainty that reminds me of when I first became England captain. Players think they might be out after one or two bad games and that can affect their performances. Eoin Morgan will captain England at the ICC World Cup to be jointly hosted in Australia and New Zealand . Alastair Cook lost his one-day captaincy for England on the eve of the Cricket World Cup . For instance, if England had changed their captain and gone with a virtually new top four just a month before the Ashes they would have been castigated. So why is it allowed to happen a month before the World Cup? They have just about got the right squad now but it should have been in place a year ago. MORGAN IS KEY . The impetus for that right mindset must start at the top. Eoin Morgan has to have a good World Cup if England are to cause an upset. He is their gun player. We know captaincy has lifted his game but that can only last so long and could change if things start going pear-shaped for the team and the captain’s mind becomes cluttered. Eoin Morgan has been lifted by the captaincy and his form will be key to England's chances at the World Cup . Morgan of the Thunder bats during the Big Bash League match in Sydney ahead of the tournament . Age              Caps . Eoin Morgan (capt)       28              130 . Moeen Ali                      27               12 . James Anderson           32               84 . Gary Ballance               25               12 . Ian Bell                          32              150 . Ravi Bopara                  29              114 . Stuart Broad                  28              108 . Jos Buttler                     24               44 . Steven Finn                   25               47 . Alex Hales                     26                7 . Chris Jordan                 26                19 . Joe Root                       24                43 . James Taylor                25                6 . James Tredwell            32                44 . Chris Woakes               25               24 . If Morgan can stay uncluttered and start scoring expansive runs again it could have an enormous impact on the team. I like his captaincy style. He can think outside the box, won’t be afraid of doing his own thing and reminds me a little of Brendon McCullum in his leadership. Morgan must get the full support of the coaching staff in setting a positive example and getting the game plan clear in everyone’s minds. KEEPING THE FAITH . You get massive ups and downs with young players and England have shown a reluctance to back them and give them a proper chance to sink or swim. We all know that Alex Hales showed a few limitations last summer. Duncan Fletcher told me that India soon worked out how to bowl to him because he stayed legside of the ball and tried to play through the off. But Hales hasn’t had a long enough opportunity to work his way through that, so we are going to the World Cup with question marks against him and seemingly extra batsmen picked to cover for him in Ian Bell and Gary Ballance. That makes for a squad with one batsman too many and one all-rounder short, in my opinion. Question marks over Alex Hales' batting has led to the selection of an unbalanced squad . Hales loses his wicket while playing for the Hurricanes in Australia's Big Bash League . England should have concentrated on what Hales can do rather than what he can’t, given him a run and seen if he can replicate his Twenty20 form over 50 overs. As it is, we are still not sure going into the premier one-day tournament. Then we have Ben Stokes, who smashed 77 off 37 balls for Melbourne Renegades against Hobart in the Big Bash on Wednesday. It makes me laugh to hear everybody immediately screaming that he should be in the World Cup squad. Just look at his scores and bowling figures over the past year for England and you can see why the selectors left him out. But why has his form been so bad? And has it got anything to do with how he has been handled by England? What has happened to him when he has pulled on the England shirt? When he made that fantastic Test century in Perth he had nothing to lose and was playing with no fear. That’s the mindset England have to restore in Stokes and instil in the players who are going to Australia. Omitted Ben Stokes hit 77 off 37 balls for Melbourne Renegades in the Big Bash League on Wednesday . Calls for Stokes to be in England squad are unwarranted given his dismal record for his country . For instance, we all know what’s going to happen when Mitchell Johnson comes running in at Moeen Ali in Melbourne on February 14. He will have seen the footage of how Moeen plays the short ball and his big back-lift. There will be bouncers followed by yorkers and Moeen has to deal with that. But he has to be given licence to go for it and full support for the rest of the tournament if it doesn’t come off in that first match. England should sit the young players down, tell them they believe in them and, crucially, consistently play them in their best positions. Paul Collingwood made a valid point on Twitter when he said that if you play Stokes at eight he will bat like a No 8. If he was the right choice at three he should have stayed there long enough to prove it. James Taylor showed he can score runs at three in Sri Lanka but then was immediately pushed down the order. It doesn’t lead to any sort of continuity or security in the side. Moeen Ali can expect to face bouncers and yorkers when he comes up against Australia's Mitchell Johnson . BOWLING'S A WORRY . So there are concerns about the batting but it could be a case of better late than never with what is shaping up to be a decent line-up. I have more worries about the bowling. To have any chance of winning this World Cup, England must take wickets in the middle overs and we didn’t see much evidence of them being able to do that in Sri Lanka. Yes, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson are back, but they are not necessarily the answer to all England’s problems. Broad can take time to get back up to full speed after injury, while Anderson will need the white ball to swing if he is going to be a big force in this tournament. James Tredwell has done well for England, better than people often give him credit for, but Australia and others will get after him as the Aussies did in the one-day series last year. England will need as many bowling options as possible and the fact that they only have right-arm seam bowlers and off-spinners will limit Morgan’s decision-making in the middle. Stuart Broad (right) and James Andrew (left) return but are not necessarily the answer to England's bowling . Death bowling will be a concern at the World Cup and Sri Lanka's Lasith Malinga is the world's best . Death bowling is the other big concern with the recent change in fielding restrictions. England simply have to get it right and they may be looking at Chris Woakes and Chris Jordan to do that. We hear old bowlers saying all the time that modern players don’t bowl enough yorkers but that is only part of the issue. There is less margin for error these days as batsmen stay back in their crease and have the ability to clear the ropes with their big bats and innovative techniques if bowlers get it fractionally wrong. So yes, the yorker plays a part but it is about variety. Lasith Malinga, perhaps the best death bowler in the world today, bowls all sorts of deliveries at the end of an innings. Crucially, it is about executing all of them perfectly. HIT THE GROUND RUNNING . The tri-series against Australia and India will go a long way towards deciding how far England can go in the World Cup. They will be playing the two favourites for the tournament and my hope is that England decide on their best line-up at the start and stick with it, as they do not have many chances now for the players to get used to their specific roles. Steve Smith  presents his pink cap to Glenn McGrath during the Fourth Test against India - England's performances against these two nations in the tri-series will gauge their chances . Cricket legend Shane Warne wears a pink outfit for Jane McGrath Day in Sydney . A flag  is unveiled at the Sydney Ground to commemorate the death of Jane Magrath from cancer . England really should reach the World Cup quarter-finals and, from there, there is enough talent for them to get on a roll and win three matches in a row. But they haven’t won three games in a row against top opposition for a long time. Will England win the World Cup? Probably not. Can they win the World Cup? Of course, but they will need a serious change in mindset. I think the public will accept a gallant failure just as long as it is not stodgy old England. If they look to be dynamic, look to give it a real go, then we can’t have any complaints. It is just that it could have been so different with proper, clear thinking and planning. And with one-day cricket being treated the same as the Test game.","England are in disarray and need to take a positive approach at World Cup .

"One of Disney’s most annoying songs has to be ‘It’s a small world,’ but the addictive ditty might just have a point. From the Lion King in the Serengeti to the Aristocrats in Paris, one artist has created a map of the world revealing the location of all of Disney’s animated films.

These are the five locations that could not be mapped. Dinosaur – set on the Pangaea when the map of the Earth looked very different . Treasure Planet – an alternate universe .

Ms Smith describes herself as a’ humble and devoted fan’ of Disney films and when the location was not made clear in a movie, she researched the original tale of myth in order to pinpoint its location on her colourful map. The map has generated debate on Deviant Art, where it was first published, as to where films should be located –such as The Little Mermaid in the Caribbean – and why Disney has never set a film in Russia. By way of an explanation for the position of Arial’s underwater world, Ms Smith wrote: ‘Although the author and original story are Danish, the wildlife is clearly tropical. There is simply no way to have that type of flora and fauna anywhere near Denmark. ‘It is very reasonable that The Little Mermaid movie could take place on the Danish colony, now known as the U.S. Virgin Islands.

There are 20 films set in the U.S. according to the map, including Lady and the Tramp in New England, A Bug’s Life in Texas, The Rescuers in New Orleans, Bolt in Hollywood and Toy Story in a small Ohio town. ‘The idea here was to place the Toy Story movies near Chagrin Fall, Ohio which is the popular theory for where they are located,’ Ms Smith said.

"This was the moment Islamist thugs threw a teenager head-first off a roof as the vicious riots sweeping Egypt plumbed grisly new depths. His only ‘crime’ was to have been caught celebrating the ousting of Islamist president Mohamed Morsi by the army last week. In horrifying footage, the boy is seen hiding with three friends from a large group who had chased them in Alexandria. Scroll down for video . Terror: The video, apparently filmed with a mobile phone camera from a rooftop across the road, show the four teenage boys escaping onto a 20ft ledge atop a roof in Alexandria as the mob gathers around them . Trapped: The mob gather around the young men as the fourth teen manages to climb onto to ledge, and they begin throwing rocks at them to get them down . After both sides traded insults, the mob forced the boys on to a roof in the city’s Sidi Jaber district. The video, apparently filmed with a . mobile phone from across the road, shows them cowering from supporters . of Morsi’s Muslim Brotherhood during protests on Friday. As the teenagers huddle on top of the 20ft ledge, the mob begin throwing rocks at them and attempt to climb after them. One bearded thug is seen carrying a black and white Al Qaeda flag. Shortly after, three of the boys are thrown off the fifth-floor ledge and beaten as they lie on the ground. Victim: The first teenager falls off the ledge and lies motionless as the mob gathers around his body . Attack: The boy does not move as the men close up on him and begin beating him . Fatal: The second boy, in red, is brought off the ledge and shortly before the camera moves away, the aggressive Islamist mob can be seen beating the teenagers, one of which reportedly died . One 19-year-old, Hamada Badr, died while his two friends were left  seriously injured. His father, Mohammed Badr, said: ‘Do . you know the teenager that they killed and disfigured his body and threw . from the fifth floor is only 19 and four days? ‘All he was guilty of was that he was on the roof of the building, celebrating the ousting of Morsi. ‘But the Brotherhood waged a war against whoever was celebrating Morsi’s departure.’ Around 36 people have died and at least 1,000 injured since the coup. Last night, Tony Blair was condemned . for ‘rushing to judgment’ by former foreign secretary Douglas Hurd after . praising the coup. Middle East peace envoy Mr Blair argued that the . alternative to the coup was ‘chaos’ and the world could not afford to . see Egypt collapse. Islamist supporter: A man with a long beard wearing a white tank top and jeans carried the black-and-white flag of Al-Qaeda . Nowhere to run: The group on the roof was only a small part of the large Morsi-supporter mob which had chased the boys into the building in Alexandria . He added: ‘Seventeen million people . on the streets are not the same as an election. But it is an awesome . manifestation of power.’ But Lord Hurd said: ‘Tony Blair leaps in before he’s thought things through. We need to keep our heads and not rush to judgment. ‘We should keep our counsel... and wait for the last act of the drama which may be some years away.’ Tensions in Egypt escalated yesterday . after interim president Adly Mansour backtracked on a decision to make .

"This is the shocking moment a gang of axe-wielding robbers raided a jewellery store at a busy shopping centre in broad daylight. Dramatic CCTV footage captured the terrifying moment masked thugs ransacked the Beaverbrooks store in The Potteries Shopping Centre in Stoke-on-Trent this morning. Horrified Christmas shoppers and staff fled as the gang brazenly smashed glass display cabinets inside the busy shopping centre at around 11am. A gang of masked thugs used axes to smash open display cabinets and steal jewellery from the Beaverbrooks Store . Shocking CCTV footage captured the moment the masked robbers ransacked the jewellery store in the Potteries Shopping Centre, Stoke-on-Trent . Daylight robbery: The gang filled bags with the expensive jewellery before dashing from the shop . Dramatic footage shows the three men filling bags with expensive jewels and watches before making a quick getaway. Christmas shoppers were hurried into nearby shops which put their shutters down to protect the public from the axe-wielding thugs. After spending less than a minute inside the store the thieves made their escape with thousands of pounds worth of watches and jewellery. Witness Nick Woods, 28, a sales adviser at a Virgin Media stand nearby, said: 'I was walking back from my break when I saw a women run out of the shopping centre screaming 'they're smashing it up' repeatedly before she went towards Primark and fainted. 'I was wondering what was going on when I saw a man with a balaclava and axe. 'He started shouting at a taxi driver who had blocked their car to move. 'I came in to see my colleague picking up watches from among the broken glass and handing them to security. After spending less than a minute inside the store the three men made their escape with thousands of pounds worth of watches and jewellery . Terrified staff and shoppers watched in horror as the gang brazenly smashed glass display cabinets . One passer-by captured the terrifying moment the gang struck and began filming on her mobile phone . Angela Morris, manager at nearby Pandora jewellers, added: 'The first thing I heard was screams. 'I was in the office so I grabbed the phone and called for security to come down. 'We advised customers to stay in and asked those outside to come in before we dropped the shutters. 'It makes you realise how vulnerable you are, even though you work in a shopping centre these things still happen.' Shopper Rose Love, 51, from Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, said: 'I'm shocked. You don't expect it to happen in a shopping centre where you think it's safe. 'I feel sorry for the staff. 'It's unbelievable what people are willing to do. Hopefully it's a one off and people can still enjoy shopping.' Jordan Powell, manager at Swarovski jewellers, said: 'I heard shouting and screaming then saw a few blokes in balaclavas followed by the smashing of glass. 'Everyone froze. I got staff and customers out the back of our store and came back in to drop the shutter before escorting people out into the loading area. 'It was all over in a flash and the police were here by the time we got back to the store.' No one was hurt during the incident at the Beaverbrook store in a shopping centre in Stoke-on-Trent . One passer-by captured the terrifying moment the gang struck and began filming on her mobile phone. In the 20 second clip the trio can be heard shouting at each other to hurry up before one man can be heard saying: 'I'll f***ing have you.' The woman, who did not want to be named, added: 'It was like something from a film, they were just smashing the place up and had these great big axes. 'I can't believe they did this at a busy time of the day when there were so many people around. 'I just hope the video can help catch those responsible because it left many staff and shoppers absolutely paralysed with fear. It was terrifying.' A spokesman for the shopping centre said: 'We can confirm Staffordshire Police are investigating a robbery at intu Potteries, which took place on Monday, November 17. 'No one was hurt during the incident and we're open as normal.' A Staffordshire Police spokesman said: 'A quantity of jewellery has been taken and our detectives are taking statements from numerous members of the public. 'There is no indication of how old the three men are or their ethnicity.' Anna Blackburn, CEO of Beaverbrooks said: 'We can confirm an incident took place this morning at our Hanley store. This is a matter being handled by the police and therefore we cannot comment on the investigation. 'We are doing everything we can to assist the police in their enquiries and to ensure our team have all the support during this distressing time.'","Axe-wielding robbers raided a busy jewellers in broad daylight today .

"There is one vote of immense significance going on in Scotland on Thursday where nearly all of us can surely agree it would be best to hear a ‘yes’ verdict. Here’s one area where Alex Salmond and the politicians based in London are in total agreement. The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews has been holding its autumn meeting on September 18 since 1783 but there might never have been a gathering as momentous as this. At this meeting, the result of the ballot on whether to allow women members will be declared. Annika Sorenstam speaks during her induction ceremony as the 2014 Memorial honoree prior to the Memorial Tournament  at Muirfield Village Golf Club . Annika Sorenstam of Sweden tees off on the 18th hole during the Pro-Am prior to the 2007 Ricoh Women's British Open held on the Old Course at St Andrews . Since the alternative is worldwide ridicule — and the 2,400 men who make up the R&A membership are hardly fools — it is expected they will vote in large numbers for women to be allowed to join the club. Thereafter, expect 15 or so women holding prominent positions within the golfing community to be sounded out and fast-tracked. In addition to high-ranking officials, let us hope the list includes popular ex-players such as former world No 1 Annika Sorenstam. Peter Dawson, chief executive of the R&A, has spoken about a ‘direction of travel’ on this subject and it finally looks like the organisation has swapped a glacier as the preferred mode of transport for a speedboat. If the vote goes as expected, the next thing will be for other courses on The Open rota with men-only membership to note that times have changed and act accordingly. Peter Dawson, chief executive of the R&A, has spoken about a ‘direction of travel’ on the subject . For the R&A, the manner in which The Open at men-only Muirfield last year was overshadowed by the issue and the uneasiness felt all week by influential sponsors such as HSBC appears to have been the tipping point. There is only one more Open scheduled for a men-only club — Royal Troon in 2016 — and it is hard to envisage the privilege being granted again unless the clubs in question change. Royal St George’s is the other men-only club on the rota and the noises emanating from all three over the past six months indicate they are ready to follow the lead of the governing body. It took long enough, it’s true, but thankfully it truly looks as if this great stain that has blighted the game for so long is about to be finally washed away. The FedEx Cup play-offs are horribly contrived and dreadfully unfair on the men who play well all season long. But, like the Championship play-off game in football that decides the final promotion spot to the Premier League, there is no denying the format ensures an exciting end to the PGA Tour season. The outcome was in doubt almost to the end at East Lake on Sunday before Billy Horschel got to the 16th and closed out the Tour Championship with the greatest putt for par he will ever hole to deny the likes of Rory McIlroy and Jim Furyk and claim his $11.44million payday. The $10m FedEx bonus he received, in addition to the $1.44m first prize for the Tour Championship, is the headline figure but the rest didn’t exactly go home empty-handed. McIlroy pocketed $2m for finishing third in the FedEx standings. Justin Rose earned $300,000 for being placed 11th. And on it went. Paul Casey was busy winning the KLM Open in Holland on Sunday, but was still shipped another $75,000 by the sponsor for finishing 95th, after his participation in the first two play-off events. A wonderful life when you get to that level in golf, isn’t it? Bill Horschel poses with both trophies after winning the Tour Championship  and The FedEX Cup . QUOTE OF THE WEEK . ‘I’m about ready to cry right now because, honestly, Jack Nicklaus is a hero. I can’t really explain how good it feels to beat his record.’ Will Jon Rahm prove to be the next great Spanish golfer? The 19-year-old has been making a name for himself in the American college scene and, at the World Amateur Team Championship in Japan last week, broke a 72-hole individual scoring record set by the Golden Bear that had stood for 54 years. No wonder he was so emotional. The event itself was won by the United States. New parent Graeme McDowell and enigmatic Frenchman Victor Dubuisson might have had a late change of heart but the ISPS Handa Wales Open this week will still boast its strongest line-up since Celtic Manor hosted the Ryder Cup in 2010. True, there will be no one remotely as famous and powerful as the avid golfing leftie who showed up at Celtic Manor earlier this month. But, while United States President Barack Obama has moved on, Lee Westwood, Jamie Donaldson, Stephen Gallacher and Thomas Bjorn, plus Europe captain Paul McGinley, have all decided the best way of tuning up for the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles is by revisiting the scene of the last home triumph. It’s a welcome change of fortune for an event that has been neglected for too long by too many.

"During Chelsea’s blistering start to their Under 21 clash with Southampton at Stamford Bridge on Monday evening, one of the club's coaches began tweeting some interesting statistics. The academy kids were 5-0 up in 35 minutes against the Premier League leaders, with the ‘lads on flames’ as goals from Kasey Palmer, Izzy Brown, Dominic Solanke and Tammy Abraham put Saints away. The next message from Jody Morris carried far greater significance, highlighting the 11 English players selected by Under 21 coach Adrian Viveash and driving home the point that 10 had been scouted locally. Ten are also internationals. Izzy Brown (left) scored as the Stamford Bridge youngsters enjoyed a Blues cruise against Southampton . Kasey Palmer also impressed as Chelsea Under 21s ran out easy winners against their Saints counterparts . Isaiah Brown is mobbed by his Chelsea team-mates after scoring against Southampton . Dion Conroy (born in Redhill), Fankaty Dabo (Southwark), Jake Clarke-Salter (Carshalton), captain Jordan Houghton (Chertsey), Palmer (Lewisham) and Abraham (Camberwell) were all born within 20 miles of Chelsea’s Cobham training centre. Charlie Colkett (Newham), Jay DaSilva (Luton) and Solanke (Reading) were born within 50 miles of Cobham and certainly a lot closer to the stadium at Stamford Bridge. Goalkeeper Mitchell Beeney (born in Leeds) and Brown (Peterborough) were the two players starting against Southampton who were born outside of the Cobham catchment area. Morris is one of their own, a former Chelsea player who has returned to the club as part of academy director Neil Bath’s strategy to have 33 per cent of the coaching staff with an affinity to the club. After the wild excesses of former sporting director Frank Arnesen, who once spent £5million recruiting Franco Di Santo from Chilean club Audax, Chelsea have made a commitment to nurture local talent again. Tammy Abraham (right) in action against the Southampton Under 21s, comes from Camberwell . Jordan Houghton comes from Chertsey in Surrey - again, not a million miles away from Cobham . This is not quite a return to the days of Morris cleaning the boots of the captain Dennis Wise at Chelsea’s old training ground in Sipson Lane, Harlington, but it is certainly a start. Most would agree that overseas players have enhanced the Barclays Premier League in the past two decades, but no-one can pretend that a similar strategy has been a rip-roaring success at Chelsea’s academy. There has been some progress of late and Jose Mourinho is taking more of an interest in the academy than ever before. Andreas Christensen, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Brown, who were all on the substitutes’ bench for the 1-1 draw with Manchester City on Saturday, train with the first team most days. Things have changed a bit since John Terry’s first session with the senior side, when he smashed right-back Dan Petrescu in front of the other players, but they are learning to be professional in a different way. Jay DaSilva hails from Luton and is part of the impressive Chelsea set up just below the first team . Around the time when Terry, Morris, Jon Harley, Frank Sinclair and former Lilleshall prospect Clinton Ellis were coming through the ranks, they only had eight or nine players in each age category. To make up the numbers for the games Graham Rix, who was the youth team coach at the time, often had to pull in some of the best local players in west London to represent the club. There were times when Terry or Morris would be dragged in to play in the same team as a senior player for a practice match and then have to clean his boots after the game. They would pick up tips from the senior players, mining Wise or others in that Chelsea dressing room for information as they made their way through the ranks. Adrian Viveash (left) steered his homegrown talent to their convincing victory over Southampton . Some of that is missing in the modern world, now that Chelsea’s academy building and pitches are separated from the main area reserved exclusively for the business of the first team. There is a nod in the direction to the past, with young academy players being given specific tasks, such as cleaning dressing rooms, balls or bibs on a three-month cycle. Beyond those menial tasks is a professional set up, an environment that has been designed to encourage young players to flourish. They need little reminding that the last first-team player to successfully come through the Chelsea academy to become a first team regular remains the current captain. When Terry was a young player he was remembered because he always walked out on to the training ground at Harlington in a short sleeved shirt, whatever the weather was doing. Those days are gone.

A young Terry training at Chelsea's old ground in Sipson before he went on to captain the club . Terry and Morris in Premier League action for Chelsea against Sunderland in 2003 . In the modern era Chelsea’s young players go to school on site, reporting to the training ground at 9am before heading out to train at 10.30am. After lunch they train again, or attend gambling, alcohol or other addiction workshops to prepare them for a life that may not involve Chelsea. They download their IAP (Individual Action Plans), a five-point guide tailored to each young player to help with their development on the field. They showed signs of progress on Monday when Chelsea’s young players stormed into a convincing 5-0 lead over a club widely considered to have one of the best scouting networks in the game. After all this time, plus the phenomenal amounts of money spent on expensive overseas prospects, Chelsea are once again filling their youth teams with local players . These days, it’s not just about making up the numbers. Juan Cuadrado was the £27m addition to the Chelsea first team during the transfer window .","Chelsea's academy is now filled with local talent .

"More than half of the contiguous United States was coated in snow today as a deadly arctic blast swept across the country - the most on record for this early in the year.

And they are expected to  increase this evening as the storm sweeps across the Northeast and South  - with January-like temperatures causing up to 36 inches of snow around the Great Lakes. Almost all of the 50.4 per cent was accumulated in the past seven days, according to NOAA figures seen by The Washington Post. A week ago, snow covered only 11 per cent of the contiguous US. Northern Wisconsin has been the region most affected by snow so far - with some locations seeing a staggering 50 inches of snow from November 10 to 14. This morning, Storm Bozeman tore through parts of the Midwest, leaving commuters facing a 'treacherous' commute and forcing many schools to close, before heading to the East and South.

Kevin Roth, lead meteorologist at The Weather Channel, said the heaviest bout would come from Cleveland, Ohio, to Buffalo, New York, warning:  'It's going to be painful.' He added: 'You're talking 24 to 36 inches coming down at a rate of up to five or six inches an hour—that's what we mean when we say intense.' Boston, New York and Washington D.C saw temperatures in the low 30s today - up to 30 degrees below average for this time of year - while other areas reached only the mid 20s. In the Northwest, temperatures at Boise Airport in Idaho broke a 134-year-old record at six degrees this morning, one degree colder than the seven degrees recorded on November 17, 1880. Icy conditions: An arctic blast that killed at least 11 people over the weekend issued a second strike today. Above, a car drives down a snowy road at Castlewood State Park outside St Louis, Missouri on Sunday . Accident: Over the weekend, at least 11 people were killed as unseasonable ice and snow froze roads, leading to hundreds of accidents.

Above, a woman shops in Enid, Oklahoma . Warning: This map shows the parts of the US - particularly, the East - that were today given weather warnings . By tomorrow, parts of the South, including sections of Tennessee and North Carolina, could even see highs of below freezing, according to NBC. Wind gusts in these areas could reach 50mph. 'By then, the whole eastern half of the United States will have temperatures from 15 to 30 degrees below average,' said Tom Moore, meteorologist at The Weather Channel said. The top levels of snowfall recorded in parts of the U.S. over the weekend were: . Montana: 21.4 inches at Black Bear SNOTEL . Wyoming: 32.3 inches at Grassy Lake SNOTEL . Idaho: 28.5 inches at Vienna Mine SNOTEL . Colorado: 21 inches at Coal Bank Pass . Oregon: 19 inches (with 0.5 inch ice accumulation) in Prineville . Utah: 15.8 inches at Garden City Summit SNOTEL . Washington: 15 inches near White Salmon . Source: The Weather Channel . Over the weekend, at least 11 people were killed as unseasonable ice and snow froze the roads, leading to hundreds of accidents, some of which were fatal. On Saturday, five people were killed in weather-related smashes in Minnesota, while another person died in a three-car crash on Interstate 94 near Rogers the following morning. Also on Sunday, four people  died in accidents in Lubbock, Texas, and a 25-year-old man was killed when he veered off the road in icy conditions in Dinsmore Township, Ohio. Despite transport crews in many areas treating roads with salt and sand - and those in the most affected cities plowing snow - the conditions remain hazardous. On its website, The Weather Channel warned: 'It doesn't take much snow to make roads slick, especially in areas less accustomed to frequent snow where more roads may be untreated.' In Idaho, dozens of school in the southwest were reportedly canceled classes on Friday due to the deadly weather, with more than a foot of snow having fallen in the mountains. Meanwhile, this morning, a layer of ice was visible on parts of Lake Superior in Ashland, Wisconsin, several weeks earlier than normal, according to ABC. Affected by the storm: The wreckage of a lorry is pictured on the I-40 east of Elk City, Oklahoma, on Sunday .

This graphic (left) shows the icy blast set to travel from the Midwest to parts of the Northeast and South today, while a woman is seen heading to her car with groceries at Sprouts in Edmond, Oklahoma, on Sunday (right) Storm Bozeman first started moving into the Pacific Northwest on Wednesday night, bringing mild, moist Pacific air to land, resulting in unusual winterlike weather. It has now become a record November snowstorm in Boise, Idaho, with 7.6 inches of snow reported in the region, according to the National Weather Service. It will move to Canada later this week. The epicenter of the phenomenon is the remnants of Typhoon Nuri, which is causing areas of exceptionally low pressure over the Bering Sea, between Russia and Alaska. This has bent the jet stream, a barrier of wind which usually keeps hot and cold air separate, pulling warm air north and pushing cold air south. The weather forecast for today - Monday, November 17 - shows storms, rain and snow across the East Coast . Getting brighter? Meanwhile, tomorrow's forecast shows less stormy, snowy weather across the same area . Winter alerts: Despite the weather warnings, snow is expected to fall less and less as Storm Bozeman gradually loses moisture support from the Pacific Ocean. Above, winter weather alerts in the US today . The pattern of pressures forms a bulge that resembles the Greek letter omega (Ω), and is therefore referred to as an Omega Block. Cold air which would usually sits near Canada has been pulled down as far as Texas, while warmer air from around the United States sails north. Later this week, one more push of cold air is expected, which could send temperatures plummeting to 40 degrees below average for this time of year, particularly across the Great Lakes.

"Patients with more sympathetic, understanding doctors have better outcomes and fewer complications, new research suggests. By measuring a doctor’s understanding of a patient’s concerns, pain, suffering and an intention to help, researchers found a link between diabetic patients’ outcomes and their physicians. A large study done by a team from Thomas Jefferson University along with Italian researchers evaluated the relationships among 20,961 diabetic patients and 242 primary care physicians they were enrolled to in Parma, Italy. Researchers have found that more sympathetic doctors meant their patients had better outcomes and fewer complications . Mohammadreza Hojat, Ph.D., research professor of the Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior and director of Jefferson Longitudinal Study of Medical Education in the Center for Research in Medical Education and Health Care at Jefferson Medical College said: ‘This new, large-scale research study has confirmed that empathic physician-patient relationships is an important factor in positive outcomes. ‘It takes our hypothesis one step further. 'Compared to our initial study, it has a much larger number of patients and physicians, a different tangible clinical outcome, hospital admission for acute metabolic complications, and a cross-cultural feature that will allow for generalisation of the findings in different cultures, and different health care systems.’ Researchers used the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) which measures the level of empathy in the context of patient care. Researchers used the results of two medical tests, the haemoglobin A1c (blood) test and cholesterol levels measurements, and found a direct association between a physian’s JSE and a better control of their patient’s medical results. Dr Hojat said: ‘Results of this study confirmed our hypothesis that a validated measure of physician empathy is significantly associated with the incidence of acute metabolic complications in diabetic patients, and provide the much needed, additional empirical support for the beneficial effects of empathy in patient care. Much needed information: The research supports the beneficial effects of empathy in patient care . ‘These findings also support the recommendations of such professional organisations as the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Board of Internal Medicine of the importance of assessing and enhancing empathic skills in undergraduate and graduate medical education.’ Italian patients and doctors were evaluated because there is universal health care coverage in Italy and there is no confounding effect of difference in insurance, lack of insurance or financial barriers to access care. ‘What's more, this second study was conducted in a health care system in which all residents enrol with a primary care physician resulting in a better defined relationship between the patients and their primary care physicians than what exists in the United States,’ said co-author Daniel Z. Louis, Managing Director for the Center for Research in Medical Education and Health Care and research associate professor of family and community medicine at JMC. Co-author author Vittorio Maio, PharmD, M.S., MSPH, associate professor at the Jefferson School of Population Health said: ‘Italy has a lower rate of switching doctors, facilitating long-lasting physician patient relationships.’ According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 25 million people in America have been diagnosed with diabetes, with almost 700,000 hospitalisations per year. In the UK, 2,9 million people live with diabetes, up from 1.4 million in 1996. There are approximately two million new cases per year. Worldwide, the number of total cases jumps to 180 million.","Researchers found a link between a physician's empathy for their patient's condition and the patient's outcomes .

"A 40-year-old mother-of-seven has been mauled to death by a pack of dogs after they attacked her at an Indian reservation in Wyoming. Deanne 'Tyvones' Coando, a member of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe, was walking through Fort Washakie in the two-million-acre Wind River Indian Reservation when the animals pounced. She was rushed to Riverton Hospital with serious injuries, hypothermia and a severe loss of blood after fellow tribe members heard her screams. Despite medics' best efforts, she shortly died. Tragic: Deanne 'Tyvones' Coando (pictured in a Facebook photo) was mauled to death by a pack of dogs after they attacked her at Fort Washakie in the two-million-acre Wind River Indian Reservation in central Wyoming . Police are investigating Ms Coando's death on Wednesday, which has left tribal officials both shocked and skeptical. The ownership and whereabouts of the dogs remain unclear. On Monday, Kimberly Varilek, attorney general of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe, said it was the first time the tribe - which has a population of fewer than 2,000 - had heard about such an attack. 'The tribes have ordinances and deal with dogs running around as any government does,' said Ms Varilek, whose tribe shares the central Wyoming reservation with the Northern Arapho Tribe. 'It's not really been an issue, we've not had a series of dog attacks or anything like that against people. There may be some skepticism because it's so unheard of.' Scene of the mauling: On Monday, Kimberly Varilek, attorney general of the Eastern Shoshone Tribe, based at Fort Washakie (pictured), said it was the first time anyone with her tribe had heard about such an attack . Community: 'The tribes have ordinances and deal with dogs running around as any government does,' said Ms Varilek, whose tribe (pictured, its logo) shares the Indian reservation with the Northern Arapho Tribe . Last week, Ms Coando's children -  Jerel, Jayshauna, Jaden and Autumn Tillman, Adriaona and Damion Jr Loneman and Jewel Coando - took to social media to express their grief at her death. Jayshauna posted a photo of her and her mother to Facebook, with the caption: 'Guna miss you n all da gud times we had mom :'(', while Jaden simply wrote: 'My life sucks.' Speaking of the mauling, Mark Stratmoen, chief deputy Fremont County coroner, said Ms Coando suffered 'serious' injuries from 'multiple dogs' and was alone at the time of the incident. Missed: Last week, Ms Coando's (pictured) children - Jerel, Jayshauna, Jaden and Autumn Tillman, Adriaona and Damion Jr Loneman and Jewel Coando - took to social media to express their grief at her death . He added that he was not aware of any other fatal dog attacks in the area, but urged the public to watch for aggressive canines and immediately report any problems to law enforcement. Meanwhile, Sergio Maldonado, Sr, a member of the Northern Arapaho Tribe, said he had not heard of any issues on the reservation regarding packs of dogs threatening people. 'I don't mind sharing with you my observation that we have too many dogs on the reservation, probably cats, too, he said, adding that it is common to see dogs that are hungry and cold. 'It's not a problem safety wise for people and livestock. I haven't heard of anything like that.' He said vets had offered free spaying and neutering services over the weekend, which numerous residents had attended. Ms Coando, who had two grandchildren JayDonna and Jayess, is also survived by her parents.

A woman takes a selfie in front of armed servicemen and their armoured personnel carrier in the eastern Crimean port city of Feodosiya . All smiles for the camera: This woman looks happy to be posing alongside the soldier in Crimea which has been occupied by Russian military . People in Crimea have been captured taking selfies with Russian masked gunmen despite Ukraine being on the brink war . Ukraine has put its military on high alert and appealed for international help to avoid what it fears is a possible wider invasion by Russia. Meanwhile, outrage over Russia's military moves mounted in world capitals, with US secretary of state John Kerry calling on President Vladimir Putin to pull back from 'an incredible act of aggression'. A day after Russia captured the Crimean Peninsula without firing a shot, fears grew in the Ukrainian capital and beyond that Russia might seek to expand its control by seizing other eastern parts of the country. The U.S. now believes that Russia has complete operational control of Crimea, a pro-Russian area of the country, and has more than 6,000 troops in the region. A woman posted this photo with the caption 'SOS!!! HELP!!!!' in Crimea where Russian soldiers are now stationed . A photographer captured this image of a Russian soldier in Crimea holding his gun and posted it on Instagram . Ukrainian prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said there was no reason for Russia to invade and warned that 'we are on the brink of disaster'. World leaders rushed to try to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis. Nato held an emergency meeting in Brussels, Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague flew to Kiev to support its new government and Mr Kerry prepared to to travel to Ukraine tomorrow. People in Crimea have been captured taking selfies with Russian masked gunmen despite Ukraine being on the brink war . 'It is very important that we all do everything we can to calm tensions,' Mr Hague said, adding he had urged Russian officials to 'speak directly to the Ukrainians'. The White House issued a joint statement on behalf of the Group of Seven today, saying the nations were suspending participation in the planning for the upcoming June summit to be held in Sochi, which hosted Russia's Winter Olympics, because Russia's advances in the Ukraine violated the 'principles and values' on which the G7 and G8 operate. Mr Kerry, who previously talked about boycotting the G8 summit, as well as possible visa bans, asset freezes and trade and investment penalties against Russia. All the foreign ministers he spoke to were prepared 'to go to the hilt' to isolate Russia, he said. Caught on camera: The pictures have appeared on the photograph sharing network Instagram . Nato issued a statement saying it 'condemns Russia's military escalation in Crimea' and demanding that Russia respect its obligations under the United Nations charter. Ukraine is not a Nato member, meaning the US and Europe are not obligated to come to its defence, but the country has taken part in some alliance exercises. In Kiev, Moscow and other cities, thousands of protesters took to the streets to either condemn the Russian occupation or celebrate Crimea's return to its former ruler. 'Support us, America!' a group of protesters chanted outside the U.S. embassy in Kiev. One young girl held up a placard reading: 'No Russian aggression!' Ukraine has put its military on high alert and appealed for international help to avoid what it fears is a possible wider invasion by Russia . 'Russia! Russia!' the crowd chanted in Moscow. Faced with the Russian threat, Ukraine's new government moved to consolidate its authority, naming new regional governors in the pro-Russia east, enlisting the support of the country's wealthy business leaders and sacking the head of the country's navy after he declared allegiance to the pro-Russian government in Crimea. But Ukraine's new government and the West have so far been powerless to counter Russia's tactics. Armed men in uniforms without insignia have moved freely about Crimea for days, occupying airports, smashing equipment at an air base and besieging a Ukrainian infantry base. Mr Putin has defied calls from the West to pull back his troops, insisting that Russia has a right to protect its interests and those of Russian-speakers in Crimea and elsewhere in Ukraine. The U.S. now believes that Russia has complete operational control of Crimea, a pro-Russian area of the country, and has more than 6,000 troops in the region . His confidence is matched by the knowledge that Ukraine's 46 million people have divided loyalties. While much of western Ukraine wants closer ties with the 28-nation European Union, its eastern and southern regions like Crimea look to Russia for support. Russia has long wanted to reclaim the lush Crimean Peninsula, part of its territory until 1954. Russia's Black Sea Fleet pays Ukraine millions every year to be stationed at the Crimean port of Sevastopol and nearly 60 per cent of Crimea's residents identify themselves as Russian. During a phone conversation with Ms Merkel yesterday, Mr Putin 'directed her attention to the unrelenting threat of violence from ultra-nationalist forces (in Ukraine) that endangered the life and legal interests of Russian citizens', the Kremlin said. 'The measures taken by Russia are fully adequate with regard to the current extraordinary situation,' it said. Off guard: Armed Russian soldiers take a break from patrolling the streets of Crimea . Ukraine's new government came to power last week following months of pro-democracy protests against the country's pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukovych and his decision to turn Ukraine towards Russia instead of the EU. Mr Yanukovych fled to Russia after more than 80 people were killed in the protests, but insists he is still president. Ukraine's acting president, Oleksandr Turchynov, put Ukraine's armed forces on alert yesterday, calling up reserves for training and stepping up security at nuclear power plants, airports and other strategic locations. Occupied: A man stands next to three armed Russian soldiers in Crimea despite fears growing in the Ukrainian capital and beyond that Russia might seek to expand its control by seizing other eastern parts of the country . Mr Turchynov also moved to consolidate authority in eastern Ukraine, appointing 18 new regional governors, including two of the countries wealthiest businessmen, in the cities of Dneprotrovsk and Donetsk, as big business and the Ukrainian government united against Russia. Ukraine's richest man, Rinat Akhmetov, whose SCM Group has 300,000 employees and interests in steel, coal and mining, urged businesses, ordinary people and the government to join together, saying the use of force and 'illegal action from outside' were 'impermissible'. Russian troops, meanwhile, pulled up to the Ukrainian military base at Perevalne on the Crimean Peninsula in a convoy that included at least 13 trucks and four armoured vehicles with mounted machine guns. An elderly woman links arms with two Russian armed soldiers and asks for a photograph to be taking with them in the Crimean Peninsula . With the caption: 'Here they come' a man posted this image standing in front of two armed guards in Crimea . Ukraine has put its military on high alert and appealed for international help to avoid what it fears is a possible wider invasion by Russia . In response, a dozen Ukrainian soldiers, some with clips in their rifles, placed a tank at the base's gate, leaving the two sides in a tense stand-off. It appeared to be the first known case of outmatched Ukrainians standing up to Russian military might. Unidentified soldiers were also seen cutting power to the headquarters of the Ukrainian naval forces in Crimea - whose commander later defected and pledged his allegiance to 'the people of Crimea'. In Kiev, a Ukrainian security official said the head of the Ukrainian navy - Admiral Denis Berezovsky - had been dismissed and faced a treason investigation after declaring his allegiance to the pro-Russian government in Crimea and offering no resistance to the Russian troops. The speaker of Crimea's legislature, Vladimir Konstantinov, was quoted as saying local authorities did not recognise the new government in Kiev. He said a planned referendum on March 30 would ask voters about the region's future status.","In one photograph captioned 'sweetest guys' a woman stands alongside a soldier armed with a gun .

"In compensation for a small piece of land taken by the Victorian government, to build an extra highway lane, elite private school, Scotch College has been given a staggering $5.4 million. The Age reports in 2008, VicRoads used land acquisition powers to take over a thin piece of land, alongside the Hawthorn boys' school in Melbourne's east, in a bid to use it to expand the Monash Freeway, part of Citylink. The strip of land is at the back of the college near Gardiners creek and construction of the extra lane was completed in 2010. It's believed a payment for the land was made by the government's road authority to the college only just late last year, as identified in the school's 2013 revenue records. Scotch College (pictured) in Melbourne received $5.4 million for a thin piece of land acquired by the Victorian government . A small piece of land in the vicinity of the area marked was bought by the state government for $5.4 million after he took the land to build an extra lane for the Citylink . In 2008, the prestigious school knocked back a $1 million offer from the State Government as well as compensation for occupancy of the land during construction, and instead took the state government to court to get more money. It's believed the VicRoads offer was determined following a valuation from then valuer general Jack Dunham. But although the deal was a long drawn out process the school finally received sufficient compensation. 'The final compensation amount paid to Scotch College was determined through the Valuers' negotiations and assessment of the matters being claimed,' said Agnelo Duarte, Director of technical services at VicRoads. 'The compensation amount paid to Scotch College covered land and severance, temporary occupation of Scotch College land throughout the project, costs pre and post referral to court, solatium and interest pursuant to the act.' 'A range of expert valuation and legal advice was sought to determine the final amount and the final amount was also endorsed by the Government Land Monitor,' he said. A spokesperson for Scotch College confirmed the value of the land was the subject of negotiation during Supreme Court action. This is a copy of the plan of the land acquired by the state government, owned by Scotch College . 'The final amount received also included payment for disruptions to school operations, the need to repair grounds following loss and damage, the reimbursement of other costs, and rent for the use of property by the construction companies throughout the project.' Former Liberal party MP and Scotch college council member, Dr David Kemp told The Age he had no personal role in negotiations over payment for the land, despite heading up a taskforce to ensure the school got fairly compensated. A spokesman for Roads Minster Terry Mulder said the issue wasn't really concerning the minister as things had been settled in court. However he did confirm that Dr Kemp was not personally involved in negotiations. The Australian Education Union says the extensive payment demonstrated the poor track record the Napthine government had with public education. 'It has a poor record for supporting public schools,' said the union's Victorian president, Meredith Pearce. 'It has made a payment to one of Victoria's wealthiest schools but refused to be transparent about the hundreds of millions of dollars coming through the Gonski deal.' Ms Pearce says additional state and federal government money is in the coffers yet it's secret as to where and how that money is being spent. 'The additional money is paying for things the state government doesn't have to pay for, like land at Scotch, and it should be paying for that out of it's own budget,' she said.","Victorian government pays Melbourne's Scotch College $5.4 million for a small piece of land .

"Born Lily, 13-year-old Leo Waddell, is one of the youngest children in the UK to be prescribed hormone therapy to help him transition into a male body. Having lived as a boy since the age of five, Leo, from Lowestoft, Suffolk, changed his name by deed poll at the age of 11. He is now the star of a new documentary about the struggles he has faced living as a transgender child. With the aim of educating children about transgender people, 'I am Leo' is being shown on the BBC's children's channel CBBC at 6pm this evening as part of Anti Bullying Week. Scroll down for video . Born Lily (left), 13-year-old Leo (right, pictured today) has lived as a boy since the age of five and is now receiving hormone treatment . Leo, pictured with his mother Hayley, changed his name by deed poll at the age of 11 and is now the star of a new documentary about the struggles he has had living as a transgender child . Leo receives hormone blockers which prevent him from entering puberty, which would result in him growing breasts and starting menstruation. Treated at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust, a specialist clinic for young people with gender identity issues, Leo is one of very few people under the age of 18 who are receiving hormone treatment for gender dysphoria. Those suffering from gender dysphoria experience great distress because their biological sex and gender identity are at odds. Often also known as gender identity disorder (GID) it leaves people with the sense they are 'trapped' in the wrong body. Leo also receives counselling and therapy at the clinic on what it means to be transgender. While many people with GID seek treatment to help them transition to the sex they identify with, Leo and his mother Hayley, 48, were forced to fight for him to have the hormone therapy due to his young age. Appearing on ITV's This Morning in September last year, Leo said he would 'probably kill myself' if he had to live as a girl. However, despite these intense feelings Leo was refused treatment by his GP as it's effects when started before puberty are as yet unknown and some practitioners feel those under 18 do not have the mental maturity to make such a decision. Last year Leo and his mother appeared on This Morning to champion his fight to receive hormone treatment . Hayley, a hairdresser who also has three daughters, rejected the idea that Leo shouldn't have the hormone blockers in case he later regrets his decision. She said on This Morning: 'I think many people think that, maybe I did for some time in the early days but that isn't going to happen, I know that 100 per cent, Leo needs the blockers.' Although Leo now has been prescribed the hormone blockers he has still struggled to be accepted as a male and speaks in the documentary about the problems he has faced, particularly at primary school. Appearing alongside him in 'I am Leo' is Stephen Whittle OBE, who transitioned to live as a man years ago and has spent his life fighting for transgender rights, and 20 year-old Natalie, who was born male but lives as a young woman.

"The Great Lakes - the world's largest group of freshwater lakes - were 78.9 per cent covered by ice on February 6, according to an analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . Not since early 1996 has ice been so widespread on the Great Lakes, with the frigid winter pushing Lake Superior toward a complete ice over. Lake Superior had ice across an estimated 91 percent of its surface as of Thursday, according to the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory. The 40-year average annual Lake Superior ice coverage for February is just 30 percent. George Leshkevich, who has been tracking Great Lakes ice for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory since 1973, said this winter has had among the most rapid ice buildups of his tenure. Air temperatures show this is the coldest winter since 1979, according to Twin Cities. According to an analysis by NOAA's Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory, ice covered 78.7 percent of the Great Lakes on February 6. Not since early 1996 has ice been so widespread on the Great Lakes. Seen here is Lake Superior at 4.22 pm local time on February 7, 2014 . Calm before the storm: Lake Superior, the largest of The Great Lakes system, is seen here before the winter storms hit . Ice cover on Lake Huron rocketed up an additional 14 percent this week, climbing to a total ice cover of 86 percent. If the ice continues to build at that rate in this next week, Lake Huron could be almost frozen over, or frozen over by the end of next week . Typically: Lake Huron, seen here in warmer climes, is one of the five Great Lakes of North America and comprises the easterly portion of Lake Michigan¿Huron . The big freeze: Lake Michigan at 6.04 pm local on February 7, 2014 . Lake Michigan at 6.16 pm on February 5, 2014 . Winter weather expert for The Weather Channel, Tom Niziol shows how the current Great Lakes ice cover was pacing close to that from early February 1977, another year in which the peak ice cover topped 90 percent . The widespread ice in January and early February this year 'wouldn't have been anomalous back in the '70s or with some of the winters in the mid-'90s'. 'But it certainly has been a while since we've seen this much ice this early,' Leshkevich said. If this winter's cold trend continues, Leshkevich said the lake will freeze over, as it last did in 1996. But he's not willing to go out on a limb and predict a total freeze-over. 'If it warms up later in February, or we get a lot of wind, then things can change pretty fast,' Leshkevich said. 'It's all dependent on the weather, and I don't predict that.' While the percentage of the lake that's frozen continues to climb, satellite photos have revealed pockets of open water along the North Shore and the large, deep eastern basin of the lake. 'There's a lot of deep water that serves as a heat pump in those areas. They are usually the last to freeze,' Leshkevich noted. Lake Ontario has been covered by about 25 per cent. Here it is seen at 3.38pm on February 6, 2014 . Lake Ontario has been covered with as much as 79 percent ice, which occurred in the winter of 1994. Seen here about 7pm on February 6, 2014 . Beyond that, there are some preliminary indications the cold may finally ease up by next weekend, but that outlook remains too uncertain at this time. Lake Ontario is seen here on February 6, 2014 at 6.59pm . The lake came close to freezing over in 2003 and 2009 but hasn't hit a high enough ice concentration to be considered officially frozen since 1996. According to the Great Lakes Aquarium, 1979 and 1962 saw nearly complete freeze-overs of Lake Superior, with the lake about 95 percent ice covered in 1972. On average, about 40 percent of the Great Lakes surface area freezes each winter at its peak. Already this year that number has hit 70 percent and continues to climb. Michigan has hit about 55 percent ice cover; Huron 83 percent; Erie 93 percent and Ontario 27 percent this week. On average, ice coverage peaks in early March and then rapidly diminishes. This winter's vast ice on the Great Lakes is bucking a long-term trend of less and less ice as winters have, on average, become warmer. Baby it's cold out: A man looks to Lake Michigan at the 39th Street Harbor in Chicago on Sunday, Feb. 2, 2014 . Residents brave the cold as they walk along the shores of Lake Michigan as another round of arctic air blasts the midwest . Ice covers a breakwater on Lake Michigan at the 39th Street Harbor in Chicago, Sunday, Feb. 2, 2014 . The average amount of ice covering the Great Lakes declined by 71 percent between 1973 and 2011, with Lake Superior ice coverage down 79 percent, according to a report published in 2012 by the American Meteorological Society. Researchers used Coast Guard reports and satellite photographs taken from 1973 to 2010 to determine the ice coverage of all the lakes, with Lake Ontario ice dropping 88 percent while ice in Lake St. Clair (between Lake Huron and Lake Erie) diminished by 37 percent. Just under 88 percent of Lake Huron, almost 95 percent of Lake Erie, and . around 53 percent of Lake Michigan are now ice covered. Lake .

The last back-to-back snow event like this in the region hit in December 2008, said meteorologist Colby Neuman in the National Weather Service's Portland office. The big I-5 pileup that killed one person and injured others occurred across the Columbia River in Washington state's Clark County. Icicles hang from the eaves of State Street United Methodist Church . Snow swirls on Martin Luther King Blvd in Northeast Portland early on Thursday . At least half a dozen tractor-trailers were involved in the collision on the snow-covered freeway, The Columbian reported. Washington State Patrol Trooper Steve Schatzel said several people were trapped in the wreckage. One suffered injuries described as critical and two others suffered serious injuries. Oregon State Police Lt. Steve Mitchell described a 25-vehicle pileup on I-5 near Albany as 'pure chaos.' Traffic backed up for miles. Only minor injuries were reported. Oregon's largest city, Portland, recorded 3 ½ inches of snow by Thursday evening. Cars slipped and slid as commuters left work early. Some good-hearted residents helped push vehicles that got stuck. A school bus slid on ice and collided with a car Thursday afternoon in Aloha, west of Portland, but firefighters said one of the children on the bus was taken to a hospital. Snowfall totals as of Thursday night included 13 inches in the small town of Vernonia, Ore., northwest of Portland, and 10 inches in St. Helens, north of Portland along the Columbia River. Snow also fell along the Oregon coast; the community of Wheeler got 9 inches. In the Willamette Valley south of Portland, Corvallis got 9.3 inches and Albany reported 7 ½ inches. In the Columbia River Gorge that divides Oregon from Washington, snow was accented by 30-40 mph winds that gusted to 60 mph, Neuman said. In southwest Washington, Ridgefield got 9 inches of snow, Woodland got 7 and Longview got 5. The storm struck quickly Thursday morning, dumping snow on the Albany region and then spreading north.

"David Bentley readily admits that he fell out with every manager he played for — often because they felt he had an unsuitable attitude for a modern footballer. But as he recalls playing for the likes of Arsene Wenger, Mark Hughes and Harry Redknapp and explains why he decided to retire from football aged just 29, Bentley hardly appears to be someone with a problem. It was bold, maybe foolhardy, to give up potentially millions in earnings and a dream profession, but Bentley spent his entire career struggling with the restraints of the game. VIDEO Scroll down to watch an interview with Bentley on falling out of love with football . Speaking freely: David Bentley opens up about his life and career following his retirement from football . Pressure: Bentley's career fizzled out after he moved to Spurs for £15m from Blackburn . Frank: Former Tottenham star Bentley opens up to Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham . ‘Football was a sport I loved to play,’ Bentley recounts, his partner and three young children waiting nearby. ‘I did it for enjoyment. You express yourself. When you get to the top level it becomes a job. ‘There were a lot of reasons why at certain times I didn’t play. My point of view clashed with others. I fell out with pretty much every manager. They have five games now to save their job (so) if they see someone laughing and joking and having fun all the time, it might look like you’re not serious about saving their job.’ Growing up, Bentley viewed football differently. He looked up to players who, in his view, broke free from the commercial, PR-driven agenda which, he believes, shackles English players. His idols were Paul Scholes and Eric Cantona. His favourite player was Paul Gascoigne. Bentley was fascinated by their charisma and stage presence. Idols: Bentley worshiped Eric Cantona and Paul Gascoigne when he was growing up in London . ‘I always looked at how players were as people, as a sort of performer,’ he says, ‘Their stage presence was unbelievable. They could touch the ball four times but I loved watching them. ‘Nowadays you don’t see character and charisma. Every team plays the same, every player does the same thing. You aren’t going to remember any of them. Even the best players in the world — they just do their job and they’re a brand, controlled by an army behind them. ‘I was never really good at that. My flaw was I’d never touch my toes and take it like a good boy.’ It was April 1, 2013 when Bentley knew it was all over. He had gone back on loan to Blackburn  Rovers and was starting a Championship match against Cardiff City. But it just did not feel right any more. He knew it was not what he wanted. It was his last game of professional football. ‘I’d gone back to Blackburn to try to get ignited again, to love the game again,’ he remembers. ‘And I just thought, it’s not for me. I’d stopped enjoying it. I knew I wasn’t going to do it again.’ Calling time: Bentley says when he was named on the bench for Blackburn against Cardiff during his second spell at the club he knew it was time for him to retire from the game . Final games: Bentley steers the ball past Millwall's Chris Taylor during an FA Cup match in 2013 . Bentley spoke to his agent, Rob Segal — who he had been with since he was 15 — and friends and family about the decision. It is now all about family for Bentley. He has a stake in La Sala, a restaurant chain in Marbella which is soon to expand to England, but his partner Kim, daughter Devon and his newborn twins are his life now. The family have moved to Marbella, although they came back for a spell so the twins would be born in England. He arrives for this interview at a Buckinghamshire hotel pushing the twins in a double pram, his wife and daughter in tow and with a big smile on his face. Devon interrupts early in our discussion to try to get daddy to come and play. ‘I’ve got work to do,’ he says. Then asks: ‘How much do you love me out of 10?’ Devon holds up 10 fingers. ‘Is that all?’ he asks again. She gives him a big hug. Under the spotlight: Bentley celebrates with Sol Campbell during his early days at Arsenal . As a young player, Bentley had it all. He trained with Arsenal’s Invincibles aged just 16 — having joined the north London club at 13 — playing alongside footballing greats Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Robert Pires. Under Wenger’s tutelage he was tipped to become the best player of his generation. His ability had him labelled the new David Beckham by then-England manager Steve McClaren. And Beckham seconded that view. Bentley played with flair and without fear, never afraid to try a trick and able to land a ball on a sixpence from 60 yards. Great expectations: People compared Bentley to Beckham after his brilliant early performances . Promise: Bentley showed signs of brilliance as a teenager for Arsenal and during a loan spell at Norwich . With that mixture of attitude and talent, he scored terrific goals — such as the 40-yard volley against Arsenal shortly after moving to Tottenham, one of the moments for which he will be most remembered. But Bentley could not force his way through at Arsenal and, as an ambitious 19-year-old, he wanted to play. After a loan spell at Norwich City, he found his calling at Blackburn. That was where he was happiest in football, in his first spell there. He initially signed on loan before making the move permanent on the final day of the transfer window in January 2006. The next day, he struck the first Premier League hat-trick conceded by Manchester United to stun them in a 4-3 victory. At Blackburn he became a star and amid interest from United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, he signed a long-term deal. Blossomed: In his first spell at Blackburn he got called up to England squad and was likened to Beckham . ‘It was a good environment,’ recalls Bentley. ‘There was an old-school mentality. There was a family feel to it, I enjoyed going in. There were a lot of characters there: Robbie Savage, Dominic Matteo, David Thompson, Garry Flitcroft. ‘Every day it didn’t matter what the score was, who was better at this or that, everyone enjoyed being there, enjoyed each other’s company.’ But that all evaporated when he became the £15million man at Tottenham in July 2008, a figure which had the potential to rise to £17m with add-ons. It was a hefty price-tag for a 23-year-old. He signed a mammoth, five-year deal with wages in the region of £50,000 per week. Within a week he realised it was the complete opposite of what he had left behind at Ewood Park. Highlight: Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia fails to stop Bentley's fantastic long-range shot for Spurs . Good times: Bentley celebrates with Jonathan Woodgate after scoring from distance against Gunners . Transfer fee: But Bentley failed to nail down a first-team spot at White Hart Lane . ‘It was a difficult environment,’ he explains. ‘I had my opinion of football and I walked into the complete opposite of that. I didn’t see it coming.’ It failed to work there and four loan spells followed — including becoming the first English player to grace the Russian Premier League at FC Rostov — before he was substituted in the 62nd minute of that game against Cardiff and it was all over. From the very start, seeds of disillusion were already germinating. However much he loved playing, Bentley hated the element of control which plagues the modern game. Being told what to say, what to wear, where to go, when to do it — do this, be here, say that. Bentley believes this cripples ability and expression on the field. Shipped out: Bentley was allowed to leave Spurs on loan, with Birmingham one of his brief destinations . Hammer: The former England international spent time at West Ham in 2011 . ‘It’s why England fail,’ he explains. ‘That’s why we’ll never produce players. It’s about the mindset of the English game. ‘You look at Ross Barkley or Raheem Sterling; do you think Neymar or James Rodriguez are much better? Are they genetically built better? Or is it just in their mind? ‘When Neymar or Rodriguez go out on the field they’re relaxed. They love to play, with their heart. Young English players are mentally polluted so they can’t express themselves. ‘England will always struggle at major tournaments until somebody comes in to change the whole  system. I played at every England youth level going and it was exactly the same.’ Bentley captained England U18s, was called up to play an England B match after a scintillating season in 2006-07 at Blackburn and was soon in the senior side. But his England period, when he won seven caps, was mired in controversy. Pedigree: Bentley appeared for the England senior team seven times during his career . In 2007, he was called up by Stuart Pearce for the U21 squad to play in the European Championship but pulled out, citing the need to rest. It went down dreadfully in England’s upper echelons and McClaren punished him by exclusion from a friendly against Germany. When he eventually made his senior debut against Israel, some England fans booed him. He laughs it off and adds: ‘It’s the control element in football that’s difficult to handle every day. These days it’s a business. It’s your job. I never saw it that way. ‘I’m so grateful for the game and what it gave me, especially financially, but I never wanted to play like that. ‘I’d coach my kids’ teams but I’d never go back to professional football. I don’t think it can be changed. It’s like politics now.’ People stop Bentley in the street and ask him why he’s packed it all in, given up the flow of riches, the dream. But, with a shrug, he responds: ‘I just tell them I’m happy.’ Interview courtesy of Impact Sports Management .","Former England winger announced his retirement at the end of last season .

"They went in search evidence of the world’s melting ice caps, but instead a team of climate scientists have been forced to abandon their mission … because the Antarctic ice is thicker than usual at this time of year. The scientists have been stuck aboard the stricken MV Akademik Schokalskiy since Christmas Day, with repeated sea rescue attempts being abandoned as icebreaking ships failed to reach them. Now that effort has been ditched, with experts admitting the ice is just too thick. Instead the crew have built an icy helipad, with plans afoot to rescue the 74-strong team by helicopter.

"The Affordable Care Act will push the equivalent of 2.3 million full-time workers out of the U.S. labor force by the year 2021, according to a stunning report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday. The office's latest estimates threaten to puncture the Obama administration's argument that Obamacare won't be a long-term job killer, since incentives built into the health care law appear to be discouraging taxpayers from working. 'CBO estimates that the ACA will reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 to 2 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024,' the CBO reported. Not just computer trouble: Obama, taking a picture of a student today, dispute the CB report on the effects of Obamacare on the job market released today . This, the office's analysts determined, will be 'almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor – given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive.' In 2001 the CBO estimated that the economy would lose the equivalent of 800,000 full-time jobs as the Affordable Care Act was implemented. The new numbers for 2021 represent a near-tripling of that estimate. 'The reduction in CBO's projections of hours worked represents a decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024,' the CBO report said. Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn lashed out at the White House after the CBO report was made public late on Tuesday morning. 'So in addition to people getting canceled policies or sticker shock and finding out that their health care costs didn’t go down, they went up, or finding that if you like your doctor, you can’t keep them,' Cornyn said on the Senate floor, 'what we’re finding is that these same people may find themselves out of work as a result of the policies of the Affordable Care Act.' 'The Congressional Budget Office looked primarily at how employers would respond to a new penalty for failing to offer insurance to employees that work more than 30 hours,' he said. 'That response would include cutting people’s hours, hiring fewer workers and lowering wages for new jobs.' Blow: The report said jittery employers would choose to hire fewer people ¿ a focus that a White House official told reporters was 'incomplete,' 'overwrought' and 'misinterpreted. It is another woe for Obama after the botched roll out of the internet sign up, above . Early reporting on the congressional bean-counters' pronouncement focused on job losses expected because jittery employers would choose to hire fewer people – a focus that a White House official told reporters was 'incomplete,' 'overwrought' and 'misinterpreted.' He said during a hastily assembled conference call Tuesday afternoon that the CBO report found that 'overall there's very little impact on labor demand' from Obamacare. A White House statement issued a half-hour earlier had insisted that 'CBO's findings are not driven by an assumption that ACA will lead employers to eliminate jobs or reduce hours, in fact, the report itself says that there is 'no compelling evidence that part-time employment has increased as a result of the ACA.' The official on the conference call emphasized that workers are exercising 'voluntary choices' brought on by 'a new set of options,' including the chance to retire earlier than they may have planned. He compared the shift of full-time to part-time labor to a hypothetical situation in which the federal government stopped paying social security benefits. 'I don't think there's any debate that if you got rid of Social Security and Medicare, more 95-year-olds would work,' the senior official said. Pressed to explain how increased unemployment could be seen as a net benefit of Obamacare, the official emphasized the availability of 'new choices and new options that will –' adding after an awkward pause, 'lead to different choices.' Critic: Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn lashed out at the added hardship forced on normal people who are already 'getting canceled policies or sticker shock and finding out that their health care costs didn¿t go down' White House Press Secretary Jay Carney also spun the news as a positive for workers who may 'no longer be trapped in a job just to provide coverage for their families, and would have the opportunity to pursue their dreams.' 'Over the longer run,' he said, 'CBO finds that because of this law, individuals will be empowered to make choices about their own lives and livelihoods, like retiring on time rather than working into their elderly years or choosing to spend more time with their families.' Americans for Prosperity, a conservative pressure group, was unimpressed. 'The Affordable Care Act is hurting Americans by leading to cancelled plans, lost coverage, and rising costs,' the group's president, Tim Phillips, said Tuesday in a statement, 'but it's also proving to be detrimental to economic growth, just as many of us predicted.' 'The CBO's numbers speak for themselves,' he said. 'The reality is, big government programs like Obamacare do not and cannot create lasting prosperity or opportunity for anyone.'","Nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says Obamacare will pull the .

"A girl aged nine has become the youngest victim of the NekNomination drinking craze. Rhiannon Scully was hospitalised after downing a cocktail of vodka and whisky, egged on by her friends who had seen similar stunts on Facebook. She was found riding home ‘all over the place’ on her electric scooter and still in her school uniform by her horrified mother, who picked her up and called  an ambulance. Rhiannon later had to have her stomach pumped and was monitored overnight in hospital. Scroll down for video . Stomach pumped: Rhiannon recovers in a hospital bed. Her parents released this picture to warn other families of the peril . Yesterday police confirmed they questioned both Rhiannon’s family and her friends’ families about the incident but decided no action was required. Rhiannon’s mother Michelle, 32, claimed the drinking dare was filmed on a mobile but deleted soon after. The alcohol was taken from a cupboard at her friend’s house without the knowledge of any parent. The primary school pupil from Leadgate, County Durham, is the youngest person linked to the deadly drinking game that has now become a global craze and sees people being filmed while performing bizarre challenges. Mrs Scully said she found her daughter with her ‘eyes rolling into the back of her head’ after the drinking dare. NekNomination: Rhiannon Scully's family says children must be taught about the dangers of alcohol in school . She said: ‘When I saw her I was raging, I was upset and angry. I was also scared because we didn’t know what would happen at this point. ‘I saw her in her uniform with two other friends. I ran to her, she was falling over and she didn’t know where she was. She could have been run over, she was riding her scooter at the time.’ The mother said she and her husband Paul, 39, believed Rhiannon had drunk vodka and whisky mixed together with orange juice after being encouraged by her two friends, also aged nine. The unemployed mother said the doctor calculated she had drunk around half a pint of the concoction. ‘Even a fully grown adult would hesitate to mix vodka and whisky,’ she said. ‘She was being sick in the bathroom before the paramedics got there. ‘We found out in the ambulance that it was a NekNomination. Rhiannon said “them stupid NekNominations”.’ She added: ‘I wouldn’t like to see this happen to any other child and I wouldn’t wish the feeling I felt as a parent on my worst enemy. ‘They need to teach children in schools the dangers of alcohol.’ Her husband Paul added: ‘Rhiannon was on a drip all night and had to have her stomach pumped.’ Medics alerted police to the incident last month and the family then received a visit from officers. The NekNominate craze is only thought to have started in January this year in Perth, Australia, but has quickly spread via social media. It is a drinking game in which people post videos of themselves on Facebook and other social media sites drinking dangerous and bizarre concoctions of alcohol and then dare their friends to outdo them. An early example of the trend was a woman who was filmed riding a horse into a supermarket before downing a can of Pepsi. But the videos have become increasingly dark with three deaths in Britain now linked to the craze. Last month, in the third death, Bradley Eames, 20, from Nottingham, was found dead after he filmed himself downing almost two pints of gin mixed with teabags. play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . play video . Ordeal: Rhiannon was on a drip all night and had to have her stomach pumped . Stephen Brookes, 29, of Cardiff, died after downing a pint of vodka while taking part in the deadly NekNominate craze. A few days previously, former grammar school pupil Isaac Richardson, 20, of London, died after telling a friend he wanted to ‘outdo other NekNominate participants before downing a lethal concoction of wine, whisky, vodka and lager. Durham Police said they were also investigating how a 12-year-old required accident and emergency treatment over three consecutive weekends for alcohol-related injuries. Their investigation came after police in Stanley, County Durham, seized a bottle of expensive gin, two bottles of schnapps, two bottles of sparkling wine and eight cans of cider from four 14-year-old girls. Sergeant David Clarke said: ‘Under-age drinking is a severe problem with younger children drinking through peer pressure. Not only did it damage their health, it put them at risk of sexual abuse. ‘There is a very strong link between alcohol and sexual predators. It could just be people who find them in such a state or people who supply them with alcohol in return for sexual favours. It is used as a commodity.’ Hospital staff said they tended to see more under-age drinking in young girls than in boys and expressed their concern at youngsters putting themselves in vulnerable situations.","Rhiannon Scully downed the spirits after friends saw similar dares online .

"Saving lives or playing God? By replacing DNA with a donor's, the technique can remove hereditary diseases. But detractors say it may lead to 'designer babies' The first baby with three parents could be born as early as 2015 after a landmark decision to move ahead on a controversial genetic treatment. Britain could become the first country to sanction the creation of babies with three genetic parents, despite fears it might lead to ‘designer babies’. The Government will publish draft regulations later this year that will bring techniques a step closer to giving women affected by devastating hereditary diseases the chance to have healthy children. The techniques involve replacing defective DNA in the mother’s egg with material from a donor egg. The resulting healthy child would effectively have two mothers and a father. For the first time the ‘germ line’ of inherited DNA from the mother would be altered which, critics say, marks a turning point in the ethics of test-tube babies. But the Government’s chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, said the alteration did not affect fundamental DNA that determines an individual’s make-up such as facial features and eye colour. She compared the new techniques to replacing a defective ‘battery pack’ in a cell that would virtually eliminate the chance of a severe disease in the child. She said: ‘Scientists have developed ground-breaking new procedures which could stop these diseases being passed on, bringing hope to many families seeking to prevent their future children inheriting them. ‘It’s only right that we look to introduce this life-saving treatment as soon as we can. ‘What we’re going to do now is start to develop the regulations, to consult on the regulations, and then to take them into Parliament.’ If MPs approve the regulations at the end of next year, the first patients could be assessed and approved for treatment in 2015. Scroll down for video . The resulting healthy child would effectively have two mothers and a father, although the Government says 'fundamental DNA' would not be affected. Stock picture . It is expected that between five and ten healthy babies with three parents could be born each year to couples who might otherwise face the heartbreak of seeing them severely disabled and often dying prematurely. In these cases, a healthy child would inherit the parents’ nuclear DNA, along with mitochondrial DNA from a donor. Dame Sally denied the UK was leading the way to designer babies. She said there was a ban on changing nuclear DNA which ‘I don’t see changing in the foreseeable future’. She said: ‘I do think quite carefully about ethics, I always did as a clinician and I still do, perhaps because my father was a theologian. 'I am comfortable with this. I think we will save some five to ten babies from being born with ghastly disease and early death without changing what they look like, or how they behave, and it will help mothers to have their own babies.’ If MPs approve the regulations at the end of next year, the first patients could be assessed and approved for treatment in 2015 . One in 6,500 babies is born seriously affected by a mitochondrial disorder which can lead to hearing and vision loss, heart, lung and liver problems, and bowel disorders. An estimated 12,000 people in the UK live with the diseases. The move to consult on regulations which would legalise the technique comes after a consultation requested by the Government and run by the fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which found there was ‘general support’ from the public. Many experts in the field support the techniques being actively developed at a new laboratory in Newcastle funded by the Wellcome Trust, as well as in the US. Draft regulations which would permit licensed IVF clinics to offer the treatments to women with a family history of severe mitochondrial disease will be published later this year. Josephine Quintavalle, from the group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, said the proposals were already causing worldwide concern. She said: ‘This controversial announcement – presented simply as innovative genetic treatment when it is in effect an endorsement of highly contentious germ line modification of the human embryo – is hardly unexpected, given the enthusiasm already shown by both the Nuffield Council (on Bioethics) and the HFEA. ‘Our focus now turns to Parliament, where we hope that the proposals to create three-parent embryos will be voted down.’ Dr David King, director of Human Genetic Alert, added: ‘These techniques are unnecessary and unsafe.’","Process involves replacing defective DNA with material from a donor egg .

"The presence of wind turbines  near homes has wiped tens of thousands of pounds off their value, according to the first major study into the impact the eyesore structures have on house prices. The study by the London School  of Economics (LSE) – which looked at more than a million sales of properties close to wind farm sites over a 12-year period – found that values of homes within 1.2  miles of large wind farms were being slashed by about 11 per cent. This means that if such a wind farm were near an average house  in Britain, which now costs almost £250,000, it would lose more than £27,000 in value. Homes located within 1.2miles of wind farms can decrease in value by up to 11 per cent, a study has discovered . In sought-after rural idylls where property prices are higher, the financial damage is even more substantial. In villages around one of Southern England’s largest onshore developments – Little Cheyne Court Wind Farm in Romney Marsh,  Kent, where homes can cost close to £1 million – house values could drop by more than £100,000. The study further discovered that even a small wind farm that blighted views would hit house values. Homes within half a mile of such visible turbines could be reduced in value by about seven per cent. Even those in a two-and-a-half-mile radius experienced price reductions of around three per cent. Homes within a two-and-a-half mile radius could see reductions of up to three per cent . The report’s author, Professor Steve . Gibbons, said his research was the first strong evidence that wind farms . are harmful to house prices. Green taxes are set to be frozen to reduce soaring energy bills. Whitehall sources say the Government is preparing to put the brakes on the ‘carbon tax’ on greenhouse-gas emissions, with an announcement expected in the Budget in March. Prime Minister David Cameron has reportedly instructed aides to ‘get rid of all this green c**p’ to reduce energy bills, which currently average £1,350 a year. Prof . Gibbons, director of the LSE’s Spatial Economics Research Centre, said: . ‘Property prices are going up in places where they’re not visible and . down in the places where they are.’ The study, which is still in draft form but is due to be published  next month, focused on 150 wind-farm sites across England and Wales. It compared house-price changes in areas that had wind farms, were about to see one built  or had seen one rejected by the  local authority. Last night Chris-Heaton Harris, MP for Daventry, said: ‘There’s plenty of anecdotal evidence – especially in my constituency – of house-price reductions near wind turbines. The question is, will anybody be liable for these losses in future?’ And Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the LSE, said: ‘These results are not really surprising as it is already known that people place a value on countryside views.’ A Department for Energy and Climate Change spokesman said: ‘Developments will only get permission where impacts are acceptable.’ A spokesman for Renewables UK, which represents the wind industry, said: ‘We will be analysing the conclusions closely when the final report is issued.’","Study by LSE found value of homes close to wind farms slashed by 11% .

"Jasmine Lapsley, six, choked to death on a grape after paramedics took at least 30 minutes to arrive at the house in North Wales . The parents of a six-year-old girl who choked to death on a grape have slammed ambulance services for taking 30 minutes to reach them. Jasmine Lapsley was playing cards  on a family holiday in Morfa Nefyn, North Wales, when she started choking on her food. Her parents Robert and Kathleen Lapsley dialled 999 immediately and tried to dislodge the grape - but claim they were left waiting for half an hour before paramedics arrived. Two community first responders reached the house after 16 minutes, but Jasmine's parents claim these volunteers were unable to help. Mrs Lapsley said: 'She was sitting down at the table, behaving and playing cards. She turned around and I could see that she was choking. 'I'd just given her the grapes and she was choking on a grape, I was in no doubt about what it was.' An RAF rescue helicopter, from Prince William's former HQ in Anglesey, flew her 20 miles to Bangor's Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital. When her parents arrived they were told their daughter still had a pulse - but their hopes were dashed when medics said there was no chance of survival. Mr Lapsley said: 'It took them half an hour to get an appropriate response there. 'The first responders were unable to help. It wouldn't have mattered if they had taken five minutes, 10 minutes or 25 minutes. Her parents Robert and Kathleen Lapsley dialled 999 immediately and tried to dislodge the grape - but claim they were left waiting for half an hour before paramedics arrived . 'It wasn't what she needed. She needed the paramedic - and it took them half an hour to get that paramedic to us.' Three months on, her parents say they're finding it very difficult to continue without Jasmine. Her mother said: 'When you open your eyes every morning, it's just there. This nightmare's just there. And we have to live with that now for the rest of our lives. 'She was always what we've wanted. She's not here any more.' Two community first responders arrived at the house in Morfa Nefyn after 16 minutes, but Jasmine's parents claim these volunteers were unable to help . An RAF rescue helicopter, from Prince William's former HQ in Anglesey, flew Jasmine the 20 miles to Bangor's Ysbyty Gwynedd Hospital when she died . Chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust Tracy Myhill said she had 'unreservedly apologised' to the Lapsleys for the trauma they had suffered. But the Lapsleys said they have had not heard from the trust or received an apology. A spokesperson for the Welsh Ambulance Trust said: 'We do not routinely make direct contact with bereaved families but will try to maintain lines of communications so when families are at a point where they wish to contact the Trust, we can and will act promptly. 'The Trust has reported this tragic incident to the Welsh Government as a Serious Adverse Incident. 'These reports require a comprehensive and detailed investigation, and the Trust endeavours to complete the investigation by mid to late November.' A full inquiry into the service is expected to be completed this month - and an inquest into Jasmine's death is expected to take place before the end of the year.","Jasmine Lapsley, six, started choking on her food during a family holiday .

"Labour is suffering from ‘squeaky bum time’ in the race to win the next election, a shadow cabinet minister has admitted. Sadiq Khan’s admission, using the phrase made famous by the former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, comes amid growing pressure on Ed Miliband’s leadership in the wake of a series of poor polls. It comes as Mr Miliband attempted to bolster his election war chest – by selling off bizarre eco-friendly shopping bags emblazoned with a ‘Vote Labour’ ceramic lion logo designed by the artist Grayson Perry. Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said it was 'squeaky bum time' for the party ahead of the next general election . In an email, party members are offered the chance to ‘donate £19 towards a Labour victory now, and you'll get your very own, special-edition Grayson Perry canvas bag/work of art’. Labour is facing being heavily outspent by the Tories in the election campaign and is relying on large donations from the unions to compete. The Tory Party’s financial muscle is adding to growing Labour concern that it is not far enough ahead in the polls to win a majority in May. Mr Khan said it was time for MPs concerned about Mr Miliband’s leadership to ‘get on the pitch and help us’ instead of ‘complaining from the sidelines’. Sir Alex Ferguson (right) infamously described the closing stages of the 1996 Premiership title race against Kevin Keegan's Newcastle as 'squeaky bum time' Artist Grayson Perry donated a ceramic lion to the Labour Party, which was sold for £42,000 at a fundraising event in July. Now the party has used the image of the lion on shopping bags to raise more cash . An image of a ceramic lion designed by Grayson Perry is emblazoned on shopping bags being sold by Labour . Cross-dressing artist Grayson Perry is a long-time supporter of the Labour Party. His £19 eco-friendly ‘Vote Labour’ shopping bag uses an image of a ceramic lion which he donated to the party in July. The ornament was sold for £42,000 at a star-studded Labour fundraising event attended by left-wing actors, artists and TV stars. Star Trek actor Patrick Stewart, Bianca Jagger and Stephen Fry attended the fundraising ‘gala’ dinner. At the gala, one bidder is understood to have pledged more than £105,000 for artist Antony Gormley's 'Small Turn III' - a 106cm pillar of blocks made of cast iron. Asked if he had seen evidence of unrest within Labour ranks, Mr Khan told the Guardian: ‘There's a great Alex Ferguson saying ... where in a season when Man United and Newcastle were neck-and-neck, he said it's squeaky bum time. And I think it's squeaky bum time for Labour.’ He added that in the past whenever Labour had lost an election, the party spends a lengthy period in opposition during which ‘we fight among ourselves and often spilt’. But he said: ‘What we're trying to do is something not done since 1974 - that's to be a one-term opposition and bounce back from the second worst result in our history. ‘Some of my colleagues need to recognise there's no rule of politics that means you bounce back like a pendulum. ‘You've got to have the humility to learn the right lessons, be proud of the things you got right and earn it. ‘We lost really badly and people forget that. But we're competitive again, and we've a great set of candidates and policies. Politics is a team sport. It's really easy to blame the leader. ‘We've all got a role to play ... rather than people complaining on the sidelines, they should get on the pitch and help us win the election.’ Mr Khan claimed some of his colleagues had failed to ‘understand the rhythm of opposition’ in the new fixed-term parliament era, while the leadership was working backwards from the May 7 election date with a plan to win. Acknowledging the threat of division to Labour's chances, he appealed for calm to make sure the party did not ‘wake up on May 8 saying “if only we'd been more united, if only we'd been more disciplined”’. A ComRes poll for the Sunday Mirror and Independent on Sunday put the party on 34 per cent, four points ahead of the Tories. But only 20 per cent of those surveyed said they could imagine Mr Miliband as prime minister, a fall from 25 per cent a year ago.","Sadiq Khan’s admission comes amid mounting pressure on Ed Miliband .

"When a group of nine students got stuck in a lift at university, there was only one thing they could do. And Aerosmith's I Don't Want to Miss A Thing was the answer.

"Police are hunting for a missing beauty queen due to fly to London later this week for Miss World 2014. Reigning Miss Honduras Maria Jose Alvarado, 19, vanished with her sister Sofia  after a friend's birthday party in their home town of Santa Barbara, last Thursday. Police have said the girls' disappearance is not being treated as a crime, but today it emerged four people, including her sister's boyfriend have been arrested. Scroll down for video . Miss Honduras Maria Jose Alvarado, 19, was last seen getting into a vehicle after a birthday party in her home town of Santa Barbara, west Honduras . The missing women were last seen getting into a vehicle as they left the party. Police chief Jose Coello originally said they were not treating the pair's disappearance as a crime, but confirmed the four arrests. 'Four people are under arrest. They include the owner of the party venue and Sofia Trinidad's boyfriend. They are being investigated,' Mr Coello said. The case has caused consternation in the notoriously violent central American country, home to the most dangerous city on the planet. San Pedro Sula, just over 30 miles from Santa Barbara, is the murder capital of the world with more than 1,200 killings a year among its nearly one million inhabitants. Its murder rate of 169 per 100,000 people far surpasses anything in north America or much larger cities like Lagos or Sao Paulo. Missing beauty: Miss Alvarado was due to fly to London this week, to compete in Miss World on Thursday . Four people have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of Miss Alvarado and her sister Sofia (pictured left), including Sofia's boyfriend . Maria Jose describes herself on a Miss World website profile as an aspiring diplomat who enjoys playing volleyball and football in her spare time. The Honduran city of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, tops the list of the world's most violent places on earth. At least three murders are reported each day in the coffee-exporting nation, mostly at the hands of vicious gangs and drug cartels who operate freely in an area of lawlessness, poverty and a decaying justice system. Gunmen have taken control of slums and villages, well aware that the police are ineffective and corrupt. San Pedro Sula recorded 1,218 homicides in 2012 (a rate of 3.3 murders a day). It was followed by Acapulco, Mexico; Caracas, Venezuela and Distrito Central, Honduras. The same year, it was reported that San Pedro Sula is saddled with one of South America's weakest economies - and nearly 70 per cent of the population live in poverty. She beat 18 contestants to win the Miss Honduras crown in April. She missed an appointment yesterday evening/on Sunday evening to try on the dress she hopes to win Miss World with. The women's mum Teresa de Jesus pleaded last night: 'Open your hearts and understand my pain. 'There is an all-powerful God that sees everything and I hope you set them free.' Miss World is due to kick off on Thursday, with 120 contestants competing for the crown. The grand finale takes place on December 14 at ExCel London in the heart of the capital's Royal Docks area. Swiss-born medical student Carina Tyrrell, 24, a qualified ski instructor and competition level gymnast, is representing England.

"U.S. President Barack Obama's request to have roundabouts demolished to make way for The Beast may have seemed outrageous but now the demands of Russian President Vladimir Putin may have put that request to shame. During his whirlwind stay at Brisbane's Hilton hotel for the G20 Summit, Mr Putin had his food tested before he ate it just in case it was poisoned and was often flanked by a mob of security officers. An unnamed employee of the hotel in the city's CBD has lifted the lid on the tight security measures and the demands of one of its most powerful guests. Russian President Vladimir Putin had his food tested before he ate it just in case it was poisoned during his G20 stay at the Hilton hotel . The worker told news.com.au the hotel usually had to step up its game 'a heck of a lot' to meet the standards required by a high-profile guest, which included musicians and athletes. The hotel, which is located across the river from the South Bank location of the Brisbane Convention Centre where most of the talks were held, also had guests from Mexico and Mauritania during the two-day summit. But it was the Russian strongman's entourage that took up 75 per cent of the rooms in the hotel. Like other countries' leaders, Mr Putin had travelled to Brisbane with his own bodyguards and had added protection with 'undercover' police officers patrolling not only the outside of the hotel but staying inside as well. The Russian leader's entourage that took up 75 per cent of the rooms in the hotel located in Brisbane's CBD . Added security included police officers patrolling the hotel outside as well as staying inside it . The employee said it was all hands on deck 24 hours a day during the weekend, including the kitchen which was responsible for cooking up food for Mr Putin and members of his delegation who opted to dine-in. This was the case with most leaders unless they had official engagements to attend. 'We prepared it in our kitchen and it was taken up to him [Mr Putin] in the restaurant or wherever he was dining and it was tasted by someone first to ensure that it wasn't poisoned or anything along those lines and then it was plated up and served,' he said. The employee also put an end to speculation as to why Mr Putin had left the summit earlier than expected, saying his Sunday afternoon departure had always been planned. Mr Putin's demands emerged after it was revealed U.S. President Barack Obama's entourage requested a roundabout to be removed to make way for The Beast (pictured) But Mr Putin's demands are not the first outrageous ones to emerge. Leading up to the summit, which ran from Saturday to Sunday, it was revealed Barack Obama's delegation made a request to have a major roundabout in Brisbane demolished. The roundabout is located near the University of Queensland - in the city's western suburbs - where Mr Obama gave an address to a packed room. The reason given for the request was so his enormous presidential car, known as The Beast, did not have to slow down but it was rejected by Queensland authorities, The Australian reported.","An employee of the Hilton Hotel has spoken about serving Vladimir Putin .

"A Japanese man has been sentenced to two years in prison for creating deadly firearms with a three dimensional printer. Yoshitomo Imura, 28, was found guilty of violating laws that restrict the production of weapons, as well as the possession of dangerous weapons by the Yokohama District Court . The former employee of the Shonan Instiutute of Technology is believed to be the first person to serve jail time for printing 3D guns, which are a growing concern for police around the world. Yoshitomo Imura, 28, has been sentenced to two years in prison for producing two firearms in 2013 . Seized plastic guns produced by Imura are displayed at a police station in Yokohama in May . Imura produced two firearms between September and December 2013. He also released 3D design data for his guns on the internet, which the ruling Judge Koji Inaba described as 'vicious,' reports The Japan News. He added that he had 'flaunted his skills and knowledge and attempted to make gun controls toothless.' Imura was arrested in May after police searched his home. They were alerted when he posted blueprints of the weapons online with the accompanying message: 'The right to bear firearms is a basic human right.' Imura purchased the 3D printer for about ¥60,000 ($636.09) online. In March 2013, American firearm company Defense Distributed was granted a U.S. federal firearm license to sell and manufacture 3D printed guns. They soon released the blueprint for their 'liberator', a single-shot gun, which was downloaded 100,000 times in the two two days before the US Department of State demanded they retract the plans. Since then, the blueprints have flooded the file sharing Darknet , where they are distributed to people with 3D printers and the assembled guns are sold. Since then, many more gun model plans have been published and distributed across the internet. Imura produced two firearms between September and December 2013. He also released 3D design data for his guns on the internet, which the ruling Judge Koji Inaba described as 'vicious' Yokohama District Court, where Imuru was sentenced on Monday in what is believed to be the first prison sentence ever given forprinting 3D guns .

"Statins: The inexpensive drug is taken by more than 7million Britons a year . Cholesterol-lowering statin drugs do not appear to help prevent blood clots, according to an extensive new study. Researchers from Oxford University led a team that looked at 29 published and unpublished trials involving over 100,000 people. They found venous thrombosis (a blood clot formed in a vein) occurred in 0.9 . per cent of people taking statins compared to one per cent of people who were . not taking the drugs. There was no difference between those who took . higher or lower doses of statins. The study, published in the open-access journal PLoS Medicine, said: 'We were unable to confirm the large proportional reduction in (clot) risk.' However, it added that 'a more modest but perhaps clinically worthwhile' effect could not be ruled out. In 2009, a trial called JUPITER found that so-called rosuvastatin -- marketed as Crestor -- halved the risk of blood clots among apparently healthy adults, a finding that boosted suggestions the drug should be taken preventively. But the figures to support this finding were relatively small. The 2009 study randomly assigned 17,800 people to take Crestor or dummy pills. After two years of followup, 34 in the statin group and 60 in the placebo group developed a venous thrombo-embolism, a clot which can form in the legs and travel to the lungs. The latest study, led by Kasem Rahimi, found no such effect. Commenting on the findings, British Heart Foundation medical director, Professor Peter Weissberg, said: 'It has long been thought that statins may have additional health benefits on top of their proven ability to reduce heart attacks and strokes. 'An earlier study suggested that one statin, rosuvastatin, might reduce the risk of blood clots in deep veins and lungs, known as venous thromboembolism. 'However, findings in single studies can sometimes happen by chance. By pooling a large amount of data on several different types of statin, this analysis shows that any significant protection against blood clots is highly unlikely.' Statins are taken by up to seven million Britons to combat high cholesterol. They work by blocking the action of key enzymes in the liver, which synthesizes the fat-like substance. Just last week, scientists at the University of Rochester Medical Center discovered new genetic evidence inking cholesterol and cancer. The find means patients could one day be given statins to protect against developing cancer and to treat potential tumours. The drugs cost as little as 40p a day. Maureen Talbot, Senior . Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'Statins are now a . very important part of the lives of millions of people and play a vital . role in both lowering cholesterol and helping prevent heart attacks. 'Their importance shouldn’t be . underestimated and the potential risk of side effects are outweighed by . the proven benefits. The use of statins is the main reason why fewer . people have high cholesterol levels now compared to 20 years ago.'","2009 study suggested daily statin could reduce leg blood clots that can travel to the lungs, but latest review found no such link .

"A charity fundraiser claims she was sacked from her job raising money for Guide Dogs because she has a genetic disorder which affects her vision. Zoe Goodman got a job at Ethicall call centre in Bristol fundraising for the charity by doing telesales. But after the teenager asked for software that would magnify her computer screen so she could see it properly because of her sight problems, she was told this was not available and not to come back. 'I felt shocked, I felt bullied and I felt patronised,' said the 19-year-old. Zoe Goodman, 19, claims she was sacked from her job at Ethicall in Bristol, where she was raising money for Guide Dogs through telesales, because she is visually impaired and asked for specific equipment to help her . 'I was being fired from a Guide Dogs campaign for being visually impaired. 'If I didn't have a visual impairment I would still have my job fundraising for the blind.' Miss Goodman, 19, even asked Guide Dogs for support but claims she was initially told there was nothing they could do to help her. The teenager has Stargardt's disease, a genetic disorder which can lead to total blindness. Symptoms often start with blind spots, wavy vision and the eyes poorly adapting to dim lighting. Miss Goodman started working at Ethicall through Red Recruitment in Bristol, beating her targets to raise £150 in her first morning on the job. But she began to struggle to read the membership information on the computer screen and needed a mouse with a magnifier. Ethicall and Red Recruitment Agency, which dispatched Miss Goodman to the call centre, are investigating . 'This was being arranged and I was above target in my first calling session,' she added. 'Unfortunately the technology was not sorted out.' Red Recruitment then told her not attend work and, four missed shifts later, she received a phone call telling her she was being 'let go' as the technology was incompatible with the software. When Miss Goodman contacted Guide Dogs for some support in her case she was told there was nothing they could do at first. Guide Dogs says it is investigating the incident . Furious, she then posted on the charity's Facebook page. 'You cannot hide discrimination under the carpet,' wrote Miss Goodman. 'There should be a zero tolerance policy. 'I am absolutely disgusted with Guide Dogs and their lack of integrity. 'I will not keep quiet about this disgraceful behaviour and would appreciate a public apology for being refused support.' Guide Dogs said it would be investigating. A spokeswoman said: 'We take any complaint about our suppliers seriously and have robust systems in place to deal with these.

"The U.S military has sent in Special Ops forces to speed up the training of Iraqi troops to fight ISIS. The operation is crucial to the military's campaign against Islamic States militants, who released a video showing the murder of aid worker Peter Kassig yesterday. Speaking at the Army's National Training Center at Fort Irwin in California yesterday, Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Pentagon has decided to accelerate its mission using troops already in Iraq - while funding is sought for a broader initiative. He said . special operations forces had moved into the country's Anbar province . in recent days to begin work on the training effort. U.S. Defense Secretary said the military has sent in Special Ops forces into the Anbar province to speed up the training of Iraqi troops to fight Islamic State . Mr Hagel spoke to members of 3rd Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, at the National Training Center in Fort Irwin, California yesterday . Mr Hagel said Army General Lloyd Austin, the head of U.S.forces in the region, had recommended American troops start the training with some of the 1,600 personnel already in the country to advise the Iraqi military. He said: 'We agreed with General Austin's recommendations to take . some of the special operations forces that he has in Iraq and . give them some early missions with the Iraqi security forces in . Anbar province just to kind of continue the mission, accelerate . the mission. 'So yes, we're doing what we can with the resources we have . to give some acceleration to that.' Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, confirmed about 50 special operations troops were at Ain al-Asad air . base working to set up the training mission. The base was home . to a major U.S. military presence during the Iraq war. The announcement comes after President Obama said last week the number of U.S troops would be roughly doubled. The acceleration of the operation, which is crucial to the military's campaign against Islamic State, came as the terror group released a video showing the murder of aid worker Peter Kassig yesterday . United States Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel pictured arriving at Fort Irwin National Training Center . The decision meant adding 1,500 military personnel to establish sites to train nine . Iraqi brigades and set up two more centers to advise military . commands. The President also sought $5.6 billion in funding from Congress for . the initiative, including $1.6 billion to train and equip Iraqi . forces. Officials initially said the funding would have to be . approved by Congress before the new effort could begin. However, it was reported on Saturday that the U.S. military . already had a team of troops at Ain al-Asad working on the . mission. About a dozen countries had made verbal . commitments to help the training effort and officials hoped that . U.S. forces starting the mission would encourage foreign . partners to move ahead as well.

"A Christian couple who refused to let a gay couple stay in a double bedroom at their B&B guesthouse, have been forced to sell up after losing a lengthy court battle. Hazelmary and Peter Bull, who run Chymorvah Hotel at Marazion, Cornwall, have also faced death threats over their decision to refuse a room to gay couple Martyn Hall and Steven Preddy in 2008. Now they say they have no option but to sell their beloved home and business after failing to attract enough custom and paying their legal costs after high profile court cases over the issue. No way forward: Hazelmary and Peter Bull say they can't face another winter like last year when they went 'cold and hungry' because of money worries . Strong beliefs: Despite all the trouble Mrs Bull still defends her right to stick to her principles about whether unmarried couples should be allowed to share rooms . Threatened: Peter and Hazelmary Bull say they have suffered a campaign of abuse over their policy on gay couples . The Chymorvah, which allows only married . couples to share a bed, also lost its listing with hotel database Visit England because of its stance against the 2007 Equalities Act. And despite a good summer of sunshine . they were not even half full and believe they were the only hotel in the . county ‘that had rooms left.’ The couple claim they have received death threats, vandalism and had their website corrupted with pornography. They claim they have had the bolts . removed from the wheels of their car and most recently found a dead . rabbit nailed to their fence all over the issue of who they allow to stay in their guesthouse. In 2011 the couple were ordered to . pay £3,600 to civil partners Mr Hall and Mr Preddy after they were . refused a room at the the grade II listed hotel on religious grounds. The . landmark legal case heard at Bristol County Court polarised opinions . and effectively sealed the supremacy of gay rights over Christian belief . under the Sexual Orientation Regulations introduced in 2007. Empty: Despite its beautiful setting and great summer weather the Chymorvah Hotel in Cornwall was still only half full . Chymorvah House: The nine-bedroom grade II listed building is hoped to sell for around £750,000 the decision has left the Bulls feeling like there has been 'a death in the family' Steven Preddy (left) and Martin Hall outside Bristol County Court in 2011 after a judge ruled that Peter and Hazelmary Bull acted unlawfully when they refused them a double room on religious grounds . The laws prevent discrimination against homosexuals by businesses and state organisations, but have had the knock-on effect of requiring Christians who run small concerns to set their principles and beliefs aside if they wish to stay in business. Judge Andrew Rutherford also broke new ground by insisting that in the eyes of the law there is no difference between a civil partnership and a marriage and that as such the Bull's reason for denying civil partners a room was invalid. Outside court, Mrs Bull said the verdict had serious implications for the religious liberty of Christians had that they felt pushed to the margins of society, and added: ‘Some people are more equal than others.' They say they have been forced into selling their nine bed hotel for £750,000 because last winter they 'were actually shivering and were hungry’. But Mrs Bull fears they will be forced to accept much less for it, because their lack of visitors has left them on the brink of bankruptcy. She said: 'We were optimistic in the spring. Why wouldn’t we be with the summer ahead of us? 'We have had a better summer than we thought but nowhere near good enough to pay our way. 'We were not even half-full. We must have been the only place in west Cornwall that had rooms left.' Mounting . bills and political pressure has left the Bulls feeling their belief . system as well as their business has been demolished. Mrs Bull added: 'It was a gradual process; we just noticed more and more that we couldn’t make the mortgage repayments. 'Last winter was terrible, we were actually shivering and were hungry we are coming towards next winter and dreading it. 'In 2013, two people who worked all their lives at this have ended up cold and hungry. It’s not right.' 'This is like a death in the family. I never thought it would end like this. 'We are not facing the future with any real enthusiasm.' Victimised: The couple say have had their website corrupted with pornography and even found a dead rabbit nailed to their fence . 'Deep regard' for marriage: Peter and Hazelmary cut the cake on their wedding day on December 19 1964 . Mr and Mrs Bull have operated their 'married only' policy since they bought the Chymorvah Private Hotel in Marazion near Penzance, Cornwall, in 1986. Their hotel website says: ‘We have few rules but please note that out of a deep regard for marriage we prefer to let double accommodation to heterosexual married couples only.’ Such rules are so strictly adhered to that Mrs Bull has admitted that even her own brother, when he comes to stay, is required to stay in a separate room to his female partner.' In August 2008, the Bulls received a letter from Stonewall, the gay rights organisation, saying it had received a complaint and warning the hotel it was breaking the law. The following month Mr Preddy, from Bristol, rang to book a double room for two nights, but did not mention he was part of a homosexual couple. Mrs Bull, who took the call, said that she had wrongly assumed he would be staying with his wife before she accepted the booking. When Mr Preddy and Mr Hall arrived, they . were told by the manager, Bernie Quinn, that the hotel could not honour . the booking and could offer them only separate single rooms. End of the road: Mr and Mrs Bull fear they may have to accept much less than the £750,000 asking price because the court battle and falling visitor numbers have pushed them to the brink of bankruptcy . The chronology of events led to Mr and Mrs Bull fearing that they had become the victims of a sting operation by gay rights activists however in court a judge said there was no evidence to prove this. The controversy goes on and earlier this year the couple won the right to take their appeal to the Supreme Court next month after the case was dismissed by the Court of Appeal. But some critics have pointed to a problem with the service itself as the reason behind the collapse of the Chymorvah rather than political views of the owners. The B&B has been savaged by reviewers on cult travel website TripAdvisor for being 'shabby', 'not particularly clean' and welcoming. One user wrote: 'Looks good on the website, but extremely disappointment.'I am Christian but that's not the reason I went there. But I felt the place had a terrible atmosphere. 'I am vegetarian and there was a very limited menu. I felt like I committed a crime when I mentioned I was vegetarian. Not happy: Hazelmary Bull in one of the guest bedrooms that online reviewers panned as 'cramped', 'shabby' and 'damp' 'The look I received from woman could kill you. 'The room was cramped, not particularly clean and smelled strange, it was also cold and damp. 'I really don't like the thought of religion being forced down my throat whilst on holiday/taking a short break. I wanted to enjoy my time but I felt like I was a burden to this hotel not a guest. 'It's a real shame because it could be a lot better if the rooms were cleaner/up to date and fresh and the people running the hotel more hospitable.' Echoing similar concerns another reviewer wrote: 'Had a most disappointing three day stay here and could not wait to get out everywhere is so old and dated and really shabby. 'It throws religion in your face, which you don't need when stopping at a hotel. 'The breakfast is of very poor quality, which just about sums up the rest of the hotel. Poor!'","Hazelmary and Peter Bull have put the Chymorvah Hotel in Marazion, Cornwall on the market for £750,000 .

"A young married mother has taken her own life after struggling for years to come to terms with the death of her beloved war veteran father in a car crash. Maxine Zamora, 22, died after shooting herself in the head at her Texas home on October 14, investigators said. Ms Zamora survived in 2007 when a distracted driver plowed into the car she was traveling in with her father Javier Zamora. The Iraq war veteran, 40, died en route to the hospital after suffering massive head wounds during the collision in California. Maxine Zamora, 22, pictured with her baby daughter, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, seven years after she survived a car crash which killed her father . Seven years after losing her veteran father, Javier Zamora, in a car crash in California, his daughter Maxine (pictured) committed suicide last month after never recovering emotionally from the trauma . The crash happened after a female driver took her eyes off the road as she tried to pick up her cell phone which had slid under a seat. The sedan driver slammed into the Zamoras' SUV in August 2007 as the father and daughter, then 15, returned from a back-to-school shopping trip. Sgt Zamora, an Army helicopter gunner, had returned to his family only a few months before following a deployment to Iraq. He was finishing up work commitments and had stayed on with his daughter in California before moving to Texas to join his wife Jennifer, also a military veteran, their two other children and a stepdaughter. He was buried with full honors at The Los Angeles National Cemetery. The young mom is pictured with her baby daughter at her father's grave. The 22-year-old had struggled for years to come to terms with her father's death . Ms Zamora, who was married and had a two-year-old daughter, had a tattoo on her back dedicated to her father along with an inking of his military dogtags . Jennifer Zamora-Jamison lost her husband Javier in a distracted driving crash. Seven years later, her 22-year-old daughter Maxine, who survived the crash, took her own life . The Army veteran's driving seat was severed, pushing his head into a space between the door and the roof, the Star-Telegram reported. Rescuers had to cut him from barbed wire along the side of the road. For years, Maxine told her mother Jennifer that she could not remember the accident until one day her mom found her diary, the pages filled with the pain and grief over what she had seen. The young mom also had a full back tattoo dedicated to her father completed with an inking of his dog tags. The tattoo read: 'My heart still aches in sadness, and secret tears still flow/What it meant to lose you, no one will ever know.' Maxine's devastated mother Jennifer Zamora-Jamison told Star-Telegram: 'Maxine struggled through high school and through her marriage and even through her ''mommyhood'' with the loss of not having her daddy there.' Maxine, who escaped the accident unharmed, moved to Texas where she worked as an exotic dancer in Fort Worth. She later married Craig Polizzo and had a baby, Faith Marie, who is now two years old. Mrs Zamora-Jamison, who has since remarried, said that her daughter campaigned to stop others suffering from tragedies on the road as she had. The grieving mother said: '[H]aving to witness people every day on the roadways doing the same thing that took her father’s life. … I think it was too much for her.' Sgt Zamora, pictured with his family on his return from a military deployment in Iraq, was killed a few months later by a distracted driver in California . Last month, 22-year-old Maxine, had a fight with her husband at their Fort Worth home, went into another room and put a gun to her head, according to authorities. She was pronounced dead but her organs were able to be donated for transplant. The cause of death has yet to be officially confirmed pending routine toxicology tests. According to campaign group, Stopdistractions.org, Texas has not banned texting at the wheel along with Arizona, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana and Oklahoma. Governor Rick Perry threw out a statewide ban on texting while driving, calling it was 'government micromanagement'. Governor-elect Greg Abbott is also against banning texting while driving . Sgt Zamora (left) died en route to the hospital after suffering massive head trauma during the collision in California. His daughter Maxine (right with her mother Jennifer) survived the crash and went on to campaign for victims of distracted driving .","Maxine Zamora had survived after a distracted driver plowed into the car she was traveling in with her father Javier Zamora in 2007 .

"Retail giant Toys R Us has agreed to drop sexist marketing and gender stereotyping of its products to girls and boys. The toy store has bowed to pressure from campaign group Let Toys Be Toys, who represent . thousands of shoppers concerned with sexism in the toy industry and the impact it's having on children. After meeting with campaigners, the chain have said they will now ensure their marketing is more inclusive, as well as removing explicit references to gender in store. Inclusive: Toys R Us have vowed to drop sexist labelling on girls' and boys' toys after pressure from campaign group Let Toys Be Toys . The toy giant's adverts will show boys and girls playing with the same toys, such as kitchens, toy guns and Lego, and they have promised to review the way toys are represented in their upcoming Christmas catalogue. Some headway was made last year when the Swedish branch unveiled a gender neutral advertising campaign showing girls shooting a toy gun and boys and girls playing together in a kitchen in response to complaints in Sweden. Managing Director Roger McLaughlan said they will take further steps after meeting with representatives from Let Toys Be Toys. 'We very much enjoyed meeting Let Toys Be Toys. We will work with the Let Toys Be Toys team to ensure we develop the best plan for our customers,' he said. Making changes: The toy giant's adverts will show boys and girls playing with the same toys, such as kitchens, toy guns and Lego (file photo) Megan Perryman, a Let Toys Be Toys . campaigner, said: 'We’re delighted to be working so closely with a major . toy retailer and believe that there is much common ground here. 'Even in 2013, boys and girls are still . growing up being told that certain toys are ""for"" them, while others are . not. This is not only confusing but extremely limiting, as it strongly . shapes their ideas about who they are and who they can go on to become.' Let Toys Be Toys states on their website that the changes promised by Toys R Us follow in the footsteps of similar commitments they have had from several other major retailers including Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Boots, The Entertainer and TK Maxx. Freedom of choice: Toys R Us say they won't specify products as 'for boys' and 'for girls' All have agreed to banish 'girls' and 'boys' signs from their aisles following intervention from campaigners. Harrods also launched its iconic toy collection last summer based on theme rather than gender. As previously reported in MailOnline, Let Toys Be Toys was set up by a group of . British parents last November, calling for a change in the way toys are marketed to boys and girls. They had noticed girls were increasingly being encouraged to play with dolls, prams and kitchens - all inevitably in pink colours - while toys deems to be for boys were cars, guns and sports-related. In the pink: It's display like this one aimed at girls encouraging them just to play with dolls and dress up as princesses that led the campaigners to take action . One of the campaign's founders, Tricia . Lowther, 44, a self-employed copywriter from Durham, who has a five-year-old daughter, told the . MailOnline in June: 'It does bother a lot of parents, we seem to have tapped in . to a huge and growing sense of frustration with the way toys are . promoted according to outdated, illogical and sexist stereotypes. 'I . can't speak for any of the others but what pushed me to make a stand was . the realisation, after my daughter was born, that gender stereotyping . in children's products had become worse than when I was a child myself . back in the Seventies. It's something that has become almost impossible . to escape and is very limiting for children.' More than 7,500 people have signed the Let Toys Be Toys petition so far on change.org, asking retailers in the UK and Ireland to remove gender labels, and organise toys by theme and function instead of by gender.","The toy store bows to pressure from campaigners Let Toys Be Toys .

"A letter which was written by a Stanford School of Business graduate and handed down to first-year students as a frank survival guide for 25 years has been unearthed. The candid six-page confessional was written at some point during the late 80s by Shirzad Bozorgchami - now a California-based author and CEO - and offers MBA students the sort of sage advice that is applicable to many walks of life. 'You don’t need to be in a study group, you don’t need to turn in every homework, you don’t have to appear bubbly and social all the time,' the letter states. 'You don’t have to interview with investment banks and consultants, you don’t need to be conservative and safe in class discussions.' Gone public: The candid six-page letter (pictured) was written during the late 80s by Shirzad Bozorgchami - now a Californian-based author and CEO - as a source of advice to new students at the Stanford GSB . Mr Bozorgchami, who grew up in a turbulent, emotionally abusive home in Iran and was highly intimidated when he first joined the esteemed Stanford GSB, penned the letter to reassure and encourage his fellow students. 'This note reflects my personal thoughts, feelings and suggestions for a more fulfilling GSB life,' he wrote. Top of the list was Mr Bozorgchami's suggestion to embrace moderation when it came to studying. 'I could never understand why some people would spend hours on putting the finishing touches on a report, when the act involved very little additional learning. Decades later: Mr Bozorgchami (pictured today) was highly intimidated when he first joined the esteemed Stanford GSB in California . 'Neurotic perfectionism at its worst,' he wrote, adding that the sooner this habit is broken 'the happier you'll be.' He also advised that rather than 'carefully reading an article,' students would do better to 'skim-read' three of them, and socialize a little with the time saved pouring over books. 'You often only need to know about half the material covered,' he revealed. 'If you work hard because... you are . afraid of not passing, because an ugly monster in your nightmares keeps . reminding you that the world will come to an end if you don't pass, you . can easily resent the experience and find it painful.' The . illuminating letter also placed a strong emphasis on getting to know . classmates, avoiding the harsh judgement of others, and generally being a . pleasant human being; which Mr  Bozorgchami points out is far more . likely to lead to later success than getting the best grades. 'By . actively judging people positively, you are exposing yourself to being . hurt a little by a jerk,' he conceded. 'But that is a small price to pay . to get to know many more wonderful people that you wouldn't otherwise . take the chance on. 'We really are a bunch of very nice people here, only most of us are afraid to show it openly.' Elite: The letter unwittingly became something of a manifesto, and is allegedly still in circulation among new students at Stanford GSB (pictured) and other schools around the country . Following the letter, Mr Bozorgchami has since claimed he received an unexpected flood of thank-you responses from students who were helped or comforted by his words. It thus unwittingly became something of a manifesto, and is allegedly still in circulation among new students at Stanford GSB, and other schools around the country. Four years after he first wrote the letter, Mr Bozorgchami followed it up with an epilogue, stating: 'I am deeply moved that this letter has become a traditional gift from the second year class to the first years in the weekend before midterms.' Written in 1991, it included lessons he had further learned since leaving GSB - 'a very unusual place, with extremely high standards' - and joined the real business world. 'You often only need to know about half the material covered' 'No one has once asked me about my grades since graduation,' he wrote. 'The more lasting impact of the GSB for me... has been the soft rather than hard skills of management and the resulting relationships.'

"Lawsuits filed today against Harvard University in Massachusetts and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill argue that affirmative action policies should be banned at colleges across the nation. The federal suits allege Harvard and UNC rely on race-based affirmative action policies that impact admissions of high-achieving white and Asian American students. The Harvard lawsuit also contends that the Ivy League university specifically limits the number of Asian Americans it admits each year. A lawsuit has been filed against Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts (pictured) The Project on Fair Representation, a Washington D.C.-based legal defense fund, promise Monday's federal court filings will be the first in a series of legal challenges against colleges across the country as it seeks to end affirmative action policies outright. 'Allowing this issue to be litigated in case after case will only perpetuate the hostilities that proper consideration of race is designed to avoid,' the lawsuits state. 'Racial preferences are a dangerous tool and may only be used as a last resort. There is now overwhelming evidence that race-neutral alternatives render reliance on racial preferences unnecessary.' Harvard and UNC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The lawsuits suggest 'race neutral' policies imposed at some competitive schools — such as giving greater consideration to a prospective student's socio-economic background and boosting financial aid and scholarships — can promote diversity better than affirmative action. Elite schools should also stop giving preference to so-called 'legacy' students and offering early admission deadlines, both of which tend to hurt low income and minority applicants and favor wealthy and white ones, the lawsuits says. The lawsuit against Harvard says the acceptance rate for 'legacy' applicants whose family members are alumnus is about 30 percent -- 'roughly five times the rate other applicants are admitted.' The lawsuit against UNC notes the state's flagship public university has acknowledged in previous court filings that such 'race-neutral' policy changes could be more effective than its current race-based affirmative action policies. The Project on Fair Representation filed the lawsuits in federal district courts in Boston and Greensboro, North Carolina. The plaintiff in both lawsuits is the Students for Fair Admissions, a recently formed nonprofit group whose members include 'high achieving' students recently denied admission to both schools as well as 'high achieving' students who plan to apply to both schools, and their parents.","Lawsuits argue that affirmative action policies should be banned in U.S.

"A reformed boozer who spent nine months partying in Magaluf has shed more than stone after ditching her ladette lifestyle to become a fitness fanatic. Emma Harvey worked as a promo girl in Majorca's party capital, eating nothing but junk food and downing some 300 alcoholic drinks every single week over the course of two summers. The 23-year-old, from Bromley, London, weighed 15st 4lb when she decided to battle her bulging waistline. Emma Harvey piled on the pounds after travelling to Magaluf to work as a promo girl, she was drinking three hundred alcoholic drinks a week (left) and gorging on takeaways but has since lost six stone (right) Emma lost the weight by cutting down her fatty diet and hitting the gym, training five times a week . Emma became so ashamed of her size 22 body that she began cutting the labels out of her clothes and spent her nights scoffing pizza on the sofa. Eventually, when tying her own shoe laces left her breathless, Emma decided to give up her boozy, junk-fuelled lifestyle and went on a diet. Now weighing 9st 2lb and a size 6 to 8, Emma has become a self-confessed fitness addict, swapping greasy takeaways for lean steaks and daily gym sessions. She's even managed to bag herself a personal trainer boyfriend, Leon Hodge, 34, who she met on a night out. Emma says she was spurred on to the lose the weight after she discovered that she was too fat to tie her own shoelaces (pictured left before changing her lifestyle, and right, after) Emma met her boyfriend Leon Hodge who is a personal trainer on a night out, she says he couldn't believe what she used to look like when she showed him pictures of her former self . The accountant said: 'During those two summers in Magaluf I was eating absolute rubbish and doing no exercise whatsoever. 'I would wake up at 2pm and have a kebab for breakfast with a shot of tequila. 'The alcohol there is practically free and I was drinking at least 10 glasses of vodka and lemonade and 12 shots of Sambuca a night. I don't think I had a single glass of water while I was out there.' In April 2011, 5ft 4in tall Emma arrived in Magaluf to get over a bad break-up by throwing herself into the resort's relentless party lifestyle. Living in the city's main strip, Emma worked as a promo girl, encouraging revellers to visit bars and clubs. Breakfast: . (Waking at 2pm) A cheese burger from Burger King with chips and full fat coke . Lunch: . Skipped . Dinner: . A kebab, pizza, KFC, chips with cheese, Chinese, or curry . Snacks: . Alcohol and crisps throughout the day (and night) Alcohol: . Tequila for breakfast and a pint of beer or cider with lunch. Between 70-100 glasses of vodka or Malibu and lemonade a week, and over 200 shots of Sambuca and Jagerbomb . Breakfast: . 25g Oats with 125ml skimmed milk and one black coffee . Lunch: . Chicken breast with a jacket sweet potato . Dinner: . Lean steak with broccoli, carrots and sweetcorn . Snacks: . Apples, bananas, melon, protein shake, goji berries, or pumpkin seeds . Alcohol: . Emma no longer drinks alcohol and says she can have just as much fun on a night out without it. Now if she goes out she will have a soft drink . She says: 'An average day began with me waking at 2pm. I worked from 8pm till 4am and then partied till 10am. 'Healthy eating wasn't on my mind. I was living off fried chicken, burgers and curries.' Six months later, those unhealthy eating habits returned with Emma when she arrived back in the UK and she continued to pile on the pounds. She had left her family home in Milton Keynes a size 10 to 12 and 11st and returned a size 20 and 14st 8lb. Emma says: 'I didn't care about my weight when I was out there. It was only when I got back to the UK and saw my friends again that I could see the difference.' Emma has revealed that she didn't realise just how much weight she had put on until she came home . When living in Magaluf Emma would wake up at 2pm and then gorge on takeaways and spend her whole day drinking alcohol, she would even have tequila for breakfast (pictured left and right before the weight loss) The following summer, still unsatisfied with life at home, Emma returned to Magaluf. Her second spell as a promo girl only lasted three months, and back in the UK she continued to put on weight. But it soon began to take a tole on her confidence. Becoming conscious of her size, Emma shunned socialising for lonely nights on sofa, where she would over-eat takeaways. By December 2012, all the partying, boozing and gorging on junk food had taken its toll on Emma's body. Weighing a hefty 15st 4lb, she realised it was time to make a change. She says: 'My family were walking to the pub and I was about to join them. Only, when I tried to tie my shoes, my stomach got in the way and I couldn't bend over. I ended up putting flip flops on. 'It was snowing outside and when my dad saw me in my flip flops, he helped me put on shoes.' Emma has now cut out alcohol altogether and says she can have just as much fun drinking soft drinks . Mortified, Emma made a New Year's resolution to lose weight. Days later she joined the gym and began exercising at least five times a week, focusing on cardio, as well as completing circuit training. Emma used the phone app, 'My Fitness Pal' to calculate a healthy calorie intake, based on her weight, height, sex and age, and she slashed her daily calorie intake from 5,000 to 1,200. Cutting out junk food, and eating balanced, nutritious meals, within three months she had lost two stone. Emma stopped attending the gym after the first three months, and used her diet to continue losing weight. But in the summer of 2013 she returned to the gym and began weight training to tone her arms and stomach. Emma and her boyfriend Leon now allow themselves one cheat day a week where they can eat what they want and the rest of the week they eat healthily . Emma met her now boyfriend Leon  in August 2013 and he introduced her to weight training. Emma says: 'We met on a night out and started going to the gym together. And when I started weight training, that's when I got addicted to the gym. 'Leon was amazed when I showed him pictures of what I used to look like. He had no idea. 'Being with someone who has the same healthy outlook has been inspirational. We have a home gym and I've stopped drinking alcohol.' 'But I can have just as much fun on a night out on soft drinks. If my younger self could see me now, and how having a healthy lifestyle has become an obsession, she would absolutely punch me in the face. I used to hate people like me.' Emma, who completed her transformation by having a breast enlargement operation in February 2014, is proud of her 6st 2lb weight loss, as well as her new outlook. She says: 'I make the right choices now. Leon and I eat healthily, but once a week we have a 'cheat' meal, where we're allowed to indulge ourselves. 'Now when I'm slobbing out on the sofa with a pizza, I'm not sat there alone.'","Emma Harvey from Bromley piled on the pounds working in Magaluf .

"When Clare Houghton headed to London for a day out with her partner of ten years, she expected city walks and tourist attractions - not a ring. Instead the mother-of-two, from Northamptonshire, was surprised by a romantic proposal featuring a choir, pictures commemorating her relationship with Lee Esselmonth, 29, and a red rose - all 138ft above the Thames. And the moment Lee walked off under the guise of needing the toilet and Clare, 26, entered the glass walkway for the romantic surprise  has been captured on video. Lee, who had the proposal planned for months, made an excuse to walk off as they were about to go in . The couple (Clare, left, Lee, right) consider Tower Bridge a very special and romantic place for them . Clare was then left to enter the glass walkway on her own where she found six canvases covered in photos, quotes and memories of their relationship with tags on which Lee had written, 'You are and always will be my everything'. One was emblazoned with pictures of the couple as children, another included pictures and memories of their first date and an Egyptian holiday, ending with  Lee's message: 'wherever we went we were happy because we were together.' When she reached the end, a chorus of West End singers came out and sang her favourite song when Lee walked out with a rose to propose. The pair then clutched each other and swayed in a tearful embrace as the singers serenaded them. Lee said: 'I first had the idea that I wanted to propose in 2013. 'I had the ideas of what I wanted and the level that I wanted to take it but I found it impossible to put together myself and keep it a hidden secret. 'Clare means the world to me. We have two children and have been together for 10 years. She always puts all of us first and I wanted a day that was just about her to show her just how much she is loved. Clare was then left to enter the glass walkway on her own, and she was overwhelmed . The mother-of-two never expected anything like this - although she knew if Lee proposed it would be special . Lee says he will never forget the day he became the first man to propose on Tower Bridge's new walkway . Finally Lee got down on one knee to pop the question as Clare sobbed with emotion. She said: 'It was such an amazing and overwhelming feeling when Lee proposed on the bridge, I had goose bumps. It was the most magical experience of my life. 'I always knew if Lee did propose one day it would be so special and romantic but I really didn't expect or dream of anything like this. 'Lee really blew me away with his love. It's the most amazing feeling calling him my fiancée. I'll never forget that magical day.' The event, which took place on 27 November, 2014, was organised by The Proposers, a small independent company who plan extravagant proposals for men. Lee said: 'After so much planning and keeping the secret for so long, it was breathtaking to see it all come together. Happy family: Lee and Clare, who have two  children, have been together for ten years . Lee helped prepare posters and collages that pinpointed key moments in his relationship with Clare . Clare was greeted by six canvases covered in pictures, memories and messages of love, all wrapped with a tag with words like: 'You are the best mum in the entire world' (left) Clare Houghton, who was in tears throughout her surprise proposal, said: ''Lee really blew me away' 'It all ran so smoothly. To be the first person to propose on the new glass walkway and get the answer I wanted is something that will stay with me forever.' And the location has a special place for Clare and Lee. She said: 'We first visited Tower Bridge and stayed at the hotel overlooking the Tower eight years ago so it's a really special place we love to go back to relax and visit. The Proposers' Daisy Amodio said: 'Times have changed, couples now want a bit more of a story and come to us for inspiration and execution, so they can concentrate on saying those four famous words and having a great time.'

"Schools should have the right to refuse access to pupils who have not had the MMR jab, a leading scientist has said. Biologist Dr Craig Venter said that vaccinations should be made compulsory for children who wish to attend school and benefit from the NHS. His statement comes after health officials have launched a new programme to help stem the measles outbreak in South Wales and stop it spreading more widely across the UK. Scroll down for video . Immunise: Dr Craig Venter says children should not be allowed to attend school unless they have had the MMR jab . Dr Venter was the first scientist to successfully sequence the human genome as well as create a cell with an artificial genome. ‘People think they’re making individual decisions for themselves and their family not to get vaccinated,’ Dr Venter told The Times. ‘It’s not just an individual choice, you’re a hazard to society.’ He said that unvaccinated individuals are putting the population at risk. The number of people infected with the virus in Swansea in now approaching 900. The city has been left especially vulnerable to measles since the 90s, when a local newspaper campaigned against the MMR vaccine. There are now concerns the outbreak could spread to London. David Salisbury, director of immunisation at the Department of Health said: ‘What happened and continues . to happen in Swansea could happen anywhere in England. ‘I worry about London. It’s a fast . moving group of people, with new families coming in and families moving . out. It is harder to track immunisation status. Historically there is also a legacy of poorer immunisation.' Health officials announced today that at least a million children and . teenagers are to be vaccinated against measles in an attempt to stop . expected outbreaks in England. Some . will never have had a jab, while others have only had the first of two . doses of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. Dr Venter's comments came after the government's decision to launch a £20million vaccination scheme across the country . Many of those affected are teenagers . who missed out on vaccination in the late 1990s and early 2000s when . parents were concerned about a link between MMR and autism that has . since been discredited. Dr Venter also warned that low vaccination rates raised the prospect of circulating infections mutating into new forms. This could lead to current vaccines no longer offering protection, and putting the entire population at risk. ‘Strains that could not develop in a population that was vaccinated could mutate and affect everybody whether they have been vaccinated or not,” he added. The Department of Health said increased vaccine level were proof that Dr Venter’s proposal was unnecessary, arguing that it risked alienating parents. However Dr Venter’s call for a mandatory vaccination was supported by Rino Rappuoli, global head of vaccines research at Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics. The two scientists were speaking yesterday at a House of Commons event to raise the profile of the first approved vaccine for Meningitis B, which they have jointly developed.","Dr Craig Venter, a leading biologist, said unvaccinated children are a 'hazard to society'

"The innovation could provide the vital early warning of sepsis, which is responsible for almost 40,000 hospital deaths each year . Thousands of lives could be saved by a simple test to detect potentially-fatal blood poisoning within a matter of hours. A blood test could provide the vital early warning of sepsis, which is responsible for almost 40,000 hospital deaths each year – more than breast and bowel cancer combined. When combined with antibiotic drugs, the measure could improve a patient’s chances and save up to 15,000 lives a year. Conventional blood tests currently take up to 48 hours to confirm the illness, which has a mortality rate in excess of 40 per cent. But scientists at King’s College London have identified a molecule in the blood which is raised in those with sepsis, also known as septicaemia. They have now developed a blood test that, in tests, diagnosed the condition within two hours with 86 per cent accuracy. Large scale trials of the test are now being planned, and it is hoped to make it available on the NHS in as little as a year. Lead researcher professor Graham Lord said: ‘Sepsis is a hidden killer, causing nearly a third of all hospital deaths. Rapid antibiotic treatment for the condition is vital - every minute counts,’ he said. ‘Yet current diagnostic methods can take up to two days, so an accurate diagnostic test that can be carried out at the patient’s bedside is urgently needed. We have for the first time identified a group of biomarkers [molecules] in the blood that are good indicators of sepsis. ‘We have shown that it is possible to detect these markers by screening a patient’s blood in the ward, a process which can deliver results within two hours. This is an extremely exciting development, and hopefully we can improve recovery rates, but this has the potential to save thousands of lives every year.’ Sepsis costs the NHS more than £2billion a year and occurs when the immune system has a severe overreaction to an infection, attacking organs such as the heart and liver. Sepsis causes fever, inflammation and blood pressure and clotting problems that can lead to multiple organ failure and death . It causes fever, inflammation and blood pressure and clotting problems that can lead to multiple organ failure and death. On its website, the UK Sepsis Trust says healthcare workers have just six hours to deliver a set of interventions like antibiotics and intravenous fluids once the illness strikes. But fewer than one fifth of patients receive this standard of care due to its complexity. The research, published in the journal Public Library of Science ONE, took blood from individuals with sepsis, those with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) – a similar condition that does not respond to antibiotics – and healthy patients. After comparing the samples, they isolated a molecule that was more active in sepsis patients than in the other groups. Medical microbiologist Mark Fielder, of Kingston University London, said: ‘An early intervention in these cases can often result in a much improved result for the patient. ‘With this in mind, any improvements or aids to the diagnosis of such diseases are to be welcomed, especially when the tests are rapid and potentially able to be of use at the point of care.’ Professor Jodi Lindsay, professor of microbial pathogenesis at St George’s, University of London, said: ‘The accurate and rapid diagnosis of sepsis is vitally important and necessary to ensure some of our sickest patients receive the most effective method of treatment. Current methods are not accurate or rapid enough.’","Test can detect sepsis much earlier than conventional techniques .

"A country ranger who is paralysed from the waist down has defied the odds to become a top martial arts instructor - after gaining a black belt in kickboxing. Carl Hodgetts, 34, was left wheelchair bound after he was born with spina bifida. But incredibly, Carl achieved a first dan black belt in kickboxing - by using his arms and hands instead of his feet to ‘kick’ opponents. He is also an expert in Wing Chun, a close-quarter fighting technique created by martial arts legend Bruce Lee. Carl was awarded a black belt in kickboxing by the world governing body, the World United Martial Arts Federation in 2006. He followed the criteria for able-bodied kickboxing but to reflect Carl’s disability the federation rebranded his technique to ‘freestyle martial arts’. No limits: Carl Hodgetts in a standing frame aged eight (left) that allowed him to take part in school sports. Today he teaches both able-bodied and disabled students how to kickbox (right) Carl, from Monks Kirby, near Rugby, Warwickshire, said being in a wheelchair is actually an 'advantage' to being an able-bodied fighter. He said: 'I joined a kickboxing club in 2003 - which was quite ironic to be honest. 'When other people do kicks I do different blocks and different techniques - I have to do two or three times more work with my arms. 'But being in a wheelchair actually has its advantages, I can even use it to block people. It’s made of metal, there’s less of a target area to hit and, let’s face it, there’s not a lot of point attacking my legs. 'If someone is 6ft-plus it’s a case of attacking their knees, legs, shins, stomach and private parts.But if they’re really short I aim for their face.' Mr Hodgetts now teaches able-bodied and disabled students kickboxing. Carl has had to use his skills on a number of occasions, including defending a woman from being attacked by a drunken assailant in a pub in Coventry three years ago. Carl, 9, with sister Emma, 8 (left). Carl's other sister Sarah encouraged him to take up kickboxing 10 years ago . Carl said: 'I was talking to a girl and she was crouching down and there was a drunk chap who was jumping around. 'He saw us chatting and tried to barge into the woman but I instinctively saw what was happening and got my wheelchair between her and the man. 'As he tried to shove into me I used his weight against him and spun myself out of his way so that he fell on the floor instead of us. 'My friend and the chap were quite astonished but it was just a deviation technique. 'He seemed quite embarrassed and left shortly afterwards, I was just glad no one got hurt, including the man.' Carl first got into the sport ten years ago after his sister Sarah, 37, got chatting to a martial arts instructor on a night out. He said: 'He had a problem, a disability, with his arm, and was encouraging people like myself to do martial arts. 'My sister asked me ‘would you like to have a go?’ and I said ‘why not?’ 'At the belt gradings people looked at me thinking ‘what’s he doing here?’ People have always asked me so many questions about it, which is great because it helps raise the profile of disability sport. 'Even now I am still learning different techniques, different ways to move the chair, going through different angles. It’s helped with my confidence so much.' Carl, who also works as a part-time education ranger at Coombe Abbey Country Park, now hopes to gain his second dan grading so he can train people up to black belt.","Carl Hodgetts was born with spina bifida, which left him paralysed from the waist down .

She admits she was 'embarrassed' by the thought of medical staff examining her - so repeatedly threw requests from her GP in the bin. It was only when she and her husband began trying for a third child - and she suffered heavy bleeding - that tests revealed she had cervical cancer. Lindsay Davies with her husband, Michael, admits she 'embarrassed' by the thought of medical staff examining her - so repeatedly ignored cervical screening requests from her GP . It was only when she suffered heavy bleeding after sex that tests revealed she had cervical cancer. In March last year, she underwent a surgery to have her womb, cervix, fallopian tubes and part of her vagina removed . While the cancer hadn't spread beyond the cervix, the tumour was larger than 4cm across. In March 2014, she underwent a radical hysterectomy at King's Mill Hospital, Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. This is where the womb, cervix, tissue around the cervix, fallopian tubes, pelvic lymph nodes, the upper part of the vagina and sometimes the ovaries are removed. Speaking for the first time, Mrs Davies, who is trained as a chef, said: 'I put having a smear off for so long. 'But now I can't have any more children - and I am only 30. 'My husband Michael and I were trying for a child when I was diagnosed. 'I would urge people not to be embarrassed - it's only 10 minutes of your time and it's really not worth missing it.' Mrs Davies' story comes as figures released today revealed the number of young women diagnosed with cervical cancer has soared in the last decade. Over the last 10 years, cases of the disease in women aged 25 to 29 have soared by 59.2 per cent. Mrs Davies, who is mother to Isabel, seven, and Darcie-Rae, 18 months, first ignored a smear test request aged 22.'I just kept putting it off,' she said. Today, she urged other women not to behave as she had . It was while pregnant with Darcie-Rae (right) that Mrs Davies she started bleeding - and the problem became progessively worse. Today she said: 'The children are a comfort. I know I am lucky, I don't need telling that' Meanwhile in the last year rates have risen 4.8 per cent, as one million women failed to attend smear test appointments. The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years. It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb). A sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis. Those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment. The number of young women diagnosed with cervical cancer has soared in the last decade, as new figures reveal more than one million failed to attend smear tests last year. Over the last 10 years, cases of the disease in women aged 25 to 29 have soared by 59.2 per cent. Meanwhile in the last year rates have risen 4.8 per cent, as one million women failed to attend smear test appointments. Eight women in the UK are diagnosed each day and cervical cancer is the most common form of the disease in under 35s. A leading charity is today urging women to ensure they attend their regular smear tests, raising concerns that the uptake of screening has fallen to an all-time low. While some women admit they are too embarrassed to go for screening tests, others said they are concerned it will be painful, while some said they don't think the tests are necessary. SYMPTOMS . The most common symptom of cervical cancer is bleeding from the vagina at times other than when a woman is having a period. Women may have bleeding: . Between periods . After or during sex . At any time if you are past the menopause . Some women also have: . A vaginal discharge that smells unpleasant . Discomfort or pain during sex . While some women admit they are too embarrassed to go for screening tests, others polled in today's research said they were concerned it will be painful, while some said they don't think the tests are necessary. Eight women in the UK are diagnosed each day and cervical cancer is the most common form of the disease in under 35s. Mrs Davies, who is mother to Isabel, seven, and Darcie-Rae, 18 months, first ignored a smear test request aged 22. 'I just kept putting it off,' she said. I don't like going to the doctors or the hospital because I am uncomfortable with it. 'The thought of it was embarrassing - I know that sounds stupid, given the fact I've had children. 'Plus there never seemed to be the time.' It was when she was pregnant with Darcie-Rae that Mrs Davies she started bleeding. And things only got worse after her daughter was born in December 2013. 'It was after sex,' Mrs Davies said. 'One day it wouldn't stop.' On Christmas Eve 2013 she had her first smear test ever and two weeks later, at King's Mill Hospital, Nottinghamshire, she was diagnosed with cancer. She continued: 'When they said it was cervical cancer, I didn't feel anything. 'I felt numb. My husband started to cry, but I didn't feel anything.' An MRI revealed the tumour was 1.5cm by 2cm at that stage. While she avoided chemotherapy and radiation, doctors told Mrs Davies she would require a radical hysterectomy. 'We were trying for children – it was so hard,' she said. 'But I am alive and I will live to see my children grow up.' Surgeons also managed to keep Mrs Davies' ovaries, meaning she will not experience an early menopause. 'The children are a comfort. I know I am lucky, I don't need telling that. 'But I wish I hadn't neglected my smear – don't delay it for eight years like I did.' Mrs Davies has been told she is now cancer-free and has check-ups every three months. Mrs Davies is now supporting Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust's Smear for Smear campaign. People are being asked to smear lipstick across their face and show their support. The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years. It is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the cervix (neck of the womb). A sample of cells is taken from the cervix for analysis and sent to a laboratory for analysis. Those whose cells show abnormalities are called back for further investigation and, if necessary, treatment. Currently the test is not offered routinely to women aged younger than 25 because cervical cancer is so rare in women that young. According to Cancer Research UK statistics, not a single woman under the age of 20 died from cervical cancer between 2009-2011. The NHS offers free cervical screening tests to all women aged 25 to 64 every three to five years. The test detects early abnormalities which, if left untreated, can develop into cancer of the cervix (pictured) The lower age of 25 was raised from 20 after the Advisory Committee on Cervical Cancer Screening (ACCS) advised the NHS in 2003 that cervical screening in younger women did more harm than good. The committee advised that cell abnormalities in younger women normally went away of their own accord, and said that sending young women for further tests and treatment increased the likelihood of the woman having pre-term delivery if she went on to have children, and could cause significant anxiety. Many other countries offer cervical screening from the age of 25, including Italy, France, Belgium and Ireland. In Scotland, women are invited to be checked from the age of 20, though it is due to go up to 25 next year. In Australia women are invited from 18, Greece from 20, and in the US two years after women become sexually active. Meanwhile, other countries start cervical screening later. Both the Netherlands and Finland offer screening to women only once they are 30, and these two countries boast some of the lowest mortality rates for cervical cancer in Europe, and in Bulgaria it is for women over 31.","Lindsay Davies says she received her first smear request aged 21 .

"Barbara Schofield was trampled when the saddle slipped as she rode her horse, Figaro . A woman who was trampled by her own horse has had her ribcage rebuilt with 'Meccano' Barbara Schofield, 52, suffered nine broken ribs and a punctured lung in the accident, but was back in the saddle after just 10 weeks. Surgeons at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital used pioneering titanium technology to rebuild Barbara's ribcage. Only a handful of hospitals in the country use the technique, in which titanium plates and screws are used to help mend cracked bones. The Synthes Matrix Rib System, developed in Switzerland, uses a series of curved titanium plates around 10 to 20cms long and 10mm wide. They are sculpted in a factory and fine-tuned by a surgeon to fit the contours of the patient's ribs - like a Meccano set. She was trampled when the saddle slipped as she rode her four-year-old gelding Figaro in Willaston, on the Wirral, Merseyside. The damage also caused air and blood to go between her lung and rib cage which was an additional complication. She was taken by ambulance to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital's emergency department. There, she underwent pioneering surgery to rebuild her ribcage using plates and screws. The new technique sees tailor-made surgical plates pinned to the broken bones to alleviate pain and speed up recovery. It can allow patients to escape complications such as pneumonia, breathing difficulties and chest deformity and has a recovery time of just a few days. Until recently, the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed. Ms Schofield remained at the Royal's intensive care unit for seven days. The trauma collaborative work - across the three hospitals - has led to a reduction in the length of stay a patient requires in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) by more than four days. Within 10 weeks Ms Schofield, a part-time clinical physiologist in cardiology at Warrington Hospital, was back in the saddle for the first time since the accident attempting to regain her confidence. She said: 'I'm delighted with the innovative surgery Sanjay Kalra performed. 'He has worked wonders and I am extremely grateful to him as his expertise has resulted in a much more timely and successful recovery. Ms Schofield was taken to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital's emergency department. There, she underwent pioneering surgery to rebuild her ribcage. The new technique, Synthes Rib Matrix, involves tailor made plates being pinned to the broken bones to speed up recovery and alleviate pain . Each plate is about half an inch wide and is shaped to match the contours of the ribs. Until recently, the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healeD . Now recovered, Ms Schofield said: 'It's been a bit of a joke with friends and colleagues referring to me as 'barbed wire' instead of Barbara and also the 'bionic woman' 'I realised that this surgery was quite novel and I'm lucky to have had this technology and procedure on my doorstep, in Liverpool. 'I am so fortunate to have been dealt with by such a talented surgical team. 'It's been a bit of a joke with friends and colleagues referring to me as 'barbed wire' instead of Barbara and also the 'bionic woman'! 'I've not been through the security body scanners at an airport yet - they will probably never have seen anything quite like it!' Sanjay Kalra, consultant trauma and orthopaedic surgeon, said: 'With this technology the procedure we use not only reduces the risk of complications but encourages a faster return to normal function. 'It is only recommended for patients who have suffered severe chest trauma with multiple broken ribs. 'The results and patient outcomes have been excellent for patients like Barbara at the both the Royal and Aintree hospitals.' Until recently, the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed. This could take months and left the patient in danger of complications such as breathing difficulties, pneumonia and chest deformity. The new technique, Synthes Rib Matrix, sees patients undergo a 2 hour operation which is available both on the NHS and privately. During the surgery, tailor made plates are pinned to the broken bones to speed up recovery and alleviate pain. Each plate is about half an inch wide and is shaped to match the contours of the ribs. The recovery time from the operation is only a few days. The plates are left in the body for the rest of the patient's life.","Barbara Schofield, 52, suffered nine broken ribs and a punctured lung .

"Locals are mocking a $3.5 million sculpture set to be erected in the Sydney CBD, comparing the 50-metre artwork to dental floss, a rubber band and Mr Burns from The Simpsons. City of Sydney Council today unveiled plans to install an 'elegant cloud-shaped arch' above George Street in front of Sydney's Town Hall. The council will spend $9.3 million on the Cloud Arch, designed by Tokyo-based artist Junya Ishigami, and other works including a giant fibreglass milk crate to be installed near Central Station a set of 60 bronze bird sculptures which will be perched around the Kent Street underpass. Scroll down for video . Sydney is set to get a new Cloud Arch sculpture, designed by Tokyo-based artist Junya Ishigami, which will be erected on George Street near Town Hall . Lord Mayor Clover Moore said the artworks would help transform George Street, which is also set to get a light rail and a pedestrianised boulevard. 'We're delighted to announce such an exciting group of artworks by some of the world's leading artists,' she said. 'I have no doubt they will become iconic landmarks of our city for today and future generations.' But Twitter users were more sceptical, especially of the Cloud Arch, dubbing it the #spacenoodle and comparing the curvy steel sculpture to Jessica Rabbit, dental floss and a rubber band. Some Twitter users pointed out that other Australian capital cities have been given much stranger public artworks in the past, such as Canberra's Skywhale (top left) Others noticed out a likeness to Mr Burns as an alien in the Simpsons, and a giant car yard balloon. But some people on social media were quick to point out that other Australian capital cities have been given much stranger public artworks in the past, such as Canberra's Skywhale or Adelaide's pig and giant ball sculptures. The Cloud Arch sculpture will be built with steel plates to rise diagonally across from the Queen Victoria Building to the Woolworths building. In his artist's statement, Mr Ishigami said the Cloud Arch embodied Sydney's new 'Green, Global and Connected' characteristics and would evoke 'comfort, openness and freedom'. A $2.5m pavilion by Hany Armanious, that has already been dubbed the Milk Crate, will stand in Belmore Park near Central Railway Station . Controversial British artist Tracey Emin has been given the nod to create a $2.1m corridor of bird installations in the area near Wynyard .","City of Sydney unveiled plans for a Cloud Arch artwork on George Street .

"Police in India claimed today the killing of two teenage girls allegedly raped before they were found swinging from a mango tree in India may not have been what it first seemed. The head of police in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where the killings took place, has said the two girls may have been the victims of honour killings. Anand Lal Bannerjee also claimed only one of the cousins had been raped and they had in fact been strangled before their bodies were strung up on the tree. Scroll down for video . The case has provoked national outrage in India after it emerged that police in the village of Katra initially refused to investigate the girls' murder due to their low-caste status . He added that police now believe the five men sought for their murder last month may be innocent. Officers will investigate the victims' families, with relatives undergoing 'narco-analysis', whereby they will be interviewed under the influence of 'truth drugs'. Three brothers have confessed to . attacking and killing the young cousins, named Murti and Pushpa, in a . case which has horrified India. But in a hurriedly-called press . conference, Bannerjee said: 'According to the postmortem report of . the deceased, one of the girls was not raped and it appears to be a case . of honour killing. We are probing the matter. 'We . will conduct a lie detection test on all the accused who have been . arrested. If needed, we will take the accused to Bangalore for the test . and get the results.' The crime provoked national outrage after . it emerged that police in the village of Katra initially refused to . investigate the girls' murder due to their low-caste status. Brutal: Women activists of Bharatiya Janata Party, flag seen top, face police water cannons as they demonstrate outside the office of Uttar Pradesh state chief minister . Protest: Villagers in Uttar Pradesh hold a protest beside the tree where they discovered the bodies of two girls earlier this month . But the state's Chief Secretary Alok Ranjan dubbed rape as a 'trivial incident' and said the crime should not be blown out of proportions. He said: 'Rape is a trivial incident and it should not be blown out of proportion by the media. The media should also look into the incidents where people have been falsely implicated in such cases.' The alleged . killers - Pappu, Awadhesh and Urvesh Yadav - are members of the dominant . Yadav caste, to which most of the local police also belong. Low-caste . villagers from the community in Uttar Pradesh state have expressed . concern that they could also be targeted in the wake of the horrifying . attacks. In addition to the three suspected murderers, two police officers have been arrested for allegedly ignoring the victims' parents when they reported that the girls, aged 14 and 15, had gone missing. The girls' murder has prompted protests in New Delhi and other Indian cities, in an echo of the outpouring of grief which came when a student was raped and killed on a bus in the capital in 2012. In their home village, poor locals described their worries that they would be vulnerable to a similar attack in the future. Although a . rape is reported in India every 21 minutes on average, law enforcement . failures mean that such crimes - a symptom of pervasive sexual and caste . oppression - are often not reported or properly investigated, human . rights groups say. More sex crimes have come to light in recent days. A . woman in a nearby district of Uttar Pradesh was gang-raped, forced to . drink acid and strangled to death. Another was shot dead in northeast .

"Three members of a so-called 'Muslim Patrol' were today jailed at the Old Bailey for repeatedly trying to enforce Sharia law in East London. Jordan Horner and another Islamic extremist told one couple they could not hold hands while walking down the street, because it was in a 'Muslim area'. The radicals also attacked a group of men drinking in the road, and told a woman she would face 'hell fire' because of the way she was dressed. Horner, 19, Ricardo MacFarlane, 36, and a 23-year-old man who cannot be named for legal reasons were sentenced to 68 weeks, 12 months and 24 weeks in prison respectively. Scroll down for video . Jailed: Jordan Horner, left, and Ricardo MacFarlane, right, have been sentenced to prison along with another man for their role in the self-styled 'Muslim Patrol' The court earlier heard that last December Horner and the 23-year-old man drove alongside Joshua Bilton and Anna Reddiford in Bethnal Green, and started yelling at them through a megaphone. The teenage convert shouted: 'Let go of each other's hands. This is a Muslim area!' - but the couple initially assumed it was a joke. They stopped holding hands after the men repeated the message - and when they started again, the car blocked their way until they let go. Two weeks later, Horner and MacFarlane attacked men drinking in Shoreditch, shouting: 'Kill the non-believers.' Horner then punched two of the group, hitting James Forward in the jaw and knocking out Patrick Kavanagh with a sucker punch to the head. On January 13, Horner and the 23-year-old harassed another couple, Clare Coyle and Robert Gray, as they were walking in Stepney - accusing Miss Coyle of being a 'slag'. In an exchange filmed on Horner's phone, she replied, 'This is Great Britain. I can dress how I wish,' while the group shouted: 'Remove yourselves now. Muslim Patrol. Move away from the mosque.' Horner, an associate of hate preacher . Anjem Choudary who has declared he wants to bring Sharia law to . Britain, pleaded guilty to two charges of assault and two charges of . using threatening words and behaviour. He . was jailed earlier this year for beating up a photographer, and has . been seen putting up posters across East London 'banning' alcohol. MacFarlane, . who pleaded guilty to affray, has previous convictions for criminal . damage for painting over advertisements of women in the street. The 23 year-old admitted two counts of using threatening words and behaviour. Prosecutor . Alex Chalk told the court: 'This is a case about religious vigilantism. These men were members of a self-styled Muslim Patrol who threatened, . intimidated and even assaulted members of the public who they perceived . to be behaving in an un-Islamic manner. 'The . men accosted members of the public in neighbourhoods of East London . which they claimed were Muslim areas, and where according to them . different law applied.' Radical: Horner, 19, is close to jihadist hate preacher Anjem Choudary, pictured during a demonstration . Judge Rebecca Poulet QC told them: 'One of the many good things about living in Great Britain is the tolerance and respect members of the public generally show to one another's religious beliefs, his dress or his chosen way of life. 'When on occasions a person shows their intolerance of another individual whether by aggression or violence and in such a way as to cause real fear to the individual then the law can be invoked to protect that individual. 'This law would protect you if someone treated you in this way. It is the very same law that now brings you before this court for your conduct. 'My understanding is that Islam is a peaceful religion and this conduct was unfortunately anything but.' Lisa Wilson, representing Horner - who calls himself Jamal Uddin - said: 'He recognises that the offences are serious and recognises the custodial threshold is clearly passed. 'Actual bodily harm were of course serious and people were harmed. The incidents themselves lasted for a very short duration. 'Mr Uddin for his part felt provoked. He has three previous convictions all committed in 2010, he was a drug user and his life has changed since then - he has found a religious calling. 'He has a wife and two children, a 14-month-old son and a daughter born six days ago. Up until now he has been a young man who was immature and easily led. He now wants to work in the retail sector.' Susan Meek, representing the 23 year-old, said: 'He is a relatively young man, he has an offending history a lot of it is prior to him converting to Islam - this offending relates to his religious choice. 'He said he didn't think about the effect it would have on the victims, didn't think about the consequences and he has said he feels very stupid.'","Jordan Horner, Ricardo Macfarlane and another man sentenced to jail for 68 weeks, 12 months and 24 weeks respectively .

"Author Marti Perarnau was given total access to Bayern Munich during the 2013-14 season, Pep Guardiola's first in charge of the Bundesliga giants. In his new book Pep Confidential, Perarnau uses his behind-the-scenes pass to give readers a unique insight into Guardiola's debut campaign in Germany. In this extract he covers Guardiola's decision to snub Chelsea, Manchester City and AC Milan in order to take over from Jupp Heynckes at the Allianz Arena. How Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich took Manchester City apart at the Etihad with all the style of Barcelona . How Pep Guardiola told his Bayern Munich players a story about water polo to inspire them to Super Cup victory against Chelsea . Pep Guardiola admits Champions League semi-final defeat to Real Madrid was the 'biggest f***-up' of his life as a coach . 'PREPARE YOURSELF, MANEL. I've chosen Bayern!' In Pescara, in the north-east of Italy, Manel Estiarte smiles. Hard though it had been for his old friend to close one chapter of his life, the decision about his next step had obviously been an easy one. Their destination would not after all be England, but Germany. The exchange is taking place five months after Pep's departure from Barca. In this time, he has been flooded with offers: Chelsea, Manchester City, Milan and, of course, Bayern. In reality, they are not job offers, but love letters, project proposals for this most illustrious of coaches. During his sabbatical year the job offers poured in. His ex-colleague Txiki Begiristain, the director of football at Manchester City, was very insistent. He also met up in Paris with Roman Abramovich, who was prepared to do anything to lure Pep to Chelsea. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Guardiola an extraordinary coach - Rummenigge .

Guardiola admits he met Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich while taking a break from football . The front cover of new book Pep Confidential . Bayern, too, were anxious to register an early interest and a delegation from Munich attended Pep's last game with Barca, the final of the Copa del Rey against Athletic in Madrid on May 25, 2012. The Catalan club won 3-0 that day. In the event the Bayern delegation did not get a chance speak to Guardiola, but they made their interest clear during a meeting with his agent. It was just six days since the Munich team had suffered a painful defeat by Chelsea in the Champions League final,  on penalties at their own stadium. It was another heavy blow for the Bavarian club at the end of a bitterly disappointing period. One week earlier, they had lost 5-2 to Borussia Dortmund in the DFB-Pokal [German cup] final in Berlin. Their opponents had just won their second consecutive league title after a brilliant campaign, beating Bayern by eight points. In the space of a few weeks Bayern had lost three titles: the Bundesliga, the DFB-Pokal and the Champions League. After enduring the agonising Champions League defeat, Heynckes promised his wife that he would only go on for one more year. The directors of Bayern felt the same way. A substitute had to be found. From the start Pep was well disposed to the overtures from the Bavarian club. A year before, in late July 2011, not long after a resounding 3-1 victory in the Champions League final against Manchester United at Wembley, Barcelona competed in the Audi Cup in Munich. Pep liked the set-up at Sabener Strasse, despite the fact that it was smaller than Barca's training ground and had fewer technical facilities. The Catalan was impressed and told Manel Estiarte privately: 'I like this place. I could see myself coaching here one day.' Nationality: Spanish  Age: 43 . Clubs played for: Barcelona (1990-2001), Brescia (2001-2002), Roma (2002-2003), Brescia (2003), Al-Ahli (2003-2005), Dorados (2005-06) Major honours: 6 La Liga titles, 2 Copa del Reys, 1 European Cup, 1 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, 2 UEFA Super Cups, 1 Olympic Gold medal . Teams managed: Barcelona B (2007-2008), Barcelona (2008-2012), Bayern Munich (2013-present) Major honours: 3 La Liga titles, 2 Copa del Reys, 2 Champions Leagues, 3 UEFA Super Cups, 3 FIFA Club World Cups, 1 Bundesliga title, 1 German Cup . Estiarte was not too surprised by the comment. Pep had said something very similar a few months before, at Manchester United. The day after beating Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, Guardiola and Estiarte travelled to Manchester to watch their next opponent in action. It was May 4, 2011, and the pair sat together in the stands of Old Trafford watching Sir Alex Ferguson's team beat Schalke 4-1. Once again Pep had turned to his friend and said: 'I like this atmosphere. I could see myself coaching here one day.' Guardiola has always felt a deep admiration, almost veneration, for the legendary teams and players of Europe. Estiarte knows this and was therefore not surprised by Pep's eagerness to meet up for a chat with Uli Hoeness and Karl-Heinz Rummenigge in June 2011. The four had a quick coffee together and it soon became clear that his feelings of admiration for the two Germans were reciprocated in equal measure. Bayern had just appointed Jupp Heynckes to manage the second phase of their project, the initial stage having been overseen by Louis van Gaal. Guardiola, fresh from winning another Champions League title with Barca, was still totally committed to the Catalan club. At that moment none of them could have imagined how closely linked their destinies would become. Guardiola gets involved with German festivities with a trip to Oktoberfest beer festival in Munich . Guardiola recalls: 'We were there for a friendly against Bayern and we met Kalle [Rummenigge] and Uli [Hoeness] for a chat. I told them how much I admired both their current team and Bayern Munich as a club. It has always been one of the great clubs of European football. But I had never given a thought to coaching there. Nor was I thinking about it then. I was certainly not offering them my services. The fact that I ended up signing for the club a few years later was just a twist of fate.' It is October 2012 and in New York, Maria, Marius and Valentina, Pep's three children, are still struggling to learn English and adjust to life at their new school. The Catalan coach's phone is ringing off the hook with job offers. Begiristain's Manchester City are still keen, and very insistent. Abramovich is deploying all his charm. He wants Pep and is prepared to mould the team to his specifications. The Germans, too, are determined, although their pitch is slightly lower key and to the point. It is now that, in one of their FaceTime chats, Guardiola tells his friend and colleague: 'Prepare yourself Manel. I've chosen Bayern' The Spaniard replaced Jupp Heynckes (top), who had led Bayern to Champions League glory in 2013 . Choosing Bayern does not mean signing the contract immediately, however. It is just the first stage in the negotiations about financial terms and footballing philosophy. Hoeness promises Pep from the start: 'Don't worry, we'll find the money.' Bayern prefer to avoid debt and their policy is to ask their club members and sponsors to foot the bill for any new investment. In this case everyone is happy to invest in Pep. They discuss their preferred playing styles and the kind of players the club will need. Not a lot more needs to be said. Pep, Uli and Kalle are on the same wavelength. The conversation goes so well it's almost as if the three of them have a ball at their feet. They discuss Mario Gomez, Luiz Gustavo and Anatoliy Tymoshchuk, and Pep insists that he wants to hold on to Toni Kroos. Guardiola holds his first Bundesliga trophy at the official champions party in Munich in May . VIDEO Guardiola an extraordinary coach - Rummenigge . By December they are ready to sign the contracts, and president Hoeness meets Guardiola at his home in New York. Guardiola then informs Manchester City, Chelsea and AC Milan that he is going elsewhere and before long Sky Italia breaks the news. Bayern's hand has been forced and on January 16 the club hastily issues a statement. Unfortunately they also, rather insensitively, fail to inform Heynckes first. The incumbent coach feels badly let down. His friends Hoeness and Rummenigge had told him they were looking for a replacement, but not who it was going to be. Over in Barcelona tongues are wagging and Pep's critics accuse him of taking the soft option. Little do they know that back in Munich  Heynckes' metamorphosis from coach to living legend has just begun and that he is about to lead his team through a jaw-droppingly successful treble, setting the bar tremendously high for his successor.

"A Scottish church has become the first in the UK to share its premises with Muslim worshippers. St John’s Episcopal Church in Aberdeen now welcomes hundreds of Muslims praying five times a day in their building as the nearby mosque was so small that they were forced to worship outside. The minister of St John's, Rev Isaac Poobalan, has handed over part of the church hall to Chief Imam Ahmed Megharbi and the imam has led prayers in the main chapel. Rev Poobalan said today that he would not be true to his faith if he did not offer to help. Sheikh Ahmed Megharbi, left, and Rev Isaac Poobalan, right, behind the altar at St John's Episcopal Church, Aberdeen, which is also being used as a place of worship for Muslims . Rev Poobalan, right, said he would not be true to his faith if he did not offer to help his neighbours with their overcrowding problem . He said: 'Praying is never wrong. My job is to encourage people to pray. 'The mosque was so full at times, there would be people outside in the wind and rain praying. 'I knew I couldn’t just let this happen - because I would be abandoning what the Bible teaches us about how we should treat our neighbours. 'When I spoke to people at the church . about the situation, someone actually said to me this was not our . problem, but I had seen it with my own eyes, so it was a problem. Rev Poobalan said: 'They were out there praying and the snow came on for the first time in winter, it was really hard to watch. 'When they were doing the prayer they had their hands and feet exposed and they were sitting on on the pavement, which is very rough. 'You could even see them breathing because it was so cold and I think when I saw that, the visual impact was such that I just couldn't walk past. 'It felt wrong, mainly because the church is next door, it's a big building and it remains empty on a Friday lunchtime which is when they need the place most as that's when they are at their busiest. 'We had something we could offer and they were just standing out in the cold and I said to my congregation ""we need to do something"".' Rev Poobalan said he wanted the move to help build bridges between Christians and Muslims after some initial resistance from his congregation about the move. He said: 'It's a move that is so basic and fundamental. It has nothing to do with religion - it's all based on human need. 'The religious divide shouldn't divide us as people. 'But I anticipated there would be some opposition as it's strange and new and there was some natural anxiety in the beginning. 'But once people realised that there is more commonality between us. 'I certainly hope, wish and pray that this will help relations between the two religions. 'When I spoke to the imam there was some hesitation on their part too, because this has never been done before. 'But they took us up on the offer and it has been a positive relationship.' St John's Episcopal Church in Aberdeen is believed to be the first in the UK to share with Muslims . Rev Poobalan, 50, said being . surrounded by Islam while growing up in India helped break down the . divide for worshippers of two religions praying together in Aberdeen. Sheikh . Ahmed Megharbi of the Syed Shah Mustafa Jame Masjid mosque said: 'What . happens here is special and there should be no problem repeating this . across the country. 'The relationship is friendly and respectful.' St . John's is part of the Scottish Episcopal Church, which is part of the . Anglican Communion and distinct from the presbyterian Church of . Scotland. The Bishop of . Aberdeen and Orkney, the Right Rev Dr Robert Gillies said that this . relationship could be the start of a change in dynamics between the two . faiths. Dr Gillies said: 'It would be good to think we can change the world. 'Most of us most of the time feel we can’t so don’t bother. 'But sometimes, someone has a vision we can do something of global significance on a local scale. 'This is what is happening between St John’s and the mosque in its grounds. 'Everyone can do something locally and if more were to do so then something big might just begin to happen globally.' Dr . Gillies said that the 'eyes of the world' were now focused on the two . faiths represented in the building on the city’s Crown Terrace. Although the Christian church regards Jesus as the son of God, the Muslim faith views him as a key prophet. Sections of the church hall have been handed over to the mosque and the imam has led prayers in the chapel . Even with differences like these, there can be a mutual respect, said Dr Gillies. The relationship between the mosque and St John’s has developed over the past few years. On Christmas Eve 2010 both opened their doors for prayers, food and socialising. In 2011, the church and mosque teamed up to mark the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the USA. Verses were read from both the Bible and the Koran to commemorate those who died. There have been cases of Christians allowing Muslims to pray in their churches in parts of America. In 2011, two Florida churches were criticised for opening their doors to Muslim groups. But Church leaders believe the move in Aberdeen is a first for the United Kingdom.","The Syed Shah Mustafa Jame Masjid mosque was too small to fit everyone in .

"The planet is 'f**cked' after scientists found huge plumes of deadly methane escaping from the seafloor. This is according to Dr Jason Box who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere. He said: 'If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd' Scroll down for video . The planet is 'f**cked' after scientists found huge plumes of deadly methane escaping from the seafloor. This is according to Dr Jason Box who claims that methane could be the main driver of climate change . The scientist, based at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, tweeted the provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic. Some of this methane – which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean's surface. The leaking gas from the seafloor may have its origins in collapsing clusters of methane trapped in frozen water due to high pressure and low temperature. Scientists at Stockholm University called the discovery 'somewhat of a surprise,' which, according to Dr Box, is an understatement. Leaking gas from the seafloor may have its origins in collapsing clusters of methane trapped in frozen water due to high pressure and low temperature. Pictured are methane bubbles escaping from a lake in Alaska . 'We're on a trajectory to an unmanageable heating scenario, and we need to get off it,' Dr Box told Brian Merchant at Motherboard . 'We're f**ked at a certain point, right? It just becomes unmanageable. The climate dragon is being poked, and eventually the dragon becomes pissed off enough to trash the place.' Methane is the second-largest greenhouse gas contributor to climate change. The gas is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat and is currently being targeted by government in an attempt to mitigate global warming. Methane pollution has declined by 11 per cent since 1990 even as the governments has pushed for greater use of natural gas. But the longer view on methane pollution show that it will rise. The Obama administration points to studies that show that methane pollution is projected to increase to a level equivalent to over 620 million tonnes of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030, if no action is taken. The conventional thought is that the bubbles would be dissolved before they reached the surface and that microorganisms would consume that methane. But Dr Box said if the plumes are making it to the surface, there's a new source of heat-trapping gases that the planet needs to worry about. This, he claims, is particularly disturbing because the Arctic is warming faster than nearly anywhere else on Earth. His comments follow research in May which found that freshwater sources may be an unrealised source of methane. Unlike carbon dioxide, which is highly soluble in water, methane exists in two forms in these freshwater sources: as a dissolved gas and encapsulated in bubbles that rise from sediments. And this methane can lead to ozone production and levels of the gas in the atmosphere are 150 per cent higher than they were before the industrial revolution in U.S. It is already known that in the melting regions of the Arctic where lakes, known as thermokarsts, which are lakes that break down plant material into methane. This methane can then escape out of the lake, and once lit, could set ice on fire. The melting ice can also lead to 'drunken trees' as the firm soil slowly transforms into mud causing the plants that grow in them to lean to one side. 'I may escape a lot of this,' Dr Box told Motherboard, 'but my daughter might not. She's three years old.' From left to right in the left image: Örjan Gustafsson, Captain Mattias Pettersson and Igor Semiletov lead the Stockholm University study. They are pictured here on bridge of their ship with methane flare on screen.

"The role of Britain’s top mandarin in promoting the controversial £28billion takeover of the defence giant BAE by a European rival was last night under the spotlight. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has helped persuade David Cameron to back the plans to join BAE Systems with EADS. But he faces questions about his own role – and whether it constitutes a conflict of interest because he worked for three years at merchant bank Morgan Stanley, which stands to gain tens of millions from brokering the merger. Cabinet secretary: Sir Jeremy Heywood, with his wife Suzanne . Sir Jeremy’s declaration of meetings with outside bodies reveals he has held four private sessions with BAE executives  – in May and July last year, and again in January and March – and one with EADS. Since the election he has also twice met senior figures from Morgan Stanley, which is advising BAE – in October 2010 and October 2011 – for whom he worked between 2003 and 2007 as head of UK investment banking. Senior government sources yesterday admitted that Mr Cameron is prepared to back the merger since it will give BAE access to the lucrative civil aviation sector. This will happen if guarantees are given about protecting national security and reassuring the US that the plans would not compromise Pentagon secrets. A senior Whitehall source said: ‘He is basically supportive and if he can be reassured on a number of points he will do all he can to talk to the Americans. ‘We are in a world where defence budgets are falling and by linking BAE with EADS you can create a better balance between civil and defence products.’ The Whitehall official admitted that Sir Jeremy has played an instrumental role in government talks with BAE. ‘He’s certainly been involved in the discussions,’ said the official. ‘When a company like BAE has close relations with the Government and is involved in discussions about mergers they would want to be plugged into the centre of government to hear its views.’ Decision: Sir Jeremy has helped persuade Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured) to back the plans to join BAE Systems with EADS . Tory MPs are in uproar at the plans, which will see Britain’s main defence contractor run by a German from a headquarters in France. They believe it will leave the UK defence industry at the mercy of Europe, endanger British jobs and damage relations with the US. 'When a company like BAE has close relations with the Government and is involved in discussions about mergers they would want to be plugged into the centre of government to hear its views' Senior Whitehall official . Some 5000 Scots work for BAE Systems at its bases in Rosyth, Fife; Prestwick, Ayrshire; and Govan, Glasgow. And last night Ben Wallace, who has 6,000 BAE workers in his Wyre and North Preston constituency, delivered a coded warning that Sir Jeremy’s enthusiasm for the plans is not shared by the Tory Party. Mr Wallace did not attack Sir Jeremy by name. But he said: ‘The Government has to tread a fine line between arbitrating on the take-over and not being led down the garden path by those who have a vested interest. If the recession has taught us anything it is: beware of bankers bearing gifts.’ He added: ‘There is great concern about handing our defence industrial base to a company controlled by the French and German states. BAE takeover: Tory MPs are in uproar at the plans, which will see Britain's main defence contractor run by a German from a headquarters in France. That cannot be good for our relations with the US or the demand from the MoD for more competition in defence procurement.’ MPs are also privately concerned that the Premier has signalled support for the deal, when the  Government also has to oversee the deal. 'It's no surprise the Cabinet Secretary often meets with Britain’s major employers. His role is no different from the role he plays on other major issues requiring high level ministerial involvement' Sir Jeremy Heywood's spokesman . Department of Business sources say it is ‘very likely’ that Business Secretary Vince Cable will have to refer it to the Office of Fair Trading and potentially to the Competition Commission as well. Mr Cable has refused to state his views, since he will be expected to behave in a quasi-judicial manner and avoid the pitfalls that befell the Government’s handling of the Murdoch empire’s bid for BSkyB. One MP opposed to the deal said: ‘I’m not sure why No 10 are busy telling people Cameron supports the bid when the Government has to act impartially.’ A spokesman for Sir Jeremy said: ‘It's no surprise the Cabinet Secretary often meets with Britain’s major employers. 'His role is no different from the role he plays on other major issues requiring high level ministerial involvement.’ Sources close to Sir Jeremy say he left Morgan Stanley more than five years ago and that it would be ‘absurd’ to suggest he would profit in any way from the deal.","Controversial proposal to join defence giant BAE with European firm EADS .

"Two brothers who fleeced taxpayers out of £315,000 in a house-swapping scam involving their wives walked free after a judge said the 'greatest punishment' was the loss of their good names. Mohammed Amin, 40, and his wife, Kauser Aktar, 38, switched homes with Aftab Ahmed, 39, and his wife Sobia Shaheen, 32, so the women could pretend to be tenants and claim housing benefits. The Pakistani couples - who have 11 children between them - submitted bogus tenancy agreements for 16 years, raking in £314,452.25, Snaresbrook Crown Court in east London heard on Friday. Fraud: Mohammed Amin (left), 40, and his wife, Kauser Aktar (right), 38, switched homes with Aftab Ahmed, 39, and his wife Sobia Shaheen, 32, so the women could pretend to be tenants and claim housing benefits . Amin and Aktar, who have seven children, pocketed £153,000 from the council in Ilford, Essex, and Aktar got £74,000 from the Department of Work and Pensions by pretending to be a single mother. Shaheen - who has a previous benefit fraud conviction for lying about being a single mother - and Ahmed fleeced the London Borough of Redbridge out of more than £87,000 while living in Ilford. Father-of-four Ahmed, who earns £40,000 a year as a Ford production manager, was a 'religious man' and had planned a family Hajj pilgrimage to ask God 'for forgiveness', the court was told. Father of four: Aftab Ahmed, who earns £40,000 a year as a Ford production manager, was a 'religious man' and had planned a family Hajj pilgrimage to ask God 'for forgiveness', the court was told . Shaheen, a 'fervent' Muslim dressed in a burka, arrived at court with designer Louis Vuitton luggage. According . to reports in a Sunday newspaper, Amin, who runs a pizza shop in . Bethnal Green, east London, has built up an international property . portfolio with apartments in Dubai and Budapest. But Judge Neil Sanders suspended their sentences due to their 'exceptional circumstances', including the fact they have now repaid all the cash and concerns over care of the 11 children. The two couples, all of Pakistani origin, are now saddled with debts totalling around £250,000. 'Each . couple swapped houses and made claims for housing benefit and income . support,' Mark Himsworth, prosecuting, said. 'The female defendants said . they were not related to their landlords, the other brothers. 'They made misrepresentations, through submitting a significant number of tenancy agreements, that they were paying a genuine rate when they were paying the brothers' mortgages through false claims. The female defendants are responsible for the money in respect of their own claims.' Shaheen and Ahmed ended the fraud in 2010, before council investigators became aware of it, but Aktar and Amin continued to abuse the benefit system until 2011. 'You have both worked hard in terms of making a life for yourselves and in many ways the greatest punishment is the loss of your good name' Judge Neil Sanders . 'It went on for a long time and there was a great deal of manifest dishonesty,' Mr Himsworth added. Ahmed and Amin were handed 20 months . in prison, suspended for two years. Shaheen was handed a two-month jail . term, while Aktar was given a four-week term, both suspended for a year. Sentencing, Judge Sanders . said: 'Each of the men bought a house in your own names with the other . living in it over a long period of time, from 1995 to 2011. 'The . two men dishonestly represented through their wives to the London . Borough of Redbridge that this was a genuine rental arrangement, that . you were unrelated to the landlord and that you were entitled to claim . housing benefit in respect of the rent you were paying. 'You . have both worked hard in terms of making a life for yourselves and in . many ways the greatest punishment is the loss of your good name. Home: Mohammed Amin, 40, and his wife, Kauser Aktar, 38, who have seven children, pocketed almost £153,000 from the London Borough of Redbridge while living on this road in Ilford, Essex . 'This was a very serious offence and there were large amounts of money involved but quite exceptionally, the mitigating factors enable me to suspend the sentences.' 'The family planned a trip in October 2011 to the Hajj pilgrimage having embraced religion, to ask God for forgiveness. That had to be cancelled because their passports were seized. Their lives have completely fallen apart and Mr Ahmed is now suffering from clinical depression' Rizvan Anwar, for Aftab Ahmed . Both women were also ordered to complete a 12-week supervision requirement. Rizvan Anwar, for Ahmed, said he was 'deeply ashamed' he and his wife had become embroiled in the scam. 'Mr Ahmed accepts he applied pressure on his wife and Ms Shaheen, foolishly in hindsight, acceded to that request,’ he added. ‘She felt guilty committing these offences and asking God for forgiveness.’ 'The family planned a trip in October 2011 to the Hajj pilgrimage having embraced religion, to ask God for forgiveness. That had to be cancelled because their passports were seized. 'Their lives have completely fallen apart and Mr Ahmed is now suffering from clinical depression.' Mr Anwar, also defending Shaheen, said she has 'embraced' her Muslim beliefs far more 'fervently' and is now a 'different woman' compared to when she became involved in the scam. Other house: Sobia Shaheen, 32 - who has a previous benefit fraud conviction for lying about being a single mother - and Aftab Ahmed, 39, fleeced Redbridge out of more than £87,000 while living on this road in Ilford . 'Her family live in Birmingham and she has relied on her husband's family for support,’ he added. ‘She wanted to stop this for some time.' Graham Blower, for Amin, added: 'There are two sides to this defendant - criminality and a man who has been trying to work and better himself but going about it the wrong way and effectively being brought to book and facing up to his responsibilities.' 'It went on for a long time and there was a great deal of manifest dishonesty' Mark Himsworth, prosecuting . Ahmed and Amin, both of Ilford, admitted conspiracy to dishonestly make false representations, dishonestly obtaining property by deception, with two identical counts laid on file. They also both admitted conspiracy to obtain money transfers by deception, with another like count laid on file. Aktar, also of Ilford, admitted making a false representation. Further counts of obtaining property by deception and dishonestly obtaining money transfers were left on the court file. Shaheen, also of Ilford, admitted a single count of making a false representation.","Mohammed Amin, 40, and his wife, Kauser Aktar, 38, live in Ilford, Essex .

"PC Richard Bent, 28, who admits the theft of £250 from a dead man and £93 from a lost bag handed into police by a posed member of the public . A police officer cousin of England footballer Darren Bent stole £250 from a flat where a man had died. PC Richard Bent, 28, told a colleague: 'No disrespect, but he's dead', after swiping the bank notes from the central London home he was guarding. Detectives investigating the sudden death of Rustam Cihhudy, asked Bent to collect medical notes from the Westminster flat, and the policeman took his chance to pocket the money. When quizzed about the theft, Bent remarked: ‘No disrespect, but he’s dead. He wasn’t going anywhere soon.’ Bent, whose mother is the aunt of England and Aston Villa striker Darren, and who admits the theft, was based at Belgravia Police Station at the time of the theft on July 13 this year. His colleagues set a trap for Bent as he returned to the station to book in the medical notes. Bent was handed a lost bag by an undercover officer posing as a member of the public containing £93, which the PC promptly pocketed. ‘He is a serving police officer and the two thefts were committed while on duty’, prosecutor Emma Scheer told Westminster Magistrates Court today. ‘This is abuse of trust in relation to the fact he is a police officer, which is quite significant.’ Bent was arrested outside Bank tube station in central London, after skipping out of his shift early on July 13 to cash in his stolen money. Ms Sheer said: ‘The £250 stolen was in old money and needed to be exchanged for new money.' ‘The first charge is a theft from a deceased person, Mr Cihhudy, while on duty providing cordon services. ‘PC Bent was positioned on the cordon guarding the property and obtained the keys to the property. ‘He took the medical notes that he was requested to do.’ Mr Cihhudy’s death was initially treated as suspicious after he collapsed unexpectedly at a flat in  Page Street, Westminster, but was later adjudged not to be a police matter. ‘It was discovered PC Bent had taken money from the bag and put it into his own bank account, before effectively discarding the bag’, said Ms Scheer. Darren Bent, pictured playing for England and Aston Villa. His cousin told a colleague 'No disrespect, but he's dead' after stealing £250 . ‘At the time of the event, he didn’t know the person was an undercover police officer.’ Bent, wearing a shirt and tie covered with a black jumper, initially gave no indication of a plea and asked for the case to be transferred to the crown court. But district judge Nicholas Evans insisted the case could be dealt with at the magistrates’ court. ‘No indication is really intended for those who are mentally unable to make up their minds’, he said. ‘I am not sure why it is done and what it is intended to achieve.’ He admitted two counts of theft - in respect of the £250 and £93 amounts - but denies swiping a bank statement, three cheque books, and a passport from Mr Cihhudy.

Judge Evans ordered him to return for sentence on September 26 and released him on unconditional bail.

Bent denies the claims which may now be dealt with as a separate allegation or resolved after a hearing.","Bent was asked to collect medical notes from flat and pocketed money .

Phan was allegedly prodding Yim about . his belief in God, asking him where God was whenever Yim lost a video . game, according to the Oakland Tribune. He also asked where God was when Yim's father had died several years earlier of a stroke. Yim . flew into a rage in response to the remark about his father and he . threw his video game controller into the television, breaking the . screen. Phan and Park tried to calm Yim down for the next couple minutes but their attempts failed. At . one point, Yim said he should grab his gun and shoot Phan. A short time . later, he walked into his bedroom, loaded his AR-15 assault rifle and . returned to the living room, where he began firing the weapon. This is the home on Henrietta Drive in Oakland, California, where Yim opened fire on two of his friends, killing one of them . Yim shot Phan at least six times, including once in the side of the head. Park was shot in the finger as he threw his hands up in defense. Yim's attorney, Mario Andrews, argued for a lesser charge of manslaughter, saying that Yim feared for his life because Phan had refused to leave his house after their argument about God. Andrews also argued that the murder could not have been premeditated because Yim was under the influence of alcohol, marijuana and cocaine. But prosecutors said Yim had several minutes to contemplate the murder between the time of the argument and the time the shots were fired, at least according to testimony from Park. 'The jury got the verdict correct,' Alameda County Deputy District Attorney Allyson Donovan said, according to the Oakland Tribune. 'This gives justice to Mr. Phan and his family.'","Douglas Yim, 33, of Oakland, California, faces 126 years in prison for the crimes .

"Thefts from war memorials have more than doubled since last year, with vandals now targeting them at the rate of one every two days. Campaigners warn action must be taken to prevent the alarming rise, as scores of monuments across the country are being stripped of metal plaques and statues, before being sold as scrap. Built to preserve the memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice for their country, there are an estimated 100,000 memorials in Britain. Disgrace: A bronze statue of a Second World War soldier stood proudly in the garrison town of Tidworth in Wiltshire, left.  However, heartless thieves stole it last week leaving the plinth looking empty, right . But ahead of Remembrance Sunday, the War Memorials Trust, which works to conserve the nation’s monuments, is warning that growing numbers are being targeted by unscrupulous criminals. Frances Moreton, the trust’s director, described the increase in thefts as ‘alarming’ and called for greater vigilance. ‘There has been a noticeable increase in the amount of thefts reported to us in recent weeks. At the end of last year, we were getting reports of one incident a week. But in the past six weeks it has been one every other day, which is a noticeable increase,’ she said. ‘It is always shocking when people steal from a memorial. We have now lost the last veterans of the First World War, and they have moved from living history to historical touchstones. No shame: This grainy CCTV footage shows the moment when two crooks took 40 minutes to remove the bronze statue of a Second World War soldier from its plinth in Tidworth, Wiltshire . ‘These plaques are often the last personal link with some of the fallen. If they are lost, and their names forgotten, then it dilutes everything Remembrance Sunday stands for.’ The trust believe the recent rise in thefts is being fuelled by the soaring price of scrap metal, and growing awareness of the issue, which has resulted in more people contacting them, but also alerting crooks to an easy source of plunder. The contempt for Britain’s heroes was highlighted last week, when a bronze statue of a Second World War soldier was stolen from the garrison town of Tidworth in Wiltshire. Grainy CCTV footage shows two crooks taking 40 minutes to remove the sculpture from its plinth, before carry it off. Support: The Duchess of Cornwall is a Patron of the War Memorials Trust, which has launched a campaign to protect every memorial before the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War . The trust, which is supported by the Duchess of Cornwall, has now launched a campaign - called In Memorian 2014 - to protect every memorial before the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War. A Clarence House spokesperson said: ‘The Duchess of Cornwall has been Patron of the War Memorial Trust since 2007 and continues to support the trust’s important work.’ The aim is to mark every one of Britain’s war monuments with SmartWater – an invisible chemical marker which can be seen under UV light - in a bid to deter thefts. The trust will also issue hand-held UV lights to all of Britain’s scrap dealers to encourage them to check if metal have been illegally taken from memorials. Sir Keith Povey, chairman of the SmartWater Foundation, said: ‘As the centenary of the First World War approaches, In Memoriam 2014 encourages communities to reconnect with their local war memorials and remember the sacrifice that so many people made for their country.’ The theft of metal is a growing problem across Britain, with the cost to the economy estimated at £770 million per year. Soaring prices for metals like copper, which has seen a threefold increase in value since 2009, has meant railway lines, phone lines, as well as war memorials and statues, have been targeted by metal thieves. Currently, all scrap metal dealers are obliged to do is register with the local authority. There are also growing calls for a tighter laws on the sale of scrap metal to halt the plunder of memorials, and tougher sentences for those who wilfully desecrate them. Patrick Mercer, a Tory MP and former Army officer, said: ‘Of course it is a disgrace. These are national sacred monuments and their destruction goes far beyond a normal crime. ‘Scrap metal thefts are a big problem. Ministers should look at further regulation around scrap-metal dealing, but the best possible solution is crime prevention measures and swingeing sentences for those found guilty of these sorts of crime.’ Appalled: The Rev Raymond Dent at a memorial in a Cheshire churchyard at which two bronze plaques engraved with the names of 43 dead war heroes were stolen .","War Memorials Trust labels increase in thefts as 'alarming'

"'Orange Is the New Black' actress Diane Guerrero broke down as she recounted the heartwrenching day she arrived home from school, aged 14, to discover her parents had been deported to Colombia. Speaking to CNN on Monday, the 28-year-old actress recalled how she had returned to her Boston home after a day at school, excited to tell her family about being picked for a play. 'I got home and their cars were there and dinner was started and the lights were on, but I couldn't find them,' she told New Day. 'I broke down. I remember I hid under the bed because I was afraid somebody would come for me.' Scroll down for video . Struggle: Diane Guerrero, an actor in Orange Is the New Black, broke down during an interview with CNN on Monday as she recalled how her parents were deported to Colombia from Boston when she was 14 . Left behind: The 28-year-old sobbed as she said how her parents missed out on her growing up . Guerrero, who was born in New Jersey and grew up in Boston, spoke to CNN two days after writing an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times calling for immigration reform so families don't get separated. After she arrived home to an empty house, no government official contacted her to tell her where her parents were, she said. 'No one checked to see if I had a place to live or food to eat, and at 14, I found myself basically on my own,' she wrote. Instead, neighbors told her what had happened and waited with her until her father was able to call from the detention center, she told CNN. Her parents were being held separately, she said, and her older brother, who had a young daughter at the time, had also been taken in by authorities. Alone at 14, she relied on the kindness of other families to take her in, allowing her to attend a performing arts school and eventually go to college. Despite having places to stay and working a variety of jobs to do her best to support herself, she feared it could be taken from her at any point, she wrote in the LA Times. Painful past: Guerrero, pictured left as a child, said her father, right, and mother moved to the U.S. during a time of instability in Colombia and struggled to get properly documented. She now sees them once a year . 'I had a rocky existence,' she explained. 'I was always insecure about being a nuisance and losing my invitation to stay.' Her parents missed her recitals, her prom and her graduations from high school and college, she said. Despite the hurdles, she has achieved a successful acting career. She plays Maritza Ramos in Orange Is the New Black and the role of Lina in CW's new show, 'Jane the Virgin'. She travels to see her family in Colombia once a year, she said - but their relationship has suffered. 'We've been separated for so long, I feel like sometimes we don't know each other,' she said, as she became emotional. 'I've grown up without them. There are things about them that I don't recognize. 'It hurts. I love them so much. I know that I've been by myself, but I feel like they have lived a very lonely existence themselves.' In her op-ed, she explained that her parents had moved to the U.S. during a time of 'great instability' in Colombia and had tried for years to get properly documented 'to no avail'. Battle: Despite her struggles, she went on to graduate college and now plays Maritza Ramos in OITNB (left) Looking forward: Guerrero, pictured with her boyfriend Joseph, is now calling for immigration reform . Still, she considers herself lucky, she said. Her brother's daughter was raised in a single-parent household after he was taken away - and she is now serving time in jail. 'I don't believe her life would have turned out this way if her father and my parents had been here to guide and support her,' she wrote in Saturday's op-ed. Guerrero, a U.S. citizen who volunteers at the nonprofit Immigrant Legal Resource Center, is now calling on the Obama administration to change policies to ensure families are not separated. 'I realize the issues are complicated,' she wrote. 'But it's not just in the interest of immigrants to fix the system: It's in the interest of all Americans. 'Children who grow up separated from their families often end up in foster care, or worse, in the juvenile justice system despite having parents who love them and would like to be able to care for them. 'I don't believe it reflects our values as a country to separate children and parents in this way.'

"Green, they may be. But electric cars have struggled to overcome one of the main shortfalls that put buyers off - an inferior range to their petrol-powered rivals. That may be about to change after a new electric car was unveiled that promises to go 500 miles (800km) before the battery needs recharging. This would be far more than one of the current leaders in the field, the battery/ gasoline Chevrolet Volt, which can do around 375 miles (600km) on one charge-up. Going the distance: The QBEAK electric car which promises to go 500 miles before the battery needs recharging . On the horizon: A battery/fuel cell demonstration model of the QBEAK is expected to arrive sometime in 2013 . The Modular Energy Carrier concept (MECc), created by three Danish companies, uses bio-methanol to bolster its battery life. Mogens . Lokke, CEO of ECOmove, designers of the innovative 'QBEAK' car said . bio-methanol was far better than diesel or gasoline because it produces . substantially less carbon dioxide. 'In . combination with the way we built the car, which is really lightweight . (425 kilograms), we can get the 500-mile range,' he told CNN. A . bio-methanol/ water is converted by the fuel cell to create . electricity, while waste heat from the process powers the car's heating . and cooling system. One right royal potential owner: Prince Charles has a look inside one of ECOmove's electric concept cars during a visit to Denmark earlier this year . Keen interest: Prince Charles and Camilla were both given the low-down on the new designs when they visited Vitus Bering Innovation Park in May . It also benefits from a innovative chassis design which has really pushed the technology forward. 'Instead . of putting in a fixed battery, we have built in (six) modules that can . be fitted inside the chassis. We can use battery power in the modules or . any other kind of energy source,' Lokke said. The award-winning QBEAK also uses patented in-wheel electric motors to deliver a top speed of 75mph (120kph). The car caught the attention of royalty earlier this year when Prince Charles and Camilla paid a visit to Denmark. Driver: A novel chassis design means it will contain six electric modules rather then a single fixed battery . Imminent: The QBEAK project hopes to launch a battery-powered model with a range of 186 miles this year . They both climbed into the QBEAK car when they arrived at Vitus Bering Innovation Park in May. Mr Løkke, introduced the e-car and its many features, while the royal couple listened attentively. Prince Charles promised to follow ECOmove in the future and said that he finds the QEAK-concept very interesting. 'This . is indeed a fantastic opportunity for us to spread the message about . ECOmove and our e-car QBEAK to a wider audience', he said. According . to Mads Friis Jensen from Serenergy, the designers of the fuel cell, . bio-methanol is a cheap and abundant fuel with a short carbon chain. Challenging petrol: The award-winning QBEAK also uses patented in-wheel electric motors to deliver a top speed of 75mph (120kph) Green machine: The car's fuel cell converts a bio-ethanol/ water mix into electricity to power the battery . Compared to gasoline, bio-methanol production can cut CO2 emissions by more than 70 per cent . The U.S. Department for Energy (DOE) says direct methanol fuel cells are not hampered by the storage problems that affect other green fuels like hydrogen because as a liquid it's easier to transport and supply through current infrastructure. The QBEAK project hopes to launch a battery-powered model with a range of 186 miles (300 kilometers) later this year. The battery/fuel cell version is expected to arrive sometime in 2013.","QBEAK concept vehicle uses bio-methanol to boost its battery life .

"A California high school made history on Friday when it elected its first transgender homecoming queen in the school's history. But what the 16-year-old thought would be 'the happiest night of my life' ended with her recording a tearful Youtube video describing how the negative feedback hurt her more than it ever had before. Cassidy Lynn Campbell, 16, is now the reigning homecoming queen at Marina High School in Huntington Beach. At her crowning ceremony, she instantly fell to the ground and started crying tears of joy. She says the honor is bigger than just her. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Cassidy Campbell, 16, attends the 2013 homecoming football game for Marina High School . Your new queen: The moment Campbell learned she was elected homecoming queen she dropped to the ground in tears of joy . Campbell says she realized her win wasn't just for her but for other transgender kids who may be struggling . 'If I win it would mean that the school recognizes me as the gender I . always felt I was,' she told the L.A. Times earlier this month. 'But . with all the attention, I realized it's bigger than me. I'm doing this . for the kids who can't be themselves.' According to the paper, Campbell began taking estrogen injections and hormone blockers when she entered high school as she started her transition from male to female. She's documented her transition on Youtube, offering fashion and makeup advice for other transgender children. ""I realized it wasn’t for me anymore and I was doing this for so many . people all around the county and the state and possibly the world and I . am so proud to win this not just for me, but everyone out there,” she . told KTLA. Crowned: Campbell is crowned homecoming queen of Marina High School . Transition: Campbell documented his transition on Youtube, offering makeup tips . Campbell says she decided to run for homecoming queen earlier this year to make a statement. While most of the kids at the school accept Campbell as female and were excited to see her win, it appears some weren't - which prompted the heartbreaking Youtube video. In an explanation of the video, Campbell says she has never been so hurt by negative feedback as she did following what she thought would be 'the happiest night of my life.' Heartbreaking: Campbell says the negative feedback about her win hurt her more than ever before . 'After 16 years of struggling, I finally do it and I finally am myself -- . thinking I'll be so happy,' she said in the video. 'It's just sad that everyone has . to be so judgmental about it, and so hateful, and so mean and so . negative. I've never done anything to any of these people. And I don't . know why they have to be this way, when I've done nothing to them. It . just hurts so bad because I feel just as much of a girl as all of them . do... Everyone is just so ignorant.' She went on to question whether her transitioning to male was even worth it. 'Sometimes I wonder, ''is it even worth it?'' And if I should just go back to being miserable and just be a boy...so everyone will just shut up and leave me alone,' she says in the video.

"Assistant Employment Minister Luke Hartsuyker says there is no reason why all eligible Australians shouldn't be looking for work . Jobless Australians will be forced into working more for their welfare payments under tough new Government measures designed to get the nation's unemployed back to work. As part of a crackdown on Australia's jobless, The Federal Government will introduce the $5.1 billion job placement scheme from July 1 next year which will make it mandatory for all Australians under 50, unless they are working part time or undertaking approved training, to look for work. Australians under 30 will be required to do the heaviest lifting in order to keep their dole payments. Those in the youngest working age bracket will be asked to work a minimum of 25 hours community service a week and apply for at least 40 jobs a month. Australians aged between 30 and 49 will be required to contribute 15 hours of weekly community service and those 50-60 will need to do 15 hours a week of an approved activity. Those older than 60 will not have to do an approved activity but are encouraged to volunteer if they opt to work for the dole. Australians under 30 will need to look for a minimum of 40 jobs a month in order to receive dole benefits . Assistant Employment Minister Luke Hartsuyker said it was 'most important that jobseekers look for work.' 'A job seeker's primary responsibility is searching for that all important job,' he said. Most of the new arrangements will be put in place without introducing new legislation, however some elements of the $5.1 billion package will require new laws. Mr Hartsuyker said he will negotiate with Government cross benchers to ensure that the package is implemented 'for the benefit of job seekers and employers and to improve employment outcomes for people looking for work.' 'Work for the dole has the ability to impart on job seekers the important skills to assist them in the workforce.' Many employers, he said, are telling him job applicants are 'presenting at the gates to their business'  without adequate skills. 'Simple skills such as turning up on time, being appropriately presented, being able to get on with work mates ... work for the dole has the ability to impart those very skills.' He said the new measures are the least the taxpayer expected of those on welfare. Australians on welfare benefits will be forced to undertake more community service work and search harder for jobs . As part of the reforms, all job seekers will be encouraged to look outside of their immediate area for work and take advantage of funding that supports moving to take up a new job. Job service providers, such as Mission Australia, Sarina Russo and Ingenues, will be rewarded for getting people into short-term work for periods of four, 12 and 26 weeks. In essence, the scheme aims to cut red tape and reward job providers for finding unemployed people work. Changes to wage subsidies will also be included in the overhaul of the welfare system and will be expanded for mature age workers, and extended to young job seekers under 30 and the long-term unemployed. Wage subsidies are payments made to employers to help cover the costs of wages and training in the first few months of employment of a person  experiencing  barriers to employment. Labor accused the Government of tearing apart the principles of the mutual obligation system. The new arrangements it claims will mean jobseekers under 30 will receive no welfare for six months but still be required to door knock for jobs. 'They will not receive a cent, even if they look for work each day, each week, for six months,' Opposition Employment spokesman Brendan O'Connor told ABC radio. 'Yet now they're having to keep their side of the bargain.' Mr O'Connor supported the idea of removing red tape for job service providers, but only if it was done properly in consultation with industry.","Government to introduce $5.1 billion overhaul of Australia's welfare system .

"Dapper in a navy suit, Prince Harry looked fresh-faced as he arrived in Oman this morning, following an overnight flight from London. The 30-year-old is on the first leg of a three-day tour that will see him take in souks, sword dances and a visit to an ancient fort, and was met by an honour guard, some of whom carried traditional daggers. Blinking in the desert sun, Harry was greeted at Muscat International Airport  by Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said, the Sultan of Oman's first cousin and the Omani Patron of the Omani-British Friendship Association. Scroll down for video . Royal welcome: Harry was met by HH Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said at Muscat International Airport . The two men posed for a brief photo call in typical Middle Eastern style, sitting on two chairs in an elaborately decorated lounge underneath the sword and dagger symbol of the Omani Sultanate. Harry told his Royal host: 'I send best wishes from Her Majesty. She is very well.' He was then offered coffee and a traditional sweet treat with almonds known as halwa. The prince left accompanied by his Scotland Yard police protection officers and Omani bodyguards wearing the traditional khan-jer - dagger - in their belts. Harry is staying in the desert kingdom at the private invitation of the Sultan and had been due to attend a National Day celebration today in his honour. Unfortunately the Omani leader is currently receiving medical treatment in Germany for an undisclosed illness, meaning the parade will now no longer take place. Fresh-faced: Harry looked fresh-faced as he arrived in Oman, despite the red-eye flight from London . Chat: Prince Harry enjoyed a chat with Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said who is Sultan Qaboos' cousin . According to Kensington Palace, The Diwan - the Royal Court - in Oman - was still keen for the royal visit to take place, however, and Harry will continue with his plans to visit attractions including the Nizwa Fort and the Grand Mosque. A spokesman said: 'The Prince is travelling to Oman at the personal invitation of His. Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said. 'The visit reflects the close personal and respectful relationship that exists between The Royal Families of both countries. 'Despite The Sultan's unavailability to personally host Prince Harry on this occasion, both parties were keen that the visit still takes place given the direct and personal nature of the invitation.' The aide added: 'It will be an opportunity for a Prince Harry to see and experience the country for the first time following recent successful and enjoyable visits by other members of his family.' These include the Queen and Prince Philip in 2010 and Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall just last year. Stepping in: Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said stepped in after the Sultan flew to Germany for medical help . Formidable: Harry was met by an honour guard carrying traditional curved daggers . Tasty: Prince Harry was given coffee and a Middle Eastern sweet called halwa on arrival . The royal's new itinerary in the Sultanate will now include a visit to The British Embassy in Muscat, where Harry will have an opportunity to meet staff and hear about the work of the officials there. Tomorrow he will also visit the historic Nizwa Fort, where the prince will view local arts and crafts at a souq outside the gates before being greeted with a traditional sword dance inside the Fort's main courtyard. Harry will also enjoy a guided tour around the historic ramparts of the Fort itself, which offer stunning views of Nizwa and the surrounding mountains. Nizwa Fort was built in the 1650s by Imam Sultan Bin Saif Al Ya'rubi, although its underlying structure dates back to the 12th Century. It is Oman's most visited national monument and a reminder of the city's significant role through some of the more turbulent periods in Oman's history. On Thursday the prince will be taken to the stunning Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Muscat where he will be shown around by a member of the Diwan Higher Centre for Culture and Science. Entertaining: Charles and Camilla visited Oman in 2013 and were greeted by sword dancers . Unwell: Oman's Sultan Qaboos bin Said has been forced to seek medical treatment in Germany . Royal visit: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited Muscat in 2010 . The mosque was a gift to the nation by the Sultan to mark the 30th year of his reign and can accommodate a staggering 20,000 worshippers, including 750 women in a private musalla or prayer hall. On Thursday the prince will fly to Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates where he will play in the Sentebale Polo Cup at Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club. Afterwards Harry will attend a fundraising dinner and give a speech. The match is in aid of the charity he set up in 2006 in memory of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, following a gap year visit to Lesotho. The name Sentebale means 'forget me not' in the local dialect, Basotho. Lesotho is a tiny, poverty-stricken and landlocked kingdom in Southern Africa with one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world. Sentebale supports the many thousands of children affected by the AIDS epidemic both directly and though losing their families to the disease. Colourful: Oman is famous for its colourful horse parades, but Prince Harry will now miss out on one . Life expectancy for men and women in the kingdom is just 41 years, one in three children are orphans and there are believed to be more than 40,000 adolescents living with HIV. The Sentebale Cup, which is in its fifth year, is helping to support the Mamohato Programme, which address the emotional and psychological needs of children living with HIV as well as working to reduce the stigma linked to the disease and helping to markedly improve their quality of life. Harry, who plans to make a visit to some of the charity's projects in Lesotho next June, has said he hopes to expand its work to other countries in Africa. It is understood that Harry plans to stay on in Abu Dhabi privately after the official elements of the trip have concluded on Thursday to watch the Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Yas Marina Circuit, which is on this weekend.","Prince Harry arrived in Muscat this morning following an overnight flight .

"Anorexia could be caused by a genetic mutation, according to new research . Anorexia could be caused by a genetic mutation, according to new research. A study of the DNA of more than 3,000 people found the eating disorder may be caused by mutations that interfere with the processing of cholesterol, disrupting mood and diet. The findings, published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, may lead to the development of drugs to treat the condition. Sufferers starve themselves because they believe they are fat, and more than one in ten cases are fatal making it the deadliest of psychiatric illnesses. Just 30 per cent of patients make a full recovery. Although many experts believe the condition is caused by social pressure, there is growing evidence there may also be a genetic link. Researchers analysed genetic information from more than 1,200 anorexia patients and almost 2,000 healthy controls. They looked for variants of genes that had already been linked to feeding behaviour or been flagged up in previous studies. Just a handful of more than 150 genes studied showed signs of a link, but one stand out was the gene EPHX2, which controls an enzyme that regulates the burning of cholesterol. Professor Nicholas Schork, of The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California, said: ‘When we saw that, we thought we might be onto something, because nobody else had reported this gene as having a pronounced role in anorexia.’ Anorexia affects up to one in a hundred women but how it develops is still not fully understood. Professor Schork added: ‘These findings point in a direction probably no one would have considered taking before.’ His researchers followed up with several replication studies, each using a different cohort of anorexia patients and controls, as well as different genetic analysis methods. The scientists continued to find evidence that certain variants of EPHX2 occur more frequently in people with anorexia. A study of the DNA of more than 3,000 people found the eating disorder may be caused by mutations that interfere with the processing of cholesterol, disrupting mood and diet . To help make sense of these findings, they looked at existing data from a large-scale, long-term heart disease study and determined that a subset of the implicated EPHX2 variants have the effect of altering the normal relationship between weight gain and cholesterol levels. Professor Schork said: ‘We thought with further studies this EPHX2 finding might go away, or appear less compelling, but we just kept finding evidence to suggest it plays a role in anorexia.’ It is not yet clear how EPHX2 variants that cause an abnormal metabolism of cholesterol would help trigger or maintain anorexia. But Professor Schork noted people with anorexia often have remarkably high cholesterol levels in their blood, despite being severely malnourished. Anorexia sufferers starve themselves because they believe they are fat, and more than one in ten cases are fatal making it the deadliest of psychiatric illnesses. Just 30 per cent of patients make a full recovery . Moreover, there have been suggestions from other studies weight loss, for example in people with depression, can lead to increases in cholesterol levels. At the same time, there is evidence cholesterol, a basic building block of cells, particularly in the brain, has a positive association with mood. It is possible some anorexics for genetic reasons may feel an improved mood, from having higher cholesterol, by not eating. Professor Schork explained: ‘The hypothesis would be in some anorexics the normal metabolism of cholesterol is disrupted, which could influence their mood as well as their ability to survive despite severe caloric restriction.’ Around 60,000 Britons have anorexia. Nine out of ten sufferers are women, the majority aged 15 to 25.","Anorexia could be caused by a mutation in the gene EPHX2 .

"An unexplained S-shaped object has been spotted high in the sky above the Western Australia coast. The bizarre shape was spotted on the weather radar maps on Wednesday about 30 kilometres west of Rottnest. Forecasters ruled out a strange cloud formation - and locals have already dubbed it the 'Rottnest monster'. The bizarre shape was spotted off the coast of Western Australia, close to Rottnest Island, leading to it being dubbed the Rottnest monster . 'There's no cloud, there's nothing to produce a rain echo, ... which we do see a lot, but not this particular shape,"" the local weather bureau's Neil Bennett told ABC News. 'They don't take on S shapes and things like that. 'The radar that we use are there for the detection of precipitation, it's basically just a beam going out and hitting the rain droplets or ice particles from hail. The WA Weather Group has seized on the photo and retweeted it to their followers. 'Nice that our pet #RottNessMonster has avoided the shark baits. Her name is Susan & she likes to eat plankton,' the group tweeted. 'And I, for one, welcome our new giant sea serpent overlords,' Perth Sunrise Prints tweeted. The strange shape has been dubbed the Rottnest monster for its similarity to the famous image of the Loch Ness Monster . However, the monster was shortlived - a spokesman for the Department of Defence said in a statement today the image was actually a regular training activity involving ships and aircraft designed to prepare a Navy warship for an operational deployment. 'The environmental conditions over the West Australian coast at the time of the activity provided a unique opportunity for this routine activity to be visible on the weather radar display,' he said. 'This exercise is ongoing.'","Radar maps revealed the bizarre S in the sky yesterday .

"When photos of Solange Knowles covered in a rash of painful looking hives surfaced over the weekend, the world suppressed a collective shudder. But according to experts, the condition isn't as rare as you might imagine, with one in six regularly succumbing to the skin condition. Causes can range from extreme heat to freezing cold, as well as stress, allergic reactions and skin infections. Scroll down for video . Solange Knowles put her break out of hives down to having over-heated whilst at her wedding . Solange's sister Beyonce tried to help her younger sister by covering her face in the car . So what caused Solange's? Based on a tweet sent by the star to one fan, heat could have been the culprit. Writing on the social media site, she said:'Got em from turning up x100 during our second line.I was hot,wearing a cape,& happy as hell :).' But over-heating is not the only thing that can trigger an outbreak. Dr Maria Gonzalez, Consultant Dermatologist from the Specialist Skin Clinic, revealed that hives are the result of more than just a hot day out. 'Hives is the common name for a skin condition known as urticaria,' she explained. 'In this condition patients come out in wheals or hives which last for several hours and can be quite itchy or unsightly. 'This is a relatively a common problem as many of us will suffer from hives at some point, nearly all of which will settle spontaneously - usually within six weeks. 'However, some unlucky people suffer which chronic urticaria in that they break out in hives repeatedly over many years. In particularly bad cases hives can join together forming larger red and swollen areas on the skin . The lumps caused by hives can be red and itchy but doctors say antihistamines and soothing creams can help the situation . 'Some known triggers are allergies to things like nuts or as a response to sun exposure. Urticaria may also occur in patients with underlying problems such as thyroid disease.' PurePotions are a 100% skincare brand created by mother Natalie Balmond. Her calendula and comfrey rescue salve is perfect for anyone suffering from hives as it helps to alleviate the itching. It also forms a semi-occlusive barrier over the skin which stops irritants and dirt getting to the affected area. PurePotions are a skin care brand who use 100% natural ingredients . According to Dr Gonzalez, the stress associated with wedding planning may also have played a part in Solange's break out. 'There is a group of patients such as Solange Knowles whose trigger appears to be stress, suggesting a link between stress and our immune system.' Dr Tony Steele, a GP with over 25 years’ experience says that when stress is the trigger for a break out, breathing exercises can help. He said: 'On rare occasions pure stress and anxiety can trigger an outbreak of hives. 'People who experience this problem could try taking a non-sedating antihistamine before a stressful event or avoid stressful event all together. 'Other things which might help are relaxation techniques such as controlled breath and even meditation.' Solange managed to cure hers with a liberal dose of antihistamine Benadryl - a cure she later revealed on Instagram. Referring to her choreographed dance with 10-year-old son Julez, she said: 'Shout out to Benadryl yo, lol. NOTHING was gonna stop me from having my mother and son dance with Julez. 'My baby killed it and will forever remain my favorite dance partner of all time.' According to Dr Steele, the mother-of-one had the right idea. 'Antihistamines can help with the itch, as can soothing creams, such as calamine lotion,' he said. 'In severe prolonged cases anti-inflammatory steroids are prescribed.'","Solange Knowles came out in hives  at the end of her wedding day .

"Two boys who were allegedly kidnapped by their parents last week and taken by boat to Cuba think they went on a 'big adventure', their grandparents revealed today. Four-year-old Cole Hakken and his brother Chase, two, grinned and posed at a press conference in Tampa on Thursday - the first time they have been seen publicly since returning from Cuba. Just two hours earlier, their parents, Joshua and Sharyn Hakken, made their first court appearance in Tampa on kidnapping charges. They remain held without bond. Before the boys appeared, their maternal grandparents Patricia and Bob Hauser revealed that the youngsters do not know they were allegedly kidnapped. Scroll down for video . Safe: Four-year-old Cole and two-year-old Chase grin for cameras after their 'vacation' to Cuba . Back home: Chase and Cole pose with their grandparents, with whom they live, and local law enforcement . 'They have been told that everyone heard about their sailboat trip to Cuba - ""another country"", as they call it,' Mrs Hauser told the press. 'And their airport ride back to America, and that everyone wants to take their picture... We are treating it as if they went on a vacation.' She added that they are letting the boys share details of their 'adventure' in their own time, saying that so far they have not described what they did on the trip. When the boys came out of the house, they smiled and waved at the cameras - and Cole even dropped to the ground to lay on his side and pose for pictures. 'Thank you for taking my picture,' Chase said quietly as they were ushered back into the home. Mrs Hauser told the press that the boys have undergone health checks and are well - aside from a few bug bites. She added that authorities also retrieved the family dog, who was dehydrated. Protective: Patricia and Robert Hauser escort their grandchildren during a news conference by their home . Taken: The boys were allegedly kidnapped by their parents after their grandmother gained custody . She said it had been a fraught week since the boys were allegedly snatched by their parents - and she described her relief at finally knowing they were safe. 'They called us from Cuba and let us talk to the boys before they ever left Cuba,' she said. 'We were just smiling from ear to ear and couldn't wait for that plane to arrive.' The boys had been living at the Hauser's home since last year, but Mrs Hauser was granted permanent custody of Chase and Cole on Tuesday of last week.

"A Florida man has been arrested for imprisoning and trying to perform an exorcism on his elderly girlfriend. David Edward Benes, 54, is accused of imprisoning his 80-year-old girlfriend in their Holiday, FL., home Sept 16 and 17 while trying to perform a drunken, violent two day exorcism on her, according to a police report. This is not the first time he's run afoul of the law for drinking and violence. The couple has lived together for three years, the report said. A history of violence: David Edward Benes appears to have been in court multiple times on battery and alcohol-related charges . Police arrived at the house of horrors Sept 17 to find the battered elderly woman’s arms covered in bruises and scratches, said the report. Mr Benes was ‘too intoxicated to talk,’ the arresting officer wrote in the arrest report. The allegedly possessed woman told police she and Mr Benes were involved in a physical altercation the previous evening that ended when her bombed boyfriend physically restrained her because he was trying to ‘exorcise her and get the devil out of her’ against her will.’ The helpless woman was then told by Mr Benes she was not allowed to leave the house, took her car keys, dismantled the garage door opener and even took the batteries out of all the phones to prevent her from calling for help. The victim then awoke in the morning to Mr Benes again ‘exorcising’ her,’ she told cops. Police observed bruising and scratching on the woman’s arms, as well as the batteries having been removed from the house phones, they wrote in the report. Mr Benes later claimed he was black out drunk and that his elderly girlfriend had hit him first, said the report. Charged with battery on a person 65-years or older, and various other charges, Mr Benes is currently in jail without bail. A MailOnline search of criminal records yielded a lengthy, violent history dating back to 1992 under the name David Edward Benes. After his first battery charge was abandoned that year, Mr Benes was twice convicted of battery in 1994 and found guilty of DUI in 1997. Mr Benes was also twice found guilty of violating an order of protection, once in 2012 and again earlier this month. He was also found guilty in 1998 of driving with an open container of alcohol, records showed.","David Edward Benes, 54, violently held down his elderly girlfriend while trying to 'get the devil out of her'

"Minnesota Vikings' star running back Adrian Peterson has been suspended without pay for at least the remainder of 2014 season after he was spared jail for hitting his son, the NFL said today. Peterson, 29, has 'shown no meaningful remorse' for his conduct, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement released on Tuesday. He will not be considered for reinstatement before April 15 for violating the NFL Personal Conduct Policy in an 'incident of abusive discipline that he inflicted on his four-year-old son'. The league said in its statement that Peterson is allowed to appeal its decision in writing within three days and if he does, he will continue to be paid pending a decision. Scroll down for video . Suspended: Adrian Peterson, pictured outside court after he avoided jail earlier this month, has been suspended without pay after he was indicted for disciplining his four-year-old son with a wooden switch . The NFL Players Association swiftly announced on Tuesday that it does plan to appeal the decision and will demand a neutral party to hear the appeal. The announcement comes two weeks after Peterson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor reckless assault - down from a felony charge of child abuse - for disciplining his son with a wooden switch. The child, who has not been named, was left with cuts, marks and bruising to his thighs, back and one of his testicles, according to court records, and backlash from the public was strong. In his letter to Peterson, Goodell said he had reached his decision because the victim was just four and significantly smaller than the professional athlete. 'While an adult may have a number of options when confronted with abuse – to flee, to fight back, or to seek help from law enforcement – none of those options is realistically available to a four-year old child,' Goodell wrote. He added that the wooden switch was essentially a weapon he had used against the boy. Decision: NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, pictured last month, notified Peterson of the decision on Tuesday and said the league will help him with treatment but that he needed his full engagement . Goodell also expressed his concern that the player had shown no awareness of the harm he had caused, and had repeatedly stood up for his actions. 'We are prepared to put in place a program that can help you to succeed, but no program can succeed without your genuine and continuing engagement,' he said. 'You must commit yourself to your counseling and rehabilitative effort, properly care for your children, and have no further violations of law or league policy.' After the court's decision on November 4, Peterson received two years of probation, plus a $4,000 fine and requirement to complete parenting classes and 80 hours of community service. 'I'm just glad this is over,' Peterson said after the plea deal was announced in Texas. 'I can put this behind me, and me and my family can move forward.' Accused: Peterson (pictured with one of his sons) was initially charged with felony child abuse but it was dropped to misdemeanor reckless assault. He said he was disciplining his son as he had been in Texas . Injuries: An image shared by the Houston police shows the injuries he allegedly inflicted on the boy . Peterson's attorney, Rusty Hardin, added: 'Adrian wants to get on with his life and have his relationship with his son and get back to playing football,' said after the plea agreement was reached. Earlier this month, the NFL informed Peterson that he would remain on paid leave from the Vikings until they concluded their review of his case under their personal conduct policy. His weekly in-season salary came to more than $690,000. Tuesday's decision came after Goodell was criticized for his initial leniency after Baltimore's Ray Rice knocked out his now-wife in an elevator, in a harrowing incident that was caught on camera. Weeks after handing Rice a two-game suspension, Goodell announced in August he was toughening the league's policy on domestic violence that now calls for a six-game suspension without pay for a first domestic violence offense. The league boss was under intense scrutiny for how he handled punishment for Peterson. Star player: Peterson, pictured breaking a tackle against the Bears last December, was named MVP in 2012 . By his side: He is pictured with his wife, Ashley Brown Peterson, after leaving a hearing last month in Texas . But it hadn't been clear how the league would deal with Peterson because he had maintained he intended no harm in seeking to discipline his son the way he was as a child growing up in Texas. His plea was not an admission of guilt, and the felony was reduced to a misdemeanor. After the accusations initially emerged, a major Vikings sponsor suspended its partnership, while other corporations expressed concerns to the team and the league, and Peterson was dropped as an endorser of several brands. The Vikings have been quiet since Peterson's plea agreement, stating only that they will speak about his situation 'at the appropriate time'.","The Minnesota Vikings' running back, 29, will not be considered for reinstatement before April 15, the league said on Tuesday .

"If your ancestors were members of the upper class, chances are you will be - even centuries after they've died. Researchers have found that a person's surname is a strong indicator of social status, going back  generations, and a status from years ago can still exert its influence on a person's life today. In fact, the study found that social status is more consistently passed down among families over hundreds of years, than height. Scroll down for video . The researchers analysed the surnames of students who attended Oxford (pictured) and Cambridge universities between 1170 and 2012 and rich property owners between 1236 and 1299. They found that a person's surname is a strong indicator of social status, going back multiple generations . The results were published by Gregory Clark from the University of California, Davis and Neil Cummins from the London School of Economics in the journal Human Nature. They used the Oxbridge attendance of people with rare English surnames to track social mobility from 1170 to 2012. They discovered that social mobility in England has always been slow, and today it is not much greater than it was in pre-industrial times. Social mobility is the movement of individuals, or families, between social classes. The researchers analysed the surnames of students who attended Oxford and Cambridge universities between 1170 and 2012, rich property owners between 1236 and 1299, as well as the national probate registry since 1858. These databases were used as they indicate that the people included on them are of a high social standing, as well as highly educated. The names on them were also cross-referenced with each other to get a wider, overall picture about a family's social standing. Rare surnames studied included Atthill, Bunduck, Balfour, Bramston, Cheslyn, and Conyngham. They found that social status is consistently passed down among families over multiple generations. For example, members of the Bunduck family attended the universities consistently from the 12th century until the modern day - shown because their name regularly appeared on the register throughout. This suggests that the Bunducks of the 12th century had enough standing and intelligence to attend the university, but so did their ancestor's ancestors. The Bunducks were additionally found on the rich property owners' database, which also suggested they were of a higher class during the 13th century. And again during the 19th century, as seen by the presence on the probate registry. Social status is generally seen as a ranking of families and is based on a variety of elements including education, their income, wealth, occupation, and health. Mr Clark and Mr Cummings used databases to calculate the social trajectory of families with rare English surnames over the past 28 generations. They analysed the surnames of students who attended Oxford and Cambridge universities between 1170 and 2012, rich property owners between 1236 and 1299, as well as the national probate registry since 1858. These databases were used as they indicate that the people included on them are of a high social standing, as well as highly educated. The names on them were also cross-referenced with each to get a wider, overall picture about a family's social standing. Rare surnames studied included Atthill, Bunduck, Balfour, Bramston, Cheslyn, and Conyngham. The researchers chose rare surnames as it was more likely that the different records would refer to direct descendants. They found that social status is consistently passed down among families over multiple generations. For example, members of the Bunduck family attended the universities consistently from the 12th century until the modern day - shown because their name regularly appeared on the register throughout. This suggests that the Bunducks of the 12th century had enough standing and intelligence to attend the university, but so did their ancestor's ancestors. The Bunducks were additionally found on the rich property owners' database, which also suggested they were of a higher class. 'Strong forces of familial culture, social connections, and genetics must connect the generations,' said Mr Clark. 'Even more remarkable is the lack of a sign of any decline in status persistence across major institutional changes, such as the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth century, the spread of universal schooling in the late nineteenth century, or the rise of the social democratic state in the twentieth century,' added Mr Cummins. 'Status persistence measured by education status is just as strong now as in the pre-industrial era.' They said their findings show there 'really are quasi-physical ""Laws of Inheritance.""' This chart plots the relative frequency of the selected surnames compared to their educational status. This is plotted against the general population and the elite groups over two different generations. The study found that social status is more consistently passed down among families over hundreds of years, than height .","Experts analysed the social movement of unusual surnames across the UK .

"Taylor Swift's controversial appointment as a tourism ambassador for New York City has been defended by legendary musician Billy Joel. The 24-year-old singer faced a huge backlash after being installed as the Global Welcome Ambassador for New York in October  after it was revealed she has only been living in the city for little more than 12 months. Critics dismissed her suitability for the role, questioning how much she knew about the city given that she was born in Pennsylvania and launched her career in Nashville. Billy Joel, pictured with his daughter Alexa Ray Joel, is a New Yorker and was born in the Bronx . But long-time New Yorker Billy Joel, who was born in The Bronx, grew up in Long Island and now owns a house in Centre Island near Manhattan, said that the city's residents should 'let her in'. The 65-year-old said: 'I see the New York press going, ""Taylor Swift is going to be the new New York representative?'' the singer told USA Today. 'You snoots. Let her in. That's what New York is all about. I say, 'Welcome'.' Joel also praised Swift's songwriting talents. 'She catches a lot of junk, maybe because she's so popular with young girls. But I like what she's projecting. I respect what she's doing.' I heart NYC: Taylor Swift, pictured enjoying the sights  in August, is a passionate New York fan . It was last month that Tayor Swift announced she had been appointed as an ambassador for the city during an episode of Good Morning America. She said at the time: 'I'm still learning, but I'm so enthusiastic about this city that when I love something, I'm very vocal about it. 'New York was a huge landscape for what became this album. It's affected my life in ways I'm not even aware of fully.' The singer, who recently bought a £12million apartment in the trendy Tribeca area, also penned a song called Welcome to New York, which provided the opening track to her new album, 1989. Giving the thumbs up: Taylor Swift is excited about her new role as New York's Global Welcome Ambassador . She added: 'I started the album with Welcome to New York because New York has been an important landscape and location for the story of my life in the last couple of years. 'It's like an electric city, and I approached moving there with such wide-eyed optimism. I saw New York as a place of endless potential and possibilities, and you can hear that reflected in this music and in this song.' As part of her role, the singer presented a series of videos for New York's official tourism agency, NYC Go, including one in which the singer explains some common slang words, such as 'stoop' (commonly known as a porch) and 'bodega', the 24-hour corner shops which sell 'almost anything'. The singer grew up in Long Island and now owns a house in Centre Island near Manhattan, has defended Taylor Swift's appointment as ambassador for New York City . 'A lot of heart': The singer explains that New Yorkers are friendly to tourists and the city is easy to get around . In another video, she assures visitors that in New York, 'people are very friendly and there's also a lot of heart here. And it's easy to get around. People will help you if you ask for help.' But the move provoked a furious reaction from New Yorkers were shocked that she was selected to represent the city. Head of tourism: Dixon is CEO of NYC & Company . 'I'm incensed! It's insulting,' said Twisted Sister singer Dee Snider, who was born in Queens. He told the New York Daily News: 'She doesn't have any life experience here, or connection to the town. 'There's so many others — Jerry Seinfeld, for instance, if you want a big name,' Snider added. 'But Taylor Swift is the pop culture queen, so she moves into town, and she's the ambassador.' The NYC Go Facebook page was flooded with negative responses. 'Taylor Swift has nothing to do with NYC, she is a bad representation. Get a real NY'er instead,' commented Ilana Vickers. 'Seems like a truly ridiculous ambassador,' wrote another poster, Kiersten Kehrer. But NYC Go stood by their decision, saying: 'We couldn't have asked for a better synergy between Taylor and NYC & Company to tell our story about what makes New York City, New York City.' 'This is a campaign targeting visitors to New York City rather than locals,' they told MailOnline Travel. 'There's a separate campaign encouraging locals to explore their own city that celebrates the views of locals.' 'What makes New York City New York City is that it is unlike anywhere else in the world. 'It's almost like this city has its own heartbeat. You can find fashion that inspires you, art that inspires you, humanity that inspires you. 'Everywhere you look. It's impossible not to fall in love or be affected by something in New York City. 'I think what brought me to New York is still a little bit of a mystery to me. 'Every day I would wake up with this feeling, like I need to be in New York. It pulled me here like a magnet. 'I was intimidated by the fact that it was bright and bold and loud, and now I know that I should run towards things like that. 'I should run towards things that are absolutely overwhelmingly electric. 'There's so much happening right in front of me, so many stories playing out that for my writing it definitely helped inspire an album that is by far the most proud of in my career.' The head of New York tourism also waded into the row, saying the pop star was a suitable choice given that it is a 'city of immigrants'. Fred Dixon, President and CEO of NYC & Company, the official marketing and tourism organisation for the City of New York, said that Swift was chosen because of her newcomer status, not in spite of it. 'New York is a city of immigrants, not many of us were born in New York – we've all followed our dreams there.' Dixon revealed that Taylor's new role came about after he met her manager by chance, which led to an invitation to the singer's recently-purchased apartment, where he first listened to her song dedicated to New York. 'Taylor's song Welcome To New York is written from the perspective of a newcomer, that starry-eyed optimism and overwhelming energy you feel when you first come to New York, and she wanted to share that,' Dixon added. 'It's like we wrote it for our own brand,' he said, adding that Swift's reach on social media and her 'authentic' engagement with her huge following is something that money can't buy.","The 24-year-old singer faced a huge backlash over the appointment .

"Falling book sales are behind President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama's drop in income which fell by 21 percent in 2013. The White House released the couple's most recent federal tax return on Friday which show the Obama's reported an adjusted gross income of just over $481,000. Although the bulk of their earnings came from the President's salary, the main cause for their drop in salary was as a result of the President Obama earning more than $150,000 less in 2013 than the previous year. Their total earnings is a fraction of what the President was earning just four years ago when Obama's tax return showed an income of $5.5 million. Low point: In 2013, President Obama had the lowest total income that he has had in the past three years since his book sales dropped down to less than half of what they were in 2012 . 2009Adjusted gross income:          $5,505,409*Federal income tax paid:        $1,792,414Charitable donations:             $329,100 to 40 different charities.*According to the White House, the vast majority was proceeds from the sale of the president’s books 2010Adjusted gross income:          $1,728,096*Federal income tax paid:        $453,770Charitable donations:             $245,075 to 36 different charities*According to the White House, the vast majority of the family’s income was the proceeds from the sale of the president’s books. 2011Adjusted gross income:          $789,674*Federal income tax paid:        $162,074Charitable donations:             $172,130 to 39 different charitiesAccording to the White House, about half of the first family’s income was the president’s salary; the other half is from sales proceeds of the president’s books. 2012Adjusted gross income:          $608,611Federal income tax paid:        $112,214Charitable donations:             $150,034 to 33 different charities 2013Adjusted gross income:          $481,098Federal income tax paid:        $98,169Charitable donations:             $59,251 to 32 different charities . Sales of the President's book dropped from $258,722 in 2012 down to $104,000 in 2013. While his current books are still earning an income, it was expected that the royalties would lessen as time went on. On the other hand, when Mr Obama finally leaves office in just under three years, the books that he writes will be sure to make him and his family a considerable sum of money. Estimates are currently being made that an advance for his first book will top $15-million with further royalties on top of that. When it comes to 2013's tax return, the couple paid $98,169 in taxes on their $481,098 income for the . 2013 fiscal year, according to details released by the White House on . Friday. It means they paid an effective federal income tax rate of 20.4 per cent. By comparison, the Obamas reported income of $662,076 and paid $112,214 in federal taxes at a rate of 18.4 percent for 2012. In 2011, they earned $844,585 . while paying $162,074 in federal taxes. After deductions, the couple's . adjusted gross income was $608,611 in 2012 and $789,674 in 2011. Obama's . annual presidential salary is $400,000. He had planned to return 5 . percent of his pay in 2013 as a gesture of solidarity with federal . government workers who faced unpaid leave amid deep spending cuts. Obama reported $394,796 in 2013 wages, and it was not immediately clear if or how he returned any portion of those earnings. Because . his overall taxable income this year came in at $333,329 that keeps him . well below the $450,000 mark where individuals begin being taxed at the . raised 39.6 per cent rate that the President boosted in the . 'millionaire's tax' that his administration put into effect not long . ago. The 42-page . document shows the Obamas reported donating $59,251 to 32 charities . which equates to 12.3 per cent of their adjusted gross income. That figure is $90,000 less than the . couple donated to charity last year, which may be a result of . his falling book sales. Their largest charitable gift, $8,751, went to the Fisher House Foundation, which supports military families. Among . the Obamas' other notable charitable contributions were $5,000 to the . Sidwell Friends School, the exclusive private school where daughters . Malia and Sasha are enrolled, $4,000 to the American Red Cross and . $2,000 to One Fund Boston, which was created last year to aid victims of . the Boston Marathon bombings. The Obamas also released their Illinois income tax return showing they paid $23,328 in income taxes to their home state. Separately, . Vice President Joe Biden and his wife Jill paid $96,378 in federal tax . last year on adjusted gross income of $407,009. Giving back: The Obamas gave less to charity this year than previous years since their giving rate has always been reflective of their annual income, but they gave the most to the Fisher House Foundation which supports military families (Michelle seen at one of their events in 2012) They paid an effective federal income tax rate of 23.7 per cent, according to their tax returns.

"The brutal hatchet attack on two NYPD officers by a U.S. Navy veteran is being considered an act of terror, the FBI's director has confirmed. Zale Thompson was shot dead in a New York street last month after wounding one officer  in the head and slashing another in the arm. FBI Director James Comey said Thompson had been watching Islamic State beheading videos and other radical jihadist material online, adding there is 'no doubt that played a role' in the attack. 'There is no doubt it was terrorism,' he added. Scroll Down to See Report . Officers piecing together the life of New York hatchet attacker Zale Thompson (pictured) say he visited 277 websites to do with ISIS, beheadings and jihad before attacking cops three weeks ago . But Comey said Thompson had also been motivated by black power sentiments. The 32-year-old appeared to be seeking 'inspiration from foreign terrorist sources like ISIL (ISIS), but there is also evidence he was focused on black separatist ideology', he added. Comey also spoke of the wider threat to Americans from ISIS who he said were continuing with their aspirations to attack the U.S., although he said there was no specific plot at this stage. Highlighting the terror group's 'slick' propaganda machine, he said: 'They broadcast their hate in 23 different languages. 'They are very active in social media so that that's the primary dimension of the ISIL threat.' He made his comments a day after U.S. aid worker Peter Kassig was beheaded by ISIS in Syria, it was reported by NBC New York. A preliminary report into Thompson's October 23 assault initially concluded the 32-year-old, who used the name Zaim Farouq Abdul-malik on social media, was influenced by anti-government or black power sentiments. Thompson was arrested (seen here) in southern California six times between 2002 and 2003, likely for domestic disputes, New York Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said. However, a four page intelligence report from the NYPD later confirmed Thompson's self-radicalisation and his creeping obsession with terror outfits such as Al Qaeda and ISIS. According to the report, seen by Fox News, Thompson, 'may have held a long-standing interest in violent jihad.' In their initial investigation, the NYPD discovered 277 online search terms by the former US Navy serviceman that referred directly to jihad. The intelligence reports states that 'Thompson used internet search engines to query specific terms including but not limited to 'lone wolf', 'jihad' and 'jihad against the police.' Thompson's chilling attack was carried out in complete silence before he was shot dead after running up to four officers in New York brandishing a hatchet, before wounding cop Kenneth Healey, 25, in the head, and slashing another in the arm. Mr Healey was taken to hospital on in critical condition but has now been released. While the report raises fears of more lone wolf attacks by self-radicalized Americans, 'there is no evidence that Thompson conspired with other individuals to carry out the attack.' It reveals that Thompson's favorite internet searches were for terror groups such as al Qaeda, its Somalian branch, al-Shabaab and ISIS. The NYPD also found that Thompson's searches online brought up terms such as 'jihad against the infidels,' and 'fatwa against Americans' and 'death to America in Arabic.' Others searches such as 'is Saudi Arabia a member of the United Nations' and 'Saudi Arabic 69th general assembly un' raise the frightening possibility that Thompson may have wanted to target the United Nations in New York City. Investigators say Thompson stalked cops for hours in New York before launching his assault as they were having their pictures taken - wounding Kenneth Healey (second left) in the head . Thompson can be seen dead on the street, face up in a green coat, moments after attacking the officers. Kenneth Healey is laying face down with a hatchet gash in his head . Also added as part of the report is a photograph which shows that Thompson was stalking the four cops before the attack on the streets. In addition to the serious injuries Officer Healey suffered, Officer Joseph Meeker, 24, was also struck in the arm. Both are now recovering. 'This was jihadist inspired. Plain and simple,' said Frank Cilluffo, associate vice president and director of the Homeland Security Policy Institute of George Washington University to Fox News. 'He had so many search terms in this respect, I think it would be very difficult to suggest that it's anything but.' After the twin attack on Canadian soldiers last month, the NYPD has said it is stepping up its protocols and safety procedures. Thompson still holds his hatchet in his hand after being shot dead by two NYPD officers after he slashed two cops in an ambush attack . 'As I understand it, NYPD is already instituting new actions, and new steps where instead of patrolling alone, they are going to have group patrols, and stay together even, even simple measures such as having lunch. They are hoping that people will stick together, so you can have two eyes and ears on potential threat,' Cilluffo said. Chilling pictures taken seconds before the October 23 attacks show Mr Healy standing along with four fellow officers before they were attacked by Thompson. Dominick Williams took the photos after spotting the officers and asking them to stand for a picture. Seconds later, Thompson ran up to the cops - who where standing against a wall in Jamaica, Queens - and started swinging a sharp hand axe. Mr Healey, a rookie who had been on the force for just four months before he was injured, was taken to hospital in critical condition but has since recovered . Weapon: This is the hatchet that Thompson used to carry out his attack on the two cops in Queens, New York City . Mr Williams says he scrambled for safety as the officers wrestled with Thompson. He hacked Officer Joseph Meeker, 24, in the arm before burying the hatchet in Healey's skull. Mr Williams' camera captured the frantic aftermath of the attack. Officer Healey - who had just four months on the job - can be seen laying face down on the sidewalk - a bloody gash in his head. Another officer can be seen tending to his fallen comrade, holding a cloth over the head wound. The pictures also capture Thompson dead on the sidewalk. His body is face up with the hatchet, still in his had, laid across his chest.","Zale Thompson, 32, attacked four officer in Queens, New York, last month .

"A Virginia woman faces a federal charge after being accused of promoting the Islamic State in social media and offering to help an undercover agent get a friend into Syria to join the extremist group. Heather Elizabeth Coffman of Henrico County made an initial appearance in U.S. District Court on Monday and was ordered held until a Wednesday afternoon detention hearing, court documents show. She is charged with making a materially false statement about an offense involving terrorism. According to an affidavit filed by an FBI agent, Coffman promoted the organization known as ISIS on several Facebook accounts she maintained under various names. Scroll down for video . Twisted loyalties? Heather Elizabeth Coffman, 29, is charged with making a false statement regarding an offense involving international or domestic terrorism. Coffman, it seems, was caught in a sting and unknowingly offered to help an undercover FBI agent connect someone with the Islamic State in Syria . Those posts prompted a sting by the agent, who posed as an Islamic State backer. The agent wrote in the affidavit that Coffman talked about making arrangements for a man she identified as her husband to train and fight with the Islamic State in Syria. She said the man, who is not named in court papers, backed out when the couple split up. Coffman offered to make similar arrangements for the FBI agent and a fictitious friend. The agent told Coffman that his friend wanted to fight with the terrorist group and become a 'shaheed,' or martyr. The agent said Coffman encouraged him to support the friend's plan and offered to use her contacts to help him achieve his goal. Attractive proposition? It is unclear what cultivated Coffman's interest in the Islamic State or whether she possessed the means to connect anyone with the group but she had been posting 'positive' things about them . Worrying trend: According to the FBI affidavit, Coffman told an undercover agent that she had previously arranged for a man she termed her 'husband' to travel to Turkey so he could meet with Islamic State facilitators and eventually make his way into Syria . After several meetings between the agent and Coffman, two other FBI agents interviewed the woman at her workplace. She denied supporting any terrorist groups, the affidavit said. Coffman's attorney, Mark Schmidt, said in a telephone interview that he had not yet spoken in depth with his client about the allegations. 'As I understand it, this is in connection with Facebook and issues that arose from Facebook,' he said. 'To the best of my knowledge, Ms. Coffman has never left the country. I don't know if she even left Virginia.' The FBI affidavit says Coffman 'is suspected of conspiring and attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham ('ISIS') a foreign terrorist organization.' One of Coffman's Facebook accounts listed her job and education, translated, as 'jihad for Allah's sake,' the agent wrote. Her accounts also featured photos of the Islamic State flag and images of men holding AK-47s. One Facebook friend asked why she posted such pictures and she replied, 'I love ISIS!' According to the affidavit, she also said she got her sister to like the Islamic State and 'my dad is a little angry because I got her into all this jihad stuff.'","Heather Coffman, of Henrico County, is charged with lying to federal agents .

'We really approached this first and foremost about why would a woman want to wear this everyday, and how can it be incorporated into her wardrobe,' Humberto Leon, creative director at Opening Ceremony, said in a phone interview last week. As well as lapis stones, obsidian and an 18k gold coating, the devices include a sapphire curved screen on the inside of the wrist that displays text messages, calendar items and events from Google and Facebook, and recommendations of nearby restaurants and stores from Yelp. After Intel was late to smartphones and tablets in recent years, Chief Executive Brian Krzanich has been determined to make sure the top chipmaker is at the forefront of future trends in mobile computing. Krzanich gave the green light for the chipmaker to develop the bracelet with Opening Ceremony after his wife wore a prototype for several days and liked it, he recently said. The feminine communications accessory will be available by early December in the United States and will retail exclusively at Opening Ceremony New York and Los Angeles, select Barneys New York locations, and online at Openingceremony.us and Barneys.com. 'Our pioneering collaboration with Opening Ceremony and the introduction of this category-defining smart jewelry piece advances wearable technology as a distinctively stylish accessory that places importance on both aesthetics and functionality,' said Ayse Ildeniz of Intel . 'MICA captures Intel's philosophy that technology should enhance jewelry in order to make wearable technology truly 'wantable,' in addition to seamless and productive.'

The clasp hides a USB port to recharge the device, which can run  for two days on a single charge. One style features black water snake skin, pearls from China and lapis stones from Madagascar, while the other style features white water snake skin, tiger's eye from South Africa and obsidian from Russia. 'MICA acts as an extension of a customer's smartphone, for those times when it's not convenient to carry with you,' said Chris Penrose, senior vice president, Internet of Things, AT&T. 'It allows customers to receive texts and email notifications so that they can stay connected, while still wearing a fashionable jewelry piece to almost any occasion.' Incoming alerts discreetly vibrate the bracelet instead of making a noise. Its $495 price tag includes a two-year data plan with AT&T, which means it does not rely on a smartphone for connectivity. As well as working with Opening Ceremony, Intel in March bought fitness bracelet maker Basis Science and it has teamed up with watch retailer Fossil Group to develop other wearable computing devices. The bracelets, which Intel says have a battery life up to two days, will be sold starting by early December through Opening Ceremony and Barney's upscale department stores.

"Cameraman Simon Cumbers (pictured) was 36 when he was killed in the terrorist attack in the Saudi Arabia capital Riyadh . A gunman who shot dead BBC cameraman Simon Cumbers while he was filming a report in Saudi Arabia has been sentenced to death following nearly 10 years of legal delays. Adil Sa'ad Al-Dubayti Al Mutayri has been handed down a sentence of death for his role in the 2004 attack which killed Mr Cumbers and paralysed his colleague Frank Gardner. Mr Gardner, the BBC security correspondent, has now said the sentence should help to draw a line under the tragedy and provide 'some comfort' to his former colleague's widow and family. Mr Cumbers, a 36-year-old cameraman who had also worked for ITN and Channel 4, was killed instantly and Mr Gardner wounded by a shot that shattered his thigh bone in an ambush while they were filming a piece on Al-Qaeda near the capital Riyadh in June 2004. All but one of the gang responsible - one of whom fired several more shots into Mr Gardner as he lay on the floor - have since died in shootouts or by blowing themselves up, the correspondent told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'There is one who has been imprisoned for nine years and he was given the death sentence yesterday for crimes against the state,' Mr Gardner said, at the end of a trial in which the killer was one of several accused of a number of crimes. 'There is an appeals process that they will go through but he is not contesting the judgment at all. 'He is completely unreformed, unrepentant so it looks like that will probably be it, which I think draws a bit of a line under the whole thing.' He went on: 'I am glad that the criminal justice process is finally coming to an end. 'It has taken them forever and I hope that that gives some comfort to the family and widow of my wonderful cameraman Simon Cumbers because he was a lovely guy, brilliant cameraman, utterly professional, he didn't have a bad bone in his body and he did not deserve to be shot dead by terrorists like that.'

Simon Cumbers, pictured left at Basra International Airport in 2003, while right is Frank Gardner, the BBC's security correspondent, who was paralysed in the attack . In a family statement issued to Irish broadcaster RTE, Mr Cumbers' father said: 'I have mixed feelings about the sentencing. 'On the one hand, I am pleased that the murderer has had his fate decided and that the long wait is over. 'It won't bring Simon back, but it puts an end to the waiting.

"For many couples, bumping into an old flame can be something of an awkward affair. But it would seem that the marriage of Kate and William is built of sterner stuff than most. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended a wedding on Saturday where there were no fewer than four of their former partners. Feeling awkward? William and Kate look out from under an umbrella at a wedding attended by no fewer than four of their former partners .

Star attraction: Crowds gather to watch the royal couple arrive . The wedding, also attended by Pippa Middleton, was of Kate’s friend from Marlborough College, Alice St John Webster and Gerald Alvenel in a picturesque Somerset village. But also amongst the 300 guests were Prince William’s former girlfriends Olivia Hunt and Rose Farquhar, along with Kate’s previous love-interests Henry Ropner and Willem Marx. Aspiring actress Miss Farquhar, 28, dated William, 30, after he left Eton in the summer of 2000. Miss Hunt, 28, a writer, dated the Duke briefly before Kate at St Andrews.

Mr Marx, 29, a journalist, was 30-year-old Kate’s first boyfriend at Marlborough and baronet’s son Mr Ropner, 30, is rumoured to have dated Kate when she and William separated in 2007. For the wedding, in the village of Bishops Lydeard, near Taunton, Kate wore her favourite nude LK Bennett shoes and a £490 blossom print silk chiffon dress by London-based ethical fashion company Beulah along with a Jane Corbett white hat.

William, who looked smart in a morning suit, shielded his wife from the rain with an umbrella as they made their way into the church.

"A self-confessed murderer lashed out in the courtroom Monday after he was handed a 50-to-100 year prison sentence for slaying his girlfriend, a mother-of-five, and dumping her body in the garbage.

But Assistant Kent County Prosecutor Kellee Koncki urged the judge not to give the killer a lesser sentence because he confessed. Rather, she asked Redford to sentence him to what would result in a lifetime in prison. Maze went missing on March 19. Less than two months later, Grand Rapids police said they believed her body had been incinerated and dumped in a landfill after Hoskins put it in a Dumpster. According to mlive.com, Koncki argued that Hoskins' motive in the slaying was that he wanted to stop her talking to police after he allegedly assaulted the father of two of her children. She said the violent strangulation was premeditated. Apology: Before learning his fate, Hoskins, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, offered a weeping apology to the family of Maze . Lies: He insisted he loved the woman and didn't meant to take her life . Redford also admonished Hoskins for dumping the body, robbing the family of a chance to have a proper funeral for their loved one. Maze' mother, Wanda Rose, spoke before Hoskins was sentenced and recalled the difficult task of trying to explain to her grandchildren about their mother's death. Hoskins said in his piece that he loved Maze and worked hard to support her and her daughter. 'Before this happened, everybody looked at me as a good person,' Hoskins said.

"Fancy a vape, bae? Or perhaps you're a slacktivist who'd prefer to discuss the indyref? The word vape has been named the Oxford English Dictionaries word of the year, beating bae, a term of endearment for a romantic partner, and indyref - used to describe the poll on Scottish independence. Researchers found that use of the word vape, meaning to inhale from an e-cigarette, has doubled in a year reflecting the meteoric rise of popularity - and scrutiny - of electronic cigarettes. This year has also seen the rise of 'slacktivism' - a political or social movement which requires little time or involvement, such as signing an online petition or joining a campaign group on a social media website. Scroll down for video . Oxford Dictionaries has announced vape as its international word of the year, reflecting the meteoric rise of popularity - and scrutiny - of electronic cigarettes . Judy Pearsall, editorial director for Oxford Dictionaries, said: 'As vaping has gone mainstream, with celebrities from Lindsay Lohan to Barry Manilow giving it a go, and with growing public debate on the public dangers and the need for regulation, so the language usage of the word vape and related terms in 2014 has shown a marked increase.' When used as a verb vape means inhaling and exhaling the vapour produced by e-cigarettes, while it can also be used as a noun to refer to the devices themselves. Language research found that the use of the word vape has more than doubled this year compared to 2013. Associated phrases have also developed including vape pen and vape shop, while the 'retronym' phrase tobacco cigarette has even begun to resurface in order to draw a distinction between traditional cigarettes and electronic devices. The word of the year does not need to have been coined in the last year but must have become prominent or notable during that time. Vape was added to the website OxfordDictionaries.com in August 2014 and is currently being considered for inclusion in future editions of the official Oxford English Dictionary. In fact the word vape dates back to the 1980s. Its earliest known use is in an article titled Why Do People Smoke? in New Society in 1983 in which the author, Rob Stepney, used the word to describe a hypothetical device being explored at the time. Indyref - used to describe the poll on Scottish independence - was also shortlisted for the title . He wrote presciently of 'an inhaler or non-combustible cigarette, looking much like the real thing, but...delivering a metered dose of nicotine vapour. (The new habit, if it catches on, would be known as vaping)'. Bae originated in African-American English and has been propelled into global usage through social media and lyrics in hip-hop and R&B music. It is thought that it most likely originated as a shortened form of baby or babe, but is sometimes interpreted as an acronym for 'before anyone else'. Come Get It Bae is the name of a song by Pharrell Williams featuring Miley Cyrus. Referring to indyref, researchers said it was 'inevitable that vocabulary around the subject of the Scottish independence referendum would make its mark on the lexicon'. The candidates for the word of the year are drawn initially from the Oxford Dictionaries New Monitor Corpus, a research programme which collects around 150 million words of current English in use each month, using automated search criteria to scan new web content. Sophisticated software allows experts to identify new and emerging words on a daily basis and examine the shifts that occur in geography, register, and frequency of use. The 2013 word of the year was selfie. The term 'contactless' has also risen to prominence this year thanks to technologies that allow a smart card or mobile phone to contact wirelessly . Other shortlisted words were: . budtender (noun): A person whose job is to serve customers in a cannabis dispensary or shop. This word has come to the fore following moves to legalise the drug for medical use in some US states. It combines bud - slang for marijuana - and tender - as in bartender. normcore (noun): A trend in which ordinary, unfashionable clothing is worn as a deliberate fashion statement. Oxford Dictionaries said use of the word peaked in 2014 and remains 'very much alive' despite predictions from fashion pundits that the trend is over. contactless (adjective): Relating to or involving technologies that allow a smart card or mobile phone to contact wirelessly to an electronic reader, typically in order to make a payment. Usage peaked in September, when the technology was rolled out across London's transport network. slacktivism (noun): Actions performed via the Internet in support of a political or social cause but regarded as requiring little time or involvement, for example signing an online petition or joining a campaign group on a social media website. Oxford Dictionaries cited the Ice Bucket Challenge and the No Makeup Selfie as examples.","Oxford Dictionaries has announced vape as international word of the year .

"The full horror of the 9/11 terror attack witnessed by Navy Yard gunman Aaron Alexis that could have caused his PTSD has been revealed for the first time by his stepfather. In the first interview by a member of the killer's family, Frank Calderon, 47, said his stepson was going up the escalator from the subway station below the World Trade Center when the first of the towers collapsed. Alexis joined first responders in desperately trying to save people trapped by the collapsing building in downtown New York City. Aaron Alexis, 34, who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday was present at the World Trade Center on Sept 11 2001 and helped to pull people from the wreckage . He was left so traumatized from pulling bodies from the mangled wreckage that he did not sleep for up to three days afterwards. The 12th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attack took place a less than a week ago with memorial services at Ground Zero and also at the Pentagon in the Washington DC. Family members said he suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome and blamed the illness for two violent gun related incidents. Investigators are looking to PTSD as a . cause for the paranoia and delusions that led him to seek medical help . just weeks before going in his deadly rampage killing 12 people. Frank Calderon sits in his car outside his home near Richmond, Va., as he spoke to Mail Online about his former step-son Aaron Alexis . Alexis called police to his hotel in Rhode Island where he said he was being followed and that he heard voices in his head. The 34-year-old's mental health problems are thought to be the main cause for the rampage at the Washington Navy Yard where 12 people were shot dead. In an exclusive interview with Mail Online, Mr Calderon fought back tears as he said he is struggling to understand the ‘loving boy’ he raised as his own could have become a mass killer. He is the only family member to openly speak about Alexis as investigators try to find a motive for the killing spree. ‘What happened in Washington was not from the Aaron I knew and loved,’ he said. ‘Growing up he was a loving boy. He was a . kind boy. There was not violence. In all the years I was with him there . was no hint of any violence.’ Smoke rising from the burning twin towers of the World Trade Center on Sept 11, 2001: Washington Navy Yard gunman Aaron Alexis saw the first tower fall as he emerged from the subway that day . Frank said Aaron was working in the IT department in a building adjacent to the World Trade Center when terrorists launched their murderous attack on September 11 2001. Mr Calderon said his stepson was coming up the escalator from the subway station when the first of the towers collapsed. He said: ‘He was on his way to his shift. The planes had hit the towers, but Aaron said he was on the escalator coming up from the subway station when he saw the building come down. It was right in front of him, and he said he saw it collapse. 'The planes had already hit the Twin Towers and he was on the subway below the building' 'That day was traumatic for everyone involved. He did not talk much about it, but he said he helped out. He was a strong young man so he would have done what he could. ‘I also worked at the site, but in another building. My shift had ended at 7am and I was already home by the time the planes hit.’ The South Tower of the World Trade Center was the first to collapse shortly before 10am on September 11. Frantic Search: Emergency responders arrive at the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, where 12 people were killed and eight injured on Monday . One of Alexis' victims was Richard Michael Ridgell and a candlelight vigil was held in his honor at Jaycee Park in Westminster, Md.m on Tuesday . Navy Yard shooting victim Richard Michael Ridgell, 52 . The North Tower collapsed 29 minutes later causing most of the casualties among the fire crews who had been trying to get people out of the burning building. Aaron and his stepfather were living in Queens, New York, at the time of the terror attack. He said Aaron was a proud New Yorker and like many people he was affected by the events of that day. But Frank, who became step dad to Aaron when he was eight years old, said he did not see any initial signs of PTSD. ‘It was a traumatic time, not just for us but all the people in New York. I can't believe that what happened back then was to blame for what went on this week.’ One theory that will be probed by . investigators in Washington is if traumatic memories from 12 years ago . played any part in triggering Monday's shooting rampage. Aaron's birth father Algernon had told police in 2004 that his son was suffering from PTSD as a result of witnessing the events at Ground Zero. He made his statement to police after his son was arrested in Seattle for shooting out the tires of a construction worker. Aaron told police he had an ‘anger fueled’ black out and didn't remember the incident until an hour afterwards. Vigil for the victims: Frank Calderon, who became step dad to Aaron when he was eight years old, said he did not see any initial signs of PTSD in Alexis after 9/11 . Chaos: More than 3,000 people work at the site in Washington D.C. where gunfire erupted on Monday . He was later involved in another shooting incident while living in Fort Worth, Texas, when a neighbor complained he had fired a bullet into her floor. Aaron, a former Navy aviation technician, did not face prosecution over either incident. His clean record enabled him to buy a shotgun used in the Navy Yard rampage and also get security clearance as a civilian contractor working in the sprawling Navy Yard office complex. Mr Calderon said he had not spoken to his stepson since 2007. ‘The last time we spoke was when he went off to the Navy. He was so excited to be joining the military. ‘I was very close to Aaron and we had talked about me also joining the military, but I was too old. ‘I know he was really looking forward to it. He was at my house in North Carolina before he left for boot camp. You could see the excitement in his face.’ Frank said he was part of Aaron's life from the age of eight until he was in his mid-20s. John Roger Johnson, left, and Kathy Gaarde, right, were two of Alexis' 12 victims . A moment of silence was held during a candlelight vigil at Jaycee Park in Westminster, Md., on Tuesday in honor of Richard Michael Ridgell who was killed in Monday's shooting at the Navy Yard in Washington . He was married to Aaron's mother Cathleen for two years but lived with her for a number years before their wedding. After their split he stayed in contact with the family, in particular Aaron, saying he had an ‘on-off’ relationship with his mother. Sitting in his car outside his home in Virginia, Mr Calderon struggled to comprehend the grief and outrage caused by his son. Staring down at the floor he had a vacant look on his face as he remembered a ‘loving and kind boy’ who loved to play chess. ‘What took place the other day is not something that I can ever understand,’ he said. ‘I wish I had the words to explain, but I don't. My thought are not with Aaron but for the victims. My prayers are with their families and I just want to say how sorry I am. Why would he do this? ‘I have not seen or spoken to Aaron since 2007 but I still can't believe that he would do such a thing. Escape: Employees at the naval yard run from the building with their hands in the air following the shooting . Traumatized from pulling bodies from the mangled wreckage on 9/11, Alexis didn't sleep for days afterwards and later developed Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome - possibly as a result of what he saw at ground zero . ‘He was not a violent boy. The Aaron I knew loved to learn. We would watch the Discovery Channel together. He was like a sponge and wanted to learn so much. ‘In all the years I was with him I never once witnessed any violence. ‘I was his step-father but because I was not that much older than him I was more like a big brother. ‘We always got on well and he was never any trouble. I just wish I knew what happened to him. ‘Something changed him because the Aaron I knew was not violent.’ Mr Calderon said his stepson's years in the Navy before his discharge in 2011 must have changed him. ‘I am hearing all these reports about mental illness, that he had paranoia and heard voices. If that is true he should have had help,’ he said. 'Military veterans should be given the red carpet treatment. They should get all the healthcare they need and be helped to get jobs. What kind of country are we that a veteran comes back and he has to work in McDonalds. That is not treating them right.’ Vishnu Pandit, left, and Mary Francis Knight, right, were victims of Monday's massacre . Salute: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, right, leads a delegation at the Navy Memorial in Washington to remember the victims of Monday's deadly shooting at the Washington Navy Yard on Tuesday . Mr Calderon said Aaron had two relatives who lived in Thailand and would often visit them during his breaks from the military. ‘He did love Thailand and its people, but when he went there it was to see his uncle and cousins,’ he said. Mr Calderon, a bank worker, said he was visited by two FBI agents in the hours after the shooting. ‘There was not much to tell them,’ he said. ‘I have not spoken to him in year, not had a phone call or an email. ‘We just lost contact. He got on with his life and I moved on.’ Mr Calderon said he doesn't know if he will go to his step son's funeral. ‘That is going to be so hard but it will be up to his family in New York. I don't know if I will be invited or if I attend.’ Victim: Arthur Daniels, right, was a sub-contractor relocating and installing office furniture at government offices .","Washington Navy Yard gunman Aaron Alexis was present at the World Trade Center on 9/11 .

"Eleven years ago, Susan Still, a married mother of three from upstate New York, fled her home after enduring years of verbal, emotional and physical abuse at the hands of her husband. For Still, the final straw came in June 2003 when Ulner Lee Still, her husband of more than a decade, ordered their 13-year-old son to grab a camera and videotape him berating, punching and choking the terrified woman. Mrs Still, 54, would later say that her offense that day was that she came into the room and asked her hot-tempered husband if he wanted to have lunch. Today, she says, she has forgiven her husband, but will never forget the abuse she suffered. Scroll down for videos .

Video of her abuse, which her husband forced her son Dane to record, shocked the nation in 2003 . Dazmann Still (left) says he's not sure he can ever forgive his father for the abuse inflicted on his mother. But, as a young man, he has questioned for his abusive dad . Dazmann Still says he wants to see his father again and ask him about why he treated his mother so badly. Mrs Still said she blamed herself for years for her abuse . 'I had to (forgive him),' she told Oprah. 'I had to a long time ago in order for myself to move on and begin to rebuild a life.' She says she has worked to move past the abuse. Her son Dazmann, however, who was forced to watch and video record as his mother was brutally beaten and berated, is still struggling to come to terms with what happened. 'I wanna talk to him about a lot and I've definitely thought about going back to see him,' Dazmann, now in his 20s, said. 'I have an option of him for his actions and what he did, but I don't really know him as a human being. And that is my next step.' He said he is not sure he can ever forgive his father for what he did. The disturbing 51-minute assault that Dane recorded, with his younger brother watching from the sidelines, sent shockwaves around the country. Horrifying video: Ulner Lee Still (right) ordered his 13-year-old son to record him berating his wife, Susan (right) in June 2003 . Innocent: Susan said her husband attacked her for asking him if he wanted to have lunch . Violence erupts: After berating her and repeatedly calling her 'stupid' and 'heifer,'  Ulner Still lunged at Susan . In the video, an enraged Ulner Lee Still is seen seated in a chair, with his wife standing meekly in front of him, and hurling insults at her. He calls her 'stupid' 23 times and 'heifer' 28 times, uses foul-mouthed language in front of their kids, accuses her of infidelity and criticizes the way she looks. The confrontation between the husband and wife then takes a violent turn when Mr Still roughly grabs Susan and pushes her onto the bed. With the camera in his son's hands rolling, the father proceeds to kick and slap the terrified mother of three, throws her to the floor and tries to strangle her. In 2007, Susan Still appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss her horrifying experiences as a victim of domestic abuse. Around the same time, ABC’s 20/20 with Diane Sawyer aired a segment about the woman's ordeal. By that time, Ulner Lee Still had been convicted of domestic violence and sentenced to 36 years - the longest prison term in the history of the state involving a case where the victim survived. Human rag doll: He tossed the defenseless woman onto the bed, with their two children in the room . Punching bag: Susan was kicked, slapped and strangled by her husband, with the camera in her son's hands capturing the entire ordeal . Key piece of evidence: The video of the assault would later help prosecutors convict Ulner Lee Still . Oprah Winfrey has recently caught up with Susan Still and her two sons, 23-year-old Dazmann and his younger brother, Dane, for an episode of 'Oprah: Where Are They Now?' Susan, who has spent the past decade raising awareness about domestic abuse, said that she has forgiven her ex-husband for his actions. ‘I had to a long time ago, in order for myself to be able to move on and begin to rebuild a life,’ she said. Still explained that like other victims of domestic abuse, she had once believed that what was happening to her was her own fault, and that it was in her power to fix the relationship. Her son Dazmann, who has a young child of his own now, said that he would be interested to sit down and talk to his father in order to understand him better – and avoid repeating his mistakes. ‘Not that I'm saying that what he did was OK or anything,’ he said. ‘Or necessarily that I've even forgiven him.‘ . Dashing: Susan Still was 18 years old when she met Ulner, then a 26-year-old bass guitar player . Fairy tale romance: The two got married after several years of dating and soon started a family . Family split: Dazmann and Dane fled with Susan to a shelter in 2003, but her oldest daughter stayed with her father . Boys: Dazmann (right) and Dane (left), Still's sons, fled with their mother after the beating (pictured in 2011) Susan Still, who has become a women’s rights activist, has admitted that she is apprehensive about the prospect of her ex-husband being released from prison. As an 18-year-old college freshman, Susan was swept off her feet by Ulner Lee Still, a handsome 26-year-old bass guitarist in a local band. The two started dating and eventually got married and built a family. From the very beginning, Ulner was controlling, cutting Susan off from her family, banning her from inviting friends over and keeping tabs on her comings and goings at all times. But the rocky relationship took a turn for the worse a decade later when Ulner lost his job and Susan, an insurance company employee, became the sole breadwinner, leaving her husband feeling inadequate. Woman on a mission: Today, Susan Still is a woman's rights activist raising awareness of domestic vilence . The first time Ulner struck Susan was on the day she forgot to bring him something he had asked from the grocery store. 'He hurt me badly. I just couldn't believe it. It's like you're almost outside your body watching and saying, ""This can't be happening,""' she told 20/20 in 2006. After the videotaped beating in June 2003, Susan decided to escape with her three children. She contacted the Amherst police department and fled to a shelter for abused women. Her sons remained by her side, but her oldest daughter returned to Ulner Still. During his trial, the video recording of Susan's assault, along with testimony from the woman's boss and her two sons, helped the prosecution secure a conviction.","Susan Still, 54, from upstate New York, made headlines in 2003 when she fled her home after her husband viciously beat her up .

"Prince Harry enjoyed his first Arabian banquet tonight courtesy of the Omani royal family - many of whom joined him for the event. The fourth-in-line to the throne was the guest of honour at a lavish dinner at the Ritz-Carlton Al Bustan Palace Hotel in the capital Muscat. His host at the opulent venue, set in the shadows of the Hajjar Mountains, was His Highness Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said, the Sultan of Oman's first cousin. Welcome: Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said welcomes Prince Harry to the Ritz-Carlton Al Bustan Palace . Charmed: The royal was introduced to a series of local dignitaries ahead of the banquet . After being introduced to a small group of royals and dignitaries, which included one woman - the under-secretary to Minister of Tourism, Sheikh Abdulmalik bin Abdullah bin Ali al Khalili - Harry was shown to the table, which was laden with flowers and silver cutlery. On the menu was a vermicelli soup with garlic, fried fillets of sole, Omani-style local fish and several lamb dishes with bowls of dates and Middle Eastern salads. Each place setting had a goblet of water and one of orange juice, but no alcohol was served. The prince arrived in Muscat this morning for a three day official visit, after which he flies onto Abu Dhabi where he will play in a charity polo match on Thursday. The smartly-dressed royal was greeted off his overnight scheduled flight from London by the Sultan's cousin. Tasty: The Omani royals laid on a lavish banquet for Prince Harry featuring lamb stew and dates . Meeting: The single female guest was the under-secretary to Sheikh Abdulmalik bin Abdullah bin Ali al Khalili . Ceremonial: Male guests wore traditional dishdashas teamed with traditional sashes and daggers . Feast: At the dinner, guests tucked into garlic soup, lamb and date stew and Omani-style fish . The two men then posed for a brief photocall in typical Middle Eastern style, sitting on two chairs in an elaborately gilded lounge underneath the sword and dagger symbol of the Omani Sultanate. Harry told his royal host: 'I send best wishes from Her Majesty. She is very well.' He was offered coffee and a traditional sweet treat with almonds known as halwa, before leaving to meet staff at the British Embassy. Harry is staying in the desert kingdom at the private invitation of Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said - a Sandhurst educated Anglophile - and had been due to attend a National Day celebration today in his honour. Unfortunately the Omani leader is currently receiving medical treatment in Germany for an undisclosed illness, meaning the parade will now no longer take place. According to Kensington Palace, The Diwan - the Royal Court - in Oman - was still keen for the royal visit to take place, however, and Harry will continue with his plans. At the invitation of the Sultan he was taken on a boat trip in the afternoon to the picturesque Dimaniyat Islands Nature Reserve, 70 kilometres west of Muscat. Royal welcome: Harry was met by HH Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said at Muscat International Airport . Fresh-faced: Harry looked fresh-faced as he arrived in Oman, despite the red-eye flight from London . Chat: Prince Harry enjoyed a chat with Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said who is Sultan Qaboos' cousin . Its nine islands features pristine white beaches and rare coral reefs, which are home to turtles, rare sea birds and dolphins. Tomorrow Harry will also visit the historic Nizwa Fort, viewing local arts and crafts at a souq outside the gates before being greeted with a traditional sword dance inside the Fort's main courtyard. He will also enjoy a guided tour around the historic ramparts of the Fort itself, which offer stunning views of Nizwa and the surrounding mountains. Nizwa Fort was built in the 1650s by Imam Sultan Bin Saif Al Ya'rubi, although its underlying structure dates back to the 12th Century. It is Oman's most visited national monument and a reminder of the city's significant role through some of the more turbulent periods in Oman's history. On Thursday the prince will be taken to the stunning Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque in Muscat where he will be shown around by a member of the Diwan Higher Centre for Culture and Science. The mosque was a gift to the nation by the Sultan to mark the 30th year of his reign and can accommodate a staggering 20,000 worshippers, including 750 women in a private musalla or prayer hall. Stepping in: Sayyid Haithem Bin Tariq Al Said stepped in after the Sultan flew to Germany for medical help . Formidable: Harry was met by an honour guard carrying traditional curved daggers . A Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'The Prince is travelling to Oman at the personal invitation of His. Majesty Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said. The visit reflects the close personal and respectful relationship that exists between The Royal Families of both countries. 'Despite The Sultan's unavailability to personally host Prince Harry on this occasion, both parties were keen that the visit still takes place given the direct and personal nature of the invitation.' The aide added: 'It will be an opportunity for a Prince Harry to see and experience the country for the first time following recent successful and enjoyable visits by other members of his family.' These include the Queen and Prince Philip in 2010 and Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall just last year. On Thursday the prince will fly to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates where he will play in the Sentebale Polo Cup at Ghantoot Racing and Polo Club. Afterwards Harry will attend a fundraising dinner and give a speech. The match is in aid of the charity he set up in 2006 in memory of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, following a gap year visit to Lesotho. The name Sentebale means 'forget me not' in the local dialect, Basotho. Tasty: Prince Harry was given coffee and a Middle Eastern sweet called halwa on arrival . Beautiful: Prince Harry will be staying in Omani capital Muscat for the next two days . Entertaining: Charles and Camilla visited Oman in 2013 and were greeted by sword dancers . Unwell: Oman's Sultan Qaboos bin Said has been forced to seek medical treatment in Germany . Royal visit: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visited Muscat in 2010 . Lesotho is a tiny, poverty-stricken and landlocked kingdom in Southern Africa with one of the highest HIV/AIDS rates in the world. Sentebale supports the many thousands of children affected by the AIDS epidemic both directly and though losing their families to the disease. Life expectancy for men and women in the kingdom is just 41 years, one in three children are orphans and there are believed to be more than 40,000 adolescents living with HIV. The Sentebale Cup, which is in its fifth year, is helping to support the Mamohato Programme, which address the emotional and psychological needs of children living with HIV as well as working to reduce the stigma linked to the disease and helping to markedly improve their quality of life. Harry, who plans to make a visit to some of the charity's projects in Lesotho next June, has said he hopes to expand its work to other countries in Africa. It is understood that Harry plans to stay on in Abu Dhabi privately after the official elements of the trip have concluded on Thursday to watch the Formula 1 Grand Prix at the Yas Marina Circuit, which is on this weekend.

"An alleged stalker who is convinced he is married to Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan should return to Germany for psychiatric treatment, a court heard today. Daniel Vorderwulbecke, 37, is accused of harassing the star, bombarding her with thousands of disturbing texts, Tweets and Instagram pictures. Vorderwulbecke is also alleged to have attacked a doorman and smashed a bin worth £100 in the bout of chaos at the Palace Theatre in central London, where the star is appearing in the satirical play Speed-The-Plow. Alleged stalker Daniel Vorderwulbecke (left), who is convinced he is married to Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan, should return to Germany for psychiatric treatment, a court heard today . Since his arrest Vorderwulbecke has been treated for mental health issues at a London hospital, and is described as 'acutely unwell.' Vorderwulbecke is yet to enter formal pleas to charges of harassment without violence, assault causing actual bodily harm to doorman Cameron Ashraf and criminal damage. It is claimed Vorderwulbecke stalked Miss Lohan for seven weeks between July and September this year by bombarding her with threats in person and through 'various communication devices' including Instagram. On September 8, police were called to the Playhouse Theatre, where Vorderwulbecke had allegedly caused damage to a metal cigarette bin valued at £100. Vorderwulbecke is also alleged to have attacked a doorman and smashed a bin worth £100 in the bout of chaos at the theatre where the star is appearing in the satirical play Speed-The-Plow (pictured) Claims: The charges say Vorderwulbecke damaged a bin at the Playhouse Theatre (pictured), where the play is currently showing, before returning three days later and having an altercation with the doorman . Three days later, on September 11, he allegedly assaulted Mr Ashrat after he was barred from watching the actress rehearse. He did not attend Westminster Magistrates' Court today but Lucy Daniels, defending, said psychiatric reports indicate his condition is 'improving.' She added: 'The doctor believes Mr Voderwulbecke is better off being treated in Germany [his homeland].'

Vorderwulbecke was said to have dropped off various items for Lohan at the theatre, including purported 'marriage certificates'. Lohan, 28, was said to have been left distressed after receiving 'thousands of text messages' from the German. Vorderwulbecke is due to remain at the specialist Gordon Hospital in Pimlico until a plea and case management hearing at the same court next Thursday.","Daniel Vorderwulbecke accused of harassing the 28-year-old actress .

"Cases of lung cancer in Beijing have doubled in the past decade with Chinese officials blaming the rise on smoking. However the number of smokers in Beijing has fallen in recent years while air pollution soared by 30 per cent in the first few months of 2013, raising fears that the increase could be due to the smog. Wang Huiyao, who heads the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalisation think tank, said: 'How shocking! This number doesn’t even include the floating population. Rates of lung cancer have doubled in Beijing in the last decade, and while officials blame smoking, many fear that the city's smog is to blame . 'We must keep our environment from getting worse–no matter what. In the past 10 years, the number of smokers and smoking areas have decreased; why have lung cancer rates increased so much?' Users of Chinese social networking site Weibo agreed. One user, Jingyan_melody commented: 'The spike in lung cancer is clearly due to environmental pollution, yet they blame it on smoking. 'The number of people who smoke has decreased, especially while in public.' The figures from the official Xinhua news . agency showed the number of lung cancer patients per 100,000 people . went from 39.56 in 2002 to 63.09 by 2011. The news comes a week after an . eight-year-old girl was diagnosed with lung cancer which doctors blamed . on the country's dire air quality. The World Health Organisation estimates that around 200,000 people died last year as a result of cancer caused by bad air, and that around half of cases were in China or East Asia. Pollution in the developing nation has become so bad thanks to China having the world's largest manufacturing sector coupled with the world's largest population. Around 100million people in China are employed in factories of some kind, more than 10 times the number in the US, and China accounts for roughly 20 per cent of the world's industrial output. China's huge industrial sector, which employs around 100million people, has gone unregulated for years as the country drives for growth meaning the air has become polluted . Decades of industrial growth have been fuelled by weak government regulation which has allowed factories to be built quickly, cheaply, and with little concern for the environmental impact. As a result smog levels in Beijing are now so bad that experts have warned of a national security threat because CCTV cameras are unable to see through the haze. Measures are being being passed to tackle the problem as new government officials fear a backlash from the wealthy middle-class, but past laws have simply been ignored as the country pursues growth at all costs. China's population now stands at 1.4billion, up from just 563million in the mid-1950s, and accounts for roughly one in five people on the planet. That surge has meant huge demand for concrete, glass and steel to build new cities with. These very heavy industries are among the most polluting. China's population boom, rising from 563million in 1950s to 1.4billion this year, means the country is the world's largest consumer of coal which fuels its power stations . China is also the world's biggest consumer of coal, and around half of all coal used next year is expected to be burned in the country either in power stations or by people heating their homes. The government said pollution levels would be cut by slowing the growth of coal consumption so that its share of China's energy sources fell to 65 percent by 2017. Last month, choking smog forced Chinese authorities to shut down one of the country's largest cities. The dense pollution in Harbin - a city of more than 10 million people – meant that visibility was reduced to less than 10 metres. The smog forced schools to suspend classes, caused snarling traffic and closed the airport, in what was the country's first major air pollution crisis of the winter. The cold weather typically brings the worst air pollution to northern China because of a combination of weather conditions and an increase in the burning of coal for homes and municipal heating systems. While smoking in China is still a huge problem, with 320million people thought to be addicted, it has actually declined in recent years while air pollution has soared . China is also the world's largest consumer of cigarettes, with an estimated 320million people lighting up every year,  more than than the entire population of the United States, and accounting for one in four of the world's smokers. A million people are thought to die every year from tobacco-related illnesses in China, with most of them being from lung infections including tuberculosis and lung cancer. However, in the last 14 years smoking in China has actually fallen from 63 per cent in 1996, to 54 per cent in 2010. The vast majority of those are elderly men, with just 2 per cent of Chinese women being addicted. In Beijing, which has some of the worst air quality in the country, just 15 per cent of people smoke.","Lung cancer rates in China's capital have doubled in a decade .

While 320million Chinese smoke, the rate has fallen steadily since 1996 .

"An elementary school teacher is under investigation after bashing students for being slow learners and calling a parent a 'crack head' on Facebook.

"He famously smoked about a pound of pot a week and referred to it as a holy sacrament. Now the family of Bob Marley have launched a 'global marijuana brand' named after the reggae king, which is being hailed as the first recreational cannabis brand in an industry that is on the cusp of a major boom. Marley Natural will cater to both medical and recreational use, selling 'loose-packed' marijuana, vaporizers, pot-infused creams and oils, and will hit the market at the end of next year. The company is a partnership between the late singer's widow, Rita Marley, his children and grandchildren, and Seattle-based, marijuana-focused private equity firm Privateer Holdings. Scroll down for video . Marijuana king: The family of Bob Marley have launched a 'global marijuana brand' named after the reggae king, which is being hailed as the first recreational cannabis brand and will hit the market in 2015 . Partnership: Rita Marley, the late singer's wife, is said to have initiated Marley Natural by contacting private equity firm Privateer Holdings and suggesting a partnership . The announcement was made Tuesday on TODAY. 'This is what the end of prohibition looks like,' the CEO of Privateer Holdings, Brendan Kennedy, said. 'Bob Marley started to push for legalization more than 50 years ago. We’re going to help him finish it.' Legal marijuana sales are expected to grow to almost $2.5 billion this year. By 2018 that number is expect to hit $10 billion, according to Marketplace. Kennedy said the global market is worth about $150 billion. 'People are thinking, ‘I was too late for Facebook. I was too late for Microsoft. I was too late for Amazon and Starbucks. I am not too late for (cannabis),' Kennedy said. Marley's eldest daughter, Cedella Marley, 47, said it was a cause her father had always stood behind. 'It just seems natural that Daddy should be part of this conversation,' she told NBC. 'As Daddy would say, ''make way for the positive day''.' Marley converted to Rastafarianism from Christianity in the mid-1960s, long before finding musical fame. Couple: Jamaican singer-songwriter Bob Marley and his wife Rita Marley on July 26, 1978 . Project: Cedella Marley said it 'seems natural that Daddy should be part of this conversation' He viewed 'ganja' as a holy rite and believed it was something that opened up a spiritual door that allowed him to be a better artist. 'It make you stimulate your mind, and make you sit down and meditate,' he once said in an interview, according to The LA Times. 'Instead a get foolish, you sit down and you can meditate and be someone. Rum teach to you be a drunkard, and herb teach you to be someone.' Rita Marley said her husband would have been proud to see marijuana become legal. 'He’s 100 percent behind what is happening,' she told TODAY. 'He’s happy because this is what we dreamed of.' The Marley family are said to have contacted Privateer Holdings and initiated the partnership. They have been working on the project for 18 months. The two have signed a 30-year worldwide exclusive licensing agreement. Privateer Holdings has bought a 60,000 square-foot facility in British Columbia to grow their product, Fortune reported. Booming industry: Until now, recreational marijuana brands have been limited to to what is produced in dispensaries, such as this one, Medicine Man in Denver, Colorado. Marley Natural will be sold worldwide . Demand: Crowds flock to retail marijuana dispensaries in Denver after recreational cannabis use was legalized in January . They say they are committed to developing strands of marijuana that Marley would have smoked himself. The Marley Natural headquarters will be based in Manhattan's Lower East Side. However news of the company's launch has not sat well with anti-marijuana campaigners. Kevin Sabet, a professor at the University of Florida, told TODAY, said it is nothing but a money-making exercise and goes against the anti-establishment views of Marley himself. 'Legalization is not about allowing millions of people some personal freedom,' Sabet said. 'It’s about a allowing a select few people to make millions of dollars.' Marley died on 11 May 1981 in Miami at the age of 36. A malignant melanoma that developed under his toe spread to his lungs and brain. Since his death, Marley's legend has only increased. Brainchild: Rita Marley believes she is doing what her husband would have wanted . Holy sacrament: Marley already is the poster boy for marijuana use, viewing it as a holy rite . Marley’s estate brought in $20 million in the past year, putting him at number five on Forbes’ annual list of top-earning deceased celebrities, according to The Financial Times. The figures put his posthumous earnings ahead of Marilyn Monroe and John Lennon. In September, Marley's greatest hits album, Legend, which was first released in 1984, hit number five on the Billboard Sales chart. His family have used his name to launch other companies, including House of Marley, which sells headphones and audio accessories, and Marley Coffee. Recreational marijuana use is now legal in Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska. At least six more U.S. states are expected to regulate cannabis by 2016.","Marley Natural will sell packaged marijuana, creams and accessories .

"An Albuquerque, New Mexico dad who found a naked prowler peering into his young daughter's room will face charges after seriously beating the peeping tom. Police say Emilio Chavez III found 29-year-old Dylan Maho naked and making noises near a little girl's window when he chose to exact vigilante justice and beat Maho so badly he was taken to the hospital. While both men could be convicted of felonies, Chavez could potentially get a longer sentence for what he did to the intruder.

'I think he was well within his rights chasing him down and beating him.' But . the district attorney disagrees. Though police initially let the irate . father go free after questioning, he is now charged with aggrevated . battery, a felony. Maho, . who remained in the hospital Monday but was upgraded to stable . condition, will be formally charged with felony voyeurism upon his . release. According to Justia.com, Chavez could be convicted of a third degree felony. That means he could face up to three years in jail.

Indeed, so committed is Ms Mackintosh to her new regime, she even wears gym gear on days off in a bid to keep herself motivated. Despite her regular workouts, she did tell Closer magazine that there is one area she isn't entirely happy with - her tummy. 'Naturally, like most women, my eyes always fall to the body part I like least- my tummy,' she said in an interview with the magazine. 'It's the hardest area to tone.' Healthy: Ms Mackintosh kicked off her healthy lifestyle two years ago and intensified it ahead of her wedding . Daring: The 25-year-old certainly didn't shy away from flashing the flesh during a spa visit this week . Always slim, Ms Mackintosh embarked on a health kick in 2012 when she was dating her now husband Professor Green. After resorting to a tough sugar-free diet ahead of their 2013 wedding, she still follows a gluten and dairy free diet due to her intolerances. But it is fitness that is the budding fashion designer's real passion, and, she says, the reason for her increasing body confidence. Along with her love of pilates, the star works out with her personal trainer at least five days out of the week. Regime: The fitness aficionado works out five days a week, doing a variety of different exercises . Variety: Along with a passion for hot yoga, Mille also does regular pilates and barre body sessions . And her efforts certainly seem to be paying off if her social media accounts are to be believed, with Ms Mackintosh regularly posting snaps of herself that display her newly rock-hard abs to full effect. She has also revamped her style, frequently opting for low cut looks. As a result of her new-found body confidence, Ms Mackintosh says she would never even contemplate plastic surgery, saying: 'It terrifies me'. 'I know people who have had it done and it looks subtle, but the fear of it going wrong or becoming too dependent on having things done is frightening. 'I'm a make-up artist so I prefer natural beauty. I won't be having Botox in my 20s!'","Star says she likes what she sees in the mirror and has ruled out Botox .

"The owner of the upscale Swiss boutique where Oprah Winfrey claimed she was barred from buying a $38,000 by a ‘racist’ sales assistant today demanded to speak to the star she branded 'over-sensitive' and insisted her employee did ‘everything right’. The rather fearsome-looking Trudi Goetz said she wanted to speak with the talk show billionairess ‘as soon as possible’ and also revealed her petrified member of staff will not be sacked or punished. She said: ‘I don't know why she talked of racism.  I . am sorry, but perhaps she is being a little over-sensitive here.  Maybe . she was somewhat offended because she was not immediately recognized in . the store.' It came as Oprah said she was 'sorry' a media frenzy emerged after saying she experienced racism during a trip to Switzerland. Scroll down for video . Loggerheads: Store owner Trudie Goertz insists her sales assistant did 'everything right' and was not 'racist' to Oprah (pictured on the red carpet last night in LA) when she asked to see the $38,000 bag at the Swiss store . 'I think that incident in Switzerland was just an incident in Switzerland. I'm really sorry that it got blown up. 'I purposefully did not mention the name of the store,' Winfrey said. 'I was just referencing it as an example of being in a place where people don't expect that you would be able to be there.’ The firestorm blew up after Oprah - who is promoting a film - gave an interview with Entertainment Tonight, in which she recalled a clerk at an upscale Zurich boutique refusing to show her a handbag. Winfrey said she was told she could not afford the $38,000 tom Ford Jennifer tote and said it proved that ‘racism is still an issue’. Meanwhile, Frau Goertz said today: ‘For God's sake, no! I do not judge people according to their skin color, nor according to their income. I treat everyone equally. And I also expect my employees to do the same.’ MailOnline has learned that the saleslady in question is Italian, aged 37, and was not a full-time employee of the ritzy Trois Pommes shop in Zurich where the incident took place - but she was sent there from the sister-store in upscale St. Moritz to help out. Now it is unclear where she is as she lies low in fear of ‘public hatred’. Cutting: Goertz suggested that - unlike Oprah - in Europe famous people liked to be treated like ordinary citizens . Er, sorry: Oprah said lat night at the premiere of her new film The Butler, that she was 'sorry' she had ever brought up the bag incident . Goetz, who was ironically also a guest at the wedding of Tina Turner – the reason why Oprah was in the country, has been left to speak for her. ‘It's absurd,’ she said. ‘Oprah came into the business, wanted to see the crocodile bag. She inquired about the price. When my saleswoman told her that it cost 35,000 francs and then offered to show her cheaper ones, she walked away. And in a possible slap to Oprah's diva tendencies, she added: ‘That is something that international stars appreciate in our country - that you leave them in peace.’ Ms. Goetz, who regularly features in the society pages of Swiss newspapers and magazines, said that there will be ‘no repercussions’ for her employee - an Italian woman who worked for five years in a boutique in Milan before joining her. She went on: ‘She did everything right. I can't blame her. She has been working for five years with me and is an excellent seller.  She usually works in St. Moritz where there is a MOST demanding clientele. Scene of the crime: The upmarket Trois Pommes store in Zurich where the incident took place . 'She is so very sensitive. I repeat once again; my saleslady only meant well because she wanted to show other bags to Oprah. To demonstrate the whole range is, for me, a perfect service. I find it regrettable that Oprah has come to this service from exactly the wrong way. ‘I saw Oprah at Tina's wedding but I only knew her from TV.  We didn`t speak, and now unfortunately since then, this is played out before the entire world. ‘I hope the business will not suffer as a result of this.  I hope I can speak with Oprah to resolve the situation personally, as quickly as possible.’ Today, it seemed that Oprah – who earned $77m last year, according to Forbes, was desperately trying to take her foot out of the mess she’d put it in. Last night, the star gave an interview on the red carpet of The Butler, in which she has a role. She said: 'I'm in a store and the person doesn't obviously know that I carry the black card and so they make an assessment based upon the way I look and who I am,' said Winfrey, who earned $77 million in the year ending in June, according to Forbes magazine. Wedding guests: Ironically, Frau Goertz and wonfrey were both at the Swiss wedding of Tina Turner to Erwin Back (pictured) 'I didn't have anything that said ""I have money"": I wasn't wearing a diamond stud. I didn't have a pocketbook. I didn't wear Louboutin shoes. I didn't have anything,' she said. 'You should be able to go in a store looking like whatever you look like and say ""I'd like to see this"". That didn't happen.' Swiss tourism officials and the boutique owner apologized for the incident last week, but Winfrey insists there's no need. 'It's not an indictment against the country or even that store,' she continued. 'It was just one person who didn't want to offer me the opportunity to see the bag. 'So no apologies necessary from the country of Switzerland. If somebody makes a mistake in the United States do we apologize in front of the whole country? No!' Ironically, Oprah also came under fire today from the Swiss animal rights group Four Paws (Vier Pfoten) which slammed her for wanting to buy a crocodile skin bag and called on Trois Pommes to withdraw the item from sale. ‘We do not know if Ms. Winfrey actually wanted to buy the bag,’ said  Chantal Häberling, spokeswoman for the group. ‘But she should know crocodiles suffer for the production of such items. ‘The animals are kept in extremely small enclosures,' she said. 'To kill them the animals are beaten with a hammer on the head, and  in some farms and it sometimes takes two hours before they are dead.’ Oprah is an avowed animal rights spokeswoman.  PETA,  the world’s largest animal rights group, named her “person of the year” in 2008 after she spoke out against the wearing of fur.","Trudie Goertz took a swipe at Oprah's diva tendencies, saying that international stars like to be 'left in peace' in her country .

"Lord Sugar's right-hand man has admitted the contestants on The Apprentice are not talented businessmen after all. In a candid interview about the BBC1 show, adviser Nick Hewer said the candidates are 'not the brightest business brains in Britain'. He also criticised the candidates for becoming distracted by fame, before blasting former contestant Katie Hopkins for becoming a 'rent-a-right-wing-gob' in a bid to make a name for herself. Scroll down for video . Nick Hewer (pictured second row, right) has admitted that the contestants on The Apprentice (pictured in background) are 'not the brightest brains in Britain' Mr Hewer, who has worked on the show since 2005, told Radio Times magazine: 'I'm not saying they are necessarily the brightest business brains in Britain, because the danger there would be that, first of all, those kind of people wouldn't have the confidence to withstand the white-hot heat of this process, and secondly that nine million people might not actually understand them.' The presenter, who also fronts Countdown, also admitted that ego is 'sometimes more valuable than talent' when it comes to picking a winner. But he said some contestants - including last year's contestant Luisa Zissman - can get too ahead of themselves and might come to regret it later. He said: 'All of the candidates apply to be on the show for the right reasons - they want to work with Lord Sugar and start a business. Mr Hewer (left) said candidates go onto the show to work with Lord Sugar (right) but can become easily distracted by fame . This year's TV show, now in its tenth series, began with 20 contestants competing to go into a business partnership with Lord Sugar . Contestants must face Lord Sugar and his right-hand man in the board room during each episode (pictured) 'But sometimes they get a little flattered by having cameras stuck in their faces, and then the thing airs, and they're walking down the street and cabbies are recognising them and then some agent gets onto them, thinking they can make a few quid, and before you know it, they think they're (Italian actress) Gina Lollobrigida!' He added: 'Take Luisa Zissman from last year, for example: she's actually a bright girl but decided to takes her clothes off at the drop of a hat, and that may be something she'll come to regret. 'Katie Hopkins has carved out a niche as a rent-a-right-wing-gob in the hope that by being nasty to everybody she'll find enduring fame. But who am I to judge? I hope they're very happy.' The presenter said Katie Hopkins (left) had become a 'rent-a-right-wing-gob' in a bid to find fame while Luisa Zissman (right) could come to regret taking her clothes off 'at the drop of a hat' Meanwhile, Ben Fogle, who came to prominence on Castaway in 2000, said that reality TV had 'lost its innocence'. He said: 'We all applied to be on that show for our own reasons, but the key was that no one did it to become famous. That's changed now. Most people who go on TV have another motive. 'With something like 24 Hours ... I totally believe that it's an honest window into another world. But these days there's non-reality TV - either scripted reality or something like I'm a Celebrity..., which I've always seen as a show about egos rather than a genuine insight into an environment.' This year's TV show, now in its tenth series, began with 20 contestants competing to go into a business partnership with Lord Sugar. The winner will receive a £250,000 investment from the businessman. 'I can sell ice to the Eskimos' - Melissa Cohen, series six . 'Do the French like their children?' - Susan Ma, series seven .

"The contestants may look a million dollars when they step out to perform on X Factor but backstage it's all last minute wardrobe changes, demands from Simon Cowell and lots of stitching and sequins. FEMAIL followed Gemma Sheppard, the show's head stylist, around for a day to see exactly what she gets up to and how she ensures the contestants transform from budding singers to fully-fledged X Factor stage stars. 'A lot of people ask me how we manage the X Factor wardrobe, where do the pieces come from, how do we put the outfits together, how we work with brands and shops to pull pieces in that we need,' explains Gemma as she sets off on her whirlwind day out. Scroll down for video . Behind the scenes: FEMAIL followed Gemma Sheppard, the X Factor's head stylist, around for a day to see exactly what she gets up to . Gemma's style journey starts each week with a creative meeting with all of production - including the four judges. 'We are briefed on the contestants' songs and the overall visual ideas for the performance,' she explains. From this meeting, Gemma's first port of call for any of the looks is her fashion hub on Cavendish Square. Off they go! Gemma and her team set off for the shops and spend the day meeting fashion brands and curating looks for the contestants based on the production team and judges' demands . She said: 'My team and I set this up a couple of weeks before the series began, I call it my mini Selfridges. We have rails and shelves for each contestant, all clearly labelled and for all sorts of fashion eventualities. 'The hub can provide a lot of what I need, but depending on the theme, I do also have to go out and about to bring in more pieces - so start a whirlwind of visits to designers, showrooms, shops and PR offices to gather in what we need. Gemma takes some of her team with her and they keep checking back in with the hub to drop off anything they have collected and take stock of where they are up to. Made to measure: Gemma and her assistants root around London's trendiest shops to source a stage-worthy outfit for each singer . She explained: 'Remember it isn't just the Saturday night performance look we are creating, but also the Sunday ensemble and the Sunday sing-off outfits. 'We have 24 hours to bring these looks together, so it is important we move fast, work quickly and keep focused on the job - but, of course, all in style!'. While it may seem that Gemma has the world's best job, it doesn't come without its pressures. Indeed, on Saturday night, just hours before showtime, the team decided to completely change Fleur's dress. 'The inspiration was Harlem Night and the high glamour of the 40s. We had created a gown for her from a Miss Selfridge dress, adding a fake fur cape to the hem. 'At the dress rehearsal on Saturday afternoon, we decided that the look would work better in white - but we had our work cut out with about an hour to turn it around.' Home from home: Gemma and her team are based in the style hub, which they call their mini Selfridges, and store all of the clothes before the weekend's show . Say cheese! Gemma has become extremely close with the contestants, such as Lauren Platt, and tries to give them confidence via their outfits . The team used their creative prowess to completely revamp the look. They took a Zalando cocktail dress and removed the sleeves, deepened the neckline and one of Gemma's style assistants, Lucas, raced into town to buy ostrich feathers that they attached to the hem. Gemma explains: 'The team and I have 48 hours to prep the outfits before we go into sound check and rehearsal. We prep in the fashion hub and bring the outfits to the studios on a Friday. When we see the outfits on stage, with the lights, staging and choreography, that's when we can finesse the looks - which can mean adding a small detail through to, in this case with Fleur, actually making the whole dress in a new colour.' 'Fleur has an exquisite body so creating dresses to fit her shape is a dream,' said Gemma. 'We added Aldo boots to bring the look up-to-date so she could carry off the Big Band/retro version of Bang Bang.' After the Sunday night show, Gemma and her team pack down the fashion wagon at the studio. On Monday, they open the hub, return pieces that have been used and tidy and re-stock each contestants' rail. Then they are ready for Tuesday's creative meeting and what lies ahead for the next show and the whole process starts all over again.

"Radio 1 listeners were given a rude awakening this morning when one of Nick Grimshaw's guests swore live on air. The Breakfast Show host was interviewing Milan Neil Amin-Smith of the pop group Clean Bandit when the expletive was broadcast before 8am. The musician was asked about whether he was looking forward to performing live on the station when he replied 'hopefully we won't f*** it up'. Radio 1 Breakfast show host Nick Grimshaw (left) was forced to apologise after Milan Neil Amin-Smith (pictured, right, with bandmate Grace Chatto) swore live on air this morning . The Cambridge-based band were formed in 2006 but shot to fame last year after the release of their single, Mozart's House. In January this year, their track Rather Be topped the UK chart. After being included in the latest re-making of the Band Aid track, they've been invited to record a song for Radio 1's popular segment, Live Lounge, in which top acts produce an acoustic cover of one of their or another band's biggest hits. Nick Grimshaw asked Amin-Smith about the plans in an interview broadcast at about 7.55am this morning. The violinist replied: 'We've flown back specially from Germany so hopefully we won't f*** it up.' Amin-Smith's have been invited to record a Live Lounge segment on the station after their single Rather Be went to number one earlier this year . The band (pictured, top right) also feature alongside a cast of top stars on the new Band Aid 30 single . The Radio 1 DJ quickly interjected in a bid to cover up the expletive and later apologised to listeners,  who later took to Twitter to comment. Alf Brawn tweeted: 'Clean Bandit has just said f*** on the phone to Nick Grimshaw at 7:54am amazing.' Kevin Blairski wrote: 'Oh dear oh dear oh dear, who was that saying ""f*** it up"" live on @R1Breakfast? Clean Bandit! No idea who he is, but he's gained a fan!' And website user C Sagz added: 'The irony of ""Clean"" Bandit swearing on @BBCR1 is just fantastic!' The broadcast sparked a rash of mockery online, with some users suggesting the swear word could be good for the band's notoriety . The live interview was broadcast more than 13 hours before the traditional 9pm watershed, although BBC policy states that the watershed does not apply to radio. The corporation's website states: 'The BBC does not ban words or phrases. However, it is the responsibility of all content makers to ensure strong language is used only where it is editorially justified. 'Even on radio, where there is no watershed, editorial teams should be conscious that certain slots are associated with particular types of content an appropriate scheduling is important for stronger content.'","Violinist from electronic act Clean Bandit swears live on air .

She died on August 30, 2013 (not September 20 as stated in the published piece) Her family said they can now 'live the rest of their lives with the peace' and called for a 'war' against child abusers in the United States. The submission read: 'Marianne Theresa Johnson-Reddick born Jan 4, 1935 and died alone on Aug. 30, 2013. 'She is survived by her 6 of 8 children whom she spent her lifetime torturing in every way possible. While she neglected and abused her small children, she refused to allow anyone else to care or show compassion towards them. Newspaper: The obituary was published in the Reno Gazette-Journal on September 10 (file picture) 'When they became adults she stalked and tortured anyone they dared to love. Everyone she met, adult or child was tortured by her cruelty and exposure to violence, criminal activity, vulgarity, and hatred of the gentle or kind human spirit. 'On behalf of her children whom she so abrasively exposed to her evil and violent life, we celebrate her passing from this earth and hope she lives in the after-life reliving each gesture of violence, cruelty, and shame that she delivered on her children. 'Her surviving children will now live the rest of their lives with the peace of knowing their nightmare finally has some form of closure. 'Most of us have found peace in helping those who have been exposed to child abuse and hope this message of her final passing can revive our message that abusing children is unforgiveable, shameless, and should not be tolerated in a 'humane society'.

"Islamic fanatics are planning to infiltrate Britain’s Army and police forces to carry out brutal attacks, a chilling manifesto for terror used by Islamic State (IS) reveals. The jihadi manual explains how the atrocities committed in the Middle East – including the brutal murders of British hostages David Haines and Alan Henning – are part of a wider strategy that includes plans to wreak mayhem in the UK. The development comes after security sources revealed yesterday that thousands of terror suspects are being monitored in the UK. The Association of Chief Police Officers has also warned police officers about their personal safety in light of the threat from IS. Author of atrocities: Influential Abu Bakr Naji, right, wrote the guide (left) that acts as a template for terrorism . Neither the Metropolitan Police nor the Ministry of Defence were willing last night to discuss the security procedures in place. The 268-page terrorism guide called The Management Of Savagery reveals IS’s intention to: . The handbook also revealed that infiltration operations have been going on for years – meaning that a sleeper cell may already have get inside the MoD or a police force. Written by influential jihadi Abu Bakr Naji, the guide has been carefully studied by the terrorist commanders in Syria and Iraq, who he tells: ‘Our battle is long and still in its beginning… However, its length provides an opportunity for infiltrating the adversaries. [We] should infiltrate the police forces, the armies, private security companies, sensitive civil institutions.’ Step-by-step jihad: Extracts from The Management Of Savagery, studied by commanders in Syria and Iraq . He added that there were ‘exuberant youth in large numbers seeking jihad. Their desire for martyrdom indicates a proper condition of faith; all that is required is instructional polishing within the movement. It is possible to divert some of them to work in the security apparatus for infiltrating institutions.’ The template for terrorism states that the method chosen to kill hostages should maximise shock value in the West. British troops returned to Iraq this weekend – just weeks after David Cameron promised he would not deploy ‘boots on the ground’. A dozen soldiers from The Yorkshire Regiment will train the Kurdish army on how to use heavy machine-guns against IS. The troops are in the city of Erbil, 30 miles from the front line of the battle against jihadi forces. An MoD spokesman said: ‘The Defence Secretary has approved the deployment of a small specialist team of non-combat Army trainers.’ In August, Mr Cameron said: ‘We are not going to be putting boots on the ground. We are not sending in the British Army.’ In a section titled Blazing Battle, Bakr Naji writes: ‘We must make this battle very violent, such that death is a heartbeat away, so that the two groups will realise that entering this battle will frequently lead to death. 'The increase in savagery is not the worst thing that can happen now. Rather, the most abominable of the levels of savagery is [still] less than stability under the order of unbelief. Our enemies will not be merciful to us if they seize us. Thus, it behoves us to make them think one thousand times before attacking us. ‘The policy of violence must also be followed such that if the demands are not met, the hostages should be liquidated in a terrifying manner, which will send fear into the hearts of the enemy and his supporters.’ Experts said last night that the Management Of Savagery, which was apparently first published in 2004, is a ‘relevant document’ and that the actions it expects jihadis to follow are realistic. ‘Everything in the book is possible,’ said Afzal Ashraf, an IS expert at the Royal United Services Institute in London. ‘But obviously they would find it more difficult to infiltrate the Army and police in Britain than they found in Iraq, where much of these institutions simply morphed into IS. ‘The Management Of Savagery is a book for IS’s thinkers but less so the doers. Islamic State has also miscalculated – it thought that extreme violence would deter the West. In fact IS’s enemies have been emboldened to take action.’ Wreaking havoc: The manual explains how the atrocities committed in the Middle East – including the brutal murders of British hostages David Haines and Alan Henning (pictured) – are part of a wider strategy . The Management Of Savagery claims that the overwhelming military superiority of the United States and the UK has no value without the cohesion of each society and the support for action in the region. As IS are convinced that this cohesion does not exist, they believe they can persuade Western powers to retreat if they show how they are prepared to use the most gruesome tactics. The book says: ‘If the number of Americans killed is one tenth of the number of Russians killed in Afghanistan [around 14,000 during its occupation in the 1980s], they will flee... They have reached a stage of effeminacy which made them unable to sustain battles for a long period of time and they compensate for this with a deceptive media halo.’ Bakr Naji asks also jihadis to target oilfields, sea and airports, tourist facilities and banking and financial services. He envisages ‘a very long war,’ advising commanders to spread small numbers of their forces across a large area of the world. Bakr mocks the West’s use of air strikes given the mobility of IS and the likelihood that these attacks will inspire local uprisings. He identifies other Muslim countries that should be the next to be conquered by fundamentalists, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Yemen, Turkey, Jordan, Libya, Tunisia and Morocco. A memorial for Alan Henning, who was beheaded by IS, will be held tonight at the British Muslim Heritage Centre in Manchester. Organisers said that £30,000 has been raised so far for Henning’s widow, Barbara, and their children. The American mother of the latest hostage threatened with execution by ‘Jihadi John’ has sent ten messages to the leader of Islamic State begging for her son life – and says she is not receiving help from the US government. In the tweets to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Paula Kassig asked to be told if Peter Kassig, 26, also known as Abdul Rahman, is still alive. She wrote: ‘My husband and I are on our own, with no help from the government. We would like to talk to you.’ Meanwhile, Diane Foley, mother of beheaded US hostage James Foley, has revealed that the US government threatened to sue the family if they tried to pay a ransom for their son.

"A tailgate decal on the back of a truck that shows a woman to be bound and tied in the back, is causing a bit stir in Texas. At first glance, the optical illusion given off by the decal is so convincing that it really does appear that there is a woman in the back. The sticker is the work of Hornet Signs, a marketing and advertising company in Waco. Scroll down for video... Optical illusion: From this angle, it really does look as though there is a woman tied up on the bed of this truck . Truck trick: The decal has resulted in a number of people calling 911 after thinking there really might be a woman in the back . All is revealed: It really is empty! See? According to Brad Kolb, the owner of the company, the sticker was put on an employee’s truck to gauge how realistic their decals are. 'I wasn't expecting the reactions we got, nor do we condone this by any means,' Mr Kolb told KWTX. 'It was more or less something we put out there to see who noticed it.' Mr Kolb said an employee volunteered to be tied up and was photographed so the decal could be made. Brad Kolb: The owner says the decal has done wonders in terms of orders he's received... and there are others available too such as this soldier aiming a rifle out the back . Don't mess with Texas: A woman in the office of Hornet Signs in Waco posed for the image . It was put on the employees truck about a month ago. Mr Kolb says that orders for tailgate decals have gone up since the sticker appeared on the streets, however he has received a barrage of people saying the image is in poor taste. The company specializes in car wrap advertising and they decided to experiment with tailgate decals using unusual images, including a sniper and zombie. However, it is the kidnapped woman who has attracted the most attention. KWTX said it asked viewers what they thought of Kolb's marketing stunt, and the responses the station received were almost all negative in their stance. Some viewers said they even called the police when they saw the decal, thinking a woman was truly in trouble. One viewer said, 'Abduction or any violence against women is not funny or cute.' Only a few voiced opinions of support, 'This American business owner has a decal that made the news. Like it or not, it works.'","Tailgate decal appears to show kidnapped woman in back of the truck .

"This is the Ugandan aircraft that Africa hopes will thrust it right into the space race. Constructed amidst the rubble of his mother's backyard, ambitious Chris NSamba believes the African Skyhawk will lead to his continent launching its first astronaut into orbit. The African Space Research Programme founder has been helped by 600 volunteers in partially achieving the first stage of his dream - the creation of the plane that will penetrate the edge of space by flying at 80,000ft. Scroll down for video... Ambitious: This is the Ugandan aircraft, the Africa Skyhawk, that Chris NSamba hopes will thrust the country right into the space race . The African Space Research Programme founder has been helped by 600 volunteers . And once the African Skyhawk has had a successful test flight sometime next year, the 28-year-old plans to turn his hand to building the continent's first space shuttle. He firmly believes it will launch in the next 'four to six years'. But given the condition of his project at the moment, he might be advised to buy a gigantic rubber band to help it on its way. The former astronomy student said: 'It isn't about money, it isn't about competition or pride. 'The mission is about advancement in space technology as a continent and what we can contribute towards that growth. 'We are trying to have Africa participate in the contribution of knowledge into mankind's destiny.' The cynical may question how NSamba can launch his own space programme without any money, and be entirely reliant on donations. Is he mad? Chris NSamba's mother, Sarah Lugwama, watches as the African Skyhawk is constructed in her backyard . The former astronomy student said: 'We are trying to have Africa participate in the contribution of knowledge into mankind's destiny.' Chris Nsamba leans against the wing of the Skyhawk. He is confident the Skyhawk's test flight will take place next year, and he will have a fully fledged space shuttle in operation in 'four to six years'. They may also ask how it can be achieved, seeing as Uganda has no history of space exploration and he is teaching the aspiring astronauts himself. But he said he was confident the Skyhawk's test flight would take place next year, and he would have a fully fledged space shuttle in operation in 'four to six years'. He added: 'This is not a one-man mission. We work jointly to achieve goals. 'I have trained my crew (in) advanced astronomy. They are very good at astronomy in regards to calculations and identifications of various space objects.' And when asked how he plans to simulate zero gravity for training, he said it would be 'easy'. He added: 'I've got a jet engine on order so I'm planning to build a tunnel, put the engine at one end and when I throw a guy in he'll float in a similar way to how he would in space.' NSamba, who admits that 'one time or another every successful scientists has been called a madman' has been toiling away in his mother's backyard, in the Kampala suburb of Ntinda, for three years. But despite the challenges he faces, he said was confident his space shuttle, dubbed The Dynacraft, would be ready sooner rather than later. And he cited funding from foreigners, and the promise of cash from the Ugandan government, as markers to their ongoing success. He said: 'It will first operate in Earth's lower orbit then advance with time. We might not have money in our system but we do get our homework done.'","African Skyhawk will soar to 80,000ft sometime in 2012 .

"He recently welcomed son Charlton, his second child with wife Ayda Field, and announced his upcoming tour but there's just no rest for pop legend Robbie Williams as he prepares to make his big fashion comeback. The former Take That singer is preparing to relaunch his 30-piece menswear range, Farrell, at Primark. Farrell, which was founded by the singer in 2011 and had former Burberry design director Ben Dickens at the helm, ceased trading last October when it filed for voluntary bankruptcy. Scroll down for video . Back with a bang: Robbie Williams has re-launched his fashion range, which ceased trading last October, in Primark - and it's inspired by his late grandfather . Primark has taken the fledgling brand on board and say it is 'superb and amazing value'. Inspired by his late grandfather Jack Farrell, the  collaboration draws upon Jack’s strong values, timeless style and alluring personality. Robbie says that Jack’s life as a 'Stoke-on-Trent gentleman' is reflected in the clean, tailored lines and British heritage design. Boxing was apparently a guilty pleasure of Jack’s and he spent much of his time teaching Robbie the sport. His love of boxing is translated via heavyweight T-shirts, textured sweatshirts and thickly knitted cable jumpers - and there are even tops emblazoned with his name. In honour: The range, which is priced between £8-£45, is inspired by his grandfather Jack Farrell and aims to draw upon his strong values, timeless style and alluring personality . Thrilled: Robbie says it's amazing to work with Primark and the high street giant say the product is super high quality . Heritage: The garments are inspired by his grandfather's love of all things British and also pay tribute to his passion for boxing . Influenced and worn by Robbie himself, the 40-year-old says his new capsule collection is built on statement, stand-out pieces that 'define a wardrobe rather than fill it out'. There are button down polo shirts, double-breasted pea coats, smart tweed jackets and slim leg tailored jeans, all priced between £8-£45. Speaking about the launch, Robbie said: ’I’m delighted that Farrell has been invited into Primark. 'What a great collaboration - let’s have it!'. Speaking about breathing new life into the brand, Ben Smith, Director of Menswear, Primark, said: ‘We've absolutely loved working with the Farrell brand. The product looks superb with fastidious detail and amazing value and has remained true to its origin. 'Not only have we ensured the product is amazing but the whole concept from quality through to design and store environment have all played a massive part in ensuring we deliver a first class exclusive range to the Primark customer.' Coming soon: Robbie recently announced that he will be going on tour next year . Funny man: Robbie and Ayda welcomed Charlton last month. The baby weighed 8lbs 2oz and Robbie shared videos along the way . The Candy hitmaker recently posted a humorous video to his official account, showing Ayda pushing him and their son in a wheelchair out of hospital and captioned it, 'Charlton Valentine Williams has left the building'. The couple already have daughter Theodora 'Teddy' Rose Williams, two, together and welcomed Charlton last fortnight, with the tot weighing eight pounds and two ounces. The video shows Ayda pushing a wheelchair through the hospital, and when she turns the corner, Robbie can be seen sitting in it, with Charlton in his lap. Robbie shared clips of Ayda's labour on his official YouTube account and later spoke about his 'astonishing' wife. He said: 'I've never been more in love, and I've never been more proud of my wife. She's been absolutely astonishing.' Robbie added: 'The universe has presented itself to us again and it's been a very emotional, amazing few hours and we're really happy and honoured that you experienced the journey with us.'

"The highly respected US economist Alan Greenspan has warned against Scottish independence, dismissing Alex Salmond's campaign promises as 'implausible' and saying 'there's no conceivable way' Scotland could share the pound. The former chairman of the US Federal Reserve accused the Yes campaign of drastically understating the economic damage a Yes vote in Thursday's referendum would cause. Mr Greenspan, who is known for usually being circumspect, was scathing about Alex Salmond’s oil projections. He said: ‘Their forecasts are so implausible they really should be dismissed out of hand.’ Scroll down for video . Intervention: Alan Greenspan, left, has spoken out against the Scottish independence campaign led by Alex Salmond, right . And he insisted there was no chance of London agreeing to a currency union. ‘There’s no conceivable, credible way the Bank of England is going to sit there as a lender of last resort to a new Scotland,’ Mr Greenspan added. Washington has become increasingly concerned that its oldest ally is about to be weakened by a Yes vote. President Barack Obama has twice warned against a Yes vote and the White House yesterday said it hoped the UK remained ‘strong, robust and united’. Yet more high-profile figures made direct appeals to Scots yesterday. Robert Zoellick, the former deputy secretary of state and World Bank president, said: ‘Like many Americans, and given that my name is Robert Bruce Zoellick, I have an admiration for the Scots, their heritage, and their role in the US and world history. ‘But a break-up of the UK would be a diminution of Britain and a tragedy for the West just at a moment when the US needs strong partners. I strongly suspect it would not work out well for the Scots either.’ Warnings: Other top US figures including Robert Zoellick, left, and John McCain, right, have also flagged up the dangers posed by Scotland splitting from the UK . Plea: David Cameron last night asked Scottish voters to trust in Britain and vowed radical change . Senator John McCain, a former Republican presidential candidate who regards the UK as Washington’s most important military and intelligence partner, said he was reluctant to comment on an internal issue in another country. But he added: ‘I don’t see how it could be helpful, not just as far as intelligence ties are concerned but to the unique military relationship as well.’ Another big issue for the US would be the uncertainty surrounding the future of Britain’s nuclear deterrent. American foreign policy experts fear that a Scottish Yes vote would embolden Russia – especially in Ukraine – even as it weakened the UK and thus Europe’s ability to mount a united response. ‘Russia could argue that separatist movements are actually perfectly legitimate, whether in Crimea or eastern Ukraine,’ said Ivo Daalder, former US ambassador to Nato and now president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ‘Of course, a democratic process that takes two years is not the same as an annexation and a fake referendum.’ Yesterday, President Obama’s chief spokesman, Josh Earnest, chose his words with care when asked to comment on Scottish independence. He said: ‘We certainly respect the right of individual Scots to make a decision... along these lines. But, as the President himself said, we have an interest in seeing the United Kingdom remain strong, robust, united and an effective partner.’","Ex-chairman of US Federal Reserve speaks out ahead of referendum .

"You would think his job stinks but this professional Australian diver says he loves his work - even though he's often completely submerged in poo. Brendan Walsh runs a commercial diving business in Melbourne and spends his days in all sorts of no-air environments, with a small part being sewage. He has been diving in sewage for about 14 years and said that specific side of his East West Dive and Salvage business was quite lucrative. Brendan Walsh is essentially a professional Australian poo diver who runs a commercial diving business in Melbourne . 'It’s definitely not a job for the faint-hearted,' Mr Walsh told Daily Mail Australia. 'It’s more thick than normal diving and you can’t see anything no matter what. It's more like walking than swimming when you get down there.' Mr Walsh said diving into sewage was like working with 'brown-gold' because not many people want to touch it. 'I love my job and always have. I'm a passionate diver from way back, and I'm a mechanic. I've never worked a day in my life because I combine my passions. You can't do a job well unless you love it,' he said.

When we come back out we often have condoms hanging off you. People also don't chew their corn,' he said.

"Staff are leaving an £11million school for boys with 'challenging behaviour' in droves because they fear for their safety, two unions have said. The headteacher, two teachers, seven governers and eight other members of staff have quit the Foremost School in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, in just one year thanks to inadequate alarms, communication equipment and poor design that prevents them from monitoring pupils. The £11m facility opened in February to cater for students who have been removed from mainstream education because of difficult behaviour. Troubled: Foremost School in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, has seen a number of staff leave over safety fears. It caters to boys with behavior problems . Some, the National Union of Teachers (NUT) said, exhibited 'extreme' behaviour. Sources, quoted by the Daily Star, say staff have been forced to endure threats of violence and physical assaults from pupils. The school is designed to cater for 40 pupils, but there are just 16 in attendance currently. The school was opened in February at a cost of £11m. It currently only has 16 pupils . The NUT and Unison both say they have voiced fears to North Yorkshire County Council over the design of the buildings, where staff are expected to maintain 'line of sight' contact with students and colleagues. Teachers say students can easily give teachers the slip and open fire doors. One of the sources said: 'The building is such that sometimes we physically lose sight of these children and that's not conducive to maintaining the level of care we are responsible to deliver.' Other sources spoke of 'serious situations' but declined to go into detail about them. They also said three teachers and the headteacher quit not long after it opened.

"Cashing in: Bookies are taking bets on everything from the baby's birthday to its name and hair colour . James has emerged as a clear favourite for the name of the little Prince last night – at least among the betting public. At 2/1, it overtook the earlier leader among boys’ names, George, which is now 5/1 as is Henry – Prince Harry’s real name. Most punters had clearly expected a girl, with Alexandra the favourite at 7/4. Bookmakers Coral said the royal birth . was the biggest non-sporting betting event in the company’s history with . cash staked on everything including hair colour and weight. The name the Duke and Duchess of . Cambridge choose will set a trend for a generation of babies, with other . new parents having a boy anxious to copy them. James has links to both families, but . William already has a cousin called James - the Earl and Countess of . Wessex's son Viscount Severn. George has been the name of six Kings of England and was the Sovereign name of the Queen’s father, George VI, whose actual first name was Albert. It is also one of Prince Charles’ middle names. From Williams’s side of the family both his father’s name, which the Prince of Wales share with Princess Diana’s brother, Earl Spencer, and his grandfather’s are likely favourites. At the bookies however, Charles did not even hit top ten with William Hill, and Phillip-betters will take home 40 times the money if they win. The Cambridges are also likely to . take inspiration from Kate's side of the family, possibly honouring her . father Michael, or picking Francis, which is both her father . and her grandfather's middle name. Princess Diana's middle name was Frances, the feminine form of the name, meaning William could honour his mother's memory through his son. Less likely are older Middleton family names such as Kate's maternal grandfather, who was called Ronald, however Thomas appears several times on both sides of Kate's family. The announcement that the Duchess was in labour sent punters to the betting shops, and bookmaker Paddy Power said they took £390,000 in bets in the three hours after this morning's news. Scroll down for videos . Expecting: Now we know that Baby Cambridge is a boy, speculation is turning to what he might be called . All bets on: A board is displayed outside the Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital earlier on Monday showing the odds for boy and girl names . It's a boy: The message displayed outside the palace telling the world that there is a new prince in the British royal family . Bets on the date of birth were suspended earlier today by bookmaker William Hill, and when bets on the gender were suspended, odds on it being a girl were at 8/15, and odds on a boy stood at 11/8. Odds with Coral this morning wrongly predicted a girl, with with odds of 1-2, while the odds on a boy stood at 6-4. The bookmaker said the baby's birth has been the biggest non-sporting event in the company's history. 1) James (2/1) 2) George (5/1) 3) Henry (5/1) 4) Arthur (20/1) 5) Louis (25/1) 6) Albert (40/1) 7) Alexander (40/1) 8) Benjamin (40/1) 9) David (40/1) 10) Philip (40/1) Had there been a princess born this afternoon, the most popular names were Alexandra, with the odds 9/4 and Charlotte at 5/1. Once the Duke and Duchess have given their baby boy his names, Queen will . be informed of the before they are announced officially, . but she is unlikely to exercise her veto. Royal writer Christopher Warwick . said: 'The Queen is so down to earth that she's not likely to jump up . and down and say this boy has got to be called Charles and George. 'This isn't going to be ""Granny, do you approve?"" but more 'These are the names we've chosen - do you like them?'. 'It's much more of a personal thing these days.' Despite their freer rein, it is unlikely that William . and Kate would pick a name out of keeping with royal tradition, and . they will be mindful of choosing a name that befits a future king or . queen. In the past, the approval of the sovereign has held great importance. When the Duke and Duchess of York had . their second daughter Princess Margaret Rose in 1930, they were . planning to call her Ann Margaret, but changed their mind after learning . that King George V disliked the name Ann. Queen Victoria insisted that the name . Albert be used as a middle name, if not a first, in honour of her . beloved consort Prince Albert. Prime position: Terry Hutt, who has been living on a bench outside the hospital for over a week waits patiently . Not much longer now! Some people have been staying outside the hospital's private wing for several days . Fan: Royal supporter John Loughrey poses with his royal baby memorabilia as he waits across the street from St. Mary's Hospital . Royal babies' names are not usually . revealed straight away and the public are often left guessing for . several days as speculation mounts. When Princess Beatrice was born in 1988, it was two weeks before her name was known. When William arrived in 1982, his . parents waited seven days before deciding upon and announcing his name. Diana was thought to have preferred names such as Sebastian and Oliver, . while Charles was reportedly holding out for Albert. Charles's own name, however, remained . a mystery for an entire month and was only declared ahead of his . christening in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace in December 1948. In a more modern approach, William and Kate could buck the trend and unveil their chosen name immediately. Royal babies tend to be given a number of middle names. The Prince of Wales has four names - . Charles Philip Arthur George - while the Duke of Cambridge also has four . - William Arthur Philip Louis. Dedication: Pat and Norman Bate who have sailed down from Liverpool on their narrowboat to be near the hospital for the royal birth. With a top speed of 4mph the journey took two months . The Queen has three names - Elizabeth Alexandra Mary - while William's mother Diana, Princess of Wales, was Diana Frances. The Duchess of Cambridge has just two names, Catherine Elizabeth. Prince Harry's first name is actually Henry, followed by Charles Albert David. King Edward VIII, who abdicated the . throne, had seven names - Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick . David - but was always known to his family as David. Queen Victoria was named Alexandrina Victoria and as a child was nicknamed Drina. The baby will be styled HRH Prince [forename] of Cambridge. When William was born he was Prince . William of Wales and his children will use Cambridge in the same way. According to the monarchy's official . website: 'For the most part, members of the Royal Family who are . entitled to the style and dignity of HRH Prince or Princess do not need a . surname, but if at any time any of them do need a surname (such as upon . marriage), that surname is Mountbatten-Windsor.' Parents-to-be: The Duke of Cambridge is at his wife's side as she is in labour with their first child today . In 1917, George V adopted Windsor as the royal family's House and surname. In 1960, for the direct descendants of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh who require a surname, it became Mountbatten-Windsor. 'This is the biggest non-sporting event in our company's history' - Coral spokesman . Mountbatten was the surname Greek-born Prince Philip assumed when he became naturalised in 1947. If a boy, the baby is also likely to . one day be Prince of Wales when William accedes to the throne. The title . is usually given to the male heir to the throne, but it is not . automatic. Bookies are already cashing in after due dates backed by the punters passed by without a baby. The most popular day for due-date bets was last Thursday, July 18, when 1,142 people lost money with Ladbrokes alone. One punter was down £1,000 after . putting their money on July 17, and the company will make £23,000 after . getting to midnight last night without a royal baby.  Meanwhile Coral . says it has already made £25,000 from lost bets.

"It was among the most emotional speeches at last year’s Labour Party Conference. A young anti-crime campaigner, Narraser Gordon, was given a standing ovation from MPs including Tessa Jowell and Yvette Cooper when she movingly told how eight members of her family had been murdered. But now it has emerged that most of the ‘victims’ the campaigner claimed had died are in fact alive and well. Narraser Gordon and Ed Miliband discussed her campaign against violence as they walked around Bristol . After Miss Gordon was forced to admit . using ‘misleading’ words in her speech, Labour officials were criticised . for not checking her story before she was presented to the conference . last September. The 24-year-old, a member of the . Bristol West Labour Party, took to the stage in Liverpool to address the . party faithful and accused the Coalition Government of carrying out PR . stunts rather than tackling the important issues. She told the audience last September: ‘I am here to talk about why our young people are dying before they can see the age of 21. ‘We are here to challenge young people in asking the important question: Why join a gang, use a gun, or use a knife?’ Labour leader Ed Miliband met Narraser Gordon on a visit to Bristol . She continued: ‘This is an issue that . is causing a huge problem across the UK, including London, Liverpool, . Nottingham, Birmingham and in my own area Bristol – with eight of my . family members being murdered there. I am not a celebrity, I am simply a . young person who has had enough of seeing family members, friends and . other lives being taken before they can succeed in life.’ In a subsequent newspaper interview, . Miss Gordon, of Easton, Bristol, gave two examples of genuine victims to . whom she had links. One, Leon Plummer, who was stabbed to death in the city in 2002, was her cousin, although the pair had never met. She said another, 17-year-old Shevon Wilson, who was killed in September 2009, was a friend of hers. But a BBC current affairs team making a . documentary about Miss Gordon’s work began investigating her claims to . have lost eight members of her family to knife and gun crime, and say it . emerged that most of the people she claimed had been murdered were . actually alive. They claim she was also found communicating on Facebook with some of the people she had insisted were dead. When questioned by the BBC, Miss Gordon admitted that the majority of the people she told them about had not been murdered. Yesterday she said she ‘may have used words which could be seen as misleading’ and expressed ‘regret’. She told the regional Inside Out . programme, broadcast last night on BBC One: ‘I have lost three family . members and five very close friends who I consider as family. At conference: Miss Gordon addresses delegates - and, right, Tessa Jowell gives her a standing ovation . ‘I realise I may have used words which could be seen as misleading and I do regret this.’ She then bizarrely claimed that she . had changed the names in her story to shield the families of the ‘real’ victims, explaining: ‘I do admit that the names originally given to [the . BBC] were false. This was done to protect the families of my friends . that I have lost. ‘But I was not corresponding with . anyone on Facebook, I rarely talk to people on Facebook.’ Miss Gordon, . who met Labour leader Ed Miliband when he came to Bristol after last . summer’s riots, stood for the party during the 2011 local council . elections. She was said to be in London yesterday and is currently working on a campaign calling for more funding for community activists. Last night Phil Gaskin, regional . director of Labour South West, said: ‘She has not been suspended and we . will not be making any further comment on the matter.’ The ‘star’ of the same Labour party conference at which Miss Gordon spoke last year was 16-year-old Rory Weal. The schoolboy was feted as a ‘hero’ after his impassioned speech telling how the welfare state saved his family from ruin. But the Daily Mail revealed that he . was actually the privileged  son of a millionaire property developer, . and attended private school until his father’s business went bust.

"More than 20,000 people have been forced from their homes as German authorities prepare to defuse a massive bomb dating back to World War Two. Thousands of properties within a radius of 1.5km of the bomb were evacuated in the west German city of Dortmund. The 4,000-pound bomb was discovered after experts analysed old aerial photographs while searching for unexploded ordnance dropped on Germany's industrial Ruhr region by Allied aircraft. The 4,000-pound World War Two bomb was removed after being successfully defused today . Thousands of people have been offered shelter in the Westfalen Hall, in Dortmund after being forced from their homes . Experts examining old aerial photographs of Dortmund discovered the 4000-pound bomb, which is thought to have been dropped by the Allies during the Battle of the Ruhr . City authorities said they expect the operation to defuse the bomb will be completed by 2.30pm (3.30pm local time). While unexploded WWII-era bombs are regularly discovered in Germany, they are rarely as big as the one uncovered in Dortmund. A similar discovery two years ago prompted another mass evacuation, affecting 45,000 people in the city of Koblenz, along the River Rhine. Rescue workers helped people from their homes today. The city authorities said they expect the operation to defuse the bomb to be completed by 2.30pm or 3.30pm local time . An RAF Halifax bomber over the target during an attack on a synthetic oil plant in the Ruhr during the Second World War . The Battle of the Ruhr was a five-month campaign of strategic bombing launched in March 1943 by the Allies during World War Two. Allied bombers had within their sights the vast network of coke plants and steelworks as well as 10 synthetic oil plants, in a bid to cripple Nazi Germany's war effort. The campaign bombed 26 key targets, including the Krupp armament works in Essen, the Norstern synthetic oil-plant in Gelsenkirchen and the Rheinmetal-Borsig plant in Düsseldorf. Organised defence and the cloud of industrial pollutants producing a semi-permanent smog or industrial haze hampered accurate bombing. The British bomber force was made up of the twin-engined Vickers Wellington medium bomber and the four-engined Short Stirling, Handley Page Halifax and the Avro Lancaster. British raids were carried out at night, the losses during daylight missions proving too heavy to bear. Between them the Allies mounted 24-hour bombing raids, with the United States air force inflicting a series of raids during daylight hours, with close groups of bombers offering cover to one another. The raids carried out during the Battle of the Ruhr severely disrupted German production with steel production falling by 200,000 tons and the armaments industry facing a steel shortfall of 400,000 tons. Hitler and his minister for armaments Albert Speer were forced to cut planned increases in production.","More than 20,000 have been forced from their homes .

"Childminders and nurseries will be able to double the number of children they look after under radical plans to cut care bills for working families. Ministers are considering a move to copy French childcare rules where each member of staff can look after up to eight children. In England the limit is just four toddlers. It is hoped that reducing the red-tape burden on employers will help to bring down childcare bills which sees British parents spending more than a quarter of their income on looking after their children. Nursery staff would be able to look after more children under plans to cut huge bills for families which see mothers with a full-time job needing to work for up to four months of the year just to break even . Education minister Liz Truss today signalled she wants to tear up ‘onerous requirements on numbers’ to bring reduce nursery bills. Britain has some of the highest childcare costs in the world, meaning the typical mother with one child and a full-time job needs to work for up to four months of the year just to break even. Millions with two or more children conclude it is not worth working at all. But Miss Truss said the problem could be tackled without additional government funding. She pointed to ‘strong examples’ in Europe where rules on staff ratios are less stringent, which would enable nurseries to employ fewer, better-paid staff. The minister warned that in the UK . some poorly-paid childcare workers do not have good qualifications in . English and maths ‘yet we expect them to help our young children learn . to speak and do their first sums’. In France Écoles Maternelles offer . traditional nursery style teaching by teachers in large groups of 3 and 4 . year olds and the government there is about to extend them to . disadvantaged two-year-olds. French crèches for the under-3s are also in . much demand, Miss Truss said. Education minister Liz Truss warned salaries for nursery staff are being capped by 'of onerous requirements on numbers' ‘They operate with fewer staff who are . better qualified and better paid than their English equivalents,’ she . said in an article for the ConservativeHome website. In France, staff are paid over . £16,000 and are responsible for up to eight toddlers. The figure in . Ireland and Holland is up to six children. By comparison, nursery staff in England earn £13,000 and can be responsible for no more than four toddlers. Miss Truss said: ‘In England, we need to move to a simpler, clearer system that prioritises quality and safety over excessive bureaucracy. ‘We also need to think about the balance between the number and quality of staff in our system. ‘It is no coincidence that we have the most restrictive adult-child ratios for young children of comparable European countries as well as the lowest staff salaries. ‘Our ratios put a cap on the salaries staff can be paid because of onerous requirements on numbers. ‘If staff are being paid barely more than minimum wage, nurseries struggle to retain and recruit high quality people.’ However, Labour warned a move towards the French system could harm the quality of care. Shadow education secretary Stephen Twigg said: 'David Cameron is presiding over a childcare crisis – with 381 Sure Start centres shut down, spiralling costs for working parents and less support through tax credits. 'Now his own Children’s minister says they plan to cut the number of nursery staff – which experts say will threaten child safety and the quality of care for toddlers.' Ministers are expected to set out a major overhaul of childcare next week. Staff in French nurseries can care for eight children, compared to just four toddlers in England . In addition to changes to staffing ratios, it is likely to include generous tax breaks being offered to families with children under five who need to pay for nurseries and childminders. Senior coalition figures are to meet later this week to finalise a deal expected to be worth up to £2,000 per year per child for all working parents. The favoured model would more than make up for the loss of child benefit for better-off families that comes into effect today – but only for those where both parents work.","In France staff can look after up to eight children but in England the number is just four .

"The Okapi, or forest giraffe, and the sub-Saharan white-winged flufftail – one of Africa’s rarest birds – are now on the brink of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The two animals are the latest additions to its Red List of Threatened Species, which now runs to a shocking 21,286 species. However, there is good news. Two species of albatross, the leatherback turtle and the island fox native to California’s Channel Islands are showing signs of recovery. Endangered: The Okapi is a close relative of the giraffe and is revered in Congo as a national symbol . The update highlights serious declines in the population of the okapi (okapia johnstoni), a close relative of the giraffe, unique to the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The species is now Endangered, only one step away from the highest risk of extinction, with numbers dwindling across its range. Poaching and habitat loss, as well as the presence of rebels, elephant poachers and illegal miners, are the principal threats to its survival. ‘The okapi is revered in Congo as a national symbol – it even features on the Congolese franc banknotes,’ says Dr Noëlle Kümpel co-chair of the IUCN SSC Giraffe and Okapi Specialist Group and manager of ZSL’s range-wide okapi conservation project. Threatened: The extremely rare white-winged flufftail could become extinct unless measures are taken to protect it . ‘Sadly, DRC has been caught up in civil conflict and ravaged by poverty for nearly two decades, leading to widespread degradation of okapi habitat and hunting for its meat and skin. Supporting government efforts to tackle the civil conflict and extreme poverty in the region are critical to securing its survival.’ According to the update, almost 200 species of bird are now classed as critically endangered, facing the highest risk of extinction. The white-winged flufftail (sarothrura ayresi), a small, secretive bird which occurs in Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, is the latest species to join this category. Destruction and degradation of its habitat, including wetland drainage, conversion for agriculture, water abstraction, overgrazing by livestock and cutting of marsh vegetation, have driven it to this precarious state. Urgent action is now needed to better understand the species’ ecology and to address these threats, the IUCN said. Population increase: Numbers of  Leatherback Turtles have risen . Although the global population of the leatherback turtle (dermochelys coriacea) - the largest of all living turtles – has improved, the species continues to face serious threats at a subpopulation level. Leatherbacks are a single species, globally comprising seven biologically and geographically distinct subpopulations. The Northwest Atlantic Ocean Leatherback subpopulation is abundant and increasing thanks to successful conservation initiatives in the region. In contrast, the East Pacific Ocean subpopulation, which nests along the Pacific coast of the Americas, and the West Pacific Ocean subpopulation, found in Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, are both in severe decline due to extensive egg harvest and incidental capture in fishing gear. Targeted conservation efforts are needed to prevent their collapse. The IUCN Red List update also brings good news for some of the species assessed. Two species of albatross - one of the most threatened of the planet’s bird families – are now at a lower risk of extinction due to increases in their populations. The black-browed albatross (thalassarche melanophrys) has moved from endangered to near-threatened and the black-footed albatross (phoebastria nigripes) has moved from vulnerable to near-threatened. By-catch in fisheries is the main threat to these species. The island fox (urocyon littoralis), previously critically endangered, has also improved in status and is now listed as near-threatened. Hunted: Island Fox numbers declined partly as a result of being on the menu for non-native Golden Eagles . Found on six of the California Channel Islands off the coast of southern California, four island fox subspecies suffered catastrophic declines in the mid 1990s mainly due to disease and predation by non-native species, such as the golden eagle. All four subspecies have now recovered or are approaching recovery. This is mainly due to successful conservation work of IUCN Member the U.S. National Park Service, which included captive breeding, reintroduction, vaccination against canine diseases and relocation of golden eagles. ‘This IUCN Red List update shows some fantastic conservation successes, which we must learn from, for future conservation efforts,’ says Jane Smart, Global Director, IUCN Biodiversity Conservation.","The Okapi is revered in Congo and even features on banknotes .

Just because I’m in my eighth decade, I don’t see why I should fade into the background. 'Some of my friends complain about ageing but I decided to do something about it. There is nothing wrong with a little bit of nip and tuck to keep myself looking as young as I feel. 'Overall I’ve spent just under £10,000 on cosmetic procedures but I worked hard before I retired. I don’t see why I shouldn’t be able to use some of the hard-earned money I managed to save.'

And after joining dating site match.com, she’s had countless offers of dates from men in their 30s and 40s - and even one man who was just 26. Jane said: 'I was flattered but I had to say no. That’s just too young for me, he wouldn’t have been mature enough. 'At first I had my real age on my profile but kept getting requests from men in their eighties. 'Now I put myself down as ten years younger and I regularly get men in their 30s or 40s getting in touch. I don’t feel my age so I really don’t see why I should be going around with old men.'

"Important guests: Former secretary of state Henry Kissinger is believed to have attended the elite secret meeting . British taxpayers will have to foot the bill for the ‘exceptional costs’ of policing of the clandestine Bilderberg meeting to be held in Watford next week. The annual meeting of royalty, prime ministers and business chiefs - famous for being shrouded in secrecy - is taking place in Britain for the first time since 1998. Given the amount of – so far unnamed - . prestigious people set to attend the event at the luxury Watford hotel . in Hertfordshire, local police have been forced to step up security, . which will be part-funded by the government. The . cloak of secrecy surrounding the meetings, which ban journalists from . attending, has fuelled various conspiracy theories, including that . attendees are plotting world domination. As a result, there are fears that anti-capitalist protesters will cause ‘violence and disturbance’ at the meeting on 6 June. Hertfordshire . police have refused to release the cost of security for the event, . which has previously drawn mass demonstrations in other locations around . the world. However, they are in talks with the Home Office about a grant for ‘unexpected or exceptional costs’ that is only given out if it threatens the stability of the force’s policing budget. Dorothy Thornhill, the mayor of Watford, told the Watford Observer: 'I have my concerns about it because it does attract people who can and do cause violence and disturbance. ‘But I am confident the police will be able to minimise that and give them their right to protest. Tory Minister without portfolio Kenneth Clarke (left) and PM David Cameron are expected to be among the 140 invited guests in attendance . Policing resources in Watford have been stretched to accommodate the elite guests that will arrive tomorrow. Protest are expected to break out . ‘I am ambivalent about whether this is a good thing. It’s potentially a positive thing as long as things don’t kick off,’ she said. The invitation-only Bilderberg meetings, which began in 1954, are attended by around 140 people of influence from North America and Europe. Previous guests are thought to have included Henry Kissinger, David Rockefeller, Prince Charles, Peter Mandelson, David Cameron and Queen Beatrix of Holland.","Hertfordshire policing budget under pressure due to security costs .

"At least eight people have died after a fire tore through a clothes factory in an 11-storey building in Bangladesh's capital yesterday. Fire brigade officials said the blaze at the building in Dhaka broke out last night and by this morning crews had found eight people dead, including a police officer and the factory's managing director. The deadly blaze comes just two weeks after a building housing clothes factories collapsed in the country, killing at least 892 people. Scroll down for video . At least eight people have died in the fire that swept through a garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh . A police officer and the factory's managing director were found dead after the blaze gutted the building . Police collect evidence from inside the gutted garment. It the latest disaster to hit the country's lucrative garment industry after more than 900 people died when a building collapsed . Ten people were reportedly wounded in the deadly blaze at the 11-storey garment factory . The latest incident will once again raise concerns about safety measures in the country's £13billion garment industry. In November, a fire at another factory killed 112 people. Yesterday's blaze broke out shortly after about 300 workers at the Tung Hai Sweater factory went home for the day, fire official Nazrul Islam said. It burned parts of the first and second floors, which housed the factory, and parts of the third, which housed apartments. The dead included friends and personal staff of the factory boss, officials said. Bhajan Kumar Sarkar, another fire official, said the managing director of the factory, Mahbubur Rahman, and a police official were among the dead. All the dead had been found in the stairwell. Mr Sarkar said it took more than three hours to bring the blaze under control. The Tung Hai Group is a large garment exporter that says on its website that it produces clothes for Primark and Inditex Group of Spain. Mail Online has attempted to contact Primark. A spokesman for Inditex said it had last placed an order with the factory in 2011. 'But then we stopped ordering because the factory did not meet the standards we demand from our providers', he said. Meanwhile the death toll from the April 24 blaze - the worst garment manufacturing disaster in the world - climbed to nearly 900 today as authorities continued to search for more bodies. Police said 892 bodies had been recovered from the rubble of the eight-storey Rana Plaza building in a suburb of Dhaka. Dozens of bodies recovered yesterday were so decomposed they were being sent to a lab for DNA identification, police said. A woman weeps outside the site of the blaze. It comes just two weeks after almost 900 people died when a garment factory collapsed in Dhaka . The fire at the Tung Hai Sweater factory started after most of the 300 workers had left for the day . A mound of burnt sweaters lies inside the factory. The fire spread through parts of the first and second floors . The garment industry in Bangladesh is worth £13billion but concerns over safety have been raised recently . Following protests, authorities also began paying salaries and other benefits to survivors. The European Union's delegation to Bangladesh urged the government to 'act immediately' to improve working conditions and authorities said the government had closed 18 clothes factories in recent days for failing to meet work and safety standards. There is no clear indication of how many bodies still remain trapped in the debris because the exact number of people inside the building at the time of the collapse is unknown. More than 2,500 people were rescued alive. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association earlier said 3,122 workers were employed at the five factories housed in the building, but it was not clear how many were there during the packed morning shift when it collapsed. Several stores and a bank were also in the building. A ceiling fan has been burnt and melted by the heat of the devastating blaze in Mirpur . Factory workers wait outside the gutted 11-storey building that houses the Tung Hai Sweater Ltd . The government had closed 18 clothes factories in recent days for failing to meet safety standards . Ruth Tanner, campaigns and policy director at the anti-poverty charity War on Want, said: 'It is shocking, but sadly not surprising that more people have lost their lives in another Bangladeshi garment factory blaze. 'Tragedies like this will keep happening unless proper safety measures are put in place. British retailers must sign the Bangladesh Fire and Building Safety Agreement as a first step to prevent further deaths.' Ratings agency Moody's said clothing factory disasters in Bangladesh and frequent, increasingly violent strikes posed risks to the country's credit rating. It said political tension was damaging confidence in Bangladesh, which has a rating below investment grade. A general strike was called earlier this week by opposition political parties to protest at the deaths of at least 29 people during street demonstrations. Investor confidence in Bangladesh also dropped after the deadly factory blaze two weeks ago . Moody's says 'continued political tensions are credit negative because they may further damage investor confidence in Bangladesh against the background of recurrent industrial disasters in the ready-made garment sector'. Bangladesh's rating from Moody's is Ba3, three notches below the lowest investment grade rating.","Officials said a police officer and factory's managing director among the dead .

"A fake plastic surgeon whose botched injections left a woman’s face swollen beyond recognition is being investigated by police. Marcelle King suffered a severe allergic reaction after ‘Dr’ Ozan Melin gave her what he claimed was Botox. Her heart started racing and she was rushed to A&E to receive a cocktail of drugs to bring the reaction under control. Marcelle King suffered a severe allergic reaction after she was given what was claimed to be Botox by 'Dr' Ozan Melin (file picture posed by models) Dog-trainer Marcelle, 58, paid Melin £400 cash to have the treatment in a friend’s kitchen. She was impressed when he turned up in a new BMW and told her: ‘I’m a surgeon and I trained in America.’ But 37-year-old Melin lives on a council estate and is not a doctor. He runs a cosmetic treatment firm called Smoothface. After the first treatment nothing happened, so Mrs King went back after a week as he had offered a free booster. A major inquiry led by NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh has exposed shamefully inadequate practices in this sector . ‘This time the injections were far more painful,’ she said. Five hours later, her face felt ‘on fire’ and she could not open her eyes. The next day she saw a nurse who insisted: ‘You need steroids, antihistamines, adrenaline and antibiotics, now!’ At A&E she was told the reaction had made her heart go into tachycardia, which can kill. Consultant Kevin Hancock, of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said the fact Melin was taking cash-in-hand for kitchen injections ‘all adds up to a dodgy Del Boy image’. ‘It’s highly likely this reaction was caused by impurities in whatever he injected into her face,’ he said. When we confronted Melin at home in Lytchett Matravers, Dorset, he claimed Mrs King’s dogs caused the reactions. He said: ‘She done it to herself.’ A spokesman for Dorset Police said:  ‘A 37-year-old Poole man has been arrested on suspicion of fraud. He has been released on bail until early December.’ Earlier this year The Mail on Sunday launched its Stop The Cosmetic Surgery Cowboys campaign. Since then a major inquiry led by NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh has exposed shamefully inadequate practices in this sector. He recommended much better training and tighter regulation.

"The Taliban was 'thrilled' when Bowe Bergdahl's father 'claimed the White House for Islam' by thanking Allah in his press conference with President Obama, it has been claimed. The father of the freed soldier - who former colleagues claim was a deserter - said he was speaking Arabic and Pashto because his son's English was poor after five years in captivity. But commentators accused him of giving the Taliban a priceless propaganda tool, with one saying extremist sources in Pakistan were delighted. Threats: Federal authorities have confirmed that threats have been made against Bob Bergdahl and his wife Jani following their son's controversial release . Moment of release: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl was shown struggling to adjust his eyes to the light at the moment he was released in a video released by a Taliban website. Former colleagues accused him of being a deserter . Mr Bergdahl spoke at the White House after 28-year-old Bowe - the only American prisoner of war in Afghanistan - was freed in exchange for five Afghan detainees held by the U.S. Introduced by the President in the rose garden on Saturday, he spoke mostly English with some Arabic and Pashto. 'I'd like to say to Bowe right now, who's having trouble speaking English, bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim,' he said. 'I'm your father Bowe. The people of Afghanistan, the same. 'To . everyone who effected this... throughout the whole of American . government and international governments around the world, thank you so . much.' The Arabic phrase bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim appears prominently in the Koran and means 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful'. Sara Carter, senior Washington correspondent for conservative news network TheBlaze, said her Taliban sources were 'thrilled' at the phrase being used. Swap: Sgt Bergdahl, 28, was handed over to U.S. special forces in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees . Emotional: Bob and Jani Bergdahl wept as they spoke of their love for their son in another press conference . Accusations: Sara Carter, senior Washington correspondent for TheBlaze, said the Taliban was thrilled . She told TV commentator Glenn Beck, who founded TheBlaze: 'He definitely was, in a way, consecrating the area. 'He was reaching out. It's an Islamic phrase... And when I contacted my sources in Pakistan who have direct links with the Taliban, they were actually thrilled, the Taliban was actually thrilled that the father did this.' She added: 'This is incredible, he's gone way way beyond just a father reaching out to his son. Divisive: Bob Bergdahl said he studied Arabic to understand his son's captors . 'He’s actually putting so many lives in danger, and he’s giving a propaganda tool to Mullah Omar, who is the leader of the Taliban who the U.S. has been looking for for years.' Others, however, said there was nothing so sinister in the former UPS delivery man's speech. After his son was captured by the Taliban in June 2009, Mr Bergdahl said he immersed himself in the language and culture of Afghanistan chiefly so he could understand the captors, and speak to them from afar. He said in a previous interview: 'I'm trying to learn a little Pashto so that I can speak to people... I'm trying to write or read the language. 'I probably spend four hours a day reading on the region and the history.' Stefanie O'Neill, a Bergdahl family friend, added to CNN: 'Wouldn't you try and connect with the people that had your child? 'Bob and Jani did everything possible they could to ensure Bowe's safety. And if Bob was trying to connect with them, it was to keep his son safe, I'm sure.' Yesterday a public homecoming parade for Bergdahl featuring Grammy-winning singer Carole King was abruptly cancelled in his tiny hometown of Hailey, Idaho. The official reason given was a concern for public safety - but MailOnline learned that a row erupted between Mayor Fritz Haemmerle and former US Army Platoon leader Jonathan Kennedy, who lives in the town. In . an email to Mayor Haemmerle, who wanted to hold the celebration, Kennedy said: ‘If Individual members of the . community wish to hold sedate, private celebrations to commemorate Bowe . Bergdahl's homecoming, they are of course free and welcome to do so. Cancelled: A homecoming parade for Bergdahl was abruptly called off in his home town of Hailey, Idaho . Political firestorm: Senator John McCain - who was a POW for more than five years in North Vietnam - speaks to reporters yesterday. President Obama has been accused of putting a price on an American life . 'It would be, however, a monstrous profanity if a public ceremony, financed by public money, were to be held. ‘It would be more monstrous still if this ceremony were to, in any way, heap undeserved adulation on Bergdahl, or to adopt the sickly hue of ostentatious jingoism that all too often colors such occasions.’ He added: ‘Until he is cleared of the charges against him, this man deserves no applause. For now, the only appropriate response is silence.' Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel phoned Bergdahl's family yesterday to update them on his condition. In the 10-minute call Hagel wished the family well and told them the Defense Department will continue to support the soldier's medical care, along with the process known as reintegration. An official said Bob and Jani Bergdahl expressed their gratitude. Earlier Wednesday, Hagel told reporters that the rush to judgment about Bergdahl is 'unfair' to his family. Footage: A video on the Voice Of Jihad Website was confirmed to show Sgt Bergdahl on the day he was freed . Released: Since he was taken back by the U.S., Bergdahl has been in debriefing with military psychologists . To freedom: The soldier was shown in the video being patted down by his own colleagues before boarding . The POW's exchange for five Guantanamo detainees has provoked a storm of controversy. Many accused President Obama of negotiating with terrorists and allowing a clear price to be set on an American life. And . while the soldier has been hidden from public view, being debriefed by . military psychologists, many of his former colleagues have accused him . directly of desertion. Some claim six servicemen died in the search for the POW, and a Facebook group called Bowe Bergdahl is NOT a hero! has attracted more than 13,000 members. Its description reads: 'Bowe Bergdahl has been made out to be a hero, deserving of praise. 'However, the media and government have lied to the public and covered up the facts. 'I and many of my former battle buddies have first hand knowledge of what took place on that hill in Afghanistan. 'We are here. We will be heard. Bergdahl will be held accountable for his actions.'","Bob Bergdahl said 'bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim', Arabic phrase in Koran .

"With the shock revelation that Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka had a furious bust-up following their ATP Tour Finals clash, Sportsmail examines the role Federer’s wife Mirka played in the fallout at the London event and finds out who really holds the power behind Roger’s throne... After the birth of his second set of twins this summer, Roger Federer faced a question similar to that of any newly-besotted father — when should he go back to work? The prestigious Italian Open was soon to start and he was scheduled to be there, so he consulted with his family, and above all wife Mirka, about what to do. It did not sound like a long conversation. A few days later in Rome, a happy and smiling Federer recalled in jesting fashion: ‘They said I should quickly come and play here. I said “Well, if you don’t want me around I’ll go away”.’ Roger Federer and Mirka Vavrinec met at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and married in 2009 . Mirka watches Federer in action at Wimbledon in 2012 with the pair's twin daughters Myla and Charlene . Federer had a row with rival Stan Wawrinka after Federer's wife 'heckled' him during their ATP finals match . This response from Mrs Federer was not unexpected, for she has always been driven in her support of her husband’s career and, as a former player herself, fully understands that the business of tennis has to come first for now. Perhaps more surprising was that Mirka had got herself to Paris a fortnight later, along with their four children, in order to be in the stands for his opening match at the French Open. It must have been quite a logistical effort with new twins Leo and Lenny just three weeks old, but then their lives are famously well organised. And Mirka is renowned for the steely back-up she provides for world-famous Roger. Mirka is an ever-present at the Swiss star's games, and shows the strain on day three at Wimbledon in 2013 . Just how unbending that support can be was illustrated on Saturday night in London, when she apparently upset his friend and opponent Stan Wawrinka with some well-chosen words. It cannot always be easy to be married to a sporting phenomenon like Federer, who transcends tennis and has become as much its global ambassador as its most decorated player. He wields enormous power in the game and has an almost presidential status. That being the case, his wife might be akin to the First Lady. Beyond the cliche of every successful man having a strong woman behind them, there is no question that Mirka Federer has played a considerable part in the achievements of her extraordinarily talented spouse. Nobody who knows them well would tell you otherwise. ‘Not much gets past Mirka,’ is how one confidant put it in assessing her influence. In most individual sports there is usually at least one family figure who has been disproportionately responsible for the success of an athlete — most often a parent — and particularly in tennis. Federer’s father Robbie and mother Lynette have, however, been among the more relaxed of the breed and for most of his adult career it has been Mirka, 36, who has been a key force. Critical to their successful and happy partnership has been her understanding and ambition, which derives itself from her own experiences as a professional whose career was cut short. As Miroslava Vavrinec, Mirka emigrated with her parents from Slovakia to Switzerland at the age of two and her interest in tennis was fired by meeting Martina Navratilova at a tournament seven years later. Mirka emigrated with her parents from Slovakia to Switzerland at the age of two . Her interest in tennis was fired by meeting Martina Navratilova at a tournament seven years later . Federer, pictured with Mirka at the Laureus World Sports Awards, says his wife has seen over 900 matches . She went on to become a decent player, reaching No 76 in the world. The Swiss writer Rene Stauffer, author of Federer’s biography, illustrated her innate determination by relating how, as a junior, she once journeyed through civil war-riven Croatia just to play a tournament. Most significantly for her life, it took her to the Sydney Olympics in 2000, where she met the 20-year-old Federer. Her career was not to flourish as his did and within two years she retired with a persistent foot injury. From then on she dedicated herself to her boyfriend’s career, starting as his public relations conduit but then becoming indispensable in all areas. In 2009 they married and she gave birth to their first set of twins, Charlene and Myla. These days she rarely speaks publicly but is very visible in Roger’s support box and behind the scenes, where she is seen as a quietly formidable figure. In a rare interview with Swiss magazine Schweizer Illustrierte, she emphasised the value of her own tennis knowledge, saying, ‘That’s why we get along so perfectly. No other woman could deal with so much tennis. If he wants to sleep long I definitely won’t wake him by getting up early.’ John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors . There was no love lost between the two American greats, but it was a surprise when their ugliest spat came in an exhibition match. After trading comments, Connors crossed the net to confront McEnroe, who pushed his opponent away. Andre Agassi and Thomas Muster . Muster enraged Agassi when he patted the American on the cheek after a five-set victory. In his book, Agassi wrote: ‘Apart from the fact it was a disdainful gesture, he almost took my toupee off.’ Andy Murray and Juan Martin Del Potro . An otherwise ordinary meeting in Rome in 2008 came to life when Del Potro sparked an ugly argument by insulting Murray’s mother, Judy. However, she clearly expects to come into her own when Federer’s body can no longer take the grind of the circuit. Referring to his lofty status as a player she said: ‘You are that only once in your life. My time is still coming. After the tennis. We have discussed this.’ For now she serves as a multi-tasker extraordinaire, gatekeeper to her massively in-demand husband as well as his emotional and practical support. She also has major input into his ‘look’ and fashion adventures, a few of which have backfired. It is said she even supervises the way he has his hair cut. Federer has often said how grateful he is to her for providing the stability and family happiness that is his inspiration. The spat with Wawrinka is an exception to the smooth running of their lives. The verbals from courtside perhaps tell of something she has in common with her husband: underneath it all lies a supreme competitor.

He said: ‘All consultants recognise there is vulnerability in hospitals over the weekend, and I would challenge any consultant not to have a degree of anxiety if one of their own relatives was admitted to hospital at a weekend, knowing the amount of current senior involvement there is.’ He added: ‘At the moment we see patients taking up hospital beds at weekends, essentially treading water with no progressive treatment or diagnostics and few options to be discharged.’ Campaigners last night called for greater investment in out-of-hours care to end the healthcare lottery, following Professor Willett’s admission on the NHS England website. John O’Connell, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘If even the head of our A&E departments is concerned for his family, then alarm bells should be ringing. ‘Far too much money is wasted in the NHS and this leaves essential, frontline services stretched. It’s crucial that this waste is cut out so that taxpayers’ hard-earned cash is spent on ensuring patients get high-quality treatment at all times.’ Earlier this year, a study revealed patients undergoing routine surgery at the weekend were 82 per cent more likely to die compared with on a Monday – partly because fewer consultants were on duty. Professor Willetts is leading a review into England's accident and emergency departments . And an investigation by the  Daily . Mail last month revealed that only five consultants work overnight in . A&E across the whole of England. But the British Medical Association, . which represents senior doctors, said the NHS simply cannot afford to . provide the same level of service at weekends. Professor Willett disagrees and claims a seven-days-a-week operation could actually save the NHS money. Referring to his experience working in . Oxford almost two decades ago, he said: ‘We showed how a seven-day . service could be highly efficient and cost-effective. We reduced . admissions and shortened length of stay.’ He added: ‘We found that we were able . to close down the number of beds – in fact it was reduced by 25 per cent . – and that meant we released nursing costs, with that money going into . the extra physiotherapy support we needed at weekends.’ The Government wants to improve . staffing levels and the availability of NHS services at weekends . following concerns that patients are dying due to poor standards. Last . week Dr Andy Mitchell, who oversees the health service in London, said . there were times of the day when patients were at risk because staff . were spread too thinly. He warned that hospitals in the . capital were ‘at breaking point’ and admitted senior managers were . constantly ‘trying to patch up’. In September, an investigation found . A&E departments are being left in the hands of junior doctors . between midnight and 8am, overseen by a handful of slightly more . experienced medics – many of whom are locums. But Dr Paul Flynn, chairman of the BMA . consultants’ committee, said senior doctors were available at weekends . as part of an ‘on call’ rota under their normal contract.","Keith Willett, is NHS England director of .

"Glam grand slam: Leah Totton appears to have given her past come cosmetic surgery . There's no denying  the glamorous blonde Apprentice winner Leah Totton is a great advertisement for the chain of Botox clinics she intends to set up. Nicknamed Dr Totty, the 25-year-old doctor from Northern Ireland hopes her new business will leave her customers with smooth foreheads and her with fat profits. Just days after being named as Lord Sugar’s latest Apprentice on the BBC show, she is hard at work establishing a chain of Dr Leah cosmetic clinics with the £250,000 she received from her formidable backer. But already she has faced a backlash from those who believe she lacks the expertise and experience needed to perform or oversee the anti-ageing treatments she plans to offer. So, it must be interesting for Leah’s detractors to learn her local newspaper, the Londonderry Sentinel, published a story in February, before The Apprentice aired, that wrote in glowing terms of her skills. The article reported Miss Totton had set up a company called LT Medical, a team of ‘leading skin rejuvenation specialists’ who worked with clients to ‘achieve their aesthetic dreams’. Apparently, her clinics had been so successful in England that she was planning to expand into Northern Ireland. LT Medical, readers were informed, was ‘led by a team of dedicated UK doctors’. The company offered ‘a wide range of aesthetic treatments, including anti- wrinkle injections, facial fillers, lip enhancement and skin peels’. How extraordinary then that the Mail’s attempts to locate LT Medical, its premises, any one of those dedicated UK doctors, a website or even a phone number were this week met with a blank. There is no such company registered with Companies House and no listing for it at the Care Quality Commission, the independent regulator of health and social care services. Naturally, you expect a cosmetic surgery clinic to be discreet, but surely not invisible? In an attempt to seek more information about LT Medical, I contacted Frank PR, which represents Miss Totton. However, a spokesman would only say: ‘Previous to being on The Apprentice, Leah had set up a trading name in Belfast as she always had in mind what she is going to do now with Lord Sugar. ‘Now she’s won the show, this brand is not something she will be pursuing. Going forward, her focus will be solely on developing the Dr Leah brand.’ Scroll down for video . Face-off: Miss Totton beat Luisa Zissman to win The Apprentice and Sir Alan Sugar's £250,000 investment in her cosmetic surgery business . While the whereabouts of LT Medical remains a mystery, it turns out the newspaper’s information for the story, I am told, was supplied to a reporter by Miss Totton herself. This brings us to the latest company, Dr Leah. At the outset, Lord Sugar seemed doubtful about Miss Totton’s business proposition. He wasn’t all that impressed — who would be? — with her suggested name for the company: NIKS (skin spelt backwards). The name Dr Leah was his idea. He was also worried about the ethics of cosmetic surgery. But eventually he was won round to the idea and picked Miss Totton over fellow finalist Luisa Zissman, who baked cupcakes. One insider at the BBC says that Lord Sugar was ‘rather taken’ with Miss Totton. ‘She’s very much a man’s woman. She’s tough and ambitious, but softer around men, and was all feminine and charm around Lord Sugar. ‘He seemed to be quite impressed with her appearance and would help her when she made mistakes.’ And the source says Miss Totton liked . to look her best at all times. ‘During filming she was always looking in . the mirror and talking about camera angles. ‘She was paranoid for some reason about going out in sunlight, as though she was worried she might melt or something.’ Is this an indication that Miss Totton has had ‘work’ done herself — research, you could say, for the job ahead? Firm favourite: A BBC insider said Lord Sugar was 'rather taken' with Dr Leah . She says not. ‘I can 100 per cent verify I have not had any treatment done,’ she says. ‘I don’t have wrinkles. I’m only 25 and they’re not treatments that are aimed at my age group. ‘They’re anti-ageing treatments and at 25, certainly no — I have not had any. And I’m not looking to have any in the near future.’ TV critics have been underwhelmed by this series of The Apprentice and have described it as ‘a load of old Botox’. One critic said Lord Sugar had got  it wrong by choosing the ‘butcher’ (Dr Leah) over the ‘baker’ (cupcake queen Luisa). At first glance, it may appear Sugar himself thinks so, too. As well as investing £250,000 in the Dr  Leah chain, it had been assumed he would also become a director, take shares in the company — and a cut of the profits. He is, for example, a director of Aventom, the company set up by a previous Apprentice winner, Thomas Pellereau, and owns 100 of Aventom’s 200 shares. But so far Miss Totton is the only director of Dr Leah and owns all the company’s 100 shares. Surely Lord Sugar is not being cautious in case the cynics who can visualise pictures of women in the papers under the headlines ‘Dr Leah gave  me a trout pout’ are proved right? Not at all, say Lord Sugar’s PR. He insists the delay is simply procedural and he will soon become a director and own half of the company. There is no denying Miss Totton’s intelligence and drive. Before deciding she wanted to go into the cosmetic surgery business, she trained to become a doctor, at  considerable expense to the public purse. Raised in Londonderry, one of three children to her mother Lorraine and father, Trevor, who works for a communications company, Leah was, by all accounts, an extraordinarily bright child. She attended Lisnagelvin primary school, and Foyle and Londonderry College, which she left  with straight As and an array of prizes. From there, Leah moved to Norwich to . study medicine. While at university she went out with footballer Fraser . Forster, who was on loan at Norwich from Newcastle before signing for . Celtic. The relationship is . now over. One associate says Miss Totton, who became known during that . time as a minor WAG, may have ended it because ‘he wasn’t famous enough . as a footballer for her’. But who knows, as Mr Forster did congratulate her on winning The Apprentice, which suggests he holds no grudge. Miss Totton graduated in 2011 with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MB BS). After . leaving university, Leah says she did further training in aesthetic . medicine in Harley Street. The details are vague; what course she did is . not clear. Careful image: Leah Totton's company LT Medical was reportedly so successful in England she was expanding to Northern Ireland - but it appears never to have existed . During the filming of The Apprentice, she worked in A&E at Newham General Hospital in East London. She has tweeted several times about having done the night shift in between filming — testament to her dedication to her profession. However, building a cosmetics empire and doing the night shift at A&E are not compatible with each another. One job had to go — no prizes for guessing which one. Acquaintances say Miss Totton aims not just to become a successful businesswoman, but rich and famous, too — a ‘celebrity’. ‘She’s already talking about cracking America, which seems a bit premature,’ says one. Miss Totton insists she wants to set up Dr Leah clinics because she is concerned about the lack of regulation in the cosmetic surgery industry and wants to ‘provide a safe environment for women to undergo these treatments’. ‘I don’t see it as moving over to the dark side, I see it as medicalising the dark side and casting light onto it,’ she says. ‘Young women of 25 don’t need Botox. And I am a very moral person, so I would have no hesitation in saying that to a member of the public who came to me for non-surgical treatment.’ It’s not clear whether Miss Totton plans to carry out procedures herself or to take a purely managerial role. Plastic surgeons have warned that she doesn’t have the skills to carry out procedures. ‘She may have done a few weeks’ training in aesthetic medicine, but that is simply not enough,’ says consultant plastic surgeon Nigel Mercer, a former chairman of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons. ‘It may not be quite as dangerous as putting a hairdresser in charge of cosmetic surgery, but it is still putting patients at risk.’ But Miss Totton insists her clinics are going  to be professional and ethical, operated by trained staff who won’t give clients a trout pout, frozen eyebrows or a wonky smile. She has a wealth of experience behind her, after all, with that mysterious cosmetics empire of hers — LT Medical.","Leah Totton reportedly set up aesthetic treatment company LT Medical .

"Scientists have found a gene that causes asthma in children, giving millions hope of new treatments or even a cure. A faulty version of the gene can weaken the lining of the airways, leaving people vulnerable to the respiratory disease, they found. The researchers hope the news will lead to better treatments for asthma, which affects 5.4million Britons and caused 1,143 deaths in 2010. Hope: Scientists have foun a gene that causes asthma in children, giving millions hope of new treatments or even a cure . In the long run, they hope gene therapy – replacing faulty DNA with a healthy version – could cure some patients. ‘The finding offers hope for individuals with severe asthma, as the gene seems to play a major role for those with this specific condition,’ said Dr Hakon Hakonarson, of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. ‘Asthma researchers have been increasingly interested in the role of the airway epithelium [lining],’ he added. Scientists compared the DNA of 1,173 children with severe asthma with that of 2,522 healthy people and found those with asthma were far more likely to have a certain gene variation. The gene in question controls how cells lining the walls of our airways bind together. In people with a faulty version of the gene, the cells are less effectively bound, leaving them vulnerable to irritants that can cause a major asthma attack. Scientists believe this gene is the main factor in as many as one in five cases of asthma. Discovery: Scientists compared the DNA of 1,173 children with severe asthma with that of 2,522 healthy people and found those with asthma were far more likely to have a certain gene variation (file picture) ‘Twice as many people with severe asthma had the gene variant as healthy individuals,’ said Dr Hakonarson, joint lead author of the research in the journal Nature Genetics. ‘There will be a sub-set of people with asthma, between 15 and 20 per cent, where this gene has the biggest impact on their condition.’ He added that the discovery ‘may lead to more effective, targeted treatments for this type of childhood asthma’. Researcher Klaus Bonnelykke, of the University of Copenhagen, said: ‘Because asthma symptoms are fairly similar in all children, doctors tend to approach the condition in the same way. ‘However, in reality asthma has many different underlying mechanisms, which need to be individually mapped.’ Leanne Reynolds, of Asthma UK, said: ‘Asthma is the most common long-term condition in childhood – in fact, one in 11 children have asthma. ‘This study adds to our knowledge about underlying causes of the condition, but there is still a lot of work to be done. ‘We welcome further research into the role of our genes and how they are linked to asthma, as this could lead to the development of life-changing new treatments in the future.’","Researchers hope findings will lead to better treatments for the disease .

"The sun's magnetic field may be responsible for increasing the number of lightning strikes on Earth, a study has claimed. Research into the UK's weather system found that lightning strikes in the UK increased by up to 50 per cent when our planet's magnetic field was bent by the sun. And the findings could be used to make reliable forecasts of electrical storms in the future. A University of Reading study claims the sun is increasing Earth's lightning (stock image shown). They found that strikes increased when our magnetic field was bent by solar activity. This allows more particles to enter the atmosphere and cause lightning (stock illustration shown) As it rotates, the sun temporarily 'bends' the Earth's magnetic field allowing a shower of energetic particles to enter the upper atmosphere. Normally, the Earth's magnetic field acts as a force-field stopping it from being bombarded by particles from space, known as galactic cosmic rays. These have previously been found to prompt a chain-reaction of events in thunderclouds that trigger lightning bolts. But, research by the University of Reading found over a five-year period the UK experienced around 50 per cent more lightning strikes when the Earth's magnetic field was skewed by the sun's own magnetic field. Previous research from the University of Reading suggested that high-energy particles from the sun, known as the solar wind, creates a ‘pathway’ need for lightning ot travel. They say that the solar wind – in which the particles are propelled from the sun’s atmosphere at around a million miles per hour – charges the air, meaning a lesser current is needed for a lightning bolt to strike. Cosmic rays – another source of charged particles from exploding stars on the other side of the Universe – are thought to be another trigger for lightning. The results could prove useful for weather forecasters, since solar winds synchronise with the rotation of the sun, sweeping into Earth’s atmosphere at regular intervals. Dr Matt Owens said: 'We've discovered that the sun's powerful magnetic field is having a big influence on UK lightning rates. 'The sun's magnetic field is like a bar magnet, so as the sun rotates its magnetic field alternately points toward and away from the Earth, pulling the Earth's own magnetic field one way and then another.' The findings could pave the way for an accurate forecasting system to warn of possible electrical storms many weeks in advance. To do so, weather forecasters would need to combine conventional forecasts with accurate predictions of the sun's spiral-shaped magnetic field known as the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF). This field is spewed out as the sun rotates and is dragged through the solar system by the solar wind. The study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, used satellite and Met Office data to show that between 2001 and 2006, the UK experienced a 50 per cent increase in thunderstorms when the HMF pointed towards the sun and away from Earth. This change of direction can skew or 'bend' the Earth's own magnetic field, which could expose some regions of the upper atmosphere to more galactic cosmic rays - tiny particles from across the universe accelerated to close to the speed of light by exploding stars. Lightning strikes in the UK (stock image shown) were found to increase by 50% when Earth's magnetic field was skewed by the sun. And the findings could allow for accurate predictions of electrical storms . The study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, used satellite and Met Office data to show that between 2001 and 2006, the UK experienced a 50 per cent increase in thunderstorms when the sun's magnetic field pointed towards Earth (bottom), as opposed to away from Earth (top) Dr Owens added: 'From our results, we propose that galactic cosmic rays are channelled to different locations around the globe, which can trigger lightning in already charged-up thunderclouds. 'The changes to our magnetic field could also make thunderstorms more likely by acting like an extra battery in the atmospheric electric circuit, helping to further ""charge up"" clouds.' It adds to previous research that found an unexpected link between energetic particles from the sun and lightning rates on Earth. Professor Giles Harrison, head of the Department of Meteorology said: 'This latest finding is an important step forward in our knowledge of how the weather on Earth is influenced by what goes on in space. 'The University of Reading's continuing success in this area shows that new insights follow from atmospheric and space scientists working together. 'Scientists have been reliably predicting the solar magnetic field polarity since the 1970s by watching the surface of the sun. 'We just never knew it had any implications on the weather on Earth. We now plan to combine regular weather forecasts, which predict when and where thunderclouds will form, with solar magnetic field predictions. 'This means a reliable lightning forecast could now be a genuine possibility.'","University of Reading study says the sun is increasing Earth's lightning .

"Private schools have put themselves in danger warns Dr Martin Stephen . Thousands of middle-income families have been priced out of private schools by inflation-busting fee rises. Average fees have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation over the past ten years. The increases mean that private schooling is now beyond average earners in well-paid occupations, including pharmacists, architects, IT experts, engineers and scientists. A decade ago, these professionals would have been able to afford to pay fees out of earned income. Now, however, they would struggle without funding from other sources, according to the study. The average annual fee for a day pupil at a private school is £11,457, up from £6,820 in 2002, researchers found. Charges have risen 68 per cent in that period, 1.8 times faster than retail price inflation over the same period, which was up 37 per cent. Private school fees are considered affordable if they account for 25 per cent or less of the average annual full-time salary before tax. But £11,457 represents 35 per cent of this average, which stands at £33,011, according to the study by Lloyds TSB Private Banking. In 2002, fees would have taken 27 per cent. Suren Thiru, economist at the bank, said the rises make it ‘increasingly difficult for the average worker in many occupations to afford a private education for their offspring’. Those who can most easily afford the fees include accountants, senior police officers, airline pilots and  production managers as fees  represent 19 per cent of their annual earnings. Excluded: The rise in fees for private education means that average earners can no longer afford independent schooling for their children . The findings follow a warning this year from the former head of a top private school that the sector is  losing public confidence by becoming the preserve of the super-rich. Dr Martin Stephen, formerly of St Paul’s School, West London wrote: ‘Independent schools have put themselves in a very dangerous position; even more dangerous because they don’t realise the danger. ‘They are pricing themselves out of the reach of most normal people in the UK. The independent sector is becoming socially exclusive in a way not seen since Victorian times.’ Dr Stephen is now director of education at GEMS, an international schools group aiming to make private education ‘affordable’. He added: ‘The sector has become too dependent on overseas parents and is profiting from a state sector in some turmoil as a result of radical change. Independents need to realign themselves with their clients.’ The biggest rises in fees have been in London and the South West, both up 79 per cent from 2002-12. Next were East Anglia (74 per cent) and the East Midlands and South East, both at just under 70 per cent. The number of pupils enrolled at private schools has also fallen over the decade, according to the study.","Rise in fees is excluding children of average-earners .

"NBC has changed the lyrics of the song 'Ugg-a-Wugg' for its live show of Peter Pan after the words were deemed to be offensive to Native Americans. The original number, performed by Peter Pan and Tiger Lily, featured lines including 'the brave noble red skin' and made-up words including 'ugg-a-wugg' and 'gugg-a-bluck wa-hoo'. In its place, the team behind the show, which stars Allison Williams as Peter Pan and Christopher Walken as Hook, have devised a song called 'True Blood Brothers'. The lyrics, which are performed by a group in Native American costumes, were changed after it was deemed that they encourage stereotypes. Updated: Some songs in Peter Pan Live, which will star Allison Williams (left) as Peter Pan and Christopher Walken (right) as Captain Hook, have been changed, including one that's offensive to Native Americans . Entertainment Weekly, who spoke to the show's lyricists, reported that the team have a Native American consultant, Jerod Tate, who helped create something 'traditionally Native American'. Lyricist Amanda Green told EW that the process involved 'stripping it down and taking out things that were silly in the day it was written and offensive today'. She said that the new version does have some Native American phrases but that the nonsense words have been replaced with nursery rhymes. It will be performed by Williams, 26, as Peter Pan and Alanna Saunders as Tiger Lily. Saunders' paternal great-grandmother was part of the Cherokee Nation, NPR reported. Star: Alanna Saunders (left) will play Tiger Lily. She is a descendant of members of the Cherokee Nation . Ugg-a-Wugg has long been a controversial part of the show. In 1994, a small middle school in Southampton, New York made national headlines when it canceled its production of Peter Pan over the portrayal of Native Americans, the New York Times reported. Administrators said it was offensive to members of the Shinnecock tribe, whose reservation borders the town and whose children made up about nine percent of the district's student body at the time. 'We wouldn't do ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" in a school,' said Sherry Blakey-Smith, a Cree-Ojibwa Indian and then a teacher at the school. 'For Native Americans, Peter Pan's scene with the Indians is very much like that. We don't have pickaninny warriors.' NBC's production of Peter Pan will broadcast live on December 4. On Monday, the network released a teaser of the production that showed Williams singing and flying. Flying high: NBC released a teaser trailer showing Williams singing, flying and invading the pirate ship . Traditionally, a woman has played the titlular role in all musical versions, hence the casting of Williams - best known for playing Marnie in 'Girls' - in the part of Peter Pan. Amanda Green, who is the daughter of one of the show's original lyricists, Adolph Green, also worked on other new songs using melodies from other musicals. 'It fleshed out the show,' executive producer Neil Meron told EW. 'It deepened the characters, it kind of drove plot more - which good songs do in musicals.'","NBC will broadcast a live production of 'Peter Pan' starring Allison Williams as Peter Pan and Christopher Walken as Captain Hook on December 4 .

"Basketball bosses are 'beside themselves with excitement' at Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge attending an NBA game, MailOnline has learned. The Duke and Duchess will watch the Cleveland Cavaliers take on the Brooklyn Nets during their three-day visit to New York next month. The decision by the couple to attend the match means they should be able to watch LeBron James, currently America's biggest sports star, in action. NBA brass believe that the image of the royal couple at the match at Brooklyn's Barclays Center will be shown around the world, helping the sport gain new fans. Scroll down for videos . Sports fans: Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge are both known for their love of sports. The couple's most recent public appearance was at the Royal Variety Performance in London last week . The King: LeBron James on the court this weekend. He is the NBA's biggest star and playing in front of the future King and Queen of the United Kingdom will confirm his status . Celebrity friends: The Duchess of Cambridge greets Harry Styles of One Direction. She is likely to meet even more big names at the NBA match . 'It's an incredible publicity coup for the NBA,' an insider told MailOnline. 'The images of them all together will be seen all over the world - it's a marketing man's dream.' Insiders say that Kate and William had expressed an interest in attending a basketball game at legendary Madison Square Garden when they were planning their December 7-9 visit to the Big Apple. But they decided against the the New York Knicks vs Portland Trailblazers game on December 7 in favor of seeing LeBron play the following night. 'Kate and William are both big sports fans,' explains the friend. 'And although basketball isn't big in Britain, William has heard of LeBron James... although Kate apparently had no idea who he was!' Adam Silver, the NBA's commissioner -its equivalent of chief executive - will be present at the match. He was said to be beside himself with excitement at the coup. 'All the stars have aligned for them. No wonder Adam Silver is leaping up and down and celebrating. It's perfect timing that Kate and William are visiting New York at the exact same time as LeBron James is in town.' The pregnant Duchess might, however, find herself in more familiar company with a couple of other famous faces widely expected to attend the game. Beyonce and Jay Z are avid Nets fans, and both are expected to be there to watch the hoops action. Even without the royal draw, the Cleveland Cavaliers are a huge draw because of James. While most attention-seeking celebs sit courtside, the Duke and pregnant Duchess are expected to be viewing the game from the relative safety of a private box. Love of sports: The Duchess of Cambridge, patron of SportsAid meets a potential young wheelchair athlete Sheikh Sheikh in London last week . Star factor: Jay Z and Beyonce are frequently courtside at Nets games and expected to be present in the hope of meeting the royal couple . 'I don't think anybody likes the idea of Kate being in the front row and a huge, great basketball player crashing into her - especially in her condition,' says the insider. The purpose of the royal couple going to the match is to launch 'a new collaboration' including the Royal Foundation, which manages their charitable activities, the National Basketball Association and the United for Wildlife organization, of which Prince William is president. United for Wildlife already has a basketball link, with former NBA star Yao Ming as one of its ambassadors, alongside Andy Muray, the tennis player, and David Beckham, the footballer. The trip to the basketball match will be one of a series of high-profile engagements during the visit, which is the Duke and Duchess's first trip to New York. Both will be based in New York during the three-day trip, although Prince William will also spend part of the trip in Washington D.C where he will attend an anti-poaching conference. The Duchess of Cambridge, meanwhile, will spend the entire visit in New York and is to visit a child development center and host a lunch at the British Consulate while her husband is away. Prince George won't be joining his parents on the trip and will remain in London with nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo. The visit is the couple's first to the US since 2011, when they travelled to Los Angeles, a few months after their wedding. This time, their visit will be confined to the East Coast - completely new territory for both as neither have previously visited it before, in any capacity. William and Kate will arrive on the evening of the 7th December and will spend their first night in the US at a private dinner on behalf of the American Friends of the Royal Foundation. The Foundation was set up by Princes Harry and William in 2009 and officially launched in 2011 as the main vehicle for their philanthropic activities, including the Invictus Games. In addition to promoting the welfare of current and former members of the Armed Forces, the Foundation also works with young people and is committed to supporting conservation efforts.

It is the latter that forms the basis for much of the schedule, with the Duke of Cambridge spending his first full day in the US at an anti-corruption conference at the World Bank in Washington D.C. Once there, the Duke is expected to call for a zero tolerance approach to the trade in endangered animal parts on behalf of United For Wildlife, a conservation organisation of which he is president. He will also attend a reception in New York for the Tusk Trust on the same day, before rejoining the Duchess of Cambridge to watch the basketball game. The following day, both the Duke and Duchess will visit an inner city youth organisation, focused on social support and learning for poorer children - another key focus for the Royal Foundation. Also on the agenda is an event celebrating the British creative talent boasted by New York's media and creative industries. Prince William, who like Prince Charles has long been fascinated with technology, will attend an event hosted by a New York-headquartered technology company, which will bring together entrepreneurs from both the UK and the US. The final engagement of the visit will be the University of St. Andrews 600th Anniversary Dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. St Andrews was the Scottish university where the Duke and Duchess first met in 2002 after enrolling on the same Master of Arts degree course. Since leaving the University, the Duchess in particular has become a regular attendee of alumni events, the majority in London. The New York event is along similar lines and will support scholarships and bursaries for students from underprivileged backgrounds, as well as new student sports facilities.","Royal couple will watch the Cleveland Cavaliers take on the New York Nets next month during three-day visit to New York .

"Cycling could help ease the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, scientists believe. The exercise improved connections between brain regions linked to the disease and boosted patients’ co-ordination and balance, research has shown. Exercising on a bike is ‘an effective, low-cost therapy for the disease’, one researcher said. Some 120,000 Britons have Parkinson’s. Symptoms include tremors, speech problems and a gradual slowing down of the body. As the disease progresses, speech and balance can be affected and some sufferers become wheelchair-bound. Hope: New research says pedal power could ease symptoms of Parkinson's disease (file picture) High profile: Actor Michael J Fox, left, and Muhammad Ali, right, have raised awareness about the disease . High-profile patients include Michael J Fox, who was just 30 when he was diagnosed with the condition, and Muhammad Ali. US neuroscientist Jay Alberts began the research after noticing improvements in his companion, a Parkinson’s patient, after a long-distance tandem ride across Iowa. Dr Alberts, of the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, Ohio, said: ‘The finding was serendipitous. I was pedalling faster, which forced her to pedal faster. 'She had improvements in her upper extremity function, so we started to look at the possible mechanism behind this improved function.’ In the study, he carried out a series of scans on the brains of 26 Parkinson’s patients who used exercise bikes three times a week for two months. Some pedalled at their own pace, while others undertook ‘forced-rate’ cycling, in which they were made to pedal faster by motors fitted to their bikes. The scans revealed pedalling, particularly vigorous pedalling, boosted connections between brain regions linked to movement, the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago heard. Research: The study was carried out at Cleveland Clinic Lerner College Research Institute . Researcher Chintan Shah, also from the Cleveland Clinic, said: ‘The results show that forced-rate bicycle exercise is an effective, low-cost therapy for Parkinson’s disease.’ The scientists are now studying how patients fare with exercise bikes in their homes. They also want to see whether other forms of exercise such as swimming and rowing have similar benefits. The charity Parkinson’s UK welcomed the research, saying the balance and co-ordination can be badly damaged as the disease progresses. However, it also cautioned that not all patients will be capable of exercising intensely. Dr Kieran Breen, the charity’s director of research, said: ‘While it is too soon to encourage people with Parkinson’s to get on their bikes three times a week on the basis of this study, we do know that exercise can be beneficial. ‘A regular exercise routine can help those with the condition to not only improve their general fitness but can also help to improve movement and balance as well as other symptoms of the condition such as anxiety and depression.’","Scientists say exercising on a bike is an 'effective, low-cost therapy' for the disease .

"Even as they grapple with an immigration crisis at the border, White House officials are making plans to act before November's mid-term elections to grant work permits to potentially millions of immigrants who are in this country illegally, allowing them to stay in the United States without threat of deportation, according to advocates and lawmakers in touch with the administration. Such a large-scale move on immigration could scramble election-year politics and lead some conservative Republicans to push for impeachment proceedings against President Barack Obama, a prospect White House officials have openly discussed. Yet there's little sign that the urgent humanitarian situation in South Texas, where unaccompanied minors have been showing up by the tens of thousands from Central America, has impeded Obama from making plans to address some portion of the 11.5 million immigrants now in this country illegally. Scroll down for video . If Congress doesn't act soon, President Barack Obama plans to issue another executive order addressing illegal immigration . Obama announced late last month that congressional efforts to remake the nation's dysfunctional immigration system were dead and he would proceed on his own authority to fix the system where he could. Since then he's asked Congress for $3.7 billion to deal with the crisis of unaccompanied youths, a request that's gone unmet even as the House and the Senate scramble to see if they can vote on some solution to the crisis this week before adjourning for their annual August recess. Meanwhile, White House officials led by Domestic Policy Council Director Cecilia Munoz and White House Counsel Neil Eggleston, along with Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, have been working to chart a plan on executive actions Obama could take, hosting frequent meetings with interest groups and listening to recommendations from immigration advocates, law enforcement officials, religious leaders, Hispanic lawmakers and others. Advocates and lawmakers who were in separate meetings Friday said that administration officials are weighing a range of options including reforms to the deportation system and ways to grant relief from deportation to targeted populations in the country, likely by expanding Obama's two-year-old directive that granted work permits to certain immigrants brought here illegally as youths. That program, called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, has been extended to more than 500,000 immigrants so far. Advocates would like to see deferred action made available to anyone who would have been eligible for eventual citizenship under a comprehensive immigration bill the Senate passed last year, which would be around 9 million people. But Obama told them in a meeting a month ago to 'right-size' expectations, even as he pledged to be aggressive in steps he does take. That's led advocates to focus on other populations Obama might address, including parents or legal guardians of U.S. citizen children. They account for approximately 3.8 million of illegal immigrants living in the U.S, as of 2009, according to an analysis by Pew Research's Hispanic Trends Project. Another population of interest is parents or legal guardians of DACA  recipients - perhaps 500,000 to 1 million people, according to the Fair Immigration Reform Movement. 'Our parents deserve to live without the fear of deportation,' Maria Praeli, a 21-year-old from New Haven who came to the United States from Peru 16 years ago, said at a protest outside the White House on Monday. 'It is time for the president to go big and to go bold.' Activist Ingrid Vaca of Arlington, Virginia, who is originally from Bolivia, participates in an United We Dream rally in front of the White House today. Immigration reform activists urged President Obama not to deport the parents of DREAMers, children who brought illegally to the U.S. According to activists and lawmakers, President Obama is considering giving amnesty to the parents of children who qualify for his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival and illegal immigrants whose children were born in the U.S. The potentially hundreds of thousands of people who might be eligible for green cards today if current law didn't require them to leave the country for 10 years before applying for one could be is also an area of focus. At the same time, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce says it is actively working to determine whether there are steps Obama could take by executive action that could help the business community. For Obama, the political repercussions of broad executive action on immigration could be unpredictable, and extreme. Republicans are warning he could provoke a constitutional crisis. 'It would be an affront to the people of this country which they will never forgive, it would be a permanent stain on your presidency,' Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said on the Senate floor Monday, while urging language to block such executive action be made part of any legislation to address the border crisis. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., announced plans to use an oversight hearing on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency Tuesday to raise questions about Obama's plans, which he warned could 'worsen the border crisis and encourage many more to come.' On the other side, some Democrats have debated the best timing for Obama to take executive action, raising questions as to whether acting before the midterms could hurt vulnerable Senate Democrats in close races while boosting turnout among the GOP base. But liberal advocates noted that Obama's move on deferred action two years ago gave him a boost heading into his re-election and could help this year with Latino voters discouraged over the failure of immigration reform legislation and record-high deportations on Obama's watch. Republicans would be in a position of deciding whether to come out in favor of deporting sympathetic groups, such as parents, and many liberals say impeachment talk would only shore up Democratic base voters. 'Most Democrats will be thrilled' if Obama acts boldly on immigration, said Frank Sharry, executive director of America's Voice, a leading advocacy group. 'And Republicans will keep lurching to the right and cementing their reputation as the anti-immigrant party.'","President Obama said late last month that he would act on immigration reform if Congress did not .

"The benefits of breastfeeding have been exaggerated, a new study has suggested. A comparison of siblings fed differently during infancy suggests breast milk is no better than bottled milk at improving long-term health. Dr Cynthia Colen, from Ohio State University, said her findings are not meant to challenge established ideas, but could prevent women who cannot breastfeed from feeling stigmatised. Scroll down for video . The benefits of breastfeeding have been exaggerated, a U.S. expert has claimed . Those promoting the 'breast is best' message, including the Department of Health, say a mother's milk wards off a host of ills. NHS leaflets given to pregnant women and new mothers claim breastfeeding protects against obesity, allergies, asthma and diabetes. But Dr Colen’s research suggests breastfed children perform no better than their siblings who are bottle-fed. It showed they are no more likely to be obese and that they do not perform better academically. Dr Colen also claims that children who are breastfed are more likely to develop asthma than those who are bottle-fed. She said: ‘Many previous studies suffer from selection bias. They either do not or cannot statistically control for factors such as race, age, family income, mother's employment - things we know that can affect both breast-feeding and health outcomes. Dr Cynthia Colen says siblings who are bottle-fed perform just as well in the long-term as those who are breastfed . ‘Mums with more resources - with higher levels of education and higher levels of income - and more flexibility in their daily schedules are more likely to breastfeed their children and do so for longer periods of time.’ The NHS recommends that mothers breastfeed for about six months. Dr Colen said: ‘I'm not saying breastfeeding is not beneficial, especially for boosting nutrition and immunity in newborns. ‘But if we really want to improve maternal and child health, let's also focus on things that can really do that in the long term - like subsidised day care, better maternity leave policies and more employment opportunities for low-income mothers that pay a living wage, for example.’ She used data from the 1979 cohort of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, a nationally representative sample of young men and women. She analysed a total of 8,237 children made up of 7,319 siblings and 1,773 ‘discordant’ sibling pairs, where one was breastfed with the other given a bottle. The study measured BMI (body mass index), obesity, asthma, hyperactivity, parental attachment and behaviour as well as scores predicting academic achievement in vocabulary, reading, maths, intelligence and scholastic competence. Across all of the families, breastfeeding resulted in better outcomes in BMI, hyperactivity, maths, reading recognition, vocabulary word identification, digit recollection, scholastic competence and obesity. But when restricted to siblings differently fed within the same families, scores reflecting breastfeeding's positive effects on 10 of the indicators were closer to zero and not statistically significant - meaning any differences could have occurred by chance. The researchers believe this means the siblings who were all breastfed probably performed better because of other factors, such as socioeconomic status. The most surprising finding was that children who were breastfed were at greater risk of asthma. However, this could be because the data relied on whether people said they had asthma, rather than whether they had been formally diagnosed with the condition. Dr Colen also says children who are breastfed are more likely to develop asthma than those who are bottle-fed . Dr Colen said: ‘Instead of comparing across families we are comparing within families completely taking into account all of those characteristics - both measured and unmeasured - that differ by family such as parental education, household income and race/ethnicity. ‘If breastfeeding doesn't have the impact we think it will have on long-term childhood outcomes then even though it's very important in the short-term we really need to focus on other things. ‘We need to look at school quality, adequate housing and the type of employment parents have when their kids are growing up. ‘We need to take a much more careful look at what happens past that first year of life and understand breastfeeding might be very difficult, even untenable, for certain groups of women. ‘Rather than placing the blame at their feet let's be more realistic about what breastfeeding does and doesn't do.'","Dr Cynthia Colen says the benefits of breastfeeding are exaggerated .

"An Arkansas teacher is under fire for bringing her infant baby to class and even breastfeeding it while students study. The unnamed teacher in Poyen, population 290, has been bringing the baby to her rural high school on and off for weeks, students say.

But others disagree. One student who did give his name says the baby may as well not even be there. 'The baby just lays back there and plays with its toys, every now and then it may cry, but she goes back there and takes care of it,' said Tyler Rhodes. Another student, Chase Rhodes, agreed and told KARK: 'I mean it's a cute baby and I don't think it's a distraction at all.' The school principal told KARK that teachers are permitted to bring their children to class only in emergency situations. He declined further comment, calling the situation a 'personnel issue.'","The unnamed Poyen, Arkansas teacher has been bringing her baby to class and feeding it as students study .

"Women who take paracetamol during pregnancy are more likely to have a child with ADHD, new research suggests . Using paracetamol during pregnancy may raise the risk of children developing ADHD, warn researchers. Around half of women take over-the-counter painkillers during pregnancy, usually for headaches. Researchers found that taking paracetamol (know as acetaminophen in the U.S. and the main ingredient in Tylenol) increased the risk of hyperactivity disorders by up to a third. The risk was higher in mothers taking the painkillers for long periods while pregnant. The international team of researchers behind a new study warn that widespread use mean the results are important but need to be confirmed by further investigations. Paracetamol, known as acetaminophen in some countries, may act as a hormone disruptor in the womb, interfering with normal brain development. NHS advice to pregnant women needing short-term pain relief is to take paracetamol at the lowest dose for the shortest period of time. NHS Choices states: ‘There is no clear evidence that it has any harmful effects on the unborn baby.’ But the new study suggests taking the over-the-counter pills in pregnancy could be linked to ADHD, which stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ADHD is the term given to a collection of behavioural problems linked to poor attention span including impulsiveness, restlessness and hyperactivity. An estimated 400,000 British children have ADHD, with many prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school. The new study looked at data on more than 64,000 children and mothers in Denmark between 1996 and 2002, while parents reported behavioural problems on a questionnaire. More than half the mothers reported using paracetamol while pregnant. Its use was linked with a 37 per cent higher risk of hyperkinetic disorders - a severe form of ADHD. Children of women using the painkiller were 29 per cent more at risk of eventually taking drugs to control ADHD, and 13 per cent more likely to have ADHD-like behaviours at the age of seven. There were higher risks for the children of women who used the drug for six months or more while pregnant and higher amounts. Taking paracetamol during pregnancy could increase the risk of ADHD by up to a third . The risk of hyperkinetic disorders almost doubled and the risk for receiving ADHD drugs rose 50 per cent, says a report in JAMA Pediatrics. Dr Zeyan Liew of the University of California, Los Angeles, who led the team, said: ‘Some recent studies have suggested that acetaminophen has effects on sex and other hormones, which in turn can affect neurodevelopment and cause behavioural dysfunction. ‘Because the exposure and outcomes are frequent, these results are of public health relevance but further investigations are needed.’ About half of women take over-the-counter painkillers while they are pregnant . Previous research has suggested painkillers including paracetamol in pregnancy may harm development of the sex organs in unborn boys. A study found prolonged use of painkillers - two weeks or more - may contribute to an increased risk in boys born with undescended testicles. Dr Kate Langley, Developmental and Health Psychology, Cardiff University, and co-author of an editorial on the latest research, said: ‘This is an interesting but preliminary study which requires further investigation to see if there really is a causal link between taking paracetamol during pregnancy and ADHD in childhood. ‘These findings should therefore be taken with caution and should not change practice. ‘There are many reasons why women take paracetamol during pregnancy and it is possible that it is one of those factors, rather than the taking of paracetamol itself, which leads to a higher risk of childhood ADHD. ‘It may be important to take medications such as paracetamol during pregnancy and pregnant women should continue to follow advice from their own healthcare professionals.’ Professor Jim Stevenson, Emeritus Professor of Developmental Psychopathology at the University of Southampton said: ‘The study on a large sample of Danish mothers was carefully conducted and analysed. However, as the authors recognise, and the accompanying editorial makes plain, an association in such an observational study cannot establish a causal link. ‘The study should be used as basis for further experimental research not least because exposure to paracetamol during pregnancy is so common.’","Paracetamol could increase the risk of hyperactivity disorders by a third .

Her lawyers asked the government to prevent the extradition, but Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan ruled this week she had to be surrendered, the ABC reports.

Matt Busbice said on the program that his older brother 'took something out the oven, looked like a Rice Krispie treat, but it was a protein deer feed block and that's how we got started making hunting products. And now we pretty much make everything for hunting and fishing.' Speaking about the reality show, Ryan Bustice said 'They came, they heard about how we test our products and all our R and D, and they were fascinated with that. And we thought it would be a great way to promote our brands and show everybody how we do this.' Matt Busbice also addressed his family's friendship and supposed rivalry with the Robertson clan of 'Duck Dynasty' fame in an interview with Fox411. 'We feel like it's not us verse them,' he told the news outlet. 'WE feel like we're a companionship. Willie loves to give me advice.

"New Education Secretary Nicky Morgan's department says that independent schools must 'actively promote' British values . Independent schools and academies may be forced to drop Christmas celebrations under rules designed to tackle extremists, critics warned yesterday. They say 6,000 private schools will be compelled to adopt political correctness. Following the Trojan Horse scandal, in which Birmingham schools came under the sway of Islamic extremists, the Education Department proposed that independent schools must ‘actively promote’ British values – said to include respect for legally ‘protected characteristics’. Critics warn the rules will bring a series of unintended consequences, including preventing teachers from using words like husband or wife when discussing marriage; making teachers inflate the reputation of politicians in their lessons, and dictating the curriculum and exams schools must use. They also accuse the Department for Education of setting too tight a timetable when it set up a consultation among schools over the rules. Responses to the key proposals had to be returned last week – a month before the end of the school holidays and at a time when heads are likely to be on the beach rather than answering Whitehall questionnaires. The Independent School Standards consultation was begun in late June at the height of the Trojan Horse affair, in which a group of schools in Birmingham were found to have fallen under the sway of Islamic extremists. An inquiry found the schools segregated boys and girls, disparaged British soldiers, promoted hatred of homosexuals, and taught scepticism about responsibility for the murder of soldier Lee Rigby and the Boston bombings. The resulting Education Department proposals say that independent schools must ‘actively promote’ British values, which are said to include respect for legally ‘protected characteristics’ such as homosexuality, religion, gender change, disability, race and marital status. They also require improved teaching standards from schools with the lowest levels of attainment. The rules will apply to academies and free schools as well as the long-established independent sector. A consultation paper reveals this would allow Education Secretary Nicky Morgan to take ‘regulatory action’ in cases such as where girls are ‘disadvantaged’ on grounds of gender, ‘failure to address homophobia’, or where prejudice against other faiths is ‘encouraged or not adequately challenged’. The Christian Institute (CI) warned this may rule out Christmas events if other religions’ festivals are not celebrated to the same degree. It also fears teachers may have to avoid the words ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ when discussing marriage, so as not to discriminate against same-sex couples. The CI’s Colin Hart said: ‘They mistakenly advance the principle that political correctness equal British values. Accordingly they could be used to punish any school in the independent sector which has a religious ethos, a set of traditional beliefs, or which does not promote every minority group’s world view.’ The Institute said Christmas celebrations in schools and use of words like ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ in discussions of marriage could be barred under the proposals. Mr Hart added: ‘Under the plans, private schools, academies and free schools would have much less control over their ethos than ordinary state schools. There was clearly a managerial problem in the schools in Birmingham, but is forcing more than 6,000 schools and nearly three million pupils to the submit themselves to every whim of the PC brigade really the best way to tackle it? It makes no sense.’ Adderley Primary School, Birmingham was among those in Trojan Horse operation by Islamic fundamentalists . A reply to the Education Department from the Independent Schools Council, which represents 1,200 schools, said that forcing schools to accept common standards means they will be ‘subject to political interference’ and that the proposals ‘risk dictating to independent schools which curriculum to follow.’ The Council’s objections also say that ‘there is a major risk of unintended consequences’, that standards in high-achieving schools will be forced down, and ‘time will be wasted considering how schools actively promote these values.’ It added: ‘Explicitly requiring schools to encourage respect for the basis on which the law is made in England comes close to requiring schools actively promote respect for politicians as lawmakers.’ The Association of School and College Leaders, which represents over 18,000 heads and senior staff, said the proposals had been made in undue haste and to such a short timetable that many heads would find out what was happening only after consultation deadlines had passed. A submission from the Association said: ‘This can only undermine respect for democracy and the rule of law as practised in Britain.’ Mrs Morgan now faces a High Court judicial review brought by the Christian Institute over the attempt to impose the rules on independent schools without giving proper time to listen to their views.","Critics say 6,000 private schools will have to adopt political correctness .

"A new woman has come forward with claims that Bill Cosby drugged and raped her - supermodel Janice Dickinson. In a haunting new interview, Dickinson reveals that Cosby invited her to dinner to discuss a role on The Cosby Show, offering her a glass of wine and a pill she thought was for her cramps. That is one of the last things she remembers of the evening. Scroll down for video . Shocking claim: Supermodel Janice Dickinson (above) has come forward to say she was drugged and rapped by Bill Cosby in 1982 . Bad guy: Dickinson says after Cosby allegedly gave her the pill, the next thing she remembers is 'waking up with her pajamas off and semen between her legs' 'The next morning I woke up, and I wasn't wearing my pajamas, and I remember before I passed out that I had been sexually assaulted by this man,' she told Entertainment Tonight. 'I remember waking up with my pajamas off and there was semen in between my legs.' Dickinson says her last memory of the night was of Cosby taking off his robe and climbing on top of her, and that the next morning she remembers 'a lot of pain.' The supermodel claims the incident occurred in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. However, Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, branded the allegation a 'complete lie.' She also claims that she had included details of the assault in her 2002 autobiography, No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel, but that Cosby and his lawyer successfully pressured her and the publisher to remove the details. But Singer also flatly rejected this claim, saying: 'You can confirm with Harper Collins that she never claimed that Mr Cosby raped her, that no attorney representing Bill Cosby tried to kill the story... and no one tried to prevent anything she wanted to say about Bill Cosby in her book.' In a statement, reported by NBC News, he added: 'There is documentary proof that Janice Dickinson is fabricating and lying about Bill Cosby.' Cosby answered the door in nothing but a white towel. He was fresh from the shower, too; his black skin was glistening. He hugged me, a little too enthusiastically; told me how much he'd missed me, and how nice it was to see me. I believed him. Liquor does that to a girl. 'God, you're beautiful.' He kissed me, full on the lips, then went off to dress and we went downstairs, to dinner, where Cosby spent the next two hours talking about himself. It was An Evening with Bill Cosby. A Tribute to Bill Cosby. And suddenly I remembered something Andy Warhol once told me. It was his definition of an actor. He said, 'An actor is a person whose eyes glaze over when the conversation is no longer about them.' And I thought, Well, then, Bill Cosby is an actor's actor. After dinner he asked me back to his room, and I went. But I stopped myself at the door. 'I'm exhausted,' I said, begging off. His eyebrows went a little funny. 'Exhausted?' he asked, and it was clear he was trying hard to keep his temper in check. 'After all I've done for you, that's what I get? I'm exhausted.' 'Well, gee, Bill,' I stammered. 'If I had known it was going to be like this—' He waved both hands in front of my face, silencing me. Then he gave me the dirtiest, meanest look in the world, stepped into his suite, and slammed the door in my face. Janice detailed the events again of that evening in Lake Tahoe back in 1982 . Janice says she is coming forward now because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly, and that it is the 'right thing to do' Dickinson did, however, detail some of her evening in Lake Tahoe with Cosby in the book, though telling a very different story. She said she was drinking with Cosby at dinner and after being invited back to his room told him she was tired, at which point he slammed his door in her face. The aforementioned legal claims may however be why she decided not to print her current side of the story. She says she is coming forward now though because she believes the other victims who have spoken publicly, and that it is the 'right thing to do.' As for what she would say to Cosby if she saw him, Dickinson does not mince words. 'How dare you,' she says. 'Go f*ck yourself. How dare you take advantage of me. And I hope you rot.' Bombshell: At the time of the alleged rape, Dickinson (pictured in the 1980s) was one of the biggest models in the world . This comes as a third women, Joan Tarshis, came forward and alleged that she was drugged and raped twice by Cosby in Los Angeles back in 1969. She called him a 'very, very sick man who needs help.' Another of Cosby's accusers, Barbara Bowman, told MailOnline she was just 17 when he 'brainwashed me into viewing him as a father figure, and then assaulted me multiple times.' Cosby, who refuses to comment on the allegations, did settle a civil suit in 2006 with another woman over an alleged incident two years prior. His lawyer John P. Schmitt has said the fact that the allegations are being repeated 'does not make them true.'","Supermodel Janice Dickinson is claiming in a new interview that she was drugged and raped by Bill Cosby .
