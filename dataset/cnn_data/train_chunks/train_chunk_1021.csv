"Ed Miliband was facing further attacks on his leadership today as damning polls showed he was now less popular than Nick Clegg. Former Labour deputy Prime Minister John Prescott accused 'pointy heads' like Mr Miliband of running a series of disastrous election campaigns which have allowed the party's support to slump. The party's support has hit 32 per cent – the lowest in four years – while Mr Miliband has seen his own approval ratings slump hit rock bottom. Ed Miliband is now more unpopular than Nick Clegg, according to a poll released today by YouGov . Mr Miliband is less unpopular in the north of England than elsewhere - but even in Labour's heartland just under seven in 10 voters say he is doing a bad job . Just 18 per cent of voters think Mr Miliband is doing a good job, against 73 per cent who think he is doing badly – an overall rating of minus 55, which is now worse than Mr Clegg, on minus 54. David Cameron, meanwhile, has an overall rating of minus 14. Some 40 per cent of voters think he is doing a good job, against 54 who think he is doing poorly, according to a YouGov poll for the Sunday Times. Overall, Labour still retains a one-point lead over the Tories, who sit on just 31 per cent. Labour's dire polls, less than six months before the general election, have piled further pressure on Mr Miliband. Lord Prescott said Labour's campaign strategy needed a complete overhaul before the election. Writing in the Sunday Mirror he said: 'To be frank, our campaigns have not been very successful. 'From the 2010 general election to local and European elections and by-elections, it seems strategy is driven by the pointy-heads not the lionhearts. 'The Scottish referendum campaign was only saved by dedicated old-school campaigners like Gordon Brown and Jim Murphy who went out and spoke with passion about Labour's values, achievements and positive case for the future. In these last six months we need passionate campaigners to sell our popular policies.' Former Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott - seen listening to Ed Miliband's party conference speech this year - said the party needed less 'pointy heads' in charge - and more 'lionhearts' Jim Murphy, the front-runner to be the next Labour leader in Scotland, this morning warned the part faced electoral annihilation if it did not put an end to the infighting. He said: 'Parties that turn in on themselves - think of the footballing analogy - if a football team tackles its own players in public or takes on its own players in public it very quickly starts to play in an empty football stadium without any supporters. 'And there's a lesson in that football analogy for the Labour party and all the political parties as we watch the Tory party tear itself apart. But I'm confident Ed Miliband's Labour party won't do that sort of thing.' Shadow Secretary of State for International Development Jim Murphy appeared on BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show this morning . Mr Murphy formally launched his campaign to become Scottish Labour Leader and First Minister of Scotland yesterday . Mr Murphy also announced he was going to stand down as shadow international development secretary to concentrate on winning the leadership in Scotland. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper – the favourite to succeed Mr Miliband if Labour loses the next election – today praised Mr Miliband for 'holding the party together'. Scotland's outgoing First Minister Alex Salmond, meanwhile, said Labour would continue to struggle north of the border – because it sided with the Tories against independence. He said Labour would not be 'forgotten or forgiven for a generation' for joining forces with the Tories to campaign against independence. Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond said it was possible that the SNP could go into Coalition with Labour in Westminster . But Mr Salmond refused to rule out a coalition between the SNP and Labour, if they were to hold the balance of power at the next general election. But did say there was 'no chance' of the party forming a deal with the Tories. He said: 'I think it's unlikely but who knows, people change sometimes, parties change sometimes, party leaders change sometimes and lead them in a different direction.'","Former deputy PM slams Labour's disastrous election campaigns .

"Mike Nuanes thought he'd seen the last of his dog Jordan when the shih tzu puppy disappeared from his house seven years ago. But last week the Denver man got the shock of his life when he got a call from almost 1,400 miles away at Atlanta's Fulton County Animal Shelter notifying him that they had his long missing dog. 'When she asked, 'Is his name Jordan?' That's when my jaw hit the ground,' he said. Mike Nuanes was reunited with dog Jordan in Atlanta seven years after the shih tzu disappeared from his house in Denver . Nuanes believes someone stole the puppy from his backyard while he and his late wife were having breakfast with family at a neighboring house . 'After I picked my jaw up off the ground, I asked, 'Is he a little chocolate fellow?'' Nuanes told KGW he believes someone stole the puppy from his backyard while he and his late wife were having breakfast with family at a neighboring house. 'Being the optimist that I am, when they called me I thought, 'Well, I know he didn't walk to Atlanta, so somebody must have been taking care of him all these years,'' he said. Jordan was rescued in October and believed to be a stray. He had missing patches of fur, was crawling with fleas, and at just over 5 pounds was dangerously underweight for a dog of his type, which normally weighs 10 to 12 pounds. 'He was in pretty bad shape,' said Jill Davis, who works at Fulton County Animal Services. Luckily they were able to match him to Nuanes via a microchip. When Jordan was found he had missing patches of fur, was crawling with fleas, and at just over 5 pounds was dangerously underweight for a dog of his type, which normally weighs 10 to 12 pounds . 'He was shocked. It didn't take him a second to say, 'I'm going to get him a ticket and fly him out here (to Denver).'' Davis said. He arrived with a new collar, leash, food, and bowls for his newly returned friend. On the flight back on Frontier Airlines, Nuanes said people even have up their front row seats so Jordan had room to travel in his lap. And he fits right in with Nuanes' four other dogs. 'They accepted him right in and they're getting closer to him,' Nuanes said. 'Life is good at the Nuanes household for the dogs.'","Nuanes believes someone stole the puppy from his backyard while he and his late wife were having breakfast with family at a neighboring house .

"Being the butt of the jokes at a stand-up comedy night is a terrifying prospect for pretty much anyone, even a size eight blonde model. But when you're trying to cover up a size 22 figure (26 US), the effect is mortifying. For Amy Gordon, 29, from Wolverhampton, the experience was to make completely overhaul her diet. Scroll down for video . Amy Gordon, 29, from Wolverhampton has gone from from 18st 5lbs to 9st 7lbs in a year and a half. The dental nurse decided to start dieting after she was the butt of a comedian's jokes during a stand-up show . She said: 'I was at a comedy show with my mates when the comedian started telling jokes about fat girls and decided to single me out. '""Here’s one!"" he laughed, pointing at me, sitting in the second row. 'Suddenly all eyes were on me and the laughter grew louder - my night out had turned into a nightmare. '""Take no notice. He’s an idiot,"" my friend whispered, but I was already starting to cry and the brave face I’d worn for a lifetime finally slipped.' Amy had always been big - even at school she was a size 20 (16 US), which made her the daily target of bullies. As a teenager, Amy had dreaded being invited to theme park outings in case she was too big to go on some of the rides, even though she was just 5ft 6ins tall. At Amy's heaviest, she weighed 18st 5lbs (259lbs) But by the time Amy reached adulthood, she had found a nice group of friends and a job as a dental nurse that finally made her feel comfortable and confident. Until that night in the comedy club. She said: 'That night shattered me. From then on, all I wanted was to lose weight. Fast. 'So I embarked on a starvation diet – the only way I knew to lose weight – and within a few months I’d gone from 17st (238lbs) to 13st (182lbs), then gained it all back again. 'The ‘diet/binge’ cycle lasted nearly 10 years and left me at 18st (252lbs) - bigger than I’d started and utterly miserable. Since losing the weight, Amy has dyed her hair blonde and gained in confidence . 'When my boyfriend Andy, proposed in 2010, I lost 4st (56lbs) for the wedding and felt pretty good in my size-16 wedding dress. 'Two weeks later, after a honeymoon to Kefalonia, I was already 1st heavier and within two months that dress no longer fitted.' Amy when she reached her goal weight, with her Weight Watchers leader Dawn Charman . Amy's disgust at her weight started to impact on her social life, because she was too embarrassed to be seen in public. She said: 'I no longer wanted to go out and I avoided shopping for anything except food. I lived on junk food, ready meals and takeaways. 'My skin was spotty and I had absolutely no energy, the result of a pretty appalling diet. 'Breakfast was biscuits and coffee when I arrived at the dental surgery where I work. 'Mid-morning, I’d buy a pasty to keep me going, then for lunch I’d have a cheese baguette, crisps, chocolate and a sugary fizzy drink. 'After work, I got in the habit of eating four or five slices of toast, then when Andy came home I’d take something out of the freezer for our tea, like a pizza, potato wedges or fried chicken. 'I’d convinced myself that working full-time meant I had no time to cook.' Amy continued: 'The only time I ate vegetables was when we went to my mum’s for Sunday lunch. 'At Christmas 2012, Andy bought me some beautiful, expensive jeans and tops in a size 22 and none of them fitted. 'I had no idea what I weighed – years of dieting had given me such a fear of the scales that I no longer owned any – but I was absolutely gutted.' A week later, Amy signed up to her local Weight Watchers group in Wolverhampton. She said: 'I stepped on the scales and my Leader, Dawn Charman, asked if I wanted to know the number. Amy hated to go out socialising when she was at her largest, preferring to stay in and watch television . ‘""Yes, I want to face it,"" I replied, and when she told me I was 18st 5lb (259lbs), I was horrified, but not surprised.' Over the next few months Amy completely overhauled her diet. Breakfast was a poached egg on toast and for lunch she took salads or soups to work, with a piece of fruit for a snack. Then for dinner she would have a Weight Watchers ready meal with salad and cooked vegetables. In the first month she lost 1st 7lb (23.8lbs) and could fit into the clothes she was given for Christmas. Amy then started to learn to cook and signed up to a gym - by the end of February she had lost another 7lb. She said: 'Each week I continued losing weight and by the summer, I was down to 13st 6lb (190lbs). Amy appears in the Dec/Jan issue of Weight Watchers Magazine . 'By the winter, I was a size 14 - I hadn’t been that slim since I was about 12 years old and I started taking more interest in my appearance, like having my dark hair lightened was a big step. 'I went on to lose another 7lb and now I’m maintaining my weight between 9st 7lb and 10st (140 lbs). 'Breakfast is a big bowl of fruit with Weight Watchers yogurt, lunch is a chicken or tuna salad and a packet of crisps. 'I snack on fruit and in the evening I make a low ProPoints value meal for the two of us. 'On holiday this year in Tunisia, I wore my first ever bikini – in a size 10 – and, although I still felt a little unsure of myself, Andy told me I looked great. 'The other day, one of my patients came into the dental surgery and asked, ‘Where’s Amy?’ When I said, ‘That’s me,’ he shook his head. ‘No,the other Amy. The big girl with the dark hair.’ 'I had to smile, because I’m no longer dark, I’m no longer big and I’m no longer the girl who wears a permanent brave face… but I’m still me.'

"Honeymoon murder-accused Shrien Dewani suffered a 'panic attack' outside court today when photographers surrounded his car and banged his window with their lenses, according to his lawyer. Dewani nodded his head for emphasis when Francois van Zyl asked Judge Jeanette Traverso to remind the media of his client's fragile 'mental health'. South African authorities have a limited time in which to convict or acquit the 34-year-old for his alleged role in the murder of his wife, Anni, during their honeymoon four years ago. Scroll down for video . Fragile mental health: Shrien Dewani (pictured at the start of the trial) suffered a 'panic attack' when photographers banged their cameras on the window of his car, his lawyer told his murder trial today . Any relapse in Dewani's mental health could see his trial interrupted or abandoned. 'We want to see justice done and incidents like that mean that justice may not be done,' the judge scolded the reporters in court, requesting that the media 'treat the accused and the case with the necessary dignity'. Since the start of his high profile trial, Dewani has betrayed little sign of the post post traumatic stress disorder and severe depression that prevented his return to South Africa to face charges over the contract killing of his Swedish bride. His sensitivity to noise was said to be so profound that he was allowed to live in a camper van in the grounds of a mental hospital in Bristol as he waged a legal battle against extradition. Once he was extradited, however, Dewani's mental improved quickly and dramatically, and was deemed fit to stand trial just four months later. Anni Dewani's father, Vinod Hindocha, and her cousin Sneha Mashru leave the Western Cape High Court . A panel of mental health experts said while the wealthy businessman remains vulnerable to tears, distress, panic attacks and startling from 'sudden ambient noises', he is clear of depression. Amid obvious fears that his mental health could falter, the South African authorities have gone out of their way to minimise any stress for Dewani, who is being held in a private room at a psychiatric hospital where he is allowed special privileges. He is driven to and from court in the back of a hospital car each day. The number of reporters given access to the room at the Cape Town high court has been strictly limited and pictures were only allowed to be taken in the first minutes of Dewani appearing in the dock. Shrien Dewani's mother Snila (left) and father Prakash (right) leave the Western Cape High Court . Shrien Dewani's sister Preyal Dewani leaves the Western Cape High Court at the end of the hearing . Applications to televise Dewani's hearing in the style of the Oscar Pistorius murder trial, which was screened and debated around the clock on a pop-up channel, were turned down flat. During the five hours or so he sits in the dock every day, he appears quite relaxed and able to follow proceedings easily, occupying himself with files of legal papers and writing notes to his legal team. Occasionally, he seems bothered by the banging of a door at the back of the court or coughing from the packed gallery – on one occasion he was seen to mouth 'shut up' at an elderly member of the public observing from above. However, coming face to face with his wife's killers and the gay escort he had paid for sexual humiliation and physical abuse appeared not to leave him in any obvious emotional discomfort. Convicted taxi driver Zola Tongo – who is the state's main witness against Dewani – today spent a second day under cross-examination, and was forced to admit to discrepancies in his story. Shrien Dewani is accused of hiring hitmen to kill his new bride Anni on their honeytmoon in South Africa . Mr van Zyl highlighted a number of stark contradictions between Tongo's evidence to Dewani's trial this week, his statement to police four years ago - a week after Mrs Dewani's murder and subsequent plea and sentencing agreement. Tongo – who claims he was recruited by Dewani to stage a carjacking as the cover for his wife's murder - was given a reduced sentence for his part in the killing in exchange of giving evidence against Dewani. Asked by Judge Traverso whether he realised how important his plea and sentencing agreement was at the time he signed it, and which now varies with his recollections in the witness box, Tongo replied, 'My Lady, at that time my condition was weak. As time went on, I remembered.' Two hitmen recruited to kill Mrs Dewani by a middleman called Monde Mbombolombo, were both jailed for their roles. Mbombolombo was given immunity from prosecution for his co-operation with police. It was revealed today that he gave a fresh statement to police only last month, but it is not yet known whether this will help Dewani's case or not. Dewani denies five counts, including kidnap and murder. The case continues.","Dewani's lawyer asks judge to remind the media of his fragile mental health .

"Daniel Crespo, the California mayor shot on Tuesday, may have had multiple affairs, it has been reported. The Los Angeles Times reported that 'law enforcement sources [...] said they had received information that Crespo had relationships with women besides his wife.' Los Angeles County sheriff's officials say Lyvette Crespo shot her husband - who was the mayor of Bell Gardens - several times Tuesday after he got into a physical altercation with their 19-year-old son. The 45-year-old mayor was pronounced dead at a hospital. Lawyer Eber Bayona, who is representing Lyvette Crespo, said Thursday his client was a victim of domestic violence but he gave no details of how that might have played a role in the deadly incident. Scroll down for video . Shooting: Sheriff's officials say Lyvette Crespo (second from right) shot husband Daniel Crespo (far left), several times Tuesday after he got into a physical altercation with their 19-year-old son (far right) What happened? Mayor Daniel Crespo, pictured with daughter Chrystal, allegedly told his brother William there was another woman . Bayona said Lyvette Crespo has cooperated with authorities since the outset and was released after questioning. There has been no arrest and no criminal charges thus far. 'I think the evidence will corroborate that she has been a victim of domestic violence for many years,' Bayona said. Sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida said there were no prior calls concerning domestic violence at the home. William Crespo, the mayor's brother, said the allegations were a lie. He said he wants his sister-in-law to be charged with second-degree murder, adding that she knows how to use a gun. 'He doesn't know what he's talking about,' he told reporters about Bayona. 'He's trying to make up ... you know, make my brother look bad, when my brother's not a bad man.' 'I don't know why she didn't call 911,' he said. Brother: William Crespo said allegations that his sister-in-law Lyvette Crispo was a victim of domestic violence were lies . Mourners: Unidentified relatives and friends of Bell Gardens mayor Daniel Crespo, grieve inside the Bell Gardens police station on Tuesday . However, he told ABC7 on Friday his brother had an affair. 'He came to me crying and he said, ""Willy I cheated on her,""' William Crespo told the affiliate station. 'It was wrong that he cheated on her.' '[The other woman] wouldn't let go,' he also told ABC7. 'She kept saying she was pregnant, and then my brother, he wanted to find out if she was really pregnant. She was pregnant. She was. She's not pregnant. She lost the baby.' A phone call from the mistress led to the Crespos' fighting, William Crespo alleged to the news station. 'I seen the phone and I seen the woman. She was at the hospital when he died,' he told the affiliate station. 'She said, ""Oh I just talked to him a little while ago.""' Bayona told reporters that looks may be deceiving. 'In this case there may be an opportunity to learn about the difficult and intolerable home life for this family,' he said without providing specifics. The Crespos were reportedly high school sweethearts who married as teenagers in 1986 . An official portrait of Daniel Crespo, the mayor of the City of Bell Gardens is seen inside the city's police station on Tuesday . Claudia Osuna, a lawyer for the Crespos' adult son and daughter, said her clients were standing by their mother. She stated that the son also was a victim of domestic violence. A biography on the Bell Gardens website said the Crespos were high school sweethearts who married as teenagers in 1986. Authorities believe the two were fighting when their son, Daniel, tried to intervene and got into a struggle with his father, sheriff's Deputy Crystal Hernandez said. His mother then got a gun and opened fire, Hernandez said. Bell Gardens, a city of about 43,000, is one of a series of nondescript suburbs southeast of Los Angeles. The 2.5-square mile city is bordered by several other small towns. One is the city of Bell, which became synonymous with municipal corruption after several former officials were convicted of fleecing millions from taxpayers and padding their salaries. Bell Gardens City Council members serve part-time and rotate the mayor's position among themselves. Crespo, first elected to the council in 2001, was a Los Angeles County deputy probation officer.","Daniel Crespo, the Bell Gardens, California mayor shot on Tuesday, may have had multiple affairs, it has emerged .

"A Colorado mother pleaded guilty Wednesday in the death of her 3-year-old son whom she left alone for three days in a cabin without running water. Meghan McKeon, 25, from Steamboat Springs, was sentenced to 22 years in prison after entering a guilty plea to one count of fatal child abuse. Prosecutors agreed to drop a second child abuse charge in as part of the plea agreement. Bad choices: Meghan McKeon (left), 25, has pleaded guilty to fatal child abuse in connection to the death of her 3-year-old son, Austin Davis (right), whom she left alone for three days in March . Terrible death: An autopsy revealed that the toddler died from dehydration after spending three days in a cabin without running water . Austin Davis died March 27 after McKeon returned to the cabin and found him unresponsive. An autopsy revealed that the neglected toddler succumbed to dehydration. Police have said they believe Miss McKeon stayed at her boyfriend's house and went to her job while Austin was without supervision. . The 25-year-old single mother said in court she had been ‘spending time with a bottle’ chasing unattainable dreams. She said she wasn't a monster and didn't intentionally hurt her son. She said she wanted to start an organization that would help women. ‘I know nothing I say or do will bring my little boy back, but I have hope for a brighter future,’ she said. Personal demons: The 25-year-old Ms McKeon said in court she had been ‘spending time with a bottle’ chasing unattainable dreams . Tragic sight: McKeon found her son not breathing and lying face up with his eyes open and fixed on the ceiling . According to her arrest affidavit cited by Steamboat Today, Meghan McKeon lied to police that she had left her son with a baby sitter at 1.45pm on March 26 to go to work, and she returned home the following day after spending the night at her boyfriend's house. She later admitted that her son had been left without supervision, and that she had been doing it for at least a month while she was at work at a local supermarket. When the woman arrived home on March 27, she found little Austin unresponsive and not breathing, lying on his back with his eyes open and staring at the ceiling. McKeon called relatives and boarded a bus to take her son to Yampa Valley Medical Center, but doctors there were unable to save Austin. When detectives searched McKeon's cabin, they found the residence covered with human feces and half-eaten food. There were also several razors strewn about within easy reach of the toddler.

"Musicians have rallied around a fellow subway performer who was arrested for playing at a Brooklyn subway stop - after the cop recited the law saying he WAS allowed to be there. Andrew Kalleen, 30, was ejected from the G subway platform at the Lorimer Street-Metropolitan Avenue stop on Friday after calmly explaining to the officer that he was doing nothing illegal. A video of the incident captured by straphangers waiting for a train shows a police officer approaching Kalleen and telling him he needed a permit to play there - which the musician disputes. 'I'm not going to argue with you,' the officer says calmly in response. Scroll down for video . Confrontation:  Andrew Kalleen was playing at the Lorimer Street-Metropolitan Avenue stop on Friday when an officer told him he could not be there. Kalleen points him to the correct part of the MTA's rules, right . Anger: The officer, who has not been identified, decided to eject the musician anyway and told him to stop . Kalleen, also speaking evenly, refuses to leave and tells the officer he has a right to be there performing, then directs him to the section in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's rules of conduct that says artistic performances and solicitations of donations are allowed. The flustered officer reads the section aloud and discovers that the musician is indeed right - but still decides to eject him anyway. While the MTA rules did state he could be there, there remains a gray area - because MTA rules differ from state law, which says an entertainer can be arrested for loitering in a transportation facility unless he was authorized to be there. As the police officer calls for backup on the video, straphangers clap and Kalleen puts his guitar back on and continues singing. The officer approaches him again to make him stop. 'Get your stuff. You're leaving,' the officer says. Fighting back: Kalleen carries on playing so the officer removes his guitar - but he continues singing anyway . Kicked out: Several other police officers eventually arrive and forcibly remove the man from the station . Not giving up: But even as he is handcuffed, Kalleen continues singing. He was arrested for loitering . The officer removes theguitar from the shoulders of Kalleen, who continues to sing a cappella. 'I'm being oppressed,' says the musician, wearing hot pink socks, no shoes, a jacket, a tie and a fedora. Meanwhile, straphangers taunt the officer and ask if there are more serious crimes he should be policing, with one pointing out there are crack dealers operating in the city, while others say they see the musician every day and enjoy listening to his music. Eventually, several other uniformed and plainclothes police officers arrive at the station and force Kalleen to the floor before handcuffing him - as he continues to sing - and dragging him out. As he is pulled up the stairs, travelers shout 'F*** the police'. The video was posted online and has been viewed more than 800,000 times. Kalleen was arrested on a charge of loitering and will appear in court on Friday. Police spokesman Steve Davis said Tuesday that the department is investigating the matter. Making themselves heard: Kalleen is joined by other performers during a protest at the station on Tuesday . Standing together: The performers displayed banners so musicians and stranghangers know their rights . Support: Kalleen, pictured during the rally, must appear in court on loitering charges on Friday . On Tuesday afternoon, Kalleen and a group of other musicians and supporters including two City Council members held a musical rally at the subway station before he filed a complaint. The musician, who has been performing in the subway since 2008, has previously received two tickets at the station. 'This time, I decided that I was just going to stand up for my rights and say no,' he told CBS2. 'These incidents continue to happen on a daily basis, and we are taught to obey the authorities, so people do. And they leave their spots, and it's not legal.' Matthew Christian, of the BUSK-NY advocacy group, called for police officers to get better training to understand musicians don't need permits to perform.","Andrew Kalleen, 30, was arrested at a Williamsburg subway stop on Friday .

"An Iowa Republican congressman turned the tables on his Twitter enemies on Monday, live-reading their insults in a campaign video and responding with a mixture of deadpan looks and delirious laughter. Steve King, a markedly conservative member of the House whose views draw either applause or eye-rolls – and seldom anything in between – collected some of the meaner tweets about himself and recited them along with his wife Marilyn. One claimed he 'smells like mothballs and dusty Bibles.' Another called him a 'butthead.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Biggest laugh: Rep. King's wife Marilyn couldn't contain herself at the idea that the congressman 'smells like mothballs and dusty Bibles' This tweet from Julia Ioffe, senior editor at The New Republic, came after King argued that racial profiling wasn't an issue in responding to the riots in Ferguson, Missouri . 'Jimmy Kimmel Live' pioneered the concept of having celebrities read angry tweets about them into a camera, including this gem directed at Matthew McConaughey . The two-minute video plays like a take-off on late-night host Jimmy Kimmel's popular 'Celebrities Read Mean Tweets' segment. Last month, King tweeted a photo of himself holding his new grandson. A Twitter user called 'duncepud' responded: 'You're garbage. Cheers.' His insult might have been in response to the budget-hawk King's note that the baby's 'share of national debt = $56,022.' King, a family-valued Republican, left out the most vulgar Twitter slams. But his deadpan of 'You are a nut job and deserve whatever falls from the sky' is political-Oscar-worthy. Responding to a tweet that read, 'You are one BAD person... Shame on you!!!' he noted the triple exclamation point and said, 'That's love.' Julia Ioffe, senior editor of the left-leaning magazine The New Republic, tweeted at King in August: 'Go home, Steve King. You're drunk.' That message came after King argued that racial profiling wasn't an issue in responding to riots in Ferguson, Missouri – because the rioters 'all appear to be of a single ... continental origin.' Asked for comment, Ioffe responded with an email reading: 'No!' King's wife  guest-stars in his new video, reading and commenting on a few zingers herself. Nasty: One King antagonist responded to a tweeted picture of King and his baby grandson by calling him 'garbage' 'Nut job': King's funniest moments come when he deadpans lines that were intended to make him mad . 'You are a sad excuse for a human being,' one tweet read. 'I've been saying that for years,' a laughing Mrs. King responds. The congressman took a moment in the video to directly respond to one critic who asked in a tweet, 'How did someone so delusional & anti american get elected to office? Your the problem we have to fix.' '""Y-O-U-R,"" he zings, noting the spelling. 'You're the problem. You're illiterate.' King is running for a seventh term in the House of Representatives against Democrat Jim Mowrer, an Iraq War veteran who trailed him by 13 percentage points in a small Loras College polling sample last month.","Iowa Republican turns the tables on Twitter antagonists by deadpanning insults and laughing at the writers .

"An artist has hit out after her Facebook profile was shut down because it contained pictures of nude models from her life-drawing class. Joanna Susskind, 29, organised male and female models to come and pose naked at the art lessons she gives in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee. But when connecting with her students on Facebook, she was shocked to see website bosses clamp down on the group's photos using its strict 'pornography' rules. Artist Joanna Susskind had her Facebook profile shut down and picture's removed from her art class's group because nude models pictures in photo breached the website's 'pornography' rules . It is believed the page was reported to Facebook technical staff, who closed down Ms Susskind's personal profile and removed several photos from the art group's forum. The Glasgow-based artist said: 'There is nothing remotely pornographic about the pictures. 'It's pretty ironic really because life-drawing is one of the oldest art forms. There are some pictures with nude models in them but it's not full frontal and it's not offensive.' Ms Susskind set up the classes, called All The Young Nudes, six years ago and their success has led her to take them around Scotland. Up to 100 artists attend the two-hour weekly Glasgow class in a private room at a city centre pub. Ms Susskind now has plans to licence an evening class in New York, a city she was visiting when she was told her page had been removed earlier this month. The art classes are popular with students, who draw nudes in a private room of a pub in the centre of Glasgow . But Facebook say images posted on the group's page breach their strict rules on 'nudity and pornography' She added: 'They removed a few pictures but the page is back up again. I guess it's going to be an ongoing thing because life-drawing is all about the nude human form.' A Facebook spokesman said Joanna's profile was 'temporarily blocked' for breaching their terms and confirmed that some links were removed for breaking their rules on nudity. The spokesman said: 'Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content. We also impose limitations on the display of nudity. 'But we aspire to respect people's right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.' Ms Susskind insisted there was 'nothing remotely pornographic' about the images posted on the group's page . 'Graphic or violent content': Former soldier Andy Reid, 37, who lost both legs and an arm while serving in Afghanistan has called Facebook 'harsh and narrow-minded' after they removed a picture of one of his stumps because it was 'offensive'. The former Corporal from St Helens, Merseyside, posted the picture of his stump with the caption 'hard work on the legs today'. But it was taken down by the social media's site communities team after a user complained about it. Until October last year, beheading videos were removed by Facebook but the site changed its policy allowing them to stay online, as long as they were not glorifying the violence and used to raise awareness or condemn the action being shown. Breaking these guidelines can lead to a lifetime ban. 'Nudity': In July, professional photographer Jill White was suspended from Facebook after she posted a photograph of her daughter Willa, two, on the beach - which the site labelled 'pornographic'. A number of website users have said they were treated harshly after posting innocent photos. File picture . Mrs White, from North Carolina, said that she fell foul of Facebook's notoriously strict guidelines on posting nude pictures of children after they received a complaint about her innocent recreation of the famous 'Coppertone girl' pose from the 1950s ad campaign . Facebook has a strict policy against sharing pornography, and any explicit sexual content including a child. Users who have posted pictures of their children naked or semi-clothed have been banned from the site. Facebook says it does 'aspire to respect people’s right to share content of personal importance', including pictures of breast feeding, and lifted a blanket ban on such images in June following the high profile 'Free The Nipple' campaign. 'Users with false names': In the run up to the 2011 Royal Wedding, Facebook pages set up by anti-austerity protesters, including UK Uncut, were disabled. However, Facebook said the profiles were suspended not for political reasons, but because they had not been correctly registered. The Facebook community standards state that 'claiming to be another person, creating a false presence for an organisation, or creating multiple accounts undermines community and violates Facebook's terms.'","Artist set up popular class six years ago and invited naked models to pose .

"Weebles may seem like basic toys now, but in their day they used an impressive weight system based on the laws of physics to ‘wobble but never fall down.’ To bring this childhood toy into the modern-day, a Japanese firm has created a troop of Weeble-style robotic cheerleaders who dance and move while balancing on a ball. And thanks to built-in gyroscopes and infrared sensors, the robots perform in perfect synchronicity - but never fall over. The Murata Cheerleaders (pictured) were built by Japanese-based Murata Manufacturing. Each robot balances - similar to Weebles - and perform high-precision routines thanks to real-time position measurement technology . The Murata Cheerleaders were built by Murata Manufacturing. Instead of wheels, the cheerleading robots balance on a removable ball, which rolls in its housing to help the machines dance and move. They remain upright due to advanced gyro sensors, which incorporate inverted-pendulum control technology, to detect tilt angles. Similar gyro sensors are commonly used in digital cameras, car navigation systems, and more recently, the electronic stability control systems that prevent cars from skidding.

The robots will be showcased at the upcoming CEATEC 2014 event 7 to 11 October . And, based on the differing speeds of sound and light waves, this system determines the relative positions of the robots within a 172 square feet (16 metre square) space. In collaboration with researchers from Matsuno Lab at Kyoto University, Murata has also developed an advanced group control technology that allows 10 robots to perform in synchronisation without colliding. Each robot's location is communicated using a wireless communication network, and controlled through a specially developed program. This same technology may someday be used to realise safer and more efficient vehicle and transportation systems, said the firm. ‘The Murata Cheerleaders showcase the ability of electronics to enrich our lives,’ said Yuichi Kojima, senior vice president and deputy director of Murata's Technology and Business Development Unit. ‘We believe the wireless communication of sensor data could become a core infrastructure for the advanced integration of people and objects in smart societies.’ ‘We developed the Murata Cheerleaders to demonstrate our electronics technologies,’ said Koichi Yoshikawa, senior manager of corporate communications. 'Our hope is that the Murata Cheerleaders will inspire new discoveries by young innovators and put smiles on the faces of people worldwide.’ The Murata Cheerleaders will be showcased at the upcoming CEATEC 2014 scheduled from October 7 to 11 in Tokyo.

"The terror convert who stormed Canada's parliament and shot dead a soldier this week was influenced by the teachings of British hate-preacher Anjem Choudary, it has been claimed. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau stormed his government's headquarters in Ottowa and opened fire on Wednesday morning, gunning down Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, as he stood guard at the War Memorial. Zehaf-Bibeau was himself shot dead after passing a room in which Prime Minister Stephen Harper was meeting lawmakers. As shockwaves of the attack continued to reverberate around Canada today, a source close to the case told Reuters that the career criminal and drug addict followed the United Kingdom's most notorious radical cleric on Twitter. Influence? Michael Zehaf-Bibeau's Twitter account showed he followed several radical preachers including Choudary, who tweeted that he hoped Monday's Quebec attacker, who rammed his car into two Canadian soldiers, killing one, would be admitted to heaven . Was he with ISIS? An ISIS Twitter account posted this picture claiming to be Michael Zehaf-Bibeau holding a gun . Choudary's followers have been connected to a number of militant plots in Britain in recent years and Michael Adebolajo, one of the men who killed British soldier Lee Rigby on a London street last year, had attended protests he had organised. He was also one of nine men arrested last month on suspicion of encouraging terrorism, and supporting a banned organisation, but was released without charge. But Choudary rejected any suggestions that he had influenced Zehaf-Bibeau's actions, or those of another  Islamic convert, Martin Ahmad Rouleau, who rammed his car into two Canadian soldiers, killing one, in Quebec on Monday. Rouleau also followed Choudary on the social network. 'I don't have any idea who the fellow was yesterday, and there were reports a few days ago the one who ran over a couple of army personnel was following me on Twitter as well,' Choudary told Reuters. 'The fact that someone follows you on Twitter does not mean you necessarily influenced him to do anything.' Choudary's followers have been connected to a number of militant plots in Britain in recent years and Michael Adebolajo, one of the men who killed British soldier Lee Rigby on a London street last year, had attended protests he had organised (pictured standing behind Choudary at a rally in 2007) Killer: Following Martin Ahmad Rouleau's (pictured) deadly attack in which he ran over two Canadian soldiers in Quebec, killing one, on Monday, Choudary tweeted that he hoped he would be admitted to heaven . Rouleau, 25, was shot dead by police on Monday after running over the two soldiers in a Quebec parking lot. Following Rouleau's deadly attack, Choudary tweeted that he hoped he would be admitted to heaven. Choudary, former head of the now banned group al-Muhajiroun that gained notoriety for praising the attackers responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001 on the United States, has always denied any involvement in militant activity. Choudary said he abided by a 'covenant of security' which forbids Muslims from carrying out attacks in non-Muslim lands where their lives and well-being are protected. 'We're living in a global community and no doubt Muslims around the world who have their eye on what's happening in Syria and Iraq or want to know about the sharia will come across us at one point or another,' said Choudary who has some 20,000 Twitter followers. 'That does not mean that we're encouraging people to carry out any acts of terrorism.' He said Western foreign policy was always cited by those who carried out attacks such as the deadly London suicide bombings in July 2005, known as the 7/7 attacks, and said there was always a backlash whenever states joined U.S-led air strikes carried out in Muslim countries. Terror: Video footage has emerged of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau running toward the Parliament building holding a gun, moments before he opened fire . Shot: Police and paramedics tend to a soldier shot at the National Memorial near Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Wednesday . Canada announced this month that its jets would take part in air strikes against Islamic State fighters who have taken over vast swathes of Syria and Iraq. 'I think that people need to wake up to the reality that their own countries are being dragged into a war far away - the Syrian and Iraqi people are not occupying Britain or Canada - so they are seen as the aggressors,' Choudary said. He said Britain was likely to see similar incidents to those witnessed in Canada, as images of women and children killed in air strikes were relayed across the world via social media, leading to more anger and calls for retaliation. In the wake of the shootings, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said his government would expedite plans to give more powers of detention and surveillance to security agencies. British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain's spy agencies were in close contact with their Canadian counterparts. Remebering: Flags in Canada flew at half mast today to mark the tragedy . 'As you would expect, we are already analysing what happened in Canada and the implications for us,' he told lawmakers. In August, Britain raised its international threat level to the second-highest classification of 'severe', meaning an attack is considered highly likely, and police chiefs have said that detectives were carrying out counter-terrorism investigations at an 'exceptionally high' pace not seen in years. Last week, four men appeared in court charged with preparing to launch an attack on policemen or soldiers on the streets of London and swearing allegiance to Islamic State. 'I think the root causes for what took place on 7/7 are there and I think there are even more reasons for people to feel disenfranchised and to feel angry and to want to retaliate,' Choudary said. 'You can see from Lee Rigby that you don't need military training to attack army personnel and we saw that in Canada as well.' Islamic groups say that Choudary and his supporters represent the views of only a tiny minority of Britain's 2.7 million Muslims, and that most Muslims oppose violent Islamism.","Michael Zehaf-Bibeau stormed government HQ and killed soldier, Wednesday .

"Questions have been raised over the authenticity of the ice axe used by Mount Everest explorer George Mallory which sold for a whopping £132,000 at auction earlier this year. The axe, which is made from iron and wood and stands nearly 3ft tall, was bought by American investor and climbing enthusiast Warren B Kanders in April after being auctioned by Christie's, in London, with an estimated sale price of just £8,000. However, the authenticity of the axe has now been doubted by some experts who believe it may not have been used on the mountain by Mr Mallory after all. Questions have been raised over the authenticity of an ice axe, claimed to have been used in 1922 by Mount Everest explorer George Mallory (pictured), after it sold for a whopping £132,100 at an auction in London . The axe, which is made from iron and wood and measures nearly 3ft tall, was bought by American investor and climbing enthusiast Warren B Kanders in April after being auctioned by Christie's with a guide price of £8,000 . The axe was described during its sale as 'George Mallory's Ice Axe from Everest 1922', and was advertised as the one he used when rescuing three fellow mountaineers from plummeting to their death. Listing the item, Christie's paperwork said: 'During the expedition, Mallory with Edward Norton and Howard Somervell, set the first altitude record on Everest, when on 21 May 1922 they reached a height of 26,800ft. 'Descending from their high point, Mallory, Norton and Somervell returned to Camp V, where they met up with the badly frostbitten Major Henry Morshead and all four set off to Camp IV at the North Col. During this stage of the descent all four were tied into a single rope. 'While traversing a steep snow slope at the head of a couloir, the badly weakened Morshead slipped and pulled Norton and Somervell out of their steps. 'With three men heading uncontrollably towards the glacier 3000ft below and a seemingly inevitable death, the fate of the whole party now depended on Mallory. He was in the lead and the only one still standing. All depended upon him being able to apply an effective emergency ice-axe belay. 'Mallory was able to plunge his ice axe head deep into the snow, quickly wrap the rope around it and then hold the weight of three sliding and rapidly accelerating men.' The incident came two years before he went missing on the mountain, aged 37, in his last attempt to reach the summit. The axe was described during its sale as 'George Mallory's Ice Axe from Everest 1922', and was advertised as the one he used when rescuing three fellow mountaineers. Pictured: Mr Mallory climbing in France in 1909 . Mallory and Andrew 'Sandy' Irvine were last seen on the north east ridge of the world's highest mountain heading for the summit on June 8th 1924, nearly 30 years before the mountain was conquered by Sir Edmund Hillary. Following his disappearance, it is understood Mr Mallory's widow Ruth donated a number of his items to the Pinnacle Climbing Club – including the ice axe. It is then believed to have been passed onto club member Nancy Carpenter, who later handed it to her neighbour William Threlkeld in the 1980s. Sadly, he was killed in a car crash in 1985, while still a young man, and his family decided to hand the collector's item to the National Mountaineering Exhibition in Rheged, in the Lake District. It had been on display in Rheged for ten years, before being auctioned by Christie's earlier this year – selling for a staggering inflation of its estimated £8,000 worth. However, it has now emerged that experts believe the axe might not have been the one used by Mallory during his Everest missions. Jerry Lovatt, honorary librarian for The Alpine Club and an expert witness for the Arts Council, said he has studied the photographs from Mallory's time on Everest and doesn't believe the recently-sold ice axe is the one used by the mountaineer. 'It's possible Mallory had two axes on the mountain,' he told The Observer, 'but it seems unlikely. My best guess is that the ice axe sold in April wasn't there.' 'I don't think there's any doubt the axe came from the Mallory home. But was it George's? Three weeks to do a proper study isn't enough. It seems a shame.' The name on the ice axe, according to Christie's, is I Horeschowski/Wien, which the auction house described as being 'Horeschowski of Vienna'. However, it has emerged that it could also have been named after Alfred Horeschowsky – an Austrian climber – who used his name to manufacture and market climbing equipment. If so, Austrian archives suggest that the first ice axe made by Horeschowsky was in 1927 - three years after Mallory's death. In a statement, Christie's said it had never advertised with certainty that the item belonged to Mallory originally. Mallory (left) and Andrew 'Sandy' Irvine (right) were last seen on the north east ridge of the world's highest mountain heading for the summit on June 8th 1924, nearly 30 years before the mountain was conquered . A spokesman said: 'Lot 216 was sold by Christie's as ""an ice-axe"", on 10 April 2014. 'Said to have been used by George Mallory and previously exhibited as such, Christie's catalogue description, estimate and saleroom notice reflected that we could not state with certainty that this lot belonged to or was used by Mallory.' The heightened analysis of the item came after the sale had to be referred to the Arts Council for an export licence after being purchased by Mr Kanders - a sale lamented by many. Kenton Cool, who climbed Everest 11 times, had previously told how he hoped the axe would remain in the UK. 'This axe is a symbol of our national spirit, grit, determination and a will to succeed against the odds,' he said. However, following a three-week consultation process, the item was last week given the go-ahead to be moved abroad.","Axe was sold at London auction for £132,000 in April despite £8k guide price .

"Texas Health Resources CEO Barclay Berdan took our a full page newspaper advertisement on Sunday to apologize yet again for the company's handling of the Ebola outbreak in Dallas. In the advertisement printed in Sunday's editions of the Dallas Morning News and Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Mr Berdan says the staff at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital are 'devastated' and 'deeply sorry' that they weren't able to save U.S. Ebola 'patient zero' Thomas Eric Duncan. Mr Duncan was initially misdiagnosed by the hospital and sent away with a prescription for antibiotics, despite telling staff he had recently arrived in the country from Ebola-stricken Liberia. He passed away on October 8, 11 days after returning to the hospital a second time. Scroll down for videos . 'Deeply sorry': Barclay Berdan (left), the CEO of Texas Health Resources, penned a full-page newspaper ad published on Sunday, apologizing for the fatal misdiagnosis of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan (right) Fatal mistake: Mr Duncan passed away at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas on October 10 -  after initially getting turned away from the hospital with a prescription for antibiotics . Mr Berden says the hospital is currently investigating what led two of their nurses, 26-year-old Nina Pham and 29-year-old Amber Vinson, to contract Ebola in the days after Mr Duncan's death. 'Based on what we already know, I can tell you that many of the theories and allegations being presented in the media do not align with facts stated in medical record and the accounts of caregivers who were present on the scene,' he said. It was previously reported that nurses at the hospital were wearing the wrong protective gear for the first few days of Mr Duncan's treatment, leaving their necks and wrists exposed. Mr Berden does admit, however, that Ebola protocols were not 'fully deployed' by the time Mr Duncan was admitted a second time and that 'we made some mistakes in handling this very difficult challenge.' Ill: Texas Health nurses Nina Pham (left) and Amber Vinson (right) contracted the disease in the days after Mr Duncan's death. The hospital is still investigating what led the two nurses to catch Ebola. Ms Pham is now being treated at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, while Ms Vinson is being treated at Emory University Hospital in Georgia . 'In short, despite our best intentions and skilled medical teams, we did not live up to the high standards that are the heart of our hospital's history, mission and commitment,' Mr Berden wrote. Since Mr Duncan's passing, Mr Berden says the hospital has been instituting new guidelines should another Ebola case present itself. He says staff are not being trained on how to put on and take off protective clothing and that a 'buddy system' is helping them follow Ebola procedures. They have also made changes to their medical records system which will better help diagnose the disease. 'Our prayers are with Mr Duncan's family, Ms Pham and Ms Vinson, their families and the Ebola victims around the globe,' Mr Berden says. Mr Berden's apology follows the release of Texas Health medical records which show the hospital's protective protocols were 'insufficient' in dealing with an Ebola outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has pointed to lapses by the hospital in those initial days. And Duncan's medical records show heightened protective measures as his illness advanced. But either because of a lag in implementing those steps or because they were still insufficient, scores of hospital staffers were put at risk, according to the records. The hospital's protective protocol was 'insufficient,' said Dr. Joseph McCormick of the University of Texas School of Public Health, who was part of the CDC team that investigated the first recorded Ebola outbreak in 1976. 'The gear was inadequate. The procedures in the room were inadequate.' 'Insufficient': This file photo, shows a copy of Thomas Eric Duncan's medical records from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, provided by Duncan's family. Experts say the records show that protective protocols were not sufficient to deal with the Ebola outbreak . Duncan's medical records, provided by his family to The Associated Press, show Nina Pham, the first Texas nurse to be diagnosed with Ebola, first encountered the patient after he was moved to intensive care at 4:40pm on September 29, more than 30 hours after he came to the ER. Nearly 27 hours later, Amber Joy Vinson, a second nurse who contracted the disease, first appears in Duncan's charts. Because doctors and nurses are focused on logging the patient's care, they may not always note their own safeguards in the medical records. In Pham's first entry, she makes no mention of protective gear. When she logs again the following morning, she specifically mentions wearing a double gown, face shield and protective footwear, equipment she mentions again in later entries. In the first apparent mention of Vinson — identified by just her first name in another nurse's notes — she is said to have worn personal protection, including a hazardous-materials suit and face shield. It's unclear whether those initial interactions with Duncan represent the time at which a breakdown in protection led to the infections, or whether such lapses persisted during the remainder of the patient's 11-day stay. At least 70 workers are named in the records as being involved with Duncan's care in that period. Texas health hospital workers gathered on Thursday to say goodbye to Ms Pham, as she left the hospital for further treatment at NIH Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland . Dr. Tom Frieden, the CDC director, told lawmakers during a congressional hearing Thursday that he did not know how the nurses got infected, only that 'possible causes' had been identified. In comments a day earlier, he gave a clue: 'For the first several days of the patient's stay, before he was diagnosed, we see a lot of variability in the use of personal protective equipment.' Because Ebola has an incubation period of up to 21 days, those who cared for Duncan at the start of his second hospital stay will not be considered safe from infection until Monday. Those with him at the time of his death will not emerge from monitoring until October 30. Duncan first arrived at Presbyterian on September 25 but was sent home. When he returned by ambulance at 10:07am on September 28, he was sicker and probably more contagious. Staff noted immediately upon his intake that he had recently arrived from Liberia. Five minutes later, a nurse notes that he is in a room and had 'put on airborne precautions.' Nine minutes after that, Duncan is seen by a doctor who writes that Ebola is a possibility and notes that he 'followed strict CDC protocol' by being 'masked, fully gowned and gloved' when treating Duncan. The doctor makes no mention of eye protection such as goggles or a face shield, which are considered basic equipment in Ebola guidelines issued by the CDC. There is also no initial mention of foot coverings, which are suggested when such patients have diarrhea or vomiting, as Duncan did, according to the records. It is also not clear when Duncan was safely isolated, though the records refer to him being in an 'isolation room' in the ER on September 29. Numerous entries in the records of Duncan's stay at the hospital — both in the ER and later in intensive care — make note of precautionary measures. Many other entries are silent on the issue, and the mention of hazardous-material suits does not appear in Duncan's records until after his diagnosis is confirmed on September 30. Hospital officials say Duncan was immediately put in isolation in a private room and that staff adhered to CDC guidelines on protective gear, even though those guidelines changed during the course of Duncan's stay. 'From our review of the medical records, interviews with clinical staff and clinical observation, our use of personal protective equipment was compliant with CDC guidelines,' hospital spokesman Wendell Watson said Saturday. Dr. Victoria Sutton, a member of Texas Governor Rick Perry's newly appointed infectious-disease task force, said the issue was not protocols, but preparation. 'I think the problem is there wasn't enough time to do training,' she said. The hospital has denied the allegations of several of its nurses who anonymously aired concerns through a statement issued by the National Nurses United union. Among their complaints: that Duncan was kept for hours in an area of the emergency department where seven other patients could have been exposed; that a nurse supervisor faced resistance from higher-ups when she said he should be moved to an isolation unit; and that even after the patient was isolated, hospital workers came and went from his bedside without proper protection, then walked through halls that were not properly cleaned. 'If any of those allegations — let alone more than one — are correct, if they are valid, then obviously his whole hospitalization put health care workers at risk,' said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious-disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. A half-dozen doctors and nurses make notes in Duncan's chart during the first 24 hours of his stay in the ER. As his first night at the hospital fades into the following morning, his condition worsens. A doctor notes he is suffering and deteriorating. At one point, he asks for a diaper because he's too exhausted to get up. The records do not reveal what happened once hospital staffers left Duncan's bedside. Walking through the hallways, interacting with other staff and patients, removing protective gear and any other physical motions — even as seemingly minor as rubbing an eye or scratching an itch — before being properly sanitized could have led to further infections.","Barclay Berdan, CEO of Texas Health Resources, penned a full-page letter apologizing for his Dallas hospital's handling of the Ebola outbreak .

"A woman died on the operating table during an operation to ensure she would never have children. Bianca Atherton was born with a genetic disability and had taken the decision not to have children, fearing they would be born with her condition. She was diagnosed with a chromosomal abnormality, causing her to suffer learning disabilities. As a result the 27-year-old, from Horwich, Greater Manchester, opted to be sterilised. But it was during the operation that the badminton player suffered an 'extraordinarily rare' response to her treatment. Bianca Atherton, 27, from Horwich, died during an operation to sterilise her, after taking the decision to never have children, fearing she would pass on a genetic disability she suffered . Miss Atherton, pictured  with her partner Ashley Stringfellow, was born with a chromonsonal abnormality, leaving her with learning difficulties. She was due to play badminton for GB at this year's Special Olympics . As surgeons inflated her abdomen with gas, her heart rate plummeted. She died as doctors at the Bolton Royal Hospital in Greater Manchester attempted to revive her. An inquest heard the risk of death in laparoscopic or keyhole sterilisation was one in 100,000. Miss Atherton, a badminton player who was due to represent Great Britain in this year's Special Olympics, had a chromosomal abnormality affecting chromosome 15. Chromosomes are the structures that hold our genes, which dictate how our bodies develop and function. An abnormality is when a person has an extra, missing or irregular portion of chromosomal DNA. The most common  is Down's syndrome, which also causes learning disabilities as well as heart defects. Where people suffer chromosomal abnormalities they are often diagnosed with learning disabilities. The hearing was told Miss Atherton did not want children, and had several consultations with specialists to discuss the possible complications that could arise from the surgery. Risk of death was not mentioned to her, because it was so rare, the inquest was told. In a statement read at the hearing, her mother Catherine Atherton, said: 'Bianca and Ashley had their ups and down but they always sorted it out. 'They both loved football and bingo. 'In 2011 whilst watching Ashley football Bianca started talking to a transition worker and talked about Badminton. 'She started to play in competition and in 2011 and 2013 she won a silver at the Four Nations and also a silver and bronze at the National Summer Games in Bath. It was such an achievement. 'She had done a lot of research on the subject of sterilisation before the procedure and insisted she wanted it done. 'She was not aware of the risk of death and there was no mention that this was a risk.' On April 16 Mrs Atherton dropped her daughter off at the hospital before heading home. She added: 'Once I got in the car I felt uneasy. I phoned a friend who is a nurse and she assured me they would be good with Bianca as they are trained. 'Bianca called home at 4pm and she seemed a bit bored but her normal self. I told her ""good luck"". As surgeons performed the operation at the Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester, inflating her abdomen for the laparoscopic (keyhole) procedure, Miss Atherton's heart rate plummeted to fatal levels . 'She said not to say that as it made her nervous. 'At 5.10pm I received a call from the matron and she said Bianca had had a reaction and could I get there as soon as possible. 'We arrived and were shown to a room and told she had had a reaction and her heart had stopped but they had got it going but it was very weak.' A vasovagal respsonse is a reflex of the involuntary nervous system that causes the heart to slow down. At the same time it affects the nerves to the blood vessels in the legs, permitting them to widen or dilate. As a result the heart puts out less blood, the blood pressure drops, and what blood is circulating tends to go to the legs rather than to the head. The brain is deprived of oxygen and the sufferer faints. In extreme cases the heart rate can drop to fatal levels. During the procedure Miss Atherton suffered a common reaction to the procedure, known as the 'vasovagal response' in which her abdomen was inflated with gas causing her heart rate to drop. The inquest heard most patients' heart rate rises after medication is administered but Miss Atherton's heart continued to drop, before it finally stopped. Doctors described it as an 'extremely rare' event that none of them had experienced. Mrs Atherton said: 'I asked to see her but the staff were still working on her and that I could as soon as they stabilised her. 'One of the doctors told me as soon as they had put the gas in to inflate her stomach Bianca's heart rate went from 78 to 20 and then it stopped.' The doctors pulled out the equipment used to inflate Miss Atherton's stomach, and immediately started CPR. They tried to revive her but her heart had not been beating for 20 minutes. Her mother recalled: 'We were asked at this point to contact any family we needed to. 'Sadly our beautiful daughter passed away before they arrived with her dad and I in the room. 'As a family we are devastated by the loss of our beautiful daughter, sister and granddaughter who would make us laugh smile and feel so proud of her.' The inquest heard doctors had not warned Miss Atherton, pictured with X-Factor winner Alexandra Burke, of the risk of death associated with the operation because it was so rare, affecting one in 100,000 cases . Chromonsomes are the structures that hold our genes. Genes are the individual instructions, telling our bodies how to develop and function. They govern a person's physical and medical make-up, including hair colour, blood type and susceptibility to disease. Chromosomes are found in every cell in the body. People normally have 46 chromosomes in each cell, divided into 23 pairs. Two copies of chromosome 15 are inherited, one from each parent, to form the pair. Chromsome 15 spans more than 102 million DNA building blocks and represents more than three per cent of the total DNA in cells. It is thought to contain 600 to 700 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. There are a number of conditions linked to changes in chromosome 15. An abnormality of the chromosome can cause: . Dr Sangeeta Das, consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at the Royal Bolton Hospital told the inquest: 'Bianca knew about her condition and had been told it would pass down to her offspring and she didn't, in any circumstances, want it to be passed on. 'She was not in a position to take care of children by herself and she didn't want her mum looking after her and her children. 'She was clear in her mind. She had made an intelligent thought through decision.' He added: 'The risk of death on laparoscopic surgery is extremely rare in a minor procedure. 'There is a risk of death with any surgery but the risk was so small here we did not discuss it. I think it is around one in 100,000 for laparoscopic surgery.' Dr Emma Wheatley, an anaesthetist who  investigates unexpected deaths, said: 'I myself have never seen a patient who has not recovered from the vasovagal response. 'I have spoken to cardiologists who have never seen it. It is safer than driving on the motorway.' Recording a narrative verdict Bolton coroner, Jennifer Leeming said: 'In my view Bianca died as a consequence of a recognised but rare complication of a laparoscopic procedure. 'Bianca came over as a charming, intelligent thoughtful person. 'Her achievements that we heard about given her difficulties demand the most profound respect.' In a statement Bianca's coach David Gillespie said: 'Bianca was a dedicated, enthusiastic and eloquent athlete, who trained regularly, always enjoyed playing Badminton and was looking forward to competing at the 2014 European Summer Games.' She was one of 49 athletes with special needs selected to represent Great Britain at the 2014 Special Olympics European Summer Games in Antwerp last month. She competed at the 4 Nations Para-badminton Series events around the UK, as well as at the 2013 Special Olympics GB National Summer Games in Bath, where she won silver and bronze.","Bianca Atherton was born with a chromosomal abnormality .

"Ed Miliband's leadership has come into question after a recent poll put the Tories ahead of Labour . Ed Miliband’s leadership was under fresh scrutiny last night after another poll showed the Tories ahead of Labour. Andy Burnham, the former Health Secretary, was even being touted by some MPs as an emergency replacement for Mr Miliband to avoid ‘catastrophe’ at the next election. The latest poll, carried out by former Conservative treasurer Lord Ashcroft, deepened Labour turmoil by giving David Cameron’s party a two point lead. Last week the two parties were level pegging, but yesterday’s survey found the Tories on 32 per cent and Labour on 30 per cent. The Liberal Democrats were down at just 7 per cent. UKIP was still riding high on 17 per cent – the same as last week. It indicates Mr Cameron’s conference speech and the Tories’ promise to scrap the Human Rights Act did not persuade many voters to return to the fold. Worryingly for Mr Miliband, the poll indicates a collapse in the number of people who voted Lib Dem in 2010 switching to Labour. Labour had a 15 point lead over the Tories among Lib Dem switchers in last week’ s poll, but now the lead is just 4 per cent, indicating that Mr Cameron is managing to steal many former Lib Dems away from Mr Miliband. The Ashcroft survey comes four days after another polling organisation, YouGov, found the Conservatives had a 1 point lead. One former Labour frontbencher said last night that it looked increasingly likely that the party could lose seats at the next election. ‘Labour MPs are tearing their hair out,’ he said. ‘They are utterly despondent; they think Ed Miliband’s conference speech was terrible. ‘If it carries on like this, we face catastrophe next May. ‘Increasing numbers of people from across the Parliamentary Labour Party want to see him go – not just people who didn’t support him four years ago, but increasingly people who did support him as well.’ Polling shows more than half of Labour supporters prefer one of the other party leaders to Ed Miliband on five key issues including immigration, Europe, law and order and defence. Andy Burnham, the former Health Secretary, is being touted by some MPs as an emergency replacement for Mr Miliband . Things have got so bad that some Labour backbenchers are calling on Home Secretary Alan Johnson to step up to the challenge and replace Mr Miliband as leader – although he has indicated he does not want the job. Last night another MP said that Mr Burnham is increasingly being spoken of as someone who could restore the party’s fortunes in the seven month run-up to the election. Labour’s health spokesman received the best reaction at the party conference in Manchester last month – a far cry from the response to Mr Miliband’s poorly-received speech. ‘The only person who could do it reckon is Andy Burnham,’ said the MP. ‘Some of the other contenders like Chuka Umunna and Rachel Reeves are younger and they are more likely to wait until the election and then strike. ‘But Andy Burnham has the experience and the wherewithal to become leader before the election, should things fall that way.’ He added: ‘Ed Miliband is the problem – just those two words. The party is disillusioned and the way things are going we will be doing well if we end up in coalition with the Liberals.’ A former minister said he would also like to see Mr Burnham take over – but said it was unlikely there would be a change before the election. A former Labour frontbencher believes Ed Miliband should stand down as he 'isn't the right person' to lead the party into an election . ‘Ed Miliband isn’t the right person, but Labour is loyal to its leaders,’ he said. ‘We should be a lot further ahead in the polls – and I think we would be if we had a different leader. ‘Andy Burnham would be better but perhaps he needs a bit more time. At the moment we’ve got the leader we’ve got.’ Another MP said: ‘Our election result could be even worse than 2010 – it’s not inconceivable. No one who is undecided is going to look at David Cameron’s speech and Ed Miliband’s speech and vote Labour. ‘The Tories look and sound hungrier than us, their message clearer, their leader is more compelling. The best thing for Ed Miliband to do would be to stand down.’ But John Mann, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said he did not support a change in leader, saying the idea that it would change the party’s fortunes was ‘simplistic and naïve’. He said: ‘In order to win, there needs to be bigger dose of Northern realism.’ YouGov president Peter Kellner said yesterday that Mr Miliband has ‘more reasons than David Cameron to be apprehensive’ about the coming months. He wrote in a blog post that Labour’s core vote strategy may fail because its base is ‘fragile and urgently needs strengthening’. ‘There has been talk of him pursuing a core-vote strategy: seeking to hold on to a 35 per cent vote share at next year’s election and hoping that this will be enough to make him Prime Minister,’ said Mr Kellner. ‘Implicit in media discussions of the core-vote strategy is the assumption that these are all firm party loyalists, and that Miliband’s task is simply to mobilise them. The trouble is, they aren’t.’","Latest poll puts Tories ahead of Labour - spreading disillusion among party .

"The wife of former Minnesota Vikings player Joe Senser was allowed to return home Monday after completing a work release assignment for her conviction in a hit-and-run accident that killed a chef. Senser will be subject to random drug and alcohol testing, as well as searches of her home and car, as part of her supervised release, said Minnesota Department of Corrections spokeswoman Sarah Latuseck. Amy Senser has also lost her driver's license for about five years and must pay a $6,400 fine. Hoemcoming: Amy Senser, 48, the wife of former Minnesota Vikings player Joe Senser, was allowed to return home Monday after completing her work release . Guilty: Senser (left) was convicted in May 2012 in connection to a hit-and-run accident that killed Anousone Phanthavong (right) Senser was sent to prison for the 2011 hit-and-run death of 38-year-old  Anousone Phanthavong, a chef at a now-closed True Thai restaurant, on a dark freeway ramp in Minneapolis. He had just finished work at 11pm and was putting gas in his stalled car when he was struck and killed by the SUV Senser was driving. Mrs Senser told investigators she left the scene because she believed she struck a construction cone or barrel. There were no witnesses of the fatal collision. Phanthavong's body, which was thrown about 50 feet, was found on the ramp, along with pieces of Senser's Mercedes-Benz. A jury convicted Senser of two counts of criminal vehicular homicide — one for leaving the scene, and a second for failing to call for help. She was acquitted of a third count of gross negligence. In July 2012, Senser was sentenced to 41 month in prison. In April of this year, after serving nearly two years at a correctional facility for women in Shakopee, Senser was approved for work release, reported Fox9. Senser, a mother of two pictured with her husband during her trial, was sentenced to 41 months in prison but served about half before being approved for a work release assignment . Closure: : In a May 2012 court appearance, members of victim Anousone Phanthavong's family embraced Amy Senser after she was found guilty . The married mother of two completed six months of work release, meaning she was allowed to leave the facility she was in only for work. She will be under supervision until her sentence expires in December 2015. Senser's attorney, Eric Nelson, said last week that she had no issues during her time on work-release, the Star Tribune reported. A state law that went into effect in August cuts off the 'ignorance' defense in hit-and-run cases. On August 23, 2011, Anousone Phanthavong's car had run out of gas and he was filling the tank on the side of a freeway exit ramp near the Thai restaurant where he worked when he was struck and killed. Nearly 24 hours later, Amy Senser’s defense attorney, Eric Nelson, called police to tell them they could pick up the banged up the Mercedes-Benz involved in the crash at the Sensers' home. But it was more than a week later that Mrs Senser finally admitted that she was the one driving. The retired football player's wife was ultimately convicted of leaving the scene of an accident and failure to promptly report an accident, both felonies. Athlete: Joe Senser was a tight end for the Vikings in the early 1980s and later became a game commentator . During an emotional sentencing hearing in July 2012, Senser tearfully apologized to the victim's family and accepted full responsibility for his death. 'I've waited a long time to say I'm sorry. I hope you can believe me that I never saw your son that night and if I had I would have stopped to help him,' Senser said. Her lawyer said at the time that then-45-year-old Senser got a tattoo of Phanthavong's name to remind her of what she had done. Her husband, Joe Senser, was a tight end for the Vikings in the early 1980s and later became a game commentator. He also owns a chain of casual dining restaurants in Minnesota bearing his name.","Amy Senser, 48, was convicted in May 2012 in connection to hit-and-run crash that killed Anousone Phanthavong .

"These fascinating portraits are believed to be the only surviving images of French veterans who fought in the Napoleonic Wars of 1803–1815 wearing the uniforms they fought in. The former soldiers, aged in their 70s and 80s, were believed to have been photographed in the 1850s in Paris. The blurring on some of the pictures shows how hard the ageing subjects found it to stand still for several seconds while the plates were exposed. Scroll down for video .

The pictures are part of the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, in the U.S. Grenadier Burg of the 24th Regiment of the Guard of 1815 . When and why these men were photographed is a mystery, but some clues are offered in Henri Bouchot's book L'Epopée du Costume Militaire Français, published in Paris in 1898, and containing pictures by the famous French military illustrator, Job. There is a colour plate with a transparent overlay bearing the titled 'Les Vieux de la vieille, Le 5 Mai, 1855'. It depicts 10 Napoleonic veterans in their full uniforms passing the column in the centre of the Place Vendôme erected by Napoleon to commemorate the battle of Austerlitz. The individuals in the photographs match up well with the figures crossing the square. The date of the event, May 5, provides the reason why these men were in Paris - it was the anniversary of the death of Napoleon and every year on that date veterans gathered in the capital. The Times of London in May 1855 noted: 'The base and railings of the column of the Place Vendôme appear this day decked out with the annual offerings to the memory of the man whose statue adorns the summit. 'The display of garlands of immortelles, and other tributes of the kind, is greater than usual...the old soldiers of the Empire performed their usual homage yesterday at the same place.' A more likely date however, is May 5, 1858, because all the veterans are wearing the Saint Helene medal which had been issued on August 12, 1857, to all veterans of the wars of the French Revolution and the Empire. Napoleon's armies conquered much of Europe but French dominion collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812. Napoleon was defeated in 1814 by the 'Sixth Coalition' of Austria, Prussia, Russia, the United Kingdom, Portugal, Sweden, Spain and a number of German States. He was exiled but returned and was finally defeated in 1815 at Waterloo. All of France's territorial gains were taken away by the victors. ‘I no longer regarded myself as a simple general,’ Napoleon once said, ‘but as a man called upon to decide the fate of peoples.’ He died in may 1821 as a prisoner of the island of St Helena in the South Atlantic.","Sepia-tinted images show men who fought in Napoleonic Wars of 1803-1815 .

A source told the New York Daily News that the bride had instructed her team to find a way to make her bandages blend with her Vera Wang gown. 'It's in the hands of her wedding planner, Jennifer Zabinski, and event designer, Preston Bailey,' an insider tells told Confidential. 'I'm thinking they're going to make her some gloves or something to cover them up,' added the source. 'She's like, 'I'm just going to embrace it,' ' said the source. An excited tweet the bride posted on her Twitter account today . Downcast: Lara Yanaska, 31, posted this snap to her Instagram two weeks ago, captioned, 'Wedding countdown: 2 weeks and 2 casts to go! #HopeImAFastHealer' Breaking news: Lara posted a selfie from her bed, captioned, 'There's no place like home. Also, a #selfie w two broken wrists is quite a task. #imexhausted' 'I think they're going to try and do something fun with the casts. She's been really cool about the whole thing.' Last week, Lara's future father-in-law Donald Trump told MailOnline that the wedding would go ahead as planned, despite the bride-to-be's injuries. 'Her fingers are exposed. So the ring is good,' he said. 'It's too bad. But she's really strong, and they dig each other, so that's important.' After announcing their engagement last July, the 30-year-old son of Donald Trump and his girlfriend, picked the Mar-a-Lago club which is where thirty-five-year-old Donald, Jr., the oldest Trump child, also chose  for his wedding to model Vanessa Haydon in 2006. The married couple, who have been together for six years, began their wedding festivities with a wine tasting at the Trump Winery on Friday, followed by today's the black-tie ceremony, with a brunch on Sunday. Engaged: Eric, who is the youngest of Donald's children with his first wife Ivana, proposed to Lara last July at the Trump Seven Springs estate in Bedford, New York . Eric, who is the youngest of Donald's children with his first wife Ivana, proposed to Lara in July at the Trump Seven Springs estate in Bedford, New York. It was reported that the couple had been on a walk with their miniature beagle, Charlie, when Eric presented his girlfriend with a dazzling ring from his sister Ivanka's fine jewelry collection. They then celebrated with champagne, which Eric, EVP of development and acquisitions at his father's company, had brought along for the occasion. When asked by OK! magazine about what they were most looking forward to on the big day, Yunaska laughed, 'Probably being done with wedding planning! 'We're looking very much forward to our honeymoon. We're going to go to Africa and then we're going to go to France.' According to Page Six, the couple's wedding website jokingly describes Eric as 'born into a relatively unknown New York family... Eric embraced his family's passion for Erector sets, Monopoly and Jenga, which ultimately led to a very successful career in construction and real estate.' She'll fit right in: Lara, a native of Wilmington, North Carolina, certainly looks the Trump wife part, with her blonde hair and washboard abs . The couple live together in New York City, where they regularly spend time with Eric's older sister Ivanka, her husband Jared Kushner and their two young children Arabella and Joseph . The description continues: 'Bored with world domination, however, Eric soon realized that success isn't all it's cracked up to be without someone to love by your side. The section describing Lara, who was once a personal trainer and now works as a journalist for CBS news program Inside Edition, reportedly refers to her as a 'Southern girl . . . breaking news guru and baker extraordinaire. Lara, a native of Wilmington, North Carolina, certainly looks the Trump wife part, with her blonde hair, washboard abs and permanent tan. After graduating from North Carolina State University, she attended the French Culinary Institute where she obtained a degree in Pastry Arts. She and Eric live together in New York City, where they regularly spend time with Eric's older sister Ivanka, her husband Jared Kushner and their two young children Arabella and Joseph. The couple were married at Donald Trump's swanky Mar-a-Lago club. The 62,000 square-foot club, which was built in the 1920s by Post cereal heiress Marjorie Merriwether Post, is incredibly opulent and seated on a premiere piece of land in Palm Beach, Florida. According to the club's website, the Six-Star Diamond Award-holding club sits on 20 acres of manicured lawns and has 126 rooms. It was deemed a National Historic Landmark in 1972, a year before the heiress' death. Members are lavished with services from formal and casual dining to salons, spas, and a two-acre private beach. Its design mimics the Mediterranean villa style with elements of Moorish, Venetian, and Spanish influences. Mrs Post used two different architects – one to design the inside and the other to oversee the outside. Upon her death in 1973, she willed it to the U.S. government for use as a winter White House. But the U.S. government said it was too rich for their tastes, citing the annual $1million maintenance costs as the reason for declining, according to the Palm Beach Post. It was also too close to the Palm Beach airport. It was purchased by the Donald in 1985 for $10million. Mr Trump later renovated the mansion, adding a 20,000 square-foot ballroom, tennis and croquet courts, spa, and beach club. In 2012 bargain hunters looking to join what is arguably one of the country's most exclusive clubs were told the $200,000 initiation fee had bee slashed to $100,000 for membership privileges. The name Mar-a-Lago is Spanish for Sea-to-Lake.","Eric Trump has married his partner of six years Lara Yunaska .

"Oscar's Brazil, by Chelsea’s young Brazilian star and author Tom Watt, will be published next month to celebrate Brazil’s hosting of the World Cup. The book offers an insight into both the country and Oscar’s development from humble beginnings into one of Brazil’s shining lights as they try to win football’s greatest prize on home soil. Sales of the book will help Casa de Zezino, a project in Sao Paulo helping homeless children and teenagers in the city’s favelas. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Oscar star in brilliant new Chelsea kit advert . Proud: Chelsea's Oscar celebrates Brazil's hosting of the World Cup in a book published next month . I grew up in a suburb of Sao Paulo called Americana. Life was very different there compared to the centre of the city. There are drugs, crime and the threat of  violence everywhere but Americana was a calmer, more relaxed place and the problems weren’t anything like the poorer neighbourhoods of Sao Paulo. It was a good place to be a boy who liked football. Americana was safe enough to go off and play on my own in the park. I could be out there all day, every day. Perfect! I learned how to play football as a kid through trial and error, playing every day in the street or in the park. When you start kicking a ball about in Brazil, there are no tactics. Whoever can dribble the ball and score just does it. And that’s what I learned to do. I played futsal (small-sided indoor . football) right up until I turned professional at 16. I think Brazilian . football has reached the level it has because of futsal. The pitches are . smaller. The goals are smaller. You have to be faster in everything you . do; particularly, you have to make quick decisions. Blue boy: Chelsea's Oscar is looking forward to the prospect of playing in the World Cup in his home country . Samba success: Rivaldo, Ronaldo and Gilberto Silva celebrate lifting the 2002 World Cup after beating Germany . If you’re dribbling, you have to do it by controlling the ball in a much smaller area. If you’re shooting, you must be much more accurate because the goal - the target - is smaller. A lot of Brazilian players are self-taught like me. My first coaching didn’t come from a club but a local escolinha, a soccer school run by the municipality so you didn’t have to pay. There was one near to where I lived next to a little local pitch. By the time I joined my first club, Sao Paulo, I had already developed my style of play.  Sao Paulo was an hour away from where I grew up. It is a fantastic city, with everything you could want; restaurants, shops, things to see and do. It’s a very busy city. Everyone else in Brazil says people from Rio are just on the beach all day, every day. Paulistanos, they say, just work all the time; people from the south are bad-tempered. We all get stereotyped! At Sao Paulo they said I was going to be like a new Kaka. I was supposed to do all the things Kaka had done with the club. I wanted to say: ‘No, I’m just me.’ When I joined Internacional in 2010, I moved to Porto Alegre. Because it’s down in the south, Porto Alegre has a very different culture. The people, the gauchos, have their own way of doing things, their own way of life. There’s a calmer attitude and I enjoyed that; it’s a more tranquil place than Sao Paulo. Comparisons: At Sao Paolo, Oscar was expected to be the new Kaka when first coming through the ranks . They don’t even drink coffee like everywhere else in Brazil, but something called chimarrao, a tea made with the mate herb. They also take football very seriously down there, and maybe that’s why the city has produced so many coaches and managers, including Dunga (the 1994 World Cup-winning captain) and Felipe Scolari (the current  Brazil manager who guided the country to their 2002 World Cup triumph). I’ve been . playing in London, with Chelsea, for two years now. For the many . overseas Brazilian players like me, it will make a World Cup back home . even more special. I . know what it feels like to play in front of a Brazilian crowd. It’s . important to recognise our responsibilities and take them seriously as . players - but not to let the pressure inhibit us. Special way of life: The south of Brazil have produced coaches like Dunga (left) and Luiz Felipe Scolari (right) When the whistle blows for kick-off, we have to make sure we let the joy in our football come through. We have to be true to our ideals and not let the scale of the event stop us playing the way we all want. If we do that, we know we’ll have 200million Brazilians on our side, cheering us on. It’s an incredible thing that Brazil have won World Cups everywhere but never at home because of the game they call Maracanazo, the 1950 defeat (in the final) against Uruguay. I understand the effect it had on the Brazilian people. It just makes this year that much more important. My first strong memory of watching football was Brazil at the World Cup in 1998. I remember us getting to the final and losing to France. We were all watching together with family and friends, because I was young I was right at the front near the screen and burst into tears at the end. With lots of other people all over the country, I guess. The most famous Brazil team were the 1970 side. It had great players - Pele, Jairzinho, Rivelino, Tostao - but also a kind of togetherness. Look at the fourth goal in the final against Italy (regarded by many as the best goal ever scored). From one end of the field to the other; pass after pass after pass. And Carlos Alberto, the right-back, is the one who scores. That kind of goal is only possible where there’s a very special bond in the team. Brazil legends: Jairzinho (left) was a member of Brazil's iconic 1970 side with Pele . Icons: Carlos Alberto poses with England captain Bobby Moore prior to Brazil's 1-0 group stage win in 1970 . We realise that we’ll only be as good as past generations of Brazil teams if we are able to win as past generations did; from Pele to Ronaldinho and Ronaldo. Brazil is known for carnival. Anywhere you go during a World Cup, wherever there is a space and a big screen showing the game, people will flock together for it. Everyone in Brazil has a mix of blood in their background. I’m mixed up all the way back through my family - I’m a mongrel!  In that way, I’m just a typical ‘Brazilian’ and my family have been Brazilians as far back as we can go, back to the Indians, probably. People have come from all over the world to live in Brazil and they have brought their own religions with them. Most people are Catholics or Evangelical but we also have African religions, Islam, Lutheranism, Hinduism, Jewish people, Italian Catholics - everybody has brought their own faith. Together: Oscar is unsure whether the players or the supporters will be more excited hosting the World Cup . That diversity is important in Brazilian football, too. Look at the teams who have won the World Cup since 1958; there is the same mix of people from every ancestry as you see on the street. We’re proud that you can walk down the road and see people who are blond-haired,  blue-eyed, olive-skinned, Indian or Japanese. Maybe it is why Brazilians have this reputation for being happy; everyone is welcome here. We do have big divisions in Brazil but those are to do with social background. I understand those divisions because I come from a humble family although now I’m more comfortable. I’ve experienced it from both sides; our divisions are about rich and poor. There is no stigma attached to the colour of anyone’s skin in Brazil. As you grow up as a young footballer, you dream about playing for a big club or maybe in Europe. But the first dream and the one that lasts is to play for Brazil. Our first game is against Croatia with the whole country looking on. I don’t know who is going to be the most excited: the players or the fans. Everyone will be together, feeling the same; big emotions, excitement, euphoria, pride and, we hope, joy. Brazil have won the World Cup more times than any other nation. Here’s how they did it... 1958 - Brazil 5-2 SwedenRasunda Stadium (Solna, Sweden) Pele arrived on the world stage at the age of 17, rewriting history by becoming the youngest player to score in a World Cup final and win a World Cup winner’s medal. 1962 - Brazil 3–1 CzechEstadio Nacional (Santiago, Chile) Garrincha (‘The Little Bird’) showcased his magical dribbling skills to become the star of the tournament after Pele was injured in the second group match. 1970 - Brazil 4–1 Italy    Estadio Azteca (Mexico City, Mexico) Two former world champions met in a final for the first time and Brazilian captain Carlos Alberto scored arguably the greatest goal ever, bursting through from defence to finish off an attack of sheer brilliance orchestrated by Pele. 1994 - Brazil 0–0 Italy (Brazil won 3–2 on penalties)Rose Bowl (Pasadena, United States) The first World Cup final to be decided by a penalty shoot-out and Brazil dedicated their win to the late Formula One world champion Ayrton Senna, who had died in an accident at that year’s San Marino Grand Prix. 2002 - Brazil 2–0 GermanyInternational Stadium  (Yokohama, Japan) Ronaldo scored both goals to exorcise the ghosts of 1998, when Brazil lost 3-0 to hosts France.","Chelsea star Oscar and author Tom Watt have produced a book that offers an insight into Brazil and the playmaker's development .

"Michael Dunn, the man convicted of gunning down a black 17-year-old boy during an argument over loud music at a gas station, has been sentenced to life in prison without parole. The 47-year-old software developer had faced the mandatory life sentence after he was found guilty last month of first-degree murder in the death of teenager Jordan Davis. Davis, who was from Marietta, Georgia, was killed when Dunn fired 10 times into a car carrying four teenagers outside a gas station in Jacksonville, Florida in November 2012. In a 25-second statement on Friday morning, Dunn apologized for the first time, WJXT reported. Scroll down for video . Overwhelmed: In her victim impact statement, McBath said she had chosen to forgive Dunn for the kiling . Emotional: Victim Jordan Davis' father Ron Davis, left, is hugged by Lucia McBath, his former wife and the boy's mother, after reading a victim's impact statement to the court during the killer's sentencing hearing . Killer: Michael Dunn returns to his seat after reading his statement, which included an apology to the Davis family, during his sentencing hearing in Jacksonville, Florida on Friday. He has been sentenced to life . Locked up: Dunn, who was convicted last month of gunning down Jordan Davis, 17, (right) in November 2012, is taken away after his sentencing, left. Davis was a passenger in a car he shot at outside a gas station . 'I want the Davis family to know I truly regret what happened,' he told the court. 'I'm sorry for their loss. If I could roll back time and do things differently, I would.' But he still appeared to defend his actions, adding: 'I was in fear for my life and I did what I thought I had to do. Still, I am mortified I took a life, whether it was justified or not', WJXT reported. His sentence also carries an additional 90 years for three convictions of attempted murder - 30 years for each count. He will also serve 15 years concurrently for firing a gun into an occupied vehicle. The teenager's devastated parents also spoke in court and, in an astonishing show of mercy, the boy's mother said she forgave Dunn. Heartbroken: Ron Davis, Jordan Davis father, wipes away tears after reading his victim's impact statement . 'For me, there will be no college graduation,' Lucia McBath said. 'There will be no daughter-in-law. For me, there will be no future generation. 'I too must be willing to forgive. And so I choose to forgive you Mr. Dunn for taking my son's life. I pray that God has mercy on your soul.' Ron Davis, Jordan Davis' father, added: 'My life as I had known it was shattered on November 23, 2012. 'I now call it Black Friday for a completely different reason... The old Ron Davis died that night with Jordan.' Ron Davis' wife told the court that she still hears her husband crying in his sleep. Dunn's family chose not to speak in court as part of the victim impact statements. Dunn's parents, who appeared emotionless as they attended the hearing, have never said anything publicly or to Davis' parents about their loss, WJXT reported. Ron Davis previously said: 'They have not once - nobody in their family has come over to us and said, ""We are sorry for your loss"". And they have to live with that.' Awaiting his fate: Dunn, left, stands as Judge Russell Healey announces his sentence on Friday morning . Dunn was convicted of first-degree murder last month. He had already been convicted of three counts of attempted second-degree murder in February but the jury was deadlocked on the first-degree count, meaning a second trial was ordered. The shooting unfolded after a shouting match between Dunn, who had just left his son's wedding, and a group of teenagers in a car at a gas station in November 2012. Dunn asked Davis and the other teens in the car to turn down the music and a shouting match erupted between Dunn and Davis, who was sitting in the passenger side of the car. Dunn fired 10 times and one of the shots killed Davis. No one else in the SUV was injured. The defense argued that Dunn had shot at the car repeatedly because he felt in imminent danger. The four teenagers were unarmed and no weapons were found inside their car. Gunned down: An image shared during the trial shows the multiple bullet holes to the teenagers' car. Davis was killed by one of the 10 bullets while his three other friends inside the car escaped without injury . During testimony, Dunn's fiancee told how they went back to their hotel, ordered a pizza and drank rum and Cokes straight after the killing. Rhonda Rouer, who was inside the store when the shooting happened, said she heard shots and was immediately told to get in the car by Dunn, who drove them back to their hotel. The couple then ordered a meal, made drinks and went to bed. The next morning when she woke up, the TV was on and she said she saw that Davis had died and she told Dunn she wanted to go home. They drove straight back to Satellite Beach, canceling plans to have lunch with Dunn's son. Dunn was arrested after they returned home that afternoon.","Michael Dunn, 47, fired his gun at a car carrying 17-year-old Jordan Davis after an argument about rap music at a gas station in Florida in 2012 .

"Climbing the ladder: Couples are unable to move into a bigger second home because of rising prices . Growing numbers of homeowners are ‘trapped’ in small first homes as they struggle to take the second step up the property ladder. Thousands who bought their first home at the peak of the market can’t afford to up-size, say experts. A study by Lloyds Bank found homeowners must now raise almost £60,000 to take their next step. The report showed the average household looking to move estimated their current home was worth £223,600 – but the price for the next house they wanted was £282,000. It means these ‘second steppers’ must find an extra £58,400 to move house – double the amount of the average first-time buyer deposit of £25,848 – showing it is more expensive to move up the ladder than to get on it. A third said stamp duty was a key challenge in moving house. The Government has faced fierce criticism for failing to raise stamp duty tax thresholds in line with soaring house prices. Buyers must now pay more than £8,000 in stamp duty on an average UK property worth £274,000, or more than £20,000 on an average London home at £514,000. The report warns: ‘Second Steppers are living in the homes that the first time buyers need to buy to keep the market moving. ‘Without movement from Second Steppers, movement on the ladder comes to a standstill on the second rung.’ The gap is £15,000 more than last year as house prices, especially sought-after detached homes, soar out of reach. Many first-time buyers who bought their first home during the 2007-08 property surge have only recently come out of negative equity and now face a desperate struggle to raise the extra capital to move into a larger home. Almost half of those questioned by Lloyds said costs and fees associated with moving house was the biggest barrier to moving up the ladder. Paula Higgins, of the HomeOwners Alliance, said: ‘Second-steppers are being dealt with multiple blows – those who bought at the last peak with a small deposit may not have seen their equity grow, so may still be pushing to their borrowing to the maximum. Many people look to move on from their first home after six or seven years, so those who bought in 2007-08 at the last peak will now be trying to move. The report warns: ‘Second Steppers are living in homes the first time buyers need to keep the market moving' ‘But homeowners also face the prohibitive cost of moving, made worse by massive stamp duty bills. ‘They would have to pay £9,000 on a £300,000 property, for example. ‘This is also against the backdrop of not building enough new houses for years and years, which has pushed up prices beyond many people’s reach.’ Mrs Higgins added that others were struggling to pass new tougher mortgage tests, which meant they were stuck in their first home. Under the Mortgage Market Review introduced in April, lenders must ask probing questions about borrowers’ spending habits to determine whether they can afford the repayments in the event of interest rate rises. Housing Minister Brandon Lewis: ‘There are clear benefits to helping second steppers move up' She said: ‘The MMR hasn’t helped second-steppers, who are often young families, in that the affordability tests now take into account sky high childcare costs.’ The struggle to up-size has left many people raising families in cramped flats and terraced houses, or forced to turn to government initiatives. Official figures show rising numbers of second steppers have turned to the Government’s Help to Buy scheme – originally intended for first-time buyers. ‘Home-movers’ using the ‘equity loan’ initiative soared from eight per cent to 15 per cent of all people in the last year, while the rest were first-time buyers. Under the equity loan scheme launched in 2013, buyers can purchase a new-build property worth up to £600,000 with a small deposit. Also known as Help to Buy 1, in return for a five per cent deposit, the government will lend them up to 20 per cent through an interest free loan. This allows them to gain mortgage for the remaining 75 per cent of the house. After five years, the loan is charged at an interest rate of 1.75 per cent, which rises every year by one per cent, plus inflation. Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said: ‘Whilst first-time buyers make up the overwhelming majority of sales, there are also clear benefits to helping second steppers and other home owners move up the housing ladder, in turn freeing up starter homes for first time buyers to purchase.’ Andrew Montlake, a director at mortgage broker Coreco Group, said: ‘Borrowers who are paying their current mortgages without any issue are unable to take the next step up the ladder because of new affordability rules. ‘As a result there are more families living in their pre-family home who are having to look at moving further away from their places of work to obtain the space they need at a price they can afford.’ According to government figures, in June this year 15 per cent of the total 27,167 equity loans approved since its launch were to home-movers. This compares to September last year, when they made up just eight per cent of the 5,375 loans which had been processed at the time. Affordability tests and other new mortgage requirements have made it increasingly difficult for homeowners to borrow the extra money they need to up-size. Which is why securing the right mortgage is more important than ever before to ensure buying a home is as affordable as possible.

"The cash bonanza from the Premier League’s new TV deals is going where everyone expected - the players’ pockets - with experts Deloitte saying the total wage bills for the 20 clubs rose over £2BILLION last season. When costs for non-playing staff are removed that works out at something likely to be slightly more than £2.5m per season per man. And as the rich get richer, the gap to the rest of football has got bigger, with Championship clubs suffering a double whammy of lower income and higher wage costs at the same time, meaning bigger losses. The top of the tree: Manchester City won the Premier League title after a hard-fought campaign . Deloitte’s annual report considers in detail the season for which full financial accounts are all available, the 2012-13 campaign, but crucially also forecasts what has happened in the season just finished. Premier League income for all clubs combined grew to £2.5bn in 2012-13 and that will have leapt to £3.2bn by 2013-14, Deloitte say, thanks to the new 2013-16 TV deals with Sky and BT sport. Wage costs were £1.8bn in 2012-13, or almost 72 per cent of income, and these are believed to have jumped a massive 22 per cent to £2.2bn in 2013-14. High earner: Wayne Rooney penned a new deal with Manchester United in February worth a staggering £300,000-a-week . On Championship clubs, the report says: 'The 2012/13 season was a particularly bleak year for the finances of Championship clubs. A revenue reduction of £39m was compounded by a £40m increase in wage costs, leading to record operating losses of £241m. Pre-tax losses also increased by £170m, equivalent to an additional £7m per club, to £323m. Adam Bull, Senior Consultant in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said: 'The 2012/13 wages to revenue ratio for Championship clubs of 106 per cent is the highest ever recorded by an English division and is clearly unsustainable without ongoing owner support. 'The introduction of the Championship Financial Fair Play Rules was widely seen, and advocated by the clubs who voted it in, as a necessary step to change clubs’ behaviour. The severity of the punishments applied to those who have not complied with the rules in the 2013/14 season and the eventual result of efforts to change the rules, will determine the extent to which they present an effective deterrent to widespread overspending.' Timely: QPR's promotion to the top flight via the play-offs was vital for the Loftus Road club . Other key findings of the Deloitte Annual Review of Football Finance 2014 include: . Premier League clubs generated the highest revenue (£2.5 billion) of any league in Europe in 2012/13, followed by Germany (£1.7 billion), Spain (£1.6 billion), Italy (£1.4 billion), and France (£1.1 billion); . The Bundesliga remained Europe’s most profitable league with operating profits of £226m, followed by the Premier League, with operating profits of £82m; .

"Oklahoma prison officials have changed their execution protocols after they botched the procedure on an inmate how 'writhed and moaned for 43 minutes' before being declared dead. Officials have said they will use five-times the dose of sedative midazolam in future executions and reduce the number of media witnesses to the punishment from 12 to five. The review followed the execution of Clayton Lockett in April who seemed in considerable distress as the drugs were administered. Scroll down for video . The botched execution of Clayton Lockett, left, in Oklahoma in April forced state officials to postpone the punishment of fellow death-row inmate Charles Warner, who was scheduled to die the same night . Oklahoma has increased the amount of Midazolam, pictured, used in its execution protocols to 500mg . The use of midazolam has been increasingly controversial since EU drug companies refused to export  medicine such as sodium thiopental which was used in lethal injections. As a result, states have been forced to experiment with new combinations, such as the addition of midozolam. However, there have been several reports of other 'difficult executions when using the new drug. In January, Ohio inmate Dennis McGuire 'snorted and gasped' for 26 minutes before dying, while Arizona inmate Joseph Rudolph Wood gasped more than 600 times over almost two hours during his July execution. According to Jonathan Groner, professor of surgery at Ohio State University College of Medicine, said the use of such a sedative can be problematic. He said: 'If you have midazolam he may not respond if he’s uncomfortable.' A second execution that night was postponed until a review was completed. It has been recommended that prison staff should receive additional training and there should be contingency plans in the event of a problem with the execution equipment or the inmate's medical conditoin. An investigation ordered by Governor Mary Fallin conducted by the Department of Public Safety blamed his lengthy death on the poor placement of a single intravenous line in his groin and a decision by the warden to cover the IV site with a sheet. The investigation recommended more training for prison staff and a contingency plan, both of which are included in the new procedures. The director of the Department of Corrections, Robert Patton, declined to comment on the protocol changes, citing ongoing litigation. Assistant Federal Public Defender Dale Baich, who represents 21 death row inmates who have sued the state Department of Corrections to block their executions, said the new protocols do not solve Oklahoma's execution problems. Baich said: 'We still do not know what went wrong with Mr. Lockett's execution. Discovery and fact-finding by the federal courts will address those issues. An intravenous line is inserted into each of the prisoner's arms. The drugs are injected by hand held syringes simultaneously into the two IV lines. Three executioners are used, with one responsible for each of the drugs. The condemned criminal is first injected with Midazolam, a strong sedative which causes unconsciousness. A second drug, Vecuronium Bromide is used to stop respiration. Finally, Potassium Chloride is injected, stopping the prisoner's heart. *Oklahoma Department of Corrections . 'The prisoners still do not have access to information about the source of the drugs, the qualifications of the executioners, or how the state came up with the different drug combinations.' Under the new guidelines, Oklahoma can continue to administer midazolam, a sedative often given to patients before surgery and commonly known as Versed, as part of three-drug and two-drug protocols. It has also been used illegally as a date-rape drug. A normal dose in medical settings is usually less than 5 milligrams. Oklahoma's previous protocol called for 100 milligrams. The new recommended dosage of 500 milligrams matches that of at least one other state, Florida, which also uses the drug as part of its procedures. Baich also said cutting the number of media witnesses 'reduces public accountability and makes the process less transparent.' A federal judge had expressed concern earlier this month that Oklahoma will not be able to implement new guidelines and training for executions before three inmates are scheduled to die this fall. Charles Warner, who has been set for execution the same night as Lockett, is now scheduled to die on November 13. Inmates are strapped to this gurney at Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma before two intravenous lines are attached to their arms and the three drugs are injected into their system . Oklahoma has also set execution dates for Richard Glossip on November 20 and for John Marion Grant on December 4. Lockett's execution raised new concerns about lethal injection drugs and the secretive process many states use to obtain them. President Barack Obama called the botched execution 'deeply disturbing' and called for a review of how the death penalty is applied in the United States. The US Supreme Court ruled in 1972 that death by execution was unconstitutional as it was 'a cruel and unusual punishment'. Oklahoma passed a new death penalty act in 1977 allowing for execution by lethal injection. Between 1915 and 2014 Oklahoma executed 191 men and three women. Eighty-two people were electrocuted, with the last use of the electric chair in 1966. The first lethal injection was used to kill Charles Troy Coleman on September 10, 1990. Since then 110 people have died by execution. One federal prisoner was hanged.","Clayton Lockett 'writhed and moaned' for 43 minutes during his execution .

"THE MAGIC AND MYSTERY OF BIRDS By Noah Strycker (Souvenir Press £18) Last week’s news that half the world’s wild animals have disappeared in the past 40 years should depress and anger every right-thinking person. It’s not just exotic species we should be mourning, but British birds such as the corn bunting and the northern lapwing. Needless to say, it’s all the fault of humankind — greedy, selfish, short-sighted and thoughtless as ever. The albatross, for example, is on the verge of extinction because too often when it dives for fish it snares itself instead on the hook at the end of fishing long-lines. If you think this isn’t your business, you couldn’t be more wrong. Ornithologist Noah Strycker’s illuminating — and, actually, rather moving — new book is a welcome reminder that we have much more to learn from the animal kingdom than we can even begin to know. There are parallels between ourselves and birds: reproduction, movements, daily rhythms, communication, navigation and intelligence . Asking searching questions about why birds behave as they do, he offers poetic insights into our own existence. A bird-lover since childhood and now a world-renowned ornithologist, he lists many ways in which there are parallels between ourselves and birds: reproduction, movements, daily rhythms, communication, navigation and intelligence. And he demonstrates how much better human society might be if we took the lessons of the birds to heart. Birds find their way naturally, by means of methods humans have had to discover and invent, like starlings . Anybody who watched the extraordinary television series that attached cameras to birds in flight will be well aware of their miraculous abilities to wing their way across oceans and through storms, yet still land in the right place. Birds find their way naturally, by means of methods humans have had to discover and invent, including magnetic fields, polarised light, echoes, ‘map’-reading, and infrasound. Strycker sounds proud when he writes: ‘You can blindfold a bird, cover its nostrils, cover its ears, transport it far from home in a magnetised cage and, more often than not, it will still manage to find its way home.’ After describing those magnificent movements of murmurations of starlings (like great, sweeping skeins of smoke), he concludes that explanation takes us beyond mere science. To him, the beauty of the bird movement is as beyond scientific analysis as a Renaissance masterpiece — and the miracle of seemingly pointless beauty is itself a lesson. As one critic has correctly pointed out, Strycker has the mind of a biologist, yet he writes like a poet. And what he has to tell us is fascinating. Unlike most mountain birds, which migrate south in the winter, the American nutcracker (similar to a woodpecker) not only stays put but actually lays its eggs during the brutal snowstorms of January and February. How does it survive? By stocking up. Nutcrackers live on pine seeds, which they begin gathering in July, when pine cones first ripen, and continue harvesting until early winter. Carrying about a hundred seeds at a time in a special pouch under their tongue, they hide them under the soil in numerous locations in batches of just three or four. And this, as Strycker notes, ‘is where nutcrackers transcend mere survival’. In just one season, a single nutcracker may store tens of thousands of pine seeds in as many as 5,000 different mini-caches. They don’t mark the spots where the seeds are hidden; indeed by the time they come to find them, the ground is often covered by snow. It’s an astonishing feat, achieved, as various experiments have proved, by them noting the landmarks near each cache. The Australian fairy-wrens, with diminutive with violet crowns and long, shimmering blue tails, are all related to each other . And then there are the Australian fairy-wrens, diminutive with violet crowns and long, shimmering blue tails. Strycker spent months observing them in a six-mile stretch of creek and discovered they were all related to each other, ‘a sprawling family of a hundred siblings, uncles, cousins, grandparents and occasional newcomers’ who all took care of each other’s young — proving humans are not the only species capable of altruism. These are just some of the intriguing topics in this book. The most moving chapter is about the albatross — the romantic, majestic bird of the freezing wastelands which can have a wingspan of 12ft and fly for 2,000 miles to pick up food for their hungry chicks. Yet even though they spend interminable amounts of time on the wing, this beautiful creature mates for life. Twenty years after the first famous dancing courtship ritual (when they face each other, stretching huge wings while they dip and canoodle) they will be nesting with the same partner. The author comments: ‘Personally I think albatrosses feel love even more intensely than we do, and available evidence seems to back me up. The Nazca booby is unusual in the bird world as it is known for routinely slaughtering its own siblings in the nest . ‘No matter what category of affection you study, albatrosses beat us every time.’ Don’t forget that only about 5 per cent of the world’s 5,000 mammal species are socially monogamous. Strycker points out that about 40 per cent of new human marriages in the U.S. will end in divorce, ‘which places us on about the same level as the Nazca booby, a type of seabird known for . . . routinely slaughtering its own siblings in the nest.’ But albatrosses stay faithful and are good parents: ‘When they commit they quit the singles scene’ and ‘spend less time dancing and more time raising their chicks’. Do you see what I mean about us needing to learn lessons from the birds? In this, the last chapter, Strycker reaches new heights of beauty and imagination when he describes what he has seen — an albatross pair sleeping with the head of one bird pillowed on the breast of another, or tenderly caressing each other’s heads. I love that one of the world’s leading ornithologists can write: ‘Different people report seeing various things deep in the inky-black eyes of the albatross — wisdom, serenity, wilderness, peace, endurance — which are well and good, but all I see is love.’ For centuries, we have considered ourselves superior to all the other creatures who share this planet. Remote from nature, we think we know everything and exploit the members of the animal kingdom as our inferiors. But writers such as Strycker remind us that, in many ways, they are more complete and more gifted — extraordinary and complex nations of their own, moving to an unseen music that we will never be able to hear.","There are parallels between ourselves and birds .

"A mother killed her four-day-old son by snorting a powerful pain reliever and then breastfeeding the baby, police have said. Reanna Pederson, 32, pleaded not guilty to a negligent homicide charge in Fargo, North Dakota on Wednesday,  three months after the death of her son Avery, the Forum News Service reported. Pederson, who also has two older children, faces five years in prison if found guilty. The mother, who also allegedly admitted to using drugs during her pregnancy, is accused of getting high on hydrocodone on June 13 before breastfeeding her newborn at her home in West Fargo. Accused: Mother-of-three Reanna Pederson, 32, allegedly snorted pain killers before breastfeeding her son and falling asleep. When she woke up 30 minutes later, he was not responsive and later died . She fell asleep while breastfeeding around 11pm and when she woke 30 minutes later, the baby was not responsive. She called 911 and paramedics performed CPR on Avery before rushing him to hospital. He was on life support for a day but passed away on June 14. Pederson told police she believed she had accidentally smothered the child, but authorities claim the baby boy suffered fatal effects from the drugs, WDAY reported. A witness also told a West Fargo police officer that Pederson had smoked methamphetamine in the days before delivering her child. Relatives said they believed Pederson was responsible for the death. 'The West Fargo Police Department called me,' the boy's grandmother Lisa Miller told Valley News Live. 'And I said, ""As far as I'm concerned, if anything happens to him, she killed him"".' Loss: Avery was just four days old when he passed away in a Fargo hospital in June. His mother has also allegedly admitted to using drugs throughout her pregnancy with him . Pederson is pictured ahead of her hearing on Wednesday. She has pleaded not guilty to negligent homicide . She added that if Pederson serves the maximum of five years, that is not justice. 'If he was here with us, he could live to be 80, 85. What's five years? That's not justice,' Miller said. 'Five years is not near enough time for taking a life and that's exactly what she did. She took a life. She took my grandson's life.' In Avery's obituary, his relatives wrote: 'We had all looked forward to having our precious Avery as our little brother, grandson, nephew and cousin. Even in his short life he touched our hearts with great love and we will miss him so very much.' Pederson is out on $5,000 bail. Her two other children are with relatives.","Reanna Pederson pleaded not guilty to negligent homicide on Wednesday .

Ray Wilson, third from right, lifts captain Bobby Moore after England beat West German in this famous image from July 30, 1966 . Graham Budd, of Graham Budd Auctions, who are listing the sale, said it was an 'increasingly rare opportunity' to acquire a piece of English football history. He said: 'This presents an increasingly rare opportunity to acquire a World Cup winner's medal from England's heroes of 1966. 'Many other examples are now in museums, private collections or highly unlikely ever to be released onto the open market by the player or his family.' West Germany were beaten 4-2 at a Wembley Stadium packed with 98,000 fans who watched a thrilling match ending with the first World Cup for England. The team included goalkeeper Gordon Banks, midfielder Nobby Stiles, Jack Charlton in defence, captain Bobby Moore and Jimmy Greaves and Geoff Hurst up front. Hurst scored a hat-trick that prompted the famous line from commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme -'They think it's all over, it is now'. Ray Wilson, right, and West Germany's Haller jump for a high ball during the World Cup final at Wembley in 1966 . Ray Wilson was in Alf Ramsey's World-Cup winning squad the same year he helped Everton to victory in the FA Cup . Derbyshire-born Ray Wilson's skills as a left-back were first spotted by a scout at Huddersfield Town and Wilson signed professional forms at the Yorkshire club in 1952. Wilson made 266 League appearances for Huddersfield, and had been capped 30 times for England - a record for Huddersfield Town. He moved to Everton in 1964, but a torn muscle meant that he missed most of the 1964-65 season. By comparison 1965-66 proved to be the highlight of his career. He made Alf Ramsey's 1966 England squad after helping Everton to F.A. Cup glory against Sheffield Wednesday in the same year. He played in all six games during England's World Cup winning campaign and the semi-final against Portugal marked Wilson's 50th international cap. At 32, he was also the oldest member of the team that beat West Germany 4-2 in the final on July 30. After the World Cup, Alf Ramsey continued to select Wilson as England progressed through the qualification process for the 1968 European Championships. They went out in the semi-finals and Wilson's 63rd and final England cap came in the third-place play-off against the USSR. At club level, Wilson appeared at another F.A. Cup final in 1968, but this time, Everton lost to West Bromwich Albion. Injuries began to take their toll and he was granted a free transfer by Everton in 1969. After a season at Oldham and another at Bradford City, he retired in 1971 following a brief spell as caretaker manager. Wilson then left the world of football completely and built up a successful undertaker's business in Huddersfield. Wilson, now 79, lives in Slaithwaite near Huddersfield with his wife Pat. They have two children.","Inscription reads: 'FIFA World Championship Winners, Jules Rimet Cup, Ray Wilson, In England, 1966'

I'm very obsessive and I want that to come across in the work and get people thinking ""Who would be crazy enough to do this?"" 'I like getting up at the crack of dawn and beavering away at something, knowing that so many other people are still asleep. The felt shop was born out of a desire to make an exhibition that was so all-encompassing that when everyone came in they were just blown away by the extent of the work, the labour involved.' Lucy took to crowdfunding site Kickstarter with the aim of raising £2,000 to create her corner shop - but ended up generating more than £10,500. She also managed to secure funding from the Arts Council - and a sponsorship deal with sweets manufacturer Swizzels. The sewing enthusiast only began work on the shop in January 2014, and admits to occasionally feeling overwhelmed by the volume of produce she was committed to making. Every item, including these Anchor butter packs are made from hand-stitched felt . Audrey Petitt from Portslade, East Sussex picked up some Spam  Fritters and Digestives at the store . She added: 'It was incredibly daunting. I remember planning out the making schedule at the beginning of February and it didn't allow for a rest until the October 1. There were so many nights where I would wake up in a cold sweat feeling guilty and panicked that I hadn't made enough that day. 'I fell asleep with pieces of half-stitched felt food a lot of the time. But I never felt like giving up, amazingly. However, there were periods of extreme fatigue where I just felt like I could sleep for weeks. I think I have multivitamins and takeaways to thank for getting everything completed.'

"England coach Steve McNamara spoke of his frustration after watching his side suffer a narrow defeat by New Zealand in Dunedin that puts them on the brink of elimination from the Four Nations Series.

"Michael Gove once joked that he’d rather be represented on the world stage by his dog than by Ed Miliband. And yesterday, the former Education Secretary’s Bichon Frise puppy proved just how useful he could be - coming runner-up in the annual Westminster Dog of the Year competition. While the competition was dominated by Conservative MPs and their dogs, Mr Gove’s Snowy was beaten to the top prize by Labour MP Rob Flello and his German Shepherd, Diesel. Scroll down for video . Runner up: This fluffy but feisty, white-haired specimen came second in the Westminster Dog of the Year competition, with his Bichon Frise puppy, Snowy . Dogged determination: Labour MP Rob Flello and his German Shepherd, Diesel, won the politicians' pet show . Third place was taken by Tory MP Laurence Robertson and his dachshund, Sausage. Mr Gove said he was ‘absolutely delighted’ his pet had come second in the annual contest. He said Snowy, a rescue dog who has been with the Goves for just under two years, was an ‘indispensable member of the family’. Asked what lessons he had applied from dog ownership to his current role as chief whip, he told the BBC: ‘I think it’s vitally important to recognise the critical necessity of hugging people close at certain times and then at other times rubbing people’s noses in it.’ Victorious Mr Flello said he was 'thrilled' for Diesel, adding: 'I am very proud that he has been part of an event that promotes responsible dog ownership.' Other entrants included Mr Gove’s predecessor Andrew Mitchell, who was competing with his Springer Spaniel, Scarlett. The podium: Mr Flello (centre, with Diesel), Mr Gove (right, with snowy) and Conservative MP Rob Laurence, pictured with his Dacshund, sausage (left), took the top three places . Past and present: Former and current chief whips Andrew Mitchell (right) and Mr Gove both took part in the annual competition . Victorious Mr Flello said he was 'delighted' for his loyal canine friend Diesel after the win yesterday afternoon . Mr Mitchell, who resigned as chief whip in September 2012 over the so-called ‘Plebgate’ scandal, said: ‘She has been this man’s canine best friend during some quite tricky times.’ Conservative MP Nadine Dorries and her dog Darcy were also at the show, which is organised by the Kennel Club and the Dogs Trust charity. There were nearly as many MPs at the dog show, in Victoria Tower Gardens, next to the House of Lords, as in the sparsely populated House of Commons yesterday. Inside the chamber, Labour MP Kevin Brennan had been sparring with Tory frontbencher William Hague about whether or not Mr Gove was ‘gainfully employed’ in his current role. Mr Brennan said: ‘I understand the Government chief whip and his dog Snowy have just come runners-up in the Parliamentary Dog of the Year competition so I withdraw the implication he hasn’t got much to do with his time.’ Caroline Kisko, Kennel Club secretary, said the relationship between winners Mr Flello and Diesel 'really struck a chord with us and they are clearly popular with their constituents too'. Clarissa Baldwin, chief executive of the Dogs Trust, said: 'The Westminster Dog of the Year competition is so much more than a canine beauty pageant. The competition is strictly apolitical; judges look for the dogs' good deeds and devotion to their owner - rather than policies, opinions or 'bottle'. More than 20 dogs with owners from across the political spectrum that took part in the event.","Michael Gove and his dog Snowy come second in Westminster pets contest .

"University of Florida freshman quarterback Treon Harris has been reinstated to his team after the female student who accused him of sexual assault dropped her claim. The 19-year-old true freshman was accused of assaulting an unidentified peer in a campus dorm last Saturday night - just hours after leading the Gators to victory at the University of Tennessee. Harris' attorney, Huntley Johnson, released a statement to local media earlier stating that the woman who accused Harris withdrew her complaint: . Back on the team: University of Florida freshman quarterback Treon Harris has been reinstated to the football team after allegations he sexually assaulted a female student were dropped . Scene: According to the Gainesville university campus' crime log, the only incident of sexual battery last week happened at the Springs Residential complex and was reported on Monday. The dorm in question pictured above . Accusations: Harris was accused of assaulting an unidentified female student in a campus dorm in the early hours of Sunday morning. Those claims have since been dropped . According to the Gainesville university campus' crime log, the only incident of sexual battery this week happened at the Springs Residential complex and was reported on Monday. No charges were ever filed in the case and Harris was not even arrested. Nonetheless, has since taken his Twitter profile down. Earlier in the week Florida head coach Will Muschamp postponed his regular Monday press conference in light of the charges, and the university confirmed the report in a written statement. 'We have no tolerance for sexual assault on our campus,' UF President Bernie Machen said in a statement released by the school. 'The university is committed to providing a safe and inclusive environment for every member of the UF community. We must strive to protect all of our students from sexual harassment and assault, and do everything in our power to promote a safe learning environment,' he added. The 5-foot-11, 190-pound Harris replaced starting quarterback Jeff Drisken in the lineup for the game against Tennessee, and helped lead the team to a 10-9 victory. Harris made his debut with the Gators in the September 6 blowout against Eastern Michigan University. He graduated from Booker T Washington High School in Miami, where he helped lead the squad to a Class 4A championship in 2012 and 2013. The dropping of these latest charges come after revelations this weekend that the investigation into a similar-sounding sexual assault by quarterback Jameis Winston, was deliberately botched by Tallahassee Police and Florida State Universtiy Officials. Heisman Trophy-winner Winston was able to continue playing because formal charges were never filed.

He told them they had 60 reeds, each of which needed to be immersed in 100ml of scent. Because 100ml of scent weighs 100g, they would require 6kg of scent. Booth said: ‘I’m completely lost.

Sanjay’s done all the hard work, bless him.’ To the evident dismay of Lord Sugar’s aide on the show Karren Brady, Ahmed added: ‘He’s done all the scientific bit and we just do the glamour.’ Booth, who has previously said she hates it when women are dismissed by chauvinistic men, agreed, saying: ‘Yep, we can’t all be intelligent.’ Lord Sugar later fired them for their poor displays.

Empty seat: Accused of being 'just an empty seat in the team,' Lindsay Booth didn't argue and went further . And instead of the usual bravado that has become the show’s trademark, Booth conceded: ‘I know I didn’t do well … If he hadn’t have fired me I would have resigned.’ Ahmed added: ‘I’m not your type-A sort of person.

"Andy Murray claims to have identified and spoken with the person he wants to be his new coach - but insists an announcement may not be made until after the French Open. ‘I have an idea of exactly what I want and I’ve thought about it a lot,’ he told the BBC on Friday. ‘I have spoken to them and I’ll see.

"The owner of a Houston bus company who was charged after a 2008 crash that killed 17 passengers on their way to a religious retreat has avoided prison after a federal judge sentenced him to three years of probation in a plea agreement. The daughter of one of the victims said she was 'completely disappointed' and angered by the sentence given last week to Angel de la Torre, the owner of Angel Tours. 'lt's like Mr. de la Torre got less than a slap on the wrist for taking 17 lives,' Yen-Chi Le said Tuesday. Wreckage: National Transportation Safety Board investigators walk past the Angel Tours charter bus that was involved in a deadly accident on  August 10 2008 file that killed 17 people in Sherman, Texas . Le's 62-year-old mother, Catherine Tuong So Lam, was one of 55 members of Houston's Vietnamese Catholic community who had been heading to an annual conclave in Carthage, Missouri, when the bus plunged over a highway bridge near Sherman, 60 miles north of Dallas, on Aug. 8, 2008. The accident injured 38 others. Marina Douenat, de la Torre's attorney, declined to comment on the case. In a statement, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Houston said the judge had reviewed a pre-sentence report in the case and 'handed the defendant a sentence within the U.S. sentencing guidelines.' The National Transportation Safety Board concluded the crash was caused when a retreaded tire on the right front axle was punctured by an unknown object. Although the retread itself wasn't the cause, the panel noted that the tire was affixed to the front axle illegally, the bus company didn't have the authority to leave Texas after failing an inspection three months earlier, and the company that inspected the bus wasn't equipped to judge whether it was roadworthy. De la Torre, Angel Tours, and an employee, Carlos Ortuno, were indicted in 2013 for making false statements. In mourning: It is estimated that the medical and funeral costs for those who were killed or injured in the 2008 Angel Tours bus crash have totaled more than $3.7 million . In March, prosecutors dropped the charges against Ortuno and de la Torre pleaded guilty to a charge of operating a commercial motor vehicle after an unsatisfactory rating, which carries a sentence of up to a year in prison. Five other charges that each carried sentences of up to five years were dropped. At his sentencing hearing Friday, de la Torre was sentenced to three years of probation, fined $500 to be paid in installments over 30 months, and 55 hours of community service. Charges against his company, which is no longer operating, have been dropped. Le, a 37-year-old researcher at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, said the medical and funeral costs for those who were killed or injured have totaled more than $3.7 million, while 'the person responsible for all that grief and heartache has to pay $25 for (30) months.' The U.S. Attorney's Office statement said it 'secured a conviction on the most readily provable offense in a court of law.' Le, who became an advocate for improved bus safety after the accident, said she had hoped the case would show other bus companies there are consequences for violating safety standards. 'With the lightness of the sentence, it's not a deterrent at all,' she said.","The daughter of one of the deceased victims said she was angered by the sentence given to Angel de la Torre, the owner of Angel Tours .

Fellow comedian James McNair was killed in the crash as he and others were accompanying the former Saturday Night Live-star back from a show in Delaware. Scroll down for video .

"American ladybirds invading the UK are carrying a potentially deadly STI that could wipe out the native population, experts warned today. The long hot summer has seen an increase in the number of Harlequin ladybirds which have been threatening British insects for ten years. But scientists have now discovered the invaders are carrying a sexually transmitted fungal infection which coats them in a bright green mould. The infection - which can stop the insects moving and eating - was rarely spotted last year, but is feared to have spread to 15 per cent of the southern UK population already. A harlequin ladybird carrying the sexually transmitted fungal infection which could wipe out UK's population . The threat could wipe out the UK's dwindling population of two-spot ladybirds also known as Adalia bipunctata . Experts are worried it could spread from the foreign bugs to the struggling native two-spot ladybird and dramatically reduce their already dwindling population. They are urging the public to help them record rates of the mushroom-like fungus across the country. University of Stirling PhD student Katie Murray, who discovered the alarming increase of the STI, said: 'There has been a huge increase in it [the infection] this year that I have found. She found 15 per cent of the harlequin bugs in London parks had the infection. Miss Murray said: 'It is a potential problem, but we need to know what the problems could be. 'We don't yet know the impact, but we are going to measure the mortality and also how many eggs an infected female is able to lay. The fungal infection is transmitted sexually but also when ladybirds cluster in mixed-species groups. Pictured, a pair of mating Harlequin ladybirds . Different colourings on Harmonia axyridis, also known as the Harlequin ladybird, which has been a threat in Britain for ten years . 'These are the kind of things you would expect to be impacted, but we really don't know for certain yet. 'These questions apply to both the harlequin and the native species. 'We've seen a couple of ladybirds that were very very highly affected - the mobility of one was very compromised because it had not only on it's wing parts, but also it's mouth parts and antenna. 'One looked like it was wearing a pair of trousers on all it's legs.' The aggressive harlequin - or Harmonia axyridis - was introduced to North America in 1988 to control aphids, but spread to Europe, and was first spotted in England in 2004. It  is now thought to make up 80 per cent of all ladybirds in England and Wales. Harlequins are resistant to many native infections, have a much more varied diets and and even eat their British counterparts. Experts had previously seen the STI - called Laboulbeniales - in just a few of both the native and harlequins in the past, but the numbers were not recordable. But it is difficult to say how much it has affected the native species, because so few of them exist thanks to the invaders. The fungal infection - called Laboulbeniales - coats the ladybirds in a bright green mould and leaves little yellow bristles growing on their bodies. The fungus typically does not kill, although it can stop infected ladybirds from eating and moving. It is a sexually transmitted infection, but can also be spread during their dormant periods, when ladybirds can huddle together together in a group. In these cases, instead of the fungus being visible on the back of females and underneath males, the mushroom-like fungus appears on the edge of their bodies. Miss Murray's tutor  at the university's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Dr Helen Roy, said the disease can spread between species sexually, but also when they cluster in mixed-species groups. Dr Roy, who is volunteer leader of the UK Ladybird Survey, said: 'We've seen a real boom in this infection. 'What we wonder is whether this is seen in ladybirds outside of London, and we want to know what does it do.' 'It is more likely to be spread within a species because the usually mate with the right species, but that isn't always the case,' she said. 'Also it isn't just transferred sexually. In their dormant period ladybirds can huddle together in a group, and these can be mixed species groups. 'In these cases instead of seeing the fungus on the back of the females and the underneath of the males, you see it on the edge of the bodies.' The researchers are now asking for help from the public to track the disease by looking for ladybirds in their houses, sheds or in leaf litter and completing an online survey. Records will allow researchers to look at the extent and spread-rate of the epidemic. Katie added: 'The cold conditions at this time of year mean ladybirds huddle together in leaf litter or other sheltered places like houses, sheds, garages, or other outbuildings. 'Checking for these groups of ladybirds is a good way to have a look for the fungus, which leaves little yellow bristles growing on their bodies. 'Many ladybirds will have only a few of the bristles, so people will have to look carefully.'","Long hot summer has seen a rise in number of Harlequin ladybirds .

"UKIP leader Nigel Farage hit out at David Cameron for recalling Parliament during his party's conference . UKIP MEPs have been accused suffering a 'total loss of perspective' after suggesting David Cameron had called a vote on military action against ISIS to take attention away from Nigel Farage. The party is holding what is billed as its 'biggest ever' conference at Doncaster Racecourse tomorrow – with Mr Farage set to give his set-piece address. But the party has been left infuriated after Mr Cameron announced that Parliament would be recalled to allow MPs to vote on plans to start bombing ISIS. But UKIP MEPs – including the leader Nigel Farage - suggested the recall was a cynical ploy to take attention away from his party's conference, which is being held in Doncaster tomorrow and Saturday. MEP Suzanne Evans accused David Cameron of a 'cynical ploy' to divert attention away from Ukip's conference. She said: 'I think I've been in politics long enough now to know that you have to be a little bit cynical, I'm afraid. 'What happened the day after Douglas Carswell defected? The threat level, the security threat level to Britain was raised. 'And I think Private Eye hit the nail on the head there, that the threat level had actually been raised from Substantial Boris to Severe Farage. 'And now, on the day the Ukip party conference starts, he does something that actually several people had been calling for him to do for weeks: recall Parliament to try and sort out the problem of this barbaric death cult in Iraq and Syria.' She added: 'I think this is a cynical ploy, I'm afraid.' Fellow MEP Patrick O'Flynn wrote on Twitter: 'Just fancy that - Cam may recall Parly on 1st day of UKIP conference to announce that he has finally worked out which side to bomb in Syria.' David Sea-Borne, the party's 2015 candidate for Featherstone, said Cameron was 'scared' of what leader Nigel Farage might say on Friday at the Ukip conference. It came after Mr Farage said: 'It is widely believed Prime Minister David Cameron held back on recalling Parliament on an issue of massive national importance so it didn't affect the Labour Party conference, which finished today. 'However, he still thought it best to delay parliamentary recall until Friday, and not do it tomorrow.' The party is believed to be considering moving Mr Farage's keynote speech to 11am on Friday to avoid a clash with the potential parliamentary debate. But the former Defence Secretary Liam Fox said the claim was 'preposterous'. He said: 'I'm in Washington at the moment and all eyes are on ISIL and the Middle East. Does he think the Americans are trying to take attention off Ukip too? 'The government are hugely focused on this, all the world is concerned about it. 'It really is a sign of total loss of perspective if Farage believes this is to do with a minor party's conference.' Scroll down for video . British RAF fighters are set to join  US Navy F-18E Super Hornets (pictured)  over northern Iraq from tomorrow night . Former Defence Secretary Liam Fox said Mr Farage had lost 'all sense of perspective' after suggesting David Cameron had delayed calling a vote in Parliament on bombing ISIS to coincide with the UKIP conference . Former Culture Secretary Maria Miller added on Twitter: 'Farage puts self interest / UKIP conference before Britain's safety / fighting terrorism. Good he's not in Number Ten making the calls.' Dan Byles, Tory MP for North Warwickshire, wrote: 'UKIP tinfoil hat brigade think international military action is deliberately times to disrupt their conference. They really are a joke.' And communities minister Penny Mordaunt said: 'Farage really does think the world revolves around him.' Mr Cameron returned from New York overnight to hold a War Cabinet this afternoon. The visit has been in the diary for weeks and it was always clear that MPs would not be needed to sanction action until after then. The PM announced last night that MPs would return tomorrow to vote on whether Britain should take part in air strikes against Islamic State.","UKIP leader furious at timing of Commons vote on ISIS bombing campaign .

"A Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice caught up in a government pornographic email scandal apologized today for a 'lapse in judgment' but said he believes the court's chief justice is out to get him. Justice Seamus McCaffery issued a statement that said he is sorry if he offended anyone, but he called criticism of his actions a 'cooked-up controversy' that is part of 'a vindictive pattern of attacks' against him by Chief Justice Ron Castille. McCaffery's statement was issued the day after Castille disclosed that a review he conducted showed McCaffery sent or received 234 emails with sexually explicit material or pornography. Justice Seamus McCaffery, a Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice caught up in a government pornographic email scandal apologized today for a 'lapse in judgment' but said he believes the court's chief justice is out to get him . 'I want to reiterate my apology for my lapse in judgment with respect to the offensive emails, personal emails that were made public by the outgoing chief justice,' McCaffery concluded. 'It was wrong, and I am sorry.' McCaffery, 64, was elected to the high court as a Democrat seven years ago. He is a former Philadelphia police officer and also served as a judge on the city's municipal court and the state Superior Court. McCaffery presided over the so-called Eagles court that operated inside Veterans Stadium to handle arrests of fans. Pictured: Justices from top left: Seamus P. McCaffery, Max Baer, Debra McCloskey Todd, Joan Orie Melvin. From  lower left: Thomas G. Saylor, Chief Justice Ronald D. Castille, and J. Michael Eakin . He said that 'coarse language and crude jokes' were part of his life as a police office and as a Marine. 'That's not an excuse, just a fact,' McCaffery wrote. Castille said Wednesday that McCaffery sent most of the emails to an agent in the attorney general's office. That agent, now retired, forwarded the emails to others, he said. Castille, a Republican and former Philadelphia district attorney, must leave the court at the end of this year because he has reached the mandatory retirement age. Castille also served in the Marine Corps, losing a leg during a combat tour in Vietnam. It's unclear what, if anything, will come of the email disclosure. The court system has said the Supreme Court is reviewing the matter. Castille 'is fixated on taking down a fellow justice with his misleading statements and incredible hypocrisy,' McCaffery wrote. He said Castille is acting against him because he criticized how Castille handled a juvenile justice scandal in Luzerne County as well as construction of a large family court building in Philadelphia. Four former employees of the attorney general's office have left their government jobs in the weeks since Attorney General Kathleen Kane (picture center) identified them and four others as having sent or received explicit and pornographic emails . Before an event in Philadelphia on Thursday to dedicate that new courthouse, Castille declined to respond to McCaffery's statements. 'I don't respond to name-calling,' Castille told the AP. Four former employees of the attorney general's office have left their government jobs in the weeks since Attorney General Kathleen Kane identified them and four others as having sent or received explicit and pornographic emails. Kane said current employees also sent or received the emails and could face discipline, but she has not named them. The emails date from late 2008, when Gov. Tom Corbett was attorney general, until early 2012, about the time Kane took office as the first woman and first Democrat to be elected attorney general. Corbett has said he was unaware of the emails. Corbett's environmental protection secretary, Chris Abruzzo, and a lawyer in the department, Glenn Parno, both resigned after they were named as email participants. Rick Sheetz, who led the criminal division of the attorney general's office under Corbett, has resigned as a deputy prosecutor in Lancaster County, and Randy Feathers, who supervised investigators in the Jerry Sandusky molestation case, has announced he will soon retire from his appointed position on the state Board of Probation and Parole.

"While she is preparing to take off her mask for the first time, Dana Vulin has revealed she is fighting another battle, but this time, it's cancer. The 28-year-old was doused with methylated spirits and set on fire by a woman jealous of her beauty two and a half years ago in a horrific premeditated attack to 'ruin her pretty face'. On Sunday, after 30 months of agonising reconstructive surgery and more than 30 procedures, the Perth woman will take off the mask that she's been forced to wear to cover her burnt face. Ms Vulin suffered third-degree burns to two thirds of her body, including her face, and has endured constant pain since the horrific attack. She survived against incredible odds but recently, Ms Vulin revealed she suffered another agonising pain when she was told by her doctor that she has cervical cancer. Scroll down for video . Dana Vulin suffered horrific burns to her face and body when she was attacked by Natalie Dimitrovska . 'As soon as I looked into his eyes I said to him, 'it's bad isn't it?' And he said, 'Yeah I'm sorry, you have cancer',' Ms Vulin told Channel Seven's Sunday Night show. 'I just couldn't believe that, dealing with so much at once, there were times where I thought how much can one person deal with?' Appearing on Channel Seven’s Sunday Night this weekend Ms Vulin explained how her life has changed since the attack. 'In my wildest dreams in the beginning I didn't for one second think I could look in the mirror and see the old Dana again,' Ms Vulin said. 'I'm going to make this burn my bitch, I'm going to kick it in the face and I am going to rock scars, look hot with my scarred-up body and just make this work. 'It would've been easier to die but I've never taken the easy road to anything so. It is the hardest, rockiest, biggest mountain you can possibly think of.' The 28-year-old will take off the mask that she has been forced to wear for two and a half years . Ms Vulin was on her sofa at home in Perth, Western Australia on February 16, 2001, when a woman's voice said: 'Hello, Dana.' Natalie Dimitrovska, the jealous estranged wife of a man named Edin who Ms Vulin had met at a New Year’s Eve party, stood before her. Dimitrovska hurled a bottle of methylated spirits over Ms Vulin, a convicted drug user, while she was reportedly holding a lamp used for smoking crystal meth. 'I was pretty much instantly on fire,' a weeping Ms Vulin told Western Australia's District Court. 'I was a human fireball.' 'The moment I was on fire, [Dimitrovska and a male accomplice] just laughed and ran out of my apartment,' she added. Ms Vulin, seen here before the attack, was set alight by a jealous estranged wife of a man she had met once . The university graduate always took pride in her appearance before the crime . Since coming out of a coma, Dana has suffered agonising pain from her burns and has been forced to wear the pressure suit and mask between countless operations. 'I've been faceless and it makes you feel like a nothing and a no one,' she said. 'I know who I am, but I'm beige. I don't have any expressions on my face, you can’t see my mouth, you can’t see my nose, you can literally only see my eyeballs, not my eyebrows. It makes me feel like a faceless nothing, that’s the best way to describe it.' Of the mask that has covered her face for so long, she added: 'I respect the s**t out of this mask, and I appreciate it, but I also hate its guts. Without it I couldn't be where I am right now, but if I had a choice I'd rather endure physical pain than wear this mask.' Channel Seven reporter Rahni (left) is seen standing with Ms Vulin (right) behind a table full of her rehabilitation equipment and clothing . She has suffered agonising pain from her burns and has been forced to wear the pressure suit and mask between countless operations . 'My skin and my burns and my scars are obviously a part of me now, but this is not me,' Ms Vulin says . Ms Vulin always took pride in her appearance before the attack and enjoyed having her hair and nails done regularly. ‘Not one minute of my day is the same. Your exterior is a representation of your interior, and this is not me…my skin and my burns and my scars are obviously a part of me now, but this is not me. I’ve not been able to wear earrings, I had no hair so I haven’t been able to do anything with my hair, I’ve been fashion repeating for over two years. '(When I look in the mirror) I see someone I know and someone I don’t know, does that make sense? It’s crazy what I’ve accepted as normal. It’s crazy that I've accepted wearing that mask all day and night normal, and having my face out as not normal and natural.' The university graduate added: ‘It’s your identity, so I think in order for somebody to heal inside you have to heal on the outside. I have the right to have my face that I was born with back. Everyone has the right to have their face.'

Dana Vulin leaves court after watching the woman who set her alight and left her to burn to death jailed by a Perth judge for 17 years . On October 11 2013, Dimitrovska wept as she was jailed for 17 years for grievous bodily harm with intent. In sentencing, Judge Bruce Goetze described the attack as being in the worst category of grievous bodily harm with intent. He said the attack was also premeditated as in the weeks leading up to the incident Dimitrovska had threatened to 'ruin (Ms Vulin’s) pretty face'. Dimitrovska ran away after setting Ms Vulin on fire. 'It is really difficult to imagine how one human being could leave while another human being is on fire,’ Judge Goetze said. ‘It is totally unimaginable how you could not put out the flames, or try to do so, or at least call for help. Instead, you laughed and ran away.’ Speaking on Sunday Night, Ms Vulin said: 'I am a strong person, and more than anything that I've learnt in my burn is that I will never change and I know the person I am, and '’m confident in the woman that I am.'

"A 14-year-old boy was stabbed to death and three other teenagers suffered knife wounds after a Bronx house party descended into violence. Justin Fallu was stabbed in the chest following an argument at the apartment in the early hours of yesterday morning. Two 18-year-olds also suffered stab wounds to the chest and a 17-year-old was cut on the left side of his torso. All four victims were taken to Jacobi Medical Center, but Justin did not survive the journey. Neighbors comfort one another on hearing the news of the death of 14-year-old Justin Fallu stabbed to death at a Bronx house party that got out of control . Paramedics found one of the blood-covered victims a block away, the New York Daily News reported. Above his stab wound was a tattoo that read, 'Never Fear Death'. Residents of the building where the incident took place said the teenagers had been partying in an apartment and smoking marijuana in the stairwells all day. Shortly before 3am the party spilled out into the lobby and appeared to have spiraled out of control. 'They were screaming at each other in the lobby,' said one woman, who did not want to be identified. 'Someone said, 'Yeah? Well go ahead and do it.' And the next thing you know, they came out and did it,' she said. Another tenant said that he called the police after he felt the party had gotten out of control. 'I called the cops at 2am, and they just said all they could do was ask to turn the music down,' he told New York Daily News. 'As soon as the cops left, they turned the music back up, and 20 minutes later, this [is] what happened,' he said, pointing at the bloody clothing in the middle of the street. Residents of the building where the incident took place said the teenagers had been partying in an apartment and smoking marijuana in the stairwells all day . Justin's neighbors expressed shock at the news of his death. 'I just saw him last night,' one said. 'He said, 'I'm going to a party.' He was a good kid, he didn't deserve to go out like that.' A neighbor and family friend, Nick West, 45, told the New York Times that Justin was 'a young man with morals and principles who, unfortunately, turned out to be a statistic'. Asked how Justin's parents were coping, Mr West said: 'They are devastated.' Mr West added that Justin used to run errands for his wife, who was an amputee. He described the neighborhood as a rough one where it was tough to stay out of trouble. But Justin, he said, 'was smart enough to see the bigger picture'. 'Unfortunately,' he added, 'the friends that he had were into things they shouldn't have been into.' The three surviving victims are listed as in stable condition. There have been no arrests.

"Miranda is one half of the best central defensive partnership in Europe and were any Premier League club to land him they would have some player. Think Ricardo Carvalho in the John Terry/Carvalho partnership in Jose Mourinho’s first spell at Chelsea.

As well as being impeccable defensively he knows how to get forward and score important goals, giving Atletico the Spanish Cup last season by notching the winner at the Bernabeu against Real Madrid. The fact that his outstanding displays have caught everyone’s eye this season extends to Spain coach Vicente del Bosque. The World Cup-winning manager enquired over the defender’s international status. Unfortunately for Spain, he had already played full internationals with Brazil and can’t follow Diego Costa in making the switch to Spain. He did move back to Brazil with Sao Paulo in 2006 after ill-fated one-season spells with Coritiba and Sochaux.","Brazilian centre-back has had an outstanding season at the heart of Atletico Madrid's title-winning team .

"Tory grandee: Lord Tebbit (pictured in April) said  ragwort was a big problem in his part of East Anglia . Young unemployed people should be made to pull up ragwort from roadside verges in return for benefits, a Tory grandee has said. Former Conservative cabinet minister Lord Tebbit, 83, made the proposal to combat the rampant weed in a letter to an insect charity. He wrote to Matt Shardlow, chief executive of a charity called Buglife, which is concerned about the effect of declining ragwort on bees and rare insects. Tebbit said ragwort was a major problem in his part of East Anglia and proposed it could be weeded out by ‘Neets’ - young people who are not in education, work or training - and ‘low level criminals’. Ragwort, also known as Jacobaea vulgaris, is a common wildflower which is poisonous to cattle and horses. He wrote: ‘I suggest you come to the Norfolk/Suffolk border areas of East Anglia. Landowners who wish to control ragwort face an impossible task when roadside verges are dominated by it to an extent I cannot remember in the past. ‘There would be little cost to bring that under control if Neets and low level criminals were required as part of their contribution to the society which finances them, or which they have abused… to uproot this weed.’ Tebbit later told the Guardian: ‘Given a bit of organisation, they would be happy doing something constructive. That’s something constructive for them. ‘It’s appealing, it gets rid of a weed which is a danger to some animals and helps landowners in the cultivation of their land. Collected from roadside verges: Ragwort, also known as Jacobaea vulgaris, is a common wildflower which is poisonous to cattle and horses (file picture) Criticism: Chris Bryant (above), the shadow welfare reform minister, said the comments reflected the 'values of the Victorian workhouse' in which out-of-work people were forced to perform demeaning, unpaid labour . ‘That was my thought that caused me to suggest the idea… in a way it’s a form of national service, of doing something for society in a way in which anyone unless they are physically disabled can participate.’ Asked whether he acknowledged some might find the idea of forced labour in return for benefits controversial, he said: ‘It’s workfare but I think there are some powerful arguments for workfare and so does [Labour MP] Frank Field for example. It’s not a way-out idea in that sense. ‘If you go back to the Beveridge report on which the whole welfare state has been based, you’ll find he took the view that youngsters who had never worked should not receive benefits because they have not contributed anything.’ Suggestion: Lord Tebbit, pictured with his wife Margaret in April at their home in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk . Previous comments: Lord Tebbit, who was a minister under Margaret Thatcher (together in 1982), was famous for telling the jobless to get on their bikes and look for work - as his father had in the 1930s . Lord Tebbit wrote to Matt Shardlow (pictured), chief executive of Buglife, which is concerned about the effect of declining ragwort on bees and rare insects . He added: ‘I am much more modest about this than Beveridge was and I suspect Ernie Bevan might have been on my side in it. I just think a lot of those youngsters want something to do which is constructive.’ However, Labour MP Chris Bryant, the shadow welfare reform minister, said the comments reflected the ‘values of the Victorian workhouse’ in which out-of-work people were forced to perform demeaning, unpaid labour. He told the Guardian: ‘There’s one weed that I would like to uproot: it’s sitting in the House of Lords. 'Lord Tebbit’s proposal, which effectively equates being out of work with being a criminal, is both offensive and ludicrous.’ Lord Tebbit, who was a minister under Margaret Thatcher, was famous for telling the jobless to get on their bikes and look for work – as his father had in the 1930s.","Lord Tebbit makes proposal to combat ragwort in letter to insect charity .

"Already it has become the defining image . of the title race: the slip, the desperate scramble to get upright and . the despairing chase as Demba Ba closes in on goal to score for Chelsea. It . encapsulated everything that has made the Premier League a compelling . global spectacle. There was genuine pathos in seeing a player of Steven . Gerrard’s stature close to a title that no one had ever imagined him . winning, only to see it fall away in the final games of the season, in . part as a result of his own mistake. It . was almost irrelevant that title races are not decided in single . moments, that a combination of events over nine months determines the . outcome and that, in that Chelsea match, there was still time for . Liverpool to recover. Such rationality is obscured by the power of a . 10-second video clip that seemingly changed Gerrard’s destiny. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Gerrard: I am completely over my mistake against Chelsea . Cruel: TV footage of Steven Gerrard's costly slip which gifted Chelsea the lead at Anfield . ‘Yeah, it was unfair, of course it was, because of the timing with three games to go,’ said Gerrard last week, talking publicly about that Anfield moment for the first time. ‘We were top of the League. It’s cruel. But that’s football, that’s life. I can’t feel sorry for myself. It’s done.’ And for Gerrard the words have to be meaningful rather than a mantra he repeats to comfort himself. He is sat in the Vale de Lobo resort on the Algarve coast in Portugal, here on England duty, and he is the captain of a young, inexperienced squad who are about to travel to Brazil to play in the World Cup finals. Football challenges do not come much greater and for Gerrard there is no time for introspection. Not that he is one to dwell on failures. He has managed to avoid viewing a repeat of his error. ‘I haven’t seen it. When you slip… is there anybody who hasn’t slipped at any time in their life? The difference is I did it at a bad time and at a bad place, at a bad moment. ‘If I’d done a bad backpass, scored an own goal, or done my job wrong it would have really beaten me up for a long time. I keep saying to myself, how, where and why? There are no answers because it was a slip. ‘If I had made that mistake when I was younger — for example when I scored that own goal against Chelsea (in the 2005 League Cup final) when I was around 23. That killed me for a long time.’ He recalls: ‘You are not experienced enough to know that you can make up . for it with time, that the memory will fade away. I put myself under an . awful lot more pressure then. That’s not to say I won’t put the same . pressure on myself to make up for this one, but I’ve learned to cope . better with setbacks through age. ‘I don’t like making mistakes, big . mistakes at important times. I’ve made more than a few through my career . but as a player with experience you learn to deal with them that little . bit better the older you get. Yes, it hurt a lot — not just the slip, . more letting the title slip towards the end because we’d come so close . and had a terrific season. ‘I was disappointed for all the lads, for . all the supporters and everyone at the club, that we couldn’t hang on . and do it. It would have been a monumental achievement to go from . seventh to first. But with experience you tend to look back at the . positives as well as the negatives. To finish second in the hardest . League in the world, to have the season I’ve had personally, to watch . the likes of Raheem Sterling grow and to see the team do so well, was . fantastic.’ His response is unsurprising. The end of the season must . have been a crushing disappointment but he is 34 next week and old . enough to maintain perspective. He is married to Alex, has three young . daughters and they are quick to focus his mind on other matters. Breakthrough: Chelsea striker Demba Ba runs on to score the opening goal in 2-0 win against Liverpool . ‘They . don’t get involved with the football,’ said Gerrard. ‘Alex is  clueless . when it comes to football and none of my girls are interested so I had . to deal with it myself. I don’t want anyone around this table thinking . I’m a young, naive, insecure person who goes home and cries in his . bedroom. 'I’m 33 years of age with 100 or so caps and 600-odd . appearances. I’m big enough and brave enough to take it on the chin. I . take responsibility for the slip and the damage it’s done. But I’ll . prove to everybody in this World Cup that I’m fit, fresh and ready to . perform.’ Those reflections also reveal a trace of the thoughts of . Steve Peters, the renowned psychiatrist with whom Gerrard works and who . is accompanying the England squad to Brazil. Gerrard once would have . been marked down as a worrier; certainly former England manager Fabio . Capello thought so. That does not seem to be the case today. ‘I’ve . spoken to Steve Peters about it,’ said Gerrard. ‘I talk to him about the . good things and bad things I do in every single game and every training . session. It’s not just about the one case that I might dwell on for a . long time. Having Steve there is a bit of a help in dealing with it.’ Clearly, with the World Cup upon us, there are more pressing matters, for which Gerrard is grateful. Disappointment: Steven Gerrard shows his dejection after his slip led to the first goal . ‘Otherwise . I would be sitting on a sun lounger wondering about to the last three . or four games of the season, keeping going over and over where it’s gone . wrong, asking myself why and where, driving myself potty. I’ve got to . park the slip at the back of my mind and forget about it because I’ve . got a huge tournament coming up. ‘Once you start playing and . training, different things come up to think about. For example, Italy, . Uruguay, Luis Suarez, Costa Rica. Those are the things on my mind. ‘I’ve . got to make sure for everyone’s sake that I park the memory — I can’t . change it. I’ve got to try to perform as well as I can for everyone.’ Indeed, the vibrancy and youth of this England squad may prove to be the best antidote to Gerrard’s disappointments. ‘There . is lots of energy in the camp, thank God,’ added Gerrard, as he . gestures to Sterling, 19, sitting nearby. ‘I haven’t told him yet but . he’ll be doing all my running! ‘There are plenty of legs, plenty of . energy, plenty of excitement in the squad but it’s also mixed with a . couple of older, more experienced lads who have been around  the block, . and they will support them and take all the pressure off them. Taking a break: Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney enjoy a breather . during England's World Cup preparations in Portugal . ‘They’ve . got no worrying to be doing or any pressure at all from us. We want . them to go out with no fear, to do as much damage as they can. They’re . certainly capable of it. ‘I’m excited to be here surrounded by a lot . of young talent. Like me, I’m sure you’re all wondering how it’s going . to go and can they produce the form they’ve produced with their clubs . for England? ‘Time will tell and we’ll have to wait and see. But I’ve got confidence and belief in these youngsters. ‘They’ve . shown for Liverpool in some really big games, against big opponents, . that they have no fear and are capable of causing all sorts of problems. And I think that will be the case over in Brazil.’ For Gerrard, of . course, it could be a last appearance on the world stage for his . country. International retirement looms at the end of this tournament, . although manager Roy Hodgson will undoubtedly attempt to talk him out of . it. Gerrard will make a decision at the end of the tournament. A . good World Cup and the promise of youth might persuade him to play on. Final glory: It could be Gerrard's last appearance on the world stage for England . With . an eye to the future he adds: ‘I’m not going to leave anyone hanging. Don’t worry: as soon as the World Cup is over I’ll sit down with the . manager and I’ll make the decision. I haven’t made that decision because . I haven’t had the chance to chat with the manager at length over it. ‘But . I’ll be chatting to (Liverpool manager) Brendan Rodgers, Roy Hodgson . and a few important  people around me, whose opinion I respect, players . I’ve played with. ‘I’ll chat to them all and make the right decision . at the right time. It will be very close after the World Cup. It does . depend on how the World Cup goes, how I perform, how the team perform. Am I still going to be wanted after the World Cup? These are all the . questions we’ll have to sit down and answer. ‘I won’t stay around if . I’m not wanted. I hope I perform to the level where I’m wanted and I’ve . got that difficult decision to make.’ After all, next season Liverpool will play in the Champions League, an additional if welcome burden. ‘That . will be a factor,’ says  Gerrard earnestly, before smiling. ‘But we . have to wait and see whether I’m selected to play in those Champions . League games.’ A new generation is knocking on the door, impatient to . arrive. But England and Liverpool will want to call on Gerrard for a . year or two yet.","Gerrard: If I wasn’t going to Brazil I’d be sitting on a sun lounger and driving myself potty over what went wrong .

"Tiger Woods will miss next month’s US Open as he continues his rehabilitation from back surgery, the American announced on Wednesday. The 38-year-old world number three last week gave the strongest indication yet that he would not be able to compete at Pinehurst from June 12-15, admitting his recovery from his March 31 operation was 'slow and tedious' and saying he was still unable to hit full shots. Woods said on www.tigerwoods.com: 'Unfortunately, I won’t be there because I’m not yet physically able to play competitive golf. Concerns: Tiger Woods feared his golf career was over after suffering a back injury . 'I’d like to convey my regrets to the USGA leadership, the volunteers and the fans that I won’t be at Pinehurst.' Woods, who underwent microdiscectomy surgery for a pinched nerve in his back eight weeks ago, has not competed since the final round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship on March 9. He continued to remain positive about his future, though, adding: 'The US Open is very important to me, and I know it’s going to be a great week. Despite missing the first two majors, and several other important tournaments, I remain very optimistic about this year and my future.' This marks the sixth major the player will have missed since winning his 14th in 2008 at the US Open. Knee surgery following that victory led to an eight-month lay-off and caused him to miss the Open and PGA championships. In 2011 he . sat out the US Open and Open Championship due to knee and Achilles . injuries, while this year’s back surgery meant he missed the Masters for . the first time in his career. Question time: Woods released a statement on his website confirming his withdrawal from the US Open . That cast further doubt on his ability to surpass Jack Nicklaus’ record of 18 major titles, but Woods was bullish about his prospects. Speaking on May 19, he said: 'The only doubts I had were prior to the surgery. I couldn’t function any more. 'I’ve had knee surgeries in the past and, yeah, I was hurting going into it, but I was functioning. Right before this surgery I couldn’t do much. Forget about playing golf at the highest level - I couldn’t get out of bed. 'I was certainly doubtful at that point. Am I going to be pain-free? Am I actually going to be able to do this again where I can get out of bed and play with my kids and play golf? 'But after I had the procedure it was immediate relief and just a matter of getting through that pain part. But it wasn’t the shocking or debilitating pain - it was just pain from the surgery, the incision.'

"Santi Cazorla became the latest footballer to commemorate his FA Cup moment by nabbing one of the pitchside photographer's cameras to capture the special occasion. In the aftermath of Arsenal's dramatic 3-2 victory against Hull City at Wembley, the Spanish playmaker - who scored a stunning free-kick to spark the Gunners' comeback - sneakily borrowed Back Page Image's Kieran McManus' lens to snap a few shots of the celebrations. The 29-year-old, wearing an Arsenal scarf wrapped around his head, ignored the temptation for yet another footballer selfie, to take a picture of match winner Aaron Ramsey striking a victory pose with Tomas Rosicky. Through the looking glass: Santo Cazorla borrows Sportsmail photographer's camera at Wembley . Smile! The Spanish playmaker marked the occasion of Arsenal's win by snapping the celebrations . Final shot: Cazorla captured goal hero Aaron Ramsey (L) and Tomas Rosicky after the Gunners' 3-2 comeback win . McManus was unaware that Cazorla had used his camera until afterwards. He said: 'After photographing Arsenal lift the trophy and celebrate with their fans I went to collect my remote camera from behind the goal and had realised it had been moved. 'Wondering why, I looked back through the images on the memory card to see if I'd captured any of the goals when I realised that somebody had picked it up and used it to photograph some of the Arsenal players celebrating. 'It wasn't until I got back into the photographers room that somebody told me that it was in fact Santi Cazorla who had turned from goalscorer to photographer! Although the pictures are bit soft I think for his first effort he's done ok!' The photographer's boss, Javier Garcia MD of Back Page Images, remarked: 'Players picking up cameras from behind the goal to take images of their team-mates after winning important matches at Wembley has become almost as commonplace as selfies, but they are still intriguing images as it gives you an insight into how they might approach photography were the tables ever turned.' 'For the majority of the season, interaction between players and photographers on match-days is almost non-existent yet they all know we are there waiting to capture thepositive, negative, quirky and spectacular moments, so it is fascinating to see what they produce. 'Although Cazorla's images won't win any photographic awards, his attempts to photograph his team mates are probably better than Kieran's attempts at scoring from long-range free kicks in a Cup Final!' But, this isn't the first time that a player has made use of a photographer's cameras. At the Wembley semi-final, Hull winger Ahmed Elmohamady also stepped behind the lens. After his side beat . League One's Sheffield United, Elmohamady took Sportsmail's very own award-winning snapper Graham Chadwick's unit from behind the goal and . began clicking away. The final shots are perhaps less composed than Cazorla's efforts, but still likely to make his own personal photo album. Perfect view: Chadwick's remote camera was behind the goal to get up close and personal action shots . Crowd shot: But our snapper got more than he bargained for has the Egyptian winger took over . On our way (back) to Wembley! Elmohamady's best effort is the now ubiquitous footballer's mass selfie . However, the most memorable act of camera theft must be Jamaican sprint legend Usain Bolt's typically showman celebration after wining gold at the 2012 London Olympics. After crossing the finishing line ahead of compatriots Yohan Blake and Warren Weir, the 25-year-old . dropped to the track and performed press-ups, before borrowing a . photographer camera to take souvenir snapshots of the occasion. We suspect the final shots were taken for 'express' development. Jamaican me smile: Usain Bolt also used a photographer's camera after his gold winning sprint at London 2012 . Watch the birdie!

"A dripping wet mystery woman buried her head in the sand in a bizarre apparent protest at Bondi beach in front of baffled onlookers including life guards from the Bondi Rescue TV show. The woman first came to attention when, looking tired and emotional and dripping wet in a red cocktail dress, she dropped to her knees just behind a lifeguard sitting on a quad bike on the iconic beach and started digging a hole. The unidentified woman went swimming in a red dress before collapsing on the sand . She dropped to her knees, clawed a hole in the sand and proceeded to bury her head just behind a Bondi life guard . Trent 'Maxi' Maxwell, one of the stars of Bondi Rescue TV show, witnessed the woman's bizarre behaviour . The woman then began brandishing a small reading 'NO GAS', waving it in the air in front of the life guard before wandering off along the Bondi esplanade. The life guard was Trent 'Maxi' Maxwell, one of the stars of the popular TV show Bondi Rescue, who was nonplussed by the episode. She appeared to be protesting the use of Coal Seam Gas, a naturally occurring substance which can only be accessed through mining. The woman was not deemed to be a threat to the public, and no police action was taken. A spokesperson for Waverley Council said the woman did not cause any trouble so there was no issue. Maxwell, who has been with the Bondi Rescue team for the past five years, said it was far from the strangest scene he has scene on the beach, a drawcard for tourists and partygoers from around the world. He said his most memorable moment was a double rescue that happened just in time to save the pair of struggling swimmers. The Bondi Rescue team rescue over 5000 members of the public every summer, and deal with other situations including lost children, thieves, drunk revelers, and shark scares. The woman was holding a yellow sign which read 'NO GAS' She brandished the sign at passersby, in full view of lifeguard Maxi in the team's beach vehicle .

"A neglectful family life and the sounds of daily domestic abuse soon led Ben Smith into a downward spiral of self-harm. The New Zealand man was mistreated by his step-father for as long as he could remember, while his mother remained powerless against the man who beat her behind closed doors. 'There were times when it was late at night and I'd be woken up because of screaming, I could hear him beating my mum in the lounge,' Ben told the New Zealand Herald. Ben Smith, from New Zealand, was bullied by his step-father and neglected by his mother, eventually leading him to self-harm . 'I just felt cowardice, there was nothing I could do about it.' Only a teenager at the time, Ben sought to find affection in other places and became dependant on relationships. It was when he was between relationships, halfway through year 10, that he turned to self-harm after seeing examples in blog posts. Clearly deep in depression, Ben secluded himself to his room and began to cut himself regularly with blades where he hoped no one would notice the scars. 'It was in a period between relationships. I wasn't getting any affection there, I wasn't getting any affection at home, and I felt like I had no feelings, so with self-harm I felt pain,' Ben told the New Zealand Herald. His life was turned around however after a confrontation with his mother. 'I was just sick of the way I was treated. I said like, 'Mum you have to either get rid of him or me.' And she said, 'He gets home in about two hours, you'd better be gone by then,' he said. Since that day, Ben has barely looked back. He moved in with his maternal grandmother after tracking her down and has since started an audio engineering course. Although he's had to temporarily leave the course behind and move on to full time work due to his grandfather being diagnosed with cancer, Ben leads a far happier life.","Ben Smith was bullied by his stepfather and often heard him violently abusing his mother when he was growing up .

"FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce would be in favour of re-running the vote for the 2022 World Cup if allegations that widespread corruption was involved in the Qatar bid were proven. The Sunday Times has claimed that it had received 'hundreds of millions' of documents which allegedly revealed that disgraced former FIFA executive committee member Mohamed Bin Hammam had made payments to football officials in return for votes for Qatar. Boyce, who was not on the executive committee on the world governing body at the time of the vote, said FIFA's chief investigator Michael Garcia, who is already looking into allegations of corruption, would have to widen his investigation. Support: FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce (left) says he would be in favour of a re-vote should the corruption allegations be proven . Boyce told Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme: 'As a member currently of the FIFA executive committee, we feel that any evidence whatsoever that people involved were bribed to do a certain vote, all that evidence should go to Michael Garcia, whom FIFA have given full authority to, and let's await the report that comes back from Garcia. 'If Garcia's report comes up and his recommendations are that wrongdoing happened for that vote for the 2022 World Cup, I certainly as a member of the executive co would have absolutely no problem whatsoever if the recommendation was for a re-vote. 'If Garcia comes up with concrete evidence and concrete evidence is given to the executive committee and to FIFA then it has to be looked at very seriously at that time, there's no doubt about that.' Vice-president: Boyce took up his current role with FIFA in 2011 . Boyce, who said he had not had the chance to read the Sunday Times report, feels Garcia's investigation should not be hurried. He said: 'The man has got to be given full control to do that investigation thoroughly and if it takes more time to do that investigation thoroughly so be it. 'I have not met Garcia, but I'm told he's a man of the very, very highest calibre and I'm told he's someone who will not shirk the responsibilities that he has been given. I certainly hope that's going to be the situation.' Boyce pointed out that 50 percent of the executive committee members at the time of the 2022 vote had since left the governing body. The Northern Irishman also insisted FIFA president Sepp Blatter's position should not be called into question by the allegations. Trust: Boyce gave his support to FIFA president Sepp Blatter (left) and said his position shouldn't be questioned . Support: Gary Lineker shows his support a re-vote and for Australia's World Cup bid . He said: 'From the day that I became a member of the executive committee and from the day that Sepp Blatter announced that he wanted to see complete and utter reforms carried out by FIFA, he has led these investigations and he has led a lot of the reforms that were badly needed at FIFA that are now being carried out. 'There is no suggestion whatsoever that he was involved in any wrongdoing. ""When Garcia's report comes back to him, as president of FIFA he has to give leadership. 'There are people in authority who are not aware of things that go on regarding other individuals and if he personally wasn't involved in this I don't think there's any reason whatsoever for him to resign. 'He is still the president of FIFA and I'm sure he, like the rest of the decent people and the people who are involved in FIFA, are awaiting with great interest Mr Garcia's report.' Former England footballer Gary Lineker tweeted this morning that he believed that FIFA should hold another vote. Claims: The Sunday Times claims to have documents that prove Mohamed bin Hammam made payments to officials to get support for Qatar's successful World Cup bid . Hosts: Qatar held off competition from Australia to win the rights to host the 2022 World Cup . Rivals: Bin Hammam (right) tried to run against Sepp Blatter (left) for FIFA president but withdrew following allegations of bribery . Under a front-page headline of 'Plot to buy the World Cup,' The Sunday Times alleges . that Mohamed Bin Hammam, a Qatari who used to be a FIFA vice president, . was lobbying on his country's behalf ahead of the vote in December . 2010. The newspaper alleges that Bin Hammam made dozens of payments to top football officials in Africa as well as Jack Warner and Reynald Temarii, former FIFA executive committee members for CONCACAF and Oceania. The allegations come less than two weeks before the start of the World Cup in Brazil and bring fresh scrutiny on the 2010 vote, which awarded football's biggest tournament to the tiny desert state and currently is under investigation by FIFA's independent ethics prosecutor. The Sunday Times said that Bin Hamman declined to respond to the allegations and that members of Qatar's bid committee denied any link to the former FIFA official, saying he played no secret role in their campaign. Bribes: Former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner (left) and Bin Hammam (right) faced allegations of bribery surrounding the 2011 FIFA presidential elections . FIFA: Bin Hammam (left) and Blatter (right) at Doha airport in 2010 . Pressure: FIFA has come under scrutiny since awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar . Qatari organizers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Bin . Hammam, one of the most controversial figures in FIFA's recent history, . is no longer a committee member of world football's governing body . after being caught up in a corruption scandal surrounding his failed . campaign for its presidency in 2011. The Sunday Times is alleging, however, that he exploited his position at the heart of FIFA when he was an executive committee member to help to secure votes from key members of its 24-man ruling committee that helped Qatar win the right to host the World Cup. Qatar defeated bids from the United States, Japan, South Korea and Australia. According to the newspaper, Bin Hammam used 10 slush funds controlled by his private company and cash handouts to make dozens of payments of up to $200,000 into accounts controlled by the presidents of 30 African football associations who influenced how the continent's four executive members would vote. He also allegedly hosted lavish junkets for these African officials at which he handed out almost $400,000 in cash. Sepp Blatter at the Messe Conference Centre in Zurich where he announced Qatar would host the World Cup . World Cup? There have been suggestions that a re-vote will be required after these new allegations . The newspaper says the documents show that Bin Hammam paid out at least 305,000 euros ($415,000) in legal and private detective fees for Temarii after he was suspended for telling undercover reporters that he had been offered $12 million for his vote. Bin Hammam's help allowed him to appeal the suspension and prevent his planned replacement from voting for Australia in the vote, the Sunday Times claimed. Bin Hammam is also accused of funneling more than $1.6 million directly into bank accounts controlled by Warner, including $450,000 before the vote. Warner resigned from football duties, including his 28-year membership of FIFA's committee, in June 2011 to avoid investigation in a bribery scandal linked to Bin Hammam's campaign for FIFA president. The Sunday Times also said Bin Hammam paid $800,000 to the Ivory Coast FA, whose executive committee member Jacques Anouma agreed to ""push very hard the bid of Qatar,"" and signed off on two payments of $400,000 each to the federations of two other voters.","Allegations that Mohamed Bin Hamman was lobbying for of his country .

"Thanks to Glenn Beck, the prospectus for Disneyland has been released to the public for the first time ever, after the polarizing television and radio host won them in an auction earlier this year. The plans, which Walt Disney and his brother Roy used to raise the $17 million required to build the park, show a park that looks remarkably similar to the one today. Drawn in 1953, two years before the park opened in Anaheim, California, in 1955, the map lays out popular attraction such as Tomorrowland, Main Street and Sleeping Beauty's castle.

Of course, not all of Disney's ideas for the park  came to fruition. The Kaiser Aluminum Hall of Fame was a corporate-sponsored attraction that would show how aluminum was made, and eventually became part of Tomorrowland when the park opened in July of 1955. Lilliputian Land, which was inspired by Gulliver's Travels, would have featured 9-inch-tall singing and dancing mechanical people living in a miniature American town. The main attractions of this land would have been a ride on a 17-inch-tall locomotive and a barge that took visitors though the canals of the world, according to pages released on Boing Boing.

"Amanda Bynes was seen chain smoking, pulling up her shirt and even taking off her bra on the busy streets of New York City moments before  allegedly shoplifting earlier today. TMZ claims the troubled 28-year-old actress was 'caught by security' at Barneys New York on Madison Avenue after she left the store with a $200 hat she did not pay for. Even though staff at the luxury department store were said to have called police, the What A Girl Wants star was not taken into custody and was let go after being questioned. Scroll down for video . Odd behavior: Amanda Bynes (above) was at it again today in NYC, this time standing alone on a busy block chain smoking broken cigarettes and flashing passersby . It gets worse: Then she just took her bra off . Scene of the (maybe) crime: Bynes was photographed browsing at the midtown store (above) before the reported incident occurred . She did however agree to never return to the store again. According to sources, the LA native was 'nabbed by security guards  after she tried to leave without paying.' Law enforcement sources claim 'she put on a $200 hat and walked out of the store and security nabbed her outside.' Witnesses have accused the star of 'acting crazy.' Four NYPD officers were claimed to have 'arrived on scene to question her.' Strange days: Inside the store, Bynes looked at jewelry by herself, while adjusting the neck of her shirt repeatedly and protecting her eyes from the harsh glare of retail store lighting . All cut up: The actress also took off her sunglasses while inside for just a second, showing the Band-Aid that has been covering her face this past week to cover an unknown injury . Adding more drama to the already bizarre incident, Bynes said she wanted to buy the hat, and was going to get her wallet out of the car but got flustered because a fan was snapping pictures of her in the store.

"Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen insists he wants to stay at White Hart Lane this summer, regardless of who the club appoints as manager. The Spurs centre back has been linked with a host of clubs following Tottenham's failure to qualify for the Champions League, with reports claiming the Belgian international would ask to leave the club had Tim Sherwood been retained as manager. Despite claiming he would wait for a new manager to be appointed before deciding his future, it now appears Vertonghen is keen to remain in north London. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Vertonghen take part in charades for Red Nose Day . Staying put: Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen insists he is happy at White Hart Lane and wants to stay . 'I’ve got a couple more years at Tottenham and I’m happy, and I want to stay there, so it doesn’t matter who the manager will be,' Vertonghen told Sky Sports. There is a chance the former Ajax man may be reunited with old boss Frank De Boer, who he played under at the Amsterdam Arena and remains one of the favourites to take the Tottenham hotseat along with Southampton manager Mauricio Pochettino. Asked about the possibility of playing under the former Dutch international once again, Vertonghen said: 'He (de Boer) is a good manager but there are other good managers as well so, again, the chairman will make a good decision.' However, with the World Cup set to commence in three weeks time, Vertonghen is keen to do well for his country rather than see the tournament as an opportunity to impress fellow suitors on the global stage. 'I don’t think that is one for us because we all play for nice teams already and we just want to do something nice for Belgium, not for ourselves.'

"UKIP yesterday pledged to fast-track British passport holders through airport customs in their own queue. Nigel Farage said he wanted one queue for Britons and ‘one line for the rest of the world’ to help weed out illegal immigrants. Giving his speech at the party’s conference, he claimed Ukip was ‘parking its tanks’ on Labour’s lawn and now threatened ‘the entire British political class’. Scroll down for video . Man of the people: Nigel Farage talks to workmen over breakfast at a Doncaster cafe yesterday . UKIP leader Nigel Farage delivered his key note speech during the party's annual conference in Doncaster . Mr Farage told supporters  the party was not only a threat to the Tories but 'to the entire British political class' Mr Farage was loudly cheered by UKIP supporters throughout his speech as he attacked Labour and the Tories . He promised to take his fight to Labour’s heartlands as Ukip unveiled a package of policies to broaden the party’s appeal. Mr Farage said Ukip was attracting vast chunks of Labour’s traditional working-class voters as well as Tories. He told supporters: ‘This party is not about Left and Right, this party is about right and wrong.’ Tougher border controls were promised, with more officials and health checks on migrants before they are allowed to enter the UK. He also said Ukip would: . Speaking in Doncaster, where one of the local MPs is Labour leader Ed Miliband, Mr Farage said Ukip was targeting blue-collar voters as well as its traditional Right-wing supporters. Mr Farage lambasted the 'one party state' which exists in many towns and cities in many northern regions . Mr Farage said Labour needed to be tackled because it was too 'complacent' and had failed to protect children from sex abuse in Rotherham. He said the crimes had come about as a ‘direct result’ of Labour policies . Mr Farage's German wife Kirsten (pictured), who is rarely seen in public, attended the Doncaster conference . He said the party was making major inroads into Labour support in the Midlands, the North and across Wales. He also said Labour’s handling of the child-abuse scandal in Rotherham was ‘one of the most shocking things I have seen in my lifetime in this country’. The main battleground for the general election would be open-door immigration, he said, warning: ‘We are borderless Britain.’ Ukip immigration spokesman Steven Woolfe detailed proposals for an Australian-style, points-based migration system and a cap of 50,000 people a year allowed in. An extra 2,500 front-line staff would also work at ports and airports under the proposals. Mr Woolf told the conference: ‘If the Government can find the technology to listen in on all our phone calls it must be technically possible to identify UK citizens when they return home. He also hit out at the proposed bombing campaign against ISIS and said it would make British streets unsafe . In his set-piece conference speech, the UKIP leader told cheering supporters at Doncaster Racecourse that the party was not only a threat to the Tories but 'to the entire British political class', adding: 'I'll drink to that' Expensive handbags, shoes and sports cars would be subjected to a luxury goods tax under Ukip plans. The levy, dubbed the ‘Wag tax’, would be applied to shoes costing more than £200, handbags over £1,000 and cars worth more than £50,000. Economic spokesman Patrick O’Flynn told the party’s conference it ‘makes no sense’ that families buying cheaper goods pay the same amount of tax as those splashing out, and proposed raising VAT to 25 per cent on luxury items. He pledged to scrap a loophole that allows visitors from outside the EU to claim back VAT on shopping sprees, and the party also heard plans to cut the tax rate from 40p to 35p for those earning between £42,000 and £55,000. Mr Farage said the plans recognised the fall in living standards for ‘millions of people’. ‘Ukip would make this happen. It would do so by introducing priority entry points at all borders for UK passport holders. One line for British passport holders. One line for the rest of the world.’ He said the UK Borders staff were the ‘visible protectors of our nation’ and added: ‘For too long these hard-working public servants have been put under too much pressure by successive governments. 'They need our support. So today I am announcing that, Ukip’s general election manifesto will include a provision to increase front-line staff and search teams at UK Border entry points by an 2,500 officers.’ At present there are separate lines at UK airports for non-EU and EU, including British, citizens. Mr Farage said polls showed Ukip no longer posed a threat ‘just to the Conservative Party’. He added: ‘In our target seats next year in the by-elections and in the general election, if you vote Ukip you will get Ukip. The UKIP leader also unveiled two populist policies designed to win support from ordinary voters – including a ‘Wag Tax’ on luxury goods and a British-only queue at immigration controls . Mr Farage remained rather animated throughout his speech to delegates at the UKIP annual conference . Mr Farage also told the UKIP audience that the party was no longer a threat only to the Conservative party . 'If we get this right and win enough seats in what is going to be a tight general election, we could even say to people, “Vote Ukip to hold the balance of power”. ‘And if we hold the balance of power there won’t just be a referendum on our EU membership, there will be a culture change in British politics. 'It will be a kind of politics that represents ordinary men and women.’ Mr Farage, 50, also revealed he would step down as Ukip leader within a decade and expects to be replaced by a woman. He pledged to resign if the party gets no MPs at the election, and suggested former Tory MP Douglas Carswell could become joint leader if he wins the by-election next month in Clacton, Essex, caused by his defection in August. Mr Farage said: ‘If we don’t get any MPs I’ll be gone by midnight the next day. I think it is more likely that Ukip will be led by a woman next than any other party.’ Mr Farage told the crowd: ‘Why are we in Doncaster? Well, it’s quite simple – because Ed Miliband is one of the town’s MPs and we want to signal to the world that we are now parking our tanks on the Labour party lawn' The UKIP party conference at Doncaster Racecourse sold a host of speciality products, including this 'Let's Rock Politics' stick of rock . The party poked fun at the 'Westminster clowns' running the country in Parliament, including pro-European MP Ken Clarke . The Prime Minister  was a popular figure of fun on the sidelines of the conference at Doncaster Racecourse . Oops! Bigwig changes her tune to keep Nigel sweet . A senior Ukip politician was forced into an embarrassing U-turn live on television yesterday after she was told by a reporter that she was contradicting Nigel Farage. Deputy chairman Suzanne Evans, pictured, explained why she backed air strikes in Iraq in an interview on the BBC. But when she was told that Mr Farage was against the military action, she backtracked. Deputy chairman Suzanne Evans (pictured) was explaining why she backed air strikes in Iraq in an interview on the BBC when she suddenly backtracked after being told that Mr Farage was against the military action . Seconds after saying the intervention by the British was ‘important’, she then questioned if it was ‘really necessary’. In the interview, BBC reporter Robin Brant asked Mrs Evans: ‘On the issue of the day, Nigel Farage said it’s time to “wait”. He does not support military action, do you agree with him on that?’ She replied: ‘I think he supports the air strikes and I think it’s important. This is a dangerous barbaric death cult that we’ve got here. We have to deal with it. ‘This is something now that’s affecting British people. We have to take some kind of action.’ Mr Brant interrupted her to say: ‘He said he wouldn’t support the vote for these air strikes in Parliament. He’s said that repeatedly this morning – he doesn’t support the air strikes.’ Nigel Farage received loud cheers and signs of support from the crowd at the conference in Doncaster . Mrs Evans, who will contest the Shrewsbury seat in next year’s election, responded: ‘OK fine, perhaps I haven’t caught up with that. ‘I think the interesting thing here is a question to be asked about why Britain is participating in this. ‘America is there, we’ve got the five Arab nations that are taking part as well. Is British intervention really necessary? That’s a question we need to ask.’","Nigel Farage said he wants one queue for Britons and one for 'rest of world'

"It's back! Starbucks has decided to bring back its beloved Eggnog Latte after fans were furious over its disappearance from the holiday menu . Starbucks has decided to bring back its Eggnog Latte, following a huge outcry from customers when the company announced it was discontinuing the beverage. The drink, which the brand had been selling seasonally since 1986, was cut to 'simplify' its holiday menu, according to USA Today. 'We made a mistake,' said Starbucks spokeswoman Linda Mills. 'We are very sorry.' Ms Mills said she expects the drink to be back in stores sometime during the week of November 17. 'It's a fairly complex product to bring back,' she said. 'We have to be able to source the eggnog itself.' The brand is also putting Gingerbread Lattes back on the menus at Pacific Northwest, where they were cut. Once fans realized in early November that Eggnog Lattes weren't on the holiday menu, hundreds took to Twitter to voice their anger. One user, @saucypeeps, said, 'I tolerated your Pumpkin Spice Latte, but if you don't bring back the Eggnog Latte, I will quit you.' Another user, @emmawingfield, said upon finding out, 'There goes my holiday cheer.' And one Twitter user, @jeffybum, went as far as to post a picture (perhaps a selfie) of an exasperated-looking man with the text, 'Where's my eggnog latte?!' printed over it. Unhappy camper!

'This week you lit My Starbucks Idea up and let us know through email, tweets, and phone calls that these drinks, served up in the iconic red Starbucks cup, are an indispensable part of your holiday traditions,' she wrote. 'These messages were emotional, personal. They told of times connecting with loved ones over an Eggnog Latte, how the Eggnog Latte became a tradition. We're honored you care so much—and chagrined we risked dimming your holiday brightness, even a little.' Dozens of readers showed their gratitude in the comments section of the post. One user proclaimed the beverage's return 'a Christmas miracle' while another said, 'Christmas never would be the same without my Eggnog Latte!' Some customers still weren't happy, however. 'Your decision to not put them on the menu this year got me motivated to SCREW YOU,' wrote the commenter. 'I bought a Nespresso machine and my first gallon of eggnog today to keep the tradition alive! Cost Plus also sells a nice Gingerbread Syrup. So this year I just won't be coming back, YOU LOST ME!'

"eBay has announced plans to turn online payments giant PayPaul into a separate company, months after being told to do so by activist investor Carl Icahn. The online marketplace said the spin-off, set for the second half of 2015, was decided because the two giant internet businesses are now 'less advantageous' packaged together. eBay has owned PayPal, which is growing rapidly, since 2002 when it bought out what was then a public company. PayPal now accounts for around 40 per cent of eBay's total revenue. Announcement: eBay CEO John Donahoe, left, announced the move this morning. It was first suggested by investor Carl Icahn (right), who reportedly made $180million when the stock jumped after the news hit markets . Icahn, an activist investor and one of the richest men in America, put pressure on eBay to separate out PayPal in April - but was firmly rebuffed by CEO John Donahoe, until the u-turn today. eBay's stock price climbed more than 10 per cent in response to the news, reportedly making Icahn $180million richer in a single move. Donahoe said the move was a result of 'a thorough strategic review' rather than a simple acceptance of Icahn's demands. He said: 'A thorough strategic review with our board shows thatkeeping eBay and PayPal together beyond 2015 clearly becomes less advantageous to each business strategically and competitively.' Separation: eBay announced today it will spin off PayPal into a separate business, having owned it for 12 years. Pictured are the company's headquarters in San Jose, California . According to Business Insider, Icahn, who owns 2.48per cent of eBay, made $180million on his 30million eBay shares as their price jumped $6 each following the announcement. After the tax-free spinoff to shareholders, the new eBay . will be headed by Devin Wenig, president of eBay Marketplaces . and former head of the Markets division of Thomson Reuters Corp . . American Express Co executive Dan Schulman joins . PayPal immediately as president and CEO of PayPal after the . spinoff, the company said. Donahoe and Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan will oversee . the separation and serve on the boards of both companies. Giant: PayPal, the online payments service, now accounts for around 40 per cent of eBay's revenue . PayPal was founded in the late 1990s and went public in . 2002. It was acquired by eBay soon afterward for $1.5billion. The PayPal business faces competition from Google Inc's Google Wallet and a number of other vendors. Apple Inc is scheduled to enter the online payments market next month with its newly unveiled service, Apple Pay. 'On PayPal, investors will still contemplate the risk of PayPal directly competing with Apple Pay and Google Wallet, which will likely add some uncertainty to PayPal's standalone valuation,' PiperJaffray analysts said.

"We’ve had treadmill desks and even human hamster wheels, each designed to stop us sitting for hours on end. But the latest design, dubbed Dynamic Chair, turns the user’s whole body into a mouse so even when they’re sat down, they’re still moving. Sensors built into the exoskeleton design recognise pressure and movements, which are then used to control an on-screen pointer. The Dynamic Chair (pictured) was created by designer Govert Flint from Eindhoven University. Programmer Sami Sabik then translated these physical movements into on-screen ones. Sensors in the seat detect pressure, range of movements and angles and moving the hips, for example, scrolls through pages . The Dynamic Chair was created by designer Govert Flint from Eindhoven University, with help from programmer Sami Sabik. It was designed and built for Mr Flint’s ‘Creatures with Creations’ research project. ‘Although our bodies are evolved to move, we tend to design objects based on monofunctional use and posture,’ explained Mr Flint. Sensors in the seat detect pressure and the angle of the body, while accelerometers measure and track the movement of the user’s legs. These movements are interpreted digitally, using software created by Mr Sabik, and are translated into movements on screen. For example, moving the hips and lowering the body’s centre of gravity, for example, scrolls through pages and moves the mouse around the screen.

"Jonny Wilkinson is an extremely calm, reserved and quiet individual - although not in the changing room it appears! The ex-England fly half, who dropped the winning goal in the 2003 World Cup final, claimed both the Heineken Cup and the Top 14 titles with Toulon last season before retiring. And, in a promotional video ahead of the release of a DVD showcasing the French side's magnificent double-winning season, Wilkinson is seen giving a passionate - and expletive-laden - team talk during half-time of the Top 14 semi-final against Racing Metro at Stade Pierre-Mauroy.

"NatWest and Royal Bank of Scotland customers have taken to Twitter to vent their frustration after being left unable to withdraw cash from ATMs today. Users bombarded the online help service with questions after being given a message reading 'service unavailable' at cash points. A spokesman for the RBS Group, which owns NatWest, RBS and Ulster Bank, says the issue started at around 10.40am and lasted for three hours, but should now be fixed. Scroll down for video . NatWest and RBS customers have reported being unable to withdraw cash from ATMs this afternoon, although the banks say cards should work in their own machines . The spokesman said: 'Between around 10.40am and 13.15pm today, some of our customers were unable to use other banks' ATMs. This has now been resolved. 'Throughout this time customers were able to use RBS, NatWest and Ulster bank ATMs. We apologise for the inconvenience caused.' The issue affected the Link network which connects around 65,000 cash machines in the UK. Around 3,000 of those are likely to have been NatWest machines, meaning customers were locked out of around 62,000 ATMs. Twitter user Lyndsey White messaged NatWest saying: 'I'm in hospital with my son who really sick and I can't even use my card, thanks a lot I will definitely be changing banks.' Adam Redman added: '""Natwest customers can't withdraw cash from cash machines."" How many times is this going to happen! Need to change my bank.' The new problem is just the latest in a series of IT meltdowns for the RBS Group, stretching back to 2012 when customers were left unable to use their accounts for three days . The latest meltdown echoes the infamous 'cyber Monday' crash in December last year, when customers were unable to use their cards on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Another technical fault hit the RBS Group, which owns RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank, in 2012 meaning payments were not registered for three days. The then-boss of the group, Stephen Hester, said a failed software update was to blame for the glitch which left people unable to pay bills.","NatWest and RBS customers left unable to withdraw cash from ATMs .

"A news report on Thursday that revealed secret communications between President Barack Obama and Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has a top Republican lawmaker accusing Obama of playing 'footsie' with the 'enemy' just as the deadline for a nuclear deal with the country approaches. According to the Wall Street Journal, Obama sent Khamenei a letter last month assuring him that airstrikes about ISIS in the country were not intended to undermine Iranian ally and Syrian President Bashar al Assad. The letter allegedly indicated that the U.S. may be willing to work with Iran in the fight against radical Islamic militants ravaging the region if it satisfied a Nov. 24 deadline to come to an agreement with negotiators about its nuclear program. Scroll down for video . Arizona Sen. John McCain, pictured here yesterday at a Veteran's Day event,  accused President Barack Obama on Thursday of playing 'footsie' with the 'enemy' when he sent Iran's supreme leader a letter indicating a willingness on behalf of the U.S. to work more closely with the country in the fight against ISIS if it agreed to proposed regulations on its nuclear program . The Journal claims this is the fourth time Obama has written the leader of the Middle Eastern country since 2009 to offer a truce of sorts. The White House spokesman refused on Thursday to comment on the report, stating that he is 'not in a position to discuss private correspondence between the President and any world leader.' However, 'I can tell you that the policy that the President and his administration have articulated about Iran remains unchanged,' he told reporters. 'The United States will not cooperate militarily with Iran [in the campaign against ISIS.] We won't share intelligence with them,' he said. 'But their interests in this outcome is something that's been widely commented upon and something on a couple of occasions has been discussed on the sidelines of other conversations,' he noted. National Security Advisor Susan Rice also refused to confirm the letter to reporters on Friday nor did she deny that it was sent. As I have said 'repeatedly in public,' as have other administration officials, 'we are in no way' engaged 'in any military coordination' with Iran as it regards to ISIL, she said, using an alternative name for ISIS. Rice said the U.S. takes eliminating the threat from ISIS seriously, 'but we are not doing so in coordination with the government of Iran.' She also asserted that 'there is no linkage' between the administration's military actions against ISIS and the Iran nuclear plan. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a constant critic of the Obama administration's foreign policy, had blasted the president on Thursday for putting rebels of the Syrian government being trained by the U.S. to fight ISIS in harm's way by promising Iran that Assad is not under siege. 'Now  it is really an immoral situation, and I don’t use that word lightly,' McCain, the ranking member of the Senate's committee on Armed Services, told MSNBC on Thursday. 'They are now going to train Syrians to go in and fight against ISIS and at the same time allowing Bashar Assad to slaughter them with barrel bombs and air attacks and other attacks,' he contended. 'Every time we strike ISIS, then Bashar Assad steps up his attacks on the Free Syrian Army.' Continuing, McCain said, 'As I say, it’s immoral, yet somehow we are playing footsie with the Iranians and hope they will somehow have an effect on ISIS.' President Barack Obama, right, talks to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell before the start of a Cabinet Meeting in the Cabinet Room at the White House on Friday. Obama will meet next with GOP leaders, who will undoubtedly chastize him over the letter to Iran . In a joint statement with fellow Armed Services committee member and close Senate ally Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, McCain called Obama's overtures to Iran 'outrageous.' 'This is the same Iranian regime that has been complicit in the rise of ISIS by pushing a violent sectarian agenda throughout the Middle East --backing radical Shia militias and politicians in Iraq, doing everything in its power to aid the killing machine of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, arming Hamas terrorists with advanced rockets in Gaza, and orchestrating Hezbollah's dispatch of thousands of fighters from Lebanon into Syria,' the GOP duo said. Iran, they said, 'cares more about trying to weaken America and push us out of the Middle East than cooperating with us.' Going down this path will 'harm U.S. national security interests, as well as our relationships with our closest regional allies and partners, in pursuit of the illusory goal of rapprochement with the current Iranian leadership,' they argued. 'The consequences of this ill-conceived bargain would destroy the Syrians' last best chance to live in freedom from the brutal Assad regime.' House Speaker John Boehner also expressed skepticism that any good would come of Obama's outreach to Khamenei. 'I don’t trust the Iranians, I don’t think we need to bring them into this,' Boehner said on Thursday. 'I would hope that the negotiations that are under way are serious negotiations, but I have my doubts,' the GOP leader, who is scheduled to meet with Obama about a number of issues this afternoon, said. Outgoing GOP legislator and current House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers told MSNBC on Friday that Obama's letter was unhelpful to the overall U.S. strategy in the region. 'I can tell you that it is causing real problems with our Sunni Arab League partners in the fight against ISIS,' Rogers said, according to Politico. 'It’s really concerning.' The Michigan congressman suggested that Iran may have leaked the letter to gain the upper hand in negotiations. 'Just because the enemy of your enemy sometimes wants to help you, that doesn’t mean they’re still not your adversary,' he said. Putting it bluntly, a senior congressional source who spoke to Fox News, said of Obama's back channeling with Iran: 'This f***s up everything.' From left-right at the Obama Cabinet meeting  are Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell, Obama, Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, and Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker. Obama gave brief remarks before the meeting to reporters before reporters were ushered out . The clock on Obama's efforts to talk Iran into signing the nuclear deal is ticking as Republicans, who favor greater sanctions on the country, are now slated to take control of both chambers of the legislative branch in the new year. Bipartisan legislation sponsored by Mark Kirk of Illinois, a Republican, and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, a Democrat, could go into effect as soon as January. 'The best way to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is to quickly pass the bipartisan Menendez-Kirk legislation—not to give the Iranians more time to build a bomb,' Kirk said Wednesday, per the Journal. On Thursday McCain said that the U.S. has 'already given away the store by allowing them the right to enrich and not putting in check both the development of warheads and the means to deliver them.' McCain said any efforts by the president to build a better relationship with the country  that is 'spreading disorder and unrest throughout the region ' is misguided. 'They are not our friend. They are our enemy. Are we are treating them as somebody that we can continue to do business with,' he said. 'This is a foreign policy that is off the rails.' Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen came to his party leader's defense on Friday, saying the letter was 'not outrageous' as McCain and Graham had stated. 'Presidents use backchannels all the time,' he told CNN. 'Look, you don’t have to trust Iran to understand that the United States and Iran do have a common interest in trying to defeat ISIS and I thought Sen. McCain and Sen. Graham wanted to do everything possible to defeat ISIS,' he said, goading the GOP senators.","President Barack Obama reportedly sent Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei a letter last month .

"The story of Lady Godiva’s naked ride through the streets of Coventry has been a cornerstone of British folklore for 1,000 years. But now a Belgian chocolate manufacturer has sparked outrage by claiming it has exclusive rights to both her name and the famous image of her on top of a horse. The situation was exposed when lawyers acting for the confectionery giant fired a warning letter to a pub called The Lady Godiva last week, warning that it was infringing on its ‘intellectual property’. Owner Glen Simons was given a 90-day ultimatum to change his bar’s name and remove all references to the 11th Century noblewoman, whose daring protest at oppressive taxes has become the stuff of legend. Scroll down for video . A Belgian chocolate manufacturer has sparked outrage by claiming it has exclusive rights to both the name and image of Lady Godiva on top of a horse (above, Maureen O'Hara in 1955 film Lady Godiva of Coventry) Historians reacted with shock that her name had been allowed to fall into the hands of a foreign firm without anyone apparently noticing. Colin Walker, vice-chairman of the Coventry Society, said: ‘This is an absolute travesty. No one should be allowed to hijack the identity of historical figures for their own commercial interests. ‘When I was in Belgium recently I thought it was a bit of a cheek that they were selling chocolates with Lady Godiva on the box, but I never thought it would come to this. ‘If the Belgians try to enforce this in Coventry, there will be angry protests. We are very proud of Lady Godiva, and she is known and loved around the world.’ The Mail on Sunday has discovered that Godiva Chocolatier successfully filed a patent on Lady Godiva’s identity in 2007. It appears on the register of the Intellectual Property Office in London, the official body for trademark applications, alongside several versions of the woman-on-a-horse image. Legal experts said it would have been relatively easy for the company to stake its claim for a fee of about £1,000. It would have no obligation to consult interested parties before going ahead. The Lady Godiva Pub in Geneva - where owner Glen Simons is having a dispute about the name of the pub with Godiva Chocolatiers based in Belgium . Colin Walker, vice-chairman of the Coventry Society, said: ‘This is an absolute travesty. No one should be allowed to hijack the identity of historical figures for their own commercial interests . Mr Simons, who set up his British-themed pub in Geneva seven years ago, was warned that its name might cause ‘confusion’ with the confectioner. But he said: ‘My pub has nothing to do with chocolates so I don’t see how anyone could be confused.’ The 55-year-old, who was born in Britain but moved to Switzerland for family reasons, said he would fight the legal threat in a David-and-Goliath battle. ‘I wanted to name the pub after a woman who was part of England’s heritage and I could think of no one better or more famous than Lady Godiva,’ he added. ‘As well as the sign outside, we’ve got her name engraved on the windows and front door. It would cost a fortune to remove them. My regulars are absolutely furious. I am not going to back down. This has been the Lady Godiva pub for seven years and that’s how it’s going to stay.’ Godiva was the wife of Leofric, Earl of Mercia, and the story goes that she went naked to protest against her husband’s taxes on his tenants. The term Peeping Tom originates from a tailor who was reputedly struck blind after ignoring a decree that no townsfolk should watch her feat. The Belgian brand is actually owned by Turkey’s Ulker Group, which paid more than £500 million for the company in 2007. Managers at its Brussels headquarters refused to disclose how many other Godiva-named businesses had been sent warning letters. Managers at its Brussels headquarters refused to disclose how many other Godiva-named businesses had been sent warning letters . In a statement last night, marketing director Adele Santarelli said: ‘Godiva is one of the world’s most well-known brands with a unique reputation, heritage and name. In addition to our chocolates and the shops that sell them, we also have a growing line of Godiva cafes. Clearly, it is important for us to ensure that consumers are not confused by a place serving food and drink using the Godiva name and imagery when that place has nothing to do with us.’ But this explanation cut no ice with Pru Porretta, who has taken the role of Lady Godiva in annual processions commemorating Coventry’s most celebrated daughter. ‘The Draps family, who founded the Godiva company, came over here to see the parade years ago and fell in love with Lady Godiva,’ she said. ‘They sell their chocolates with a leaflet in the box which is supposed to tell the story but it’s full of mistakes. It’s so sad to hear they are trying to keep the name to themselves. It doesn’t leave a sweet taste in the mouth, does it?’","Confectionery giant's lawyers have sent warning letter to Lady Godiva pub .

She became infected at the same hospital by a Spanish priest repatriated from Africa with the disease as when treated him. The 44-year-old remained undiagnosed for days despite reporting she had a fever, one of the symptoms of Ebola. Reports yesterday suggested that she was still gravely ill but in a serious but stable condition. People were protesting in Madrid again today after the Mrs Romero's pet dog Excalibur was put down after she contracted the disease . People took their own dog's to the protest and hung signs on them with messages such as 'We Are All Excalibur' The protesters were also calling for the resignation of Spanish health minister Ana Mato . Today some Spanish media said that Mrs Romero was now being treated with the drug ZMab. The combination drug includes one of the agents used to make ZMapp, an experimental treatment which has been used on some Ebola sufferers, a number of whom survived. Spain's Ebola crisis comes amid disquiet in the country over how the virus could have spread. Today thousands of people gathered in more than 20 cities throughout Spain to show their solidarity with Mrs Romero and to protest against how Madrid authorities had euthanized her pet dog named Excalibur on Wednesday instead of placing it in quarantine. Some had painted Excalibur's name onto their faces and many carried placards saying ""We are with you Teresa,"" ""You are not alone"" and ""We are all Excalibur,"" and called on Health Minister Ana Mato to resign. Some officials initially deflected blame on to Mrs Romero, seizing on her admission that she may have touched her face with the gloves of her protective suit.

The 47-year-old man arrived in Brazil on September 19 from Guinea, one of three African countries at the heart of an epidemic that has killed more than 4,000 people since March. He went to an emergency room in the southern state of Parana on Thursday complaining of a fever, sore throat and a cough. Although he had only a slightly elevated temperature, the patient was kept in total isolation and transferred to a healthcare facility in Rio de Janeiro early on Friday. The health ministry said the man remains in quarantine and will only receive a clean bill of health following a second exam scheduled to take place on Sunday. Meanwhile officials in the U.S. have begun screening for West African passengers flying into John F Kennedy Airport in New York from countries being ravaged by the Ebola virus.

Customs and Border Protection, speaks during a news conference at JFK Airport announcing additional screening for passengers arriving in America from Ebola hit nations . New screenings: Public health workers are now using contactless thermometers like the one above to screen potential Ebola victims. Pictured is a test taking place in Casablance, Morocco - much closer to the outbreak . As many as 150 travellers per day who arrive from Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea will now be stopped and checked with contactless thermometers in the hope of keeping the disease out of the United States. Anybody who has a fever will be interviewed to see whether they have had contact with an Ebola sufferer, and from there can be quarantined if necessary. The new scheme, which began today, will be expanded over the next week to Newark Liberty airport in New Jersey, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport.

"Liverpool are keen to add Barcelona and Spain forward Pedro to their ranks this summer, as Brendan Rodgers continues to plan for the dual challenge of Premier League and Champions League football next season according to the Daily Mirror. The Reds have already been heavily linked with Southampton's Adam Lallana, although no deal is likely for the England international until after the World Cup. But with Rodgers determined to add as many as five players to his squad he has already turned his attention to strengthening other positions. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pedro Rodriquez scores with stunning bicycle kick in Spain training . In demand: Barcelona and Spain attacker Pedro has emerged as a target for Liverpool . Overhaul: The 26-year-old could be moved on from Camp Nou by new manager Luis Enrique . Pedro, 26, will help Spain defend their position as world champions in Brazil this summer, but faces an uncertain future at club level following the appointment of Luis Enrique as Barcelona manager. Enrique revealed at his official unveiling as Barca boss he will make wholesale changes at the club this summer after a disastrous campaign which ended trophyless. He said: 'The players must know that you cannot let a year pass at Barca. If they are not at the level required then there will be changes. 'We will reinforce the team in the best way possible, to be as competitive as possible. There is a market there - teams ask a lot of money for players. You must manage it all. We will reinforce, maybe in all lines of the team, to have the best players for the club and for me. 'I do not want to talk too much about individuals. Good and important players will stay. We will look at everyone and then see what we do. We do not have to make decisions now. We have time.' Versatile: Pedro offers options as he can play comfortably in any position across the attack . Targets: Rodgers is already hard at work assessing potential Liverpool players for next season . Pedro, who has spent his whole career at Barcelona winning four league titles and two Champions Leagues, would fit perfectly into Liverpool's style of play. Versatile enough to play across all three attacking positions he also fits the bill of the calibre of player that Rodgers has designs on. Following the 4-0 friendly victory over Shamrock Rovers on May 14, the Reds boss said: 'Our criteria that we look for is players with strong technique and football intelligence. 'You'll get some players who are specialists and who need to play in particular positions, but if we can get players in who are multi-functional, and can play in different roles and are multi-dimensional in their work, it sets us up and gives me more options as a coach.' Liverpool will be keen to tie up a deal for the player before the World Cup in order to avoid his value soaring should he perform well. Pedro has scored 14 goals in 37 games for La Roja, and was part of the team that won the World Cup in 2010 and the European Championship in 2012.

"Millions of doses of experimental Ebola vaccines will be ready for use in 2015 but it is not clear if any will work, the World Health Organisation has said. There is currently no proven vaccine against the deadly virus and drug companies have previously avoided investing too heavily in a cure because outbreaks before this year's had been small. Now, the UN health agency has said doses of two experimental Ebola vaccines will be ready for use next year but have warned they are not a 'magic bullet'. Scroll down for video . The World Health Organization says millions of doses of an Ebola vaccine may be ready for distribution next year. Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to find a vaccine for the deadly virus . The two experimental vaccines, produced by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and the Public Health Agency of Canada, are already in safety trials. The GSK vaccine is being tested in Mali, the UK and the US. Research on the Canadian vaccine is also under way in the US with further trials expected to start in Europe and Africa soon. The results are expected in December. After that, trials will move to countries affected by Ebola, probably starting with Liberia. That will allow researchers to assess how effective the vaccine is and what dose is needed to provide protection. Five more experimental vaccines will start being tested in March. However it is not known whether any of these will work against the deadly virus that has already killed at least 4,877 people this year in West Africa. WHO assistant director general Marie-Paule Kieny said: 'Before the end of first half of 2015...we could have available a few hundred thousand doses. That could be 200,000 - it could be less or could be more.' Trials of those two most advanced experimental vaccines are underway, and the initial data is promising, said the WHO's Dr Marie-Paule Kieny . She was speaking after WHO held talks about potential vaccines with health experts, officials from Ebola-affected nations and pharmaceutical firms. WHO believes that up to 1.4 million people could have been affected by 2015 and there are also fears the virus may be used as a weapon of bio-terrorism. 'The vaccine is not the magic bullet. But when ready, they may be a good part of the effort to turn the tide of this epidemic,' Dr Kieny said. If early data from the ongoing tests are promising, larger trials in West Africa would offer the shot to health workers and others at high risk of catching Ebola  as soon as December, she said. Dr Kieny cautioned that a vaccine, when ready, would not be a 'magic bullet' but could be a turning point in the battle against the virus . Bertrand Draguez, medical director for Doctors Without Borders, said: 'The message we heard from WHO that the people fighting the epidemic will be among the first to test Ebola vaccines and treatments is exactly the one we needed to hear. 'This needs to be followed by a massive roll-out of vaccines to the general population once their efficacy is proven.' US firm Johnson & Johnson have already said they aim to produce at least one million doses of their vaccine next year and UK-based GlaxoSmithKiline is also working on a vaccine called ChAd3. In Brussels on Friday, the European Union and its 28 member nations managed to create a one billion-euro fund to fight the Ebola outbreak. Britain's contribution of £205million was the largest among the EU nations. 'Helping West Africa to cope with the crisis is the most effective way to prevent a serious outbreak of the disease elsewhere,' the EU leaders said at the end of a two-day summit. 'The scale of the epidemic is a threat not only to the economy and the stability of the affected countries, but also to the region as a whole. ' In Beijing, China's president pledged to provide £50million in aid to help fight Ebola.","Millions of doses of experimental Ebola vaccines will be produced by  2015 .

"A cancer patient is moving to a caravan 50 miles away from his South Wales home in order to receive the drugs he needs. David Southwood, 53, from Newport, has battled kidney cancer for two years. He then heard about a drug called axitinib which will extend his life by a year - but it is only available across the border in England. David Southwood, 53, from Newport (pictured with wife Angela) is moving to a caravan in England so he can receive life-extending drugs unavailable on the NHS in Wales - he has battled kidney cancer for two years . Mr Southwood, a property manager, believes without the drug he will live for 'a couple of months at most' Now, he and his wife Angela say they have no choice but to uproot their lives and move to a tiny caravan in Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset - far away from their friends and family. Mr Southwood said: 'There's so much to think about - if I move to England I may lose the consultant I've had for the last two years. 'I have family in South Wales and no family at all in England, so it would be isolating as well to stay there.' The property manager believes that without the drug he will live for 'a couple of months at most'. He has already dipped into his life savings and has even sold his car to buy the drug privately, but now says he can't afford to keep paying for it. The drug is due to become available on the Welsh NHS but Mr Southwood is worried that unless he moves he will die before he gets a prescription. Mr Southwood will move the 50 miles from his home in Newport, South Wales to Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset . The caravan the Southwoods will move to in order to give David access to cancer drug axitinib . His wife of 26 years, Angela, said: 'If we lived a few miles away in England he would be able to get access to this drug, which could potentially extend his life. 'Perhaps someone can explain to me why as a UK citizen he is different to the population in the UK that is eligible to receive the drugs. 'To move away from family to have access to the drugs at a difficult time anyway seems totally unfair.' Mr and Mrs Southwood (pictured) have used  their life savings and even sold their car to pay for the drugs . A Welsh Government spokesman said they are currently waiting for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to finish appraising the drug. He said: 'We have had discussions with the manufacturer but currently have no information about when the appraisal process will be completed and whether the final advice will be positive or negative.' Yesterday a 100,000-signature petition demanding that Welsh cancer sufferers get the same access to treatment as English patients was handed to the Welsh Assembly. Campaigners called on the Welsh government – which is run by Labour – to create a special fund to pay for advanced but expensive new drugs. English sufferers have access to 71 types of pioneering cancer treatment for free on the NHS, available through the £200million-a-year Cancer Drugs Fund, which was set up in 2010.","David Southwood, 53, is moving 50 miles in order to receive life-saving drugs .

"It's billed as the most technologically advanced cruise ship ever built. So it's ironic that I can't connect to the Wifi on my iPhone as I set sail on Quantum Of The Seas - but it's only temporary. I'm one of the first guests on board the world's first smartship, sailing from Southampton to Cornwall and back before it makes its way to New York on Sunday and relocates to the Caribbean. Scroll down for video . Big ship: Touted as the world’s first smartship, Quantum of the Seas is the most high-tech cruise ship in the world. The vessel sails from Southampton to Cornwall and back before it makes its way to New York on Sunday and relocates to the Caribbean . Jewel in the crown: North Star, a London Eye-style pod on the top deck lifting passengers 300ft above sea level, offering thrilling views . There, passengers will be able to connect to the ultra-fast O3b technology, not yet available in the UK, but Royal Caribbean promises it will be by the time its next liner, Anthem Of The Seas arrives here in the spring. At 1,141ft long, Quantum Of The Seas is the length of 41 London buses and longer than five Boeing 747s. It’s the third largest cruise ship in the world, making for an impressive sight as it docked in Southampton on Friday. But looking like rows of floating flats, it's not the outside that's the attraction. Inside boasts robotic bartenders serving cocktails, a skydiving simulator, a world-first digital entertainment system, on-board dodgems, and virtual balconies in windowless rooms. And then there's the jewel in the crown - North Star, a London Eye-style pod on the top deck lifting passengers 300ft above sea level, offering thrilling panoramic ocean views. It's the ultimate ship designed with tech-savvy holidaymakers in mind. Cutting-edge technology: The whirring blue robotic arm bartenders that shake and stir your poison according to your tastes . The ship's architecture is complemented by a multi-million dollar, 2,980 art collection including this a huge butterfly wall by the glass lifts . The passenger pod, similar to the capsules on the London Eye, offers 360-degree panoramic views of the ocean . Guests can find swimming pools, sunbeds and hottubs - as well as a bar serving drinks throughout the day on Deck 15 . And the digital experience begins before guests even leave home - where they can check in online as well as book on-board dining, spa appointments and shore excursions. The checking in process is efficient. From arriving at the port in Southampton to taking my first step on Quantum takes about seven minutes - none of the usual airport queues. The incredibly designed Quantum, which took three years to build and weighs 167,800 tonnes, certainly delivers on its 'wow factor' promise. There are 18 decks, 2,090 staterooms, 16 glass elevators, and room for a staggering 4,905 passengers and 1,500 crew members. Once on board, it's a case of what to do first. Decks four and five are lined with elegant Las Vegas-style restaurants, bars and shops selling everything from pints of beer and slices of pizza, to champagne and diamonds. The indoor active space iFly on level 16 boasts on-board dodgem cars as well as a a circus school with flying trapeze, and roller skating . Located next to a rock-climbing wall, the jewel of the ship’s art collection is a 30-foot magenta polar bear on the exterior deck . Level 16 boasts iFly - the world's first skydive simulator at sea - as well as North Star, a five-star spa, a surf simulator, a climbing wall, and Seaplex, the largest indoor active space at sea, with gaming, a circus school and bumper cars. Deck 15 is where guests can find swimming pools, sunbeds and hottubs - as well as a pool-side bar playing music and serving drinks throughout the day. And the showstopping Two70 entertainment venue – featuring vast, floor-to-ceiling glass walls spanning three decks and offering 270-degree panoramic sea views – with its five-star lounge-style seating, and chic cocktails, is on levels four and five. Inside, the ship's awesome architecture is complemented by a multi-million dollar, 2,980 art collection – from a huge butterfly wall by the glass lifts, and on-board galleries, to the 30ft-tall magenta polar bear made from stainless steel triangles standing proud on the ship’s exterior deck. My 11th floor statecabin is spacious and modern, boasting USB plugs, a flat-screen TV, a double bed, a sofa and blue, grey and cream decor, as well as plenty of storage and a shower room - although toiletries are only available upon request. There's also a balcony with two chairs affording an impressive ocean view. The passenger pod, similar to the capsules on the London Eye, offers 360-degree panoramic views of the ocean . Room with a view: The pod suspends passengers out over the side of the ship for unparalleled views across the ocean . Weighs 168,666 gross tonnes . 1,141 feet long - 2.5 longer than the Great Pyramid of Giza is tall . Cruising speed: 22 knots - faster than Usain Bolt's average by a bow . Space for 4,905 guests in total and 1,500 crew . 136 feet wide - three times wider than a basketball court . Boasts 2,090 staterooms (375 with virtual balconies) North Star pod takes guests 300ft above sea level . Four bow thrusters produce 4,694 horsepower each - equal to 24 F1 cars . Ship is three times the size of the International Space Station; 11 times bigger than a blue whale . Cost £133,000 per berth to build . For those in windowless rooms, virtual balconies are available – a full-length screen showing a boat’s eye view as the vessel travels; but it comes at an extra cost. My Wow wristband gives me access to my room - as well as allowing me to make purchases; in theory linking to on board app Royal iQ, which guests can use to manage their holiday - but it doesn't work efficiently during the pre-inaugural voyage, so I resort to the old-fashioned method of writing everything down instead. The wristband also takes away the need to ever carry around cash - which is potentially dangerous with plenty of high-end shops dotted around. On decks four and five are where most of the 18 restaurants are located - including Jamie's Italian; Jamie Oliver's first outlet at sea; and Wonderland, which offers an experimental dining ‘experience’ in an glamorous and quirky setting. In a concept called Dynamic Dining, the cruise ship's traditional main dining room has been 'reimagined' as five complimentary restaurants. No free-for-all buffet here. Instead, these are elegant, well-thought-out eateries offering five-star dining, adventurous dishes and top-notch wines, with waiters using tablets to communicate orders immediately with the kitchen. These are the types of restaurants you would want to dine at even if you weren't at sea. Guests have the opportunity to dine in some of the restaurants free of charge, while others (including Jamie’s Italian) have an extra fee attached. After a ride on the North Star, which takes us on an incredibly high, but very smooth ride, I enjoy champagne in the chic Diamond Club, before dining in the luxurious Chops Grille, which specialises in steak and fish dishes. A member of staff demonstrates the RipCord by iFLY skydiving simulator at the back of Quantum of the Seas . Quantum of the Seas' robot bartenders -  the first of their kind in the world - prove to be yet another form of entertainment on the ship . When Two70 becomes an entertainment venue at night, it uses six ‘roboscreens’ that move or unite as one to entertain passengers . Our waiter is friendly and helpful, and the food is superb, everything is faultless. Even though I'm full the dessert menu is not to be passed on - and I finish with a calorific red velvet sponge cake smothered in cream. The evening doesn't end there. As well as a production of Mamma Mia, guests can book to watch the exclusive show StarWater in the spectacular Two70 venue - the screen technology is incredible, offering a backdrop only rivalled by theatres but without the need for the space. After that, there's a late-night casino on deck three - with designated smoking areas, which is odd to see inside - with card tables and slot machines flashing their lights until the early hours, as well as tribute bands playing in bars, piano players tinkering late into the night, and DJs taking the party on until the next day. Around every corner there is something whirring, something to touch, something to taste, or something to experience. The cruise ship is filled with shops and 18 restaurants and bars to keep passengers entertained on board . Royal Caribbean owns the world’s three largest cruise ships – Allure of the Seas, the Oasis of the Seas and the Quantum of the Seas . Quantum of the Seas boasts 18 decks and has room for 4,180 guests. The ship is three times the size of the International Space Station . I place my order for a drink courtesy of the whirring blue robotic arm bartenders, that shake and stir your poison according to your tastes. There’s a queue already, with people having to wait nine minutes for their order – but there are no groans of frustration, as the bionic staff prove to be entertainment enough. Royal Caribbean says it has created the ship with the modern holidaymaker in mind - and that it opens cruising up to a younger, tech-savvy audience. But it adds that although Quantum Of The Seas is designed with technology at its fore, guests can choose not to use it. However, with the digital concept at the heart of what’s on offer on board this smartship, it’s not the type of vessel to travel on if you want to switch off - but it's perfect if you are switched on. It's the future of cruising ... or, at least, it will be as soon as the Wifi connection works.","Royal Caribbean’s new vessel is third largest in world carrying 4,905 passengers .

"I will not bow to pressure when picking my starting XI, was the gist of what Mauricio Pochettino said. The Tottenham Hotspur manager is yet to opt for Harry Kane as a starting striker in the Premier League over Emmanuel Adebayor and Roberto Soldado, two players that earn significantly more but have contributed far less. 'My decision is always about my analysis on the training,' Pochettino insisted, asserting he rotates his strikers to give ‘balance to the team'. Harry Kane (centre) celebrates scoring Tottenham's winning goal against Aston Villa on Sunday . Kane bagged a hat-trick during Tottenham's 5-1 against Asteras Tripolis at White Hart Lane last month . It begs the question, what more must Kane do to earn his chance as Tottenham's go-to striker? The preferred duo at White Hart Lane have been AWOL or, at the very least, not justifying the fat pay packets they receive while Kane is paid a fraction of the cost. Follow all the latest #UEL action on: . Facebook: UEFAEuropaLeague . Twitter: @EuropaLeague . And at uefa.com . And yet the club’s current top goalscorer is regularly relegated to the substitutes’ bench, having played just 95 minutes in six Premier League appearances so far. Pochettino has been scratching his head over finding that ‘balance’ but the numbers tell it better. Kane this year has averaged a goal every 72.9 minutes, while Adebayor trails on 415.5 and Soldado, 300. Sportsmail columnist and former Tottenham midfielder Jamie Redknapp believes Kane has earned the right, despite being relatively new. ‘If you compare him to Adebayor and Soldado there is no comparison,’ he told Sky Sports. ‘I’d be amazed if he doesn’t start next week (against Stoke City).’ Both Roberto Soldado (left) and Emmanuel Adebayor have struggled to find the net this season . Mauricio Pochettino (above) is yet to select Kane as his starting striker in the Premier League . Kick-off: Thursday, November 6, 6pm . TV: ITV4 from 5.30pm . Before that, though, the man eight years younger than Soldado and nine than Adebayor travels to Greece to face Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League on Thursday evening. The Road to Warsaw is inviting to Kane. It has become the England Under 21 international’s stomping ground, scoring four goals in a competition that offers Champions League football to the winner. Kane is poised to start in Tripolis as he did against the Greek club at White Hart Lane a fortnight ago, where he scored a hat-trick before replacing goalkeeper Hugo Lloris who was sent off. Three days later he was dropped in favour of Adebayor as Tottenham lost 2-1 against Newcastle United at home. The former Manchester City and Arsenal striker has not travelled for a Europa League tie in more than a year, and has been left in London again. Kane (right), who has scored nine goals so far this season, looks set to start on Thursday night . Soldado has been a major disappointment since joining from Valencia for £26m in the summer of 2013 . It implies Asteras will be another chance for the Tottenham youth product to give Pochettino food for thought. And yet, will it hinder him? With Pochettino hellbent on rotation, Kane is poised to subsequently be overlooked for Sunday’s Premier League match against Stoke. There’s no doubting the striker’s enthusiasm - ‘I feel fit and ready and I feel I could play a game every day if I could,’ he says - although Pochettino will suggest he’s protecting a Young Lion from being burned out. Kane isn't the most technically gifted, nor is he the fastest or most skilful. But he has shown ability to gain half a yard on his opponent and be clinical in doing so, outshining £26million signing Soldado in the process. Take, for example, the striker's latest appearance against strugglers Aston Villa on Sunday. The Spurs youngster fights off competition from his team-mates before the match winning free-kick . Kane nets another goal in the Europa League as Spurs beat AEL Limassol 3-0 to reach the group stage . Such confidence saw the 21-year-old come on for Adebayor with Tottenham a goal down and dismiss Erik Lamela, a £30m buy, to take charge of an inviting free-kick in the dying moments. The Argentina international wanted to take it, Kane was having none of it. He scored with technique more than power, albeit via a wicked deflection from Nathan Baker, and completed a 2-1 turnaround for Pochettino. ‘Without a doubt it was one of the greatest moments for me in a Spurs shirt,' man of the match Kane said afterwards. Tottenham have stalled in the Premier League, leaving a top-four finish an ambitious ask. For the first time, the Champions League awaits the winner of the Europa League and Kane, with Tottenham’s Greek obstacle looming, can continue to raise eyebrows - if given the opportunity.

"Sean Jennings has been offering singing lessons as a vocal coach under the name Sean Jeffrey . A talent scout who worked with X Factor and Britain's Got Talent acts has been exposed as a convicted paedophile. Sean Jennings has been coaching artists vying for a place on the talent shows after changing his name to hide his conviction for assaulting a 12-year-old boy. The 42-year-old, who now calls himself Sean Jeffrey, was jailed in 2003 after police discovered more than 10,000 indecent images of young boys at his Bristol home. He spent four-and-a-half years in prison before changing his name and attending the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Now, a Sun on Sunday investigation by Michael Hamilton has revealed the criminal submitted acts to two of Simon Cowell's talent programmes. Though Jennings has not been worked directly with either the X Factor or Britain's Got Talent, one of the groups he has managed was successful in securing a place in the latter. The X Factor now allows acts as young as 15 to apply for an audition. A Syco spokesman said the staff at the company were completely unaware of his past and were appalled to learn of it. 'He has never been a vocal coach on the shows and has never been paid by Syco, X Factor or Britain's Got Talent. He added: 'We will not have any contact with him and certainly will not appreciate this man trying to contact us in the future.' Offering vocal coaching for £60-an-hour, the man's website boasts he has appointments at Syco and teaches 'current and past stars' of some of London's most successful West End shows. When confronted he confirmed he was a vocal coach, but stopped short of admitting he had changed his name from Jennings to Jeffrey before telling journalists: 'I need to take advice'. But he said he was 'strict' about never working with children. Facebook and Twitter pages set up under his new name were immediately removed. Sean Jennings was jailed in 2003 after officers found more than 10,000 indecent images of boys at his home in Bristol . A spokesman for Syco, the production company in charge of the X Factor (pictured) and Britain's Got Talent said Jennings had unsuccessfully submitted acts to the shows but was never paid and has never worked for them . Child protection expert Mark Williams-Thomas said the discovery was worrying for young artists trying to succeed in the music industry. 'I'd be very concerned about any employment or activity that brings him into contact with boys aged ten to 16. 'It just shows how easy it is to work with children with convictions.'

"Ford is recalling more than 202,000 cars, vans and trucks in North America in five recalls to fix gas leaks, air bag sensors, stalling and other issues. The company says the problems have caused one accident, but it's not aware of injuries in the case. The biggest of the recalls announced Tuesday affects about 135,000 F-150 pickups and Ford Flex family haulers from the 2014 model year. Ford is recalling more than 202,000 cars, vans and trucks in North America in five recalls to fix gas leaks, air bag sensors, stalling and other issues . The company says the problems have caused one accident, but it's not aware of injuries in the case . Faulty passenger seat weight sensors can stop air bags from inflating in crashes. Dealers will widen a gap between the seat frame and track, and then recalibrate the sensors. Also covered are some 2009 through 2014 F-150s that were serviced for seat track problems this year. The recalls are examples of how automakers are moving faster to report and correct safety problems in response to large penalties paid to the federal government by General Motors and Toyota. GM was fined $35 million for its slow response to the ignition switch recall, and Toyota paid a $1.2 billion penalty to settle a criminal charge that it hid safety information from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. So far this year, automakers have issued more than 550 recalls affecting more than 52 million vehicles. That shattered the full-year record of 30.8 million recalled vehicles set in 2004. GM has issued 75 recalls totaling more than 30 million vehicles this year. GM has issued 75 recalls totaling more than 30 million vehicles this year . Here are details of the other Ford recalls: . About 38,600 Ford Crown Victoria, Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Cars from 2005 to 2011. They're being recalled for a second time to fix problems with steering shafts that can separate. Improper repairs can cause loss of steering. Dealers will inspect and replace the upper intermediate steering shaft if needed. They also will inspect lower steering column bearings and install bearing retainers if needed. So far this year, automakers have issued more than 550 recalls affecting more than 52 million vehicles . About 27,600 Transit Connect small vans from 2014 for potential fuel line leaks. Fuel and vapor lines may have been routed incorrectly in vans with 2.5-liter engines. The lines can rub and possibly cause leaks over time. Dealers will inspect and reroute the lines if needed. About 90 Transit large vans from 2015 with 3.2-liter diesel engines.

"Paul Lambert will stay at Aston Villa after talks with American owner Randy Lerner in New York. Lambert’s position was uncertain with the club up for sale for £200million, but he will continue as manager while working under similar cash guidelines as before. That means he will get funds to use in the transfer window but there will not be the substantial lift in budget he insisted was required to see Villa avoid another season of struggle.

The emphasis, though, will be on . signing players of proven quality – rather than making speculative . acquisitions – with quality promoted over quantity.

The first was sold in 1824 and production of rubberised coats soon spread all over Britain. Every kind of coat was produced with rubberised material including riding coats and coats supplied to the British Army, British Railways and UK police forces.

"A student named Homecoming Queen at a Texas high school on Friday surprised one of her best friends by immediately passing the title on to her after other students had played a cruel trick on girl. No sooner had Anahi Alvarez's name been read out the high school's football field, than it was announced that she was honoring another girl, her best friend Lillian Skinner. Friends of Lillian, 17, describe her as a ‘sweet’ and ‘amazing girl’ who is always smiling and loves to spread a happiness. But in the run up to the Homecoming Queen announcement, Lillian had been the victim of a cruel prank by some mean girls who had tried to convince the senior that she had been nominated for the title when she hadn't.

"Tottenham's interest in Victor Wanyama will be compounded by statistics collated from his defensive midfield performances at Southampton. Mauricio Pochettino is looking at bringing in the big Kenyan over the summer after utilising him as a defensive screen while at St Mary’s. Tottenham had the ninth best defensive record in the Premier League and the new coach recognises that will have to improve if he is to make an impression on the Champions League qualifying places. Solid as a rock: Victor Wanyama (left) was used as a defensive screen by Southampton . Southampton averaged 1.47 points per game last season but that jumped to 1.58 when Wanyama started and dropped to 1.28 when he didn’t. They conceded on average a goal every 121 minutes when he was on the pitch and that dropped to every 57 minutes when he didn’t play. Although not heralded among Southampton’s shining lights, Wanyama, 22, was regarded as the unsung hero of the side by Pochettino. He joined last summer from Celtic for £12million and got off to a great start in the Premier League earning plaudits from opposition managers for his displays against Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal, only for a chipped bone to restrict his progress at New Year. That way to North London: Mauricio Pochettino is interested in bringing the Kenyan with him to Spurs . Pochettino was quick to bring him back but he only returned to full fitness at the tail end of the season. Tottenham are also interested in Jay Rodriguez but have yet to make an enquiry for Adam Lallana who is expected to join Liverpool.","Mauricio Pochettino interested in bringing Wanyama with him to Spurs .

"Sir Ian Botham (pictured) has told of his heartbreak at deciding to end visits to his dementia-suffering father while he was in a care home . Sir Ian Botham has told of his heartbreak at deciding to end visits to his dementia-suffering father while he was in a care home. The former England cricketing great has opened up about losing his 'bright and clever' father Leslie to Alzheimer's in 2005 and the agony of watching his condition deteriorating. The 58-year-old, England's leading Test wicket taker, revealed how Leslie's behaviour became increasingly 'awkward' as dementia took hold putting a huge strain on his family. Eventually the pensioner became a patient in a care home - but the former bowler revealed he was so distressed by seeing his father ravaged by the condition that he could no longer face visiting him. Talking to the BBC's Inside Out programme, he asked people not to 'judge' him for his decision, describing the situation as 'horrendous'. During an emotional interview he revealed his mother was under so much strain looking after her husband that she suffered a heart attack. Leslie passed away in a care home in Somerset in December 2005 at the age of 82. Initially Sir Ian, now a cricket commentator at Sky Sports, would visit his father with his mother but in the end he said he felt there was 'no point in going'. 'He had to be sedated to have a shower, he got violent, he lost all his bodily controls, he was totally dysfunctional and I did not want to see my dad like that,' he said. 'All I was looking at was a cavity of what was my father and I said ""Mum you've got to stop going"" and she said ""no I can't"". 'I said ""Mum, you come back, it's tearing you apart, you sit there, you're in tears he doesn't know who you are any more"". 'We would walk in and he would come up and he would have someone on his arm and he would come up and say ""Are you here? Are you staying here?"" 'He would have no idea who I was or who my mum was and I said ""Mum, I'm making a decision here, I've got so many great memories of my father I am not going any more"". To watch the full interview click here . Ian Botham is pictured left in 1993 with his father Leslie who died in 2005 at the age of 82 after battling Alzheimer's . Sir Ian Botham, pictured in action as a player, revealed the pain of watching his father's condition deteriorating . 'I said ""I really wish you wouldn't because it isn't doing you any good. And I'm not going because it's destroying everything I loved about my father and I don't want to have to see him like this in this vegetable state"". And I refused to go.' Sir Ian, who has helped to raise millions of pounds for charity over the years, said that the experience of seeing his father in this state was 'horrendous' adding: 'He was fit, healthy, bright, clever, a sportsman, father, grandfather. 'He would be horrified to see himself and I wasn't prepared to keep on looking at him like that and seeing this person who did not even know who he was - so that's why I didn't go.' Sir Ian, also known as Beefy, captured the imagination of the British public when he almost single-handedly defeated Australia in a 1981 series that later became known as 'Botham's Ashes'. Outside cricket he has been a prolific fundraiser, undertaking 12 long-distance charity walks including from John O'Groats to Land's End. Alzheimer's, a physical disease affecting the brain, is the most common cause of dementia. By 2015, it is predicted there will be more than 520,000 people in the UK with the condition.

"Crystal clear water, pristine beaches and the stunning Great Barrier Reef stretching 2,600kms off the coast of Queensland. The Whitsunday Islands are one of Australia’s greatest tourist attractions with more than 800,000 tourists flocking to the region each year. To cope with an increasing number of local and American visitors, Virgin Australia has just launched daily flights from Los Angeles direct to Brisbane. The Group Executive for Public Affairs at Virgin Danielle Keighery told Daily Mail Australia there is a high demand from customers wanting to get to the Great Barrier Reef from the United States. ‘Having daily flights gives people more options and allows greater flexibility, so I think it’s great  that we can offer that service’ The stunning Great Barrier Reef stretches for 2,600 kms and is one of the seven natural wonders of the world . Crystal clear water, palm trees and pristine beaches - it's just another day in paradise at Hayman Island, the most northerly of the Whitsunday Islands . However the new daily route means changes to the Melbourne and Sydney services. The Melbourne to LA route ceased operation completely on Saturday, while the Sydney to Los Angeles flights now depart at a different time to allow an earlier arrival into the US. Virgin Australia’s Chief Commercial Officer Judith Crompton says the changes are part of extensive market analysis. “Those travelling from Melbourne will still be able to travel to Los Angeles on one ticket with through-checked baggage, connecting through Sydney or Brisbane, and we are committed to providing competitive fares on these routes.' The new Business Class cabins will be rolled out on the three class Boeing 777 aircraft - which fly the Brisbane to LA route – by the end of next year. While Virgin’s fleet of Airbus A330’s will be upgraded in early 2015, with the first aircraft expected to be in service by March. The futuristic upgrade include more spacious seats on both the A330 and the 777, which convert into luxurious 80 inch lie-flat beds .

The futuristic upgrade of the Business Class suites include more spacious seats on both the A330 and the 777, which convert into luxurious 80 inch lie-flat beds and gives passengers three inches more legroom, along with redesigned bars on the Boeing 777 aircraft. The daily Brisbane to LA route which is on sale now, also features a restaurant quality Business Class menu designed by Luke Mangan, who came on board after a call from Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson. ‘He didn’t have to convince me much, I just knew it was going to be good fun and a challenge’, Luke told Daily Mail Australia. Fine dining and airline food are not usually mentioned in the same sentence, but that’s exactly what the celebrity chef has managed to achieve. The new Business class menu wouldn't be out of place in a three hat restaurant and features mouth-watering options such as char-grilled beef fillet, red curry of duck leg and blue eyed fillet. The new Business class menu designed by celebrity chef Luke Mangan, wouldn't be out of place in a three hat restaurant . Food mogul Luke Mangan (standing) came onboard to design the Business class menu after a call from Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson . Ms Keighrey says people now want fresh foods on flights. ‘The old days of having plane food that was constructed and frozen is thankfully long gone and we now can enjoy fabulous fresh food that is all prepared fresh and passengers can get off the other end feeling good’. And that's exactly what Luke is trying to achieve.  ‘What I’m trying to do is get restaurant food in the sky and I’ve learnt a lot of tricks along the way, like using fragrant spices to make it clean fresh and full of flavour, because you lose about 20-20 per cent of your tastebuds in the air’. After dropping out of school at just 15, Mangan now has 12 restaurants to his name, runs Salt grills on three P&O cruises and still manages to teach Virgin staff how to plate up his restaurant quality meals. ‘We prepare a lot of the base and we teach the crew – we get around thirty crew every two months and we do a master class for 2.5 hours and we show them how to plate the dishes up’, Luke told Daily Mail Australia. ‘All the dishes are tested in airline ovens at Mojo in Sydney and I get to try them and give them the thumbs up!’. Virgin has not only upgraded their flight schedule, seats and menus, they have also developed a partnership with the newly refurbished One&Only resort on the picture perfect Hayman Island. The ultra-luxury private island resort recently underwent an $80 million dollar makeover and now Virgin velocity members can earn points when staying at the resort and enjoy special benefits.

One&Only currently has eight luxurious resorts around the world, from the Bahamas and South Africa, to Dubai and the first resort in the Asia Pacific region on Hayman Island - which played host to the cast of Modern Family earlier in the year. The renovations include an upgrade of almost half of the 160 rooms to suite, villa or penthouse accommodation, all set amongst expansive pools and two kilometres of pristine white sand beaches. The beach front villas cost around $2000 a night, while the newly renovated Pool Wing features transformed suites with breathtaking views and drop in pool access from the terrace that will set you back up to $1500 a night.

CEO of Kerzner International Development Alan Leibman said they are excited to have introduced the award winning One&Only style to this part of the world. ‘We have completely redefined luxury in the Great Barrier Reef and transformed the guest experience with hallmarks of excellence found in One&Only resorts around the world, whilst capturing the break-taking beauty of one of the natural wonders of the world’.

The partnership between Virgin Australia and One&Only Hayman Island is part of an ongoing commitment by the airline to align themselves with high quality brands. Ms Keighrey told Daily Mail Australia, ‘It really is one of the most beautiful locations and an extremely popular location for people traveling. One&Only focus on fabulous service and providing a really lovely and seamless experience so we have the commonality there in wanting to deliver above and beyond what our customers want’. Velocity - the hugely successful frequent flyer program run by the airline – is now valued at close to $1 billion after the sale of a %35 stake to the private equity film Affinity Equity Partners on October 22. Virgin has maintained a 65 per cent stake with the deal boosting their cash flow by $336 million, as the company prepares to take over budget airline Tigerair Australia. Research has found Virgin Australia had the highest customer satisfaction levels of all airlines operating between Australia and the United States last year. Something Ms Keighrey says is very important to her team. ‘I’ve got friends who don’t even want to go to sleep on a long haul flight because they want to enjoy the champagne, the entrée, the main, the movies and all those sorts of things. Flying is a great experience and it’s important for us to continue to deliver a great experience’.","Virgin Australia has commenced a daily service from Brisbane to Los Angeles .

Wright and Miss King were watching television downstairs when the dog killed the girl, and although they tried to rescue her from the jaws of the pet, she suffered horrific injuries and died in hospital. Following the attack, Miss King ended the relationship. Two weeks ago Blackburn Magistrates' Court heard that Wright then sent abusive messages, also calling her a 'slag' and a 'slut', saying 'it was your fault Ava died'. Appearing via video link at Blackburn Magistrates' Court today, Wright was given an 18-week prison sentence, suspended for two years and a two-year supervision order after he pleaded guilty to harassment at an earlier hearing. Tragic: Chloe King, pictured with her daughter Ava-Jayne Corless, who was killed by the dog in February .

He was also given a two year restraining order banning him from any form of contact with Miss King or her mother Claire King. And he was ordered to stay at home between 7pm and 4am for 12 months and told to pay a victim surcharge of £85 and costs of £85 to be taken from his benefits. The court heard that when Miss King told Wright the relationship was over, he sent her a number of insulting messages before she contacted the police out of desperation. He was warned not to have any further contact with her but on August 6 he bumped into Miss King and was 'very apologetic' and she felt sorry for him, prosecutor Chrissie Hunt said. 'She began to speak to him while making it very clear she wanted not further relationship with him, however a couple of weeks after contact was reinstated he began to send her messages which included images of pills and rope,' she said. Heartbreaking: Ava-Jayne was just 11-months-old when she was killed at Wright's home in Blackburn . Jobless: Wright swears as he enters Blackburn Magistrates' Court two weeks ago . 'The defendant began to utilise social media in order to contact Chloe King, which she ignored. 'Then he created false Facebook profiles to contact her. Miss King has tried desperately to block contact from that particular source. 'The defendant's behaviour deteriorated towards the end of August and the messages became worse. He sent her a list of things he wanted to do prior to killing himself - the list included publishing intimate photos of her.' Ms Hunt added that in September Miss King saw Wright near her home and was so concerned that she withheld her number and phoned him to ask what he was doing. Mitigation: Wright's lawyer Paul Huxley said his client was 'absolutely gutted' as to what happened in February . Miss King's mother Claire - the grandmother of Ava-Jayne - then tried to speak with Wright's mother to discuss his behaviour while he was present. However, during the summit he ran upstairs and cut himself with a Stanley knife, the court heard. When he was eventually arrested and interviewed by police, Wright remained defiant - asked why he went near her house, he said 'I will go where I want, it's a free country'. In mitigation, Paul Huxley said his client was 'absolutely gutted' as to what happened in February and he feels a huge amount of responsibility for the incident. Savaged: Wright and Miss King were watching television downstairs when the dog killed the girl, and although they tried to rescue her from the jaws of the pet, she suffered horrific injuries and died in hospital . He added: 'I'm not going to discuss the dog itself because that's not relevant, but what then follows on is press interest and a huge amount of public interest to the point gentlemen walk down the street and he is verbally shouted at by random people. 'He has been shunned by his friends and it must be said, this has been the worst year of his life. 'He has made a foolish and immature comment about killing her and freezing her - it's ridiculous to say the least.' Blackburn JPs considered the aggravating features of his case but decided to suspend his sentence so he can be rehabilitated in the community. Chair John Wainwright said: 'This has caused stress, been over a long period of time and included photos. 'This was emotional and caused distress to the complainant and her family. The reason for this sentence is for punishment and rehabilitation. 'This is to allow you to react with the probation service over a prolonged period of time.'","Lee Wright was in relationship with Chloe King, Ava-Jayne Corless' mother .

"A man is accused of tying up his girlfriend on Halloween night before assaulting her and photographing the attack because he objected to her French maid costume. Jennifer O'Gallagher alleged her boyfriend John Chapman committed the assault inside a Nanticoke, Pennsylvania apartment building, according to a police affidavit obtained by The Smoking Gun. 'A female yelling and screaming for help' prompted Nanticoke police to respond shortly before 4:45am, the affidavit of probable cause written by Sgt. Brian Williams said. Attack: John Chapman, pictured, allegedly assaulted his girlfriend after seeing her French maid costume for Halloween . After speaking to a bystander, who told police the sound of the noise emanated from an apartment building, Williams and Officer Lee Makowski 'could also hear the female crying, yelling get off of me, leave me alone,' the document said. 'We observed a hallway window smashed across the hallway and the female was still crying screaming get off of me, leave me alone,' Williams wrote. Police then spoke to John Chapman, who 'said his girlfriend Jennifer O'Gallagher is flipping out and he was trying to stop her,' the document said. Williams also wrote O'Gallagher said at the scene 'Thank God the police are hear [sic].' O'Gallagher had visible injuries and told police she had been assaulted by her boyfriend, according to the affidavit. Speaking to police, O'Gallagher said the couple returned to the apartment on Friday afternoon, and that both she and Chapman drank vodka roughly at 5:00pm, the affidavit says. In her account, 'At approximately 7:00pm she and Chapman were getting their Halloween costumes on so they could go out for the night,' the affidavit said. 'Jennifer said Chapman seen [sic] Jennifer's French maid costume. Chapman became upset and started to argue with her. During the arguement he stripped Jennifer naked and then bound her wrist and ankles together. Attack: Chapman is accused of removing his girlfriend's clothes, tying her up then photographing her . 'Jennifer said Chapman was laughing at her and taking pictures of her. Jennifer said this went on for hours. While laying on the ground he was choking and grabbing her.' O'Gallagher also told police she was able to use a knife on the ties after Chapman went out around 11:30pm. Though O'Gallagher had locked the apartment doors, she told police that 'Chapman would return several times trying to get back into the apartment,' Williams wrote. 'Jennifer would tell him each time to go away he drunk [sic] and not coming in. 'Finally around 3:30am John return [sic] and smashed out the bedroom window Jenner said the glass landed on her because her bed is under the window.' Though O'Gallagher had attempted to hide herself, the affidavit said 'Chapman found her and dragged her from the closet onto the floor and started to grab and choke her again. Jennifer said it continuted for about and hour [sic] until police arrived.' Police arrested Chapman for simple assault, unlawful restraint, and harassment, the document obtained by The Smoking Gun reveals. According to the website, Chapman is inside Luzerne County jail 'in lieu of $20,000 bail.'","John Chapman allegedly fought with his girlfriend Jennifer O'Gallagher when they were getting dressed in their Halloween costumes .

"The bedroom of a French soldier has remained unchanged for almost 100 years since he was killed in the First World War. When dragoons officer Hubert Rochereau was killed in Belgium in 1918, his parents preserved his old bedroom as a permanent shrine to their son. And when they sold the large family house in 1936, they stipulated that it should not be changed for another 500 years. Shrine: Hubert Rochereau's old cavalry helmet sits on his made bed nearly 100 years after he was killed . When the familly sold the house in 1936, they stipulated the room should not be changed for another 500 years . Now the bedroom in the village of Belabre, central France, has become a poignant memorial to the young officer who was born there in 1896 and died in battle of Loker, in Flanders, almost a century ago. A moth-eaten army uniform is still on its hanger, photographs sit on his desk alongside a packet of cigarettes, and a lace bedspread is still on the bed with his feathered helmet. The shelves and walls are adorned with his sword, a fencing helmet and a collection of pistols. On his desk is a vial labelled 'the soil of Flanders on which our dear child fell and which has kept his remains for four years.' Rochereau died in the back of an English field ambulance on April 26, 1918, one day after he was wounded during a battle for control for the Belgian village of Loker. A second lieutenant with the 15th Dragoons Regiment based in Libourne, near Bordeaux, he received a posthumous croix de guerre and the Legion of Honour for his courage in battle. The shelves and walls are adorned with his sword, a fencing helmet and a collection of pistols . The regiment's history, seen by the Guardian, records Rochereau's commander was killed by a bullet to the head after giving a 'heroic' order to counter-attack in Loker, which changed hands several times. The house's current owner Daniel Fabre has preserved the bedroom in its original state and said he hopes any new owner will do the same. He told the Nouvelle Republique newspaper: 'This clause had no legal basis, but we believe the room should be left unchanged. 'If we sell, we will be looking for a new owner that respects Hubert Rochereau's memory and keeps this extraordinary museum piece intact.' Rochereau, a second lieutenant with the 15th Dragoons Regiment based in Libourne, near Bordeaux, received a posthumous croix de guerre medal for his extreme bravery on the battlefield. He was one of 580,000 soldiers who died on that part of the western front in the 1914-18 war. He is also remembered on the village war memorial and on a monument to the fallen in Libourne.","Dragoons officer Hubert Rochereau was killed in Belgium in 1918 .

"A young father who violently shook his newborn daughter, resulting in 15 fractures and a brain injury, has had his prison term doubled. The man, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was sentenced to at least two years' jail in December 2013 after confessing to attacking his six-week-old daughter, roughly shaking her and twisting her limbs on two occasions in July 2011. The Crown appealed the original sentencing, arguing that the baby's crying did not reduce the father's moral culpability. The jury found the man guilty of two counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent. He will be jailed for a minimum of four years, with a maximum term of seven years. Young father who assaulted his six-week-old daughter on two occasions has had his prison term doubled after a Crown appeal. The father twisted his daughter's limbs and shook her violently . The man, who was 20 at the time of the attacks, initially denied responsibility before admitting to the court, '(I) lost control of myself and just shook my baby instead.' According to court documents, during the first assault the man twisted his baby's limbs and violently shook her, as he 'took his anger out over his financial woes and frustrations generally on his six-week-old baby.' The second attack took place while he felt angry and frustrated from financial pressures and the stress of living away from family members. At the time of the attacks, the father weighed 170 kilograms and the baby weighed 4.6 kilograms. During the initial sentencing in December 2013, Judge Martin Blackmore acknowledged that, 'unlike their first child, (the baby) was apparently quite a noisy and somewhat difficult baby. 'Such behaviour in a child is challenging even for mature and experienced parents, which certainly the offender was not. 'It has to be recognised that a parent is capable of lashing out in frustration when dealing with a crying baby.' The father was originally sentence to a minimum of two years in jail. His sentence has been extended, with the court ruling the baby's crying does not reduce his moral culpability. The man's will not be eligible for parole until September 2017 . However, during the appeal the Crown argued that there was not sufficient evidence to prove the child had been crying in the lead up to the assaults. The father had been home alone with the child on both occasions. In the judgement handed down on Friday, Justice Peter Garling said: 'The Crown, in my view, is correct to submit that the sentencing judge regarded this finding as lessening the respondent's moral culpability for the offence that occurred. 'His Honour's specific reference to the capacity of a parent to lash out in frustration 'when dealing with a crying baby', is a direct finding of fact that this is what occurred in these circumstances. 'This was an erroneous finding. The evidence did not permit that finding to be made.' Justice Garling also ruled that the sentencing judge in 2013 had not taken into consideration the objective seriousness of the crime. As a result, the defendant was given a light sentence. Justice Lucy McCallum and Justice Clifton Hoeben agreed his Justice Garling's ruling. The father will be eligible for parole in September 2017. The child has not suffered any permanent disability after the attacks. Justice Garling also ruled that the sentencing judge in 2013 had lessened the respondent's moral culpability based on an erroenous finding. Justice Garling also found that the judge had not taken into consideration the objective seriousness of the crime .","Crown appealed the 2013 sentencing of young man who shook his baby .

"England went from one extreme to the other, their near perfect display in the first one-day international being replaced by a shambolic one as they were blown away by Sri Lanka in conditions that seemed made for them. It was cold and cloudy at Chester-le-Street but Sri Lanka looked completely at home as they inflicted on  England their heaviest defeat in a one-day international they have staged — 157 runs — by blasting them out for just 99. This was a golden opportunity for England to take a 2-0 lead in their first series under new management, particularly after they had won the toss, but Sri Lanka made them look just like the novices they so often seemed in Australia. Sri Lanka's Sachithra Senanayake (centre) celebrates the crucial wicket of Englands Ravi Bopara . Joe Root was bowled for a duck as England's top order were blown away . Kumar Sangakkara smashes the ball for six on his way to a quick-fire 40 . Sri Lanka's Nuwan Kulasekara celebrates the big wicket of Ian Bell . England’s problems in one-day cricket . usually crop up overseas when the sun shines and the pitch is flat but . here they were outplayed and out-classed by a Sri Lanka team who . effectively beat them at their own 50-over game. Sri . Lanka showed England how it should be done in what should have been a . testing environment in May at the most northerly Test ground in the . world, keeping wickets in hand before building a respectable total. Then, . when England set off for what should have been a gettable chase, their . top order had no answer to the seam of Nuwan Kulasekara, who gained more . movement off the pitch than a home attack led by Jimmy Anderson. Admittedly . England were without Alastair Cook, who was ruled out with a groin . injury. He could have been expected to have shown much more solidity . against the  moving ball than yesterday’s sorry bunch. Yet . Cook’s absence was no excuse for England, who were shoddy in the field, . bowling 15 wides and dropping two catches, and even worse with the bat, . with only stand-in captain Eoin Morgan going down fighting. ‘That . was one of the worst performances I’ve ever been involved in,’ said . Morgan. ‘It was abysmal, really, and I just can’t explain why we played . that badly. We’ve played a lot of cricket here and that was a pitch . which should have suited us. We just didn’t play at all and we will have . to draw a line under this and up our game in Manchester.’ England . had won their previous four ODIs before yesterday, but their problems . began quickly when they were unable to make significant inroads with the . two new balls. The vastly . experienced Sri Lanka top order had more than enough nous to repel an . England attack which seemed, in the absence of Stuart Broad and Ben . Stokes, to be a bowler short, with Ravi Bopara more a fifth seamer than . fourth. Tillekaratne Dilshan . has made his name as an innovative destroyer but he showed here that he . can apply himself too, providing the backbone of the Sri Lanka innings . with 88 before being bowled by a beauty from Chris Jordan. But . that delivery was a rarity and, even though there was  no swing for . their bowlers, they could not seem to avoid bowling wides, Jordan and . Harry Gurney being the worst offenders with five apiece. Gurney was . flattered by his three wickets and was guilty, along with Bopara, of a . bad drop as Sri Lanka gained late momentum through Ashan Priyanjan and . added 87 in their last 10 overs. ‘We never drop catches in practice  so . this is becoming a huge annoyance,’ added Morgan. England's injured captain Alistair Cook takes a close-up looks at the action . Cook watched on as England's batting line-up played dismally . Not a pretty sight: Cook looks most unimpressed with what is happening out in the middle . Cook couldn't watch any more as England collapased to 99 all out . Sachithra Senanayake wheels away after taking the early wicket of Chris Jordan . A . score of 256 for eight should have been within England’s reach but they . ended up  falling an incredible 157 runs short and barely lasted more . than halfway through their allotted overs as they crumbled before a . disappointing Durham crowd of 10,570. Only . Morgan and Ian Bell reached double figures and after Kulasekara had . knocked the early stuffing out of  England, the unorthodox spin of . Sachithra Senanayake proved far too much for the lower order with four . cheap wickets. This was the . sixth worst one-day international total of all time for England, while . their paltry innings accrued only 13 more runs than their worst ever, 86 . against Australia at Old Trafford in 2001. Sangakarra dives over the crease to survive a run-out attempt . It . is to Manchester they go now for Wednesday’s third match with the . series level, and England will hope that Cook will be fit to regain his . place ahead of Michael  Carberry, who blew his chance here to prove he . can bat at this level as well as he can moan about perceived  injustices . in Australia. Broad, . meanwhile, made his comeback for Nottinghamshire after knee problems but . is the subject of a complaint from Pakistan over comments of his own he . made on Twitter about the bowling action of another mystery spinner in . Saeed Ajmal. The man who was . badly missed by England here at Durham appeared to question the . legality of Ajmal’s action, prompting Pakistan to ask for an explanation . from England.

"Barclays has put aside £500million to pay fines for rigging the foreign currency market, it was announced yesterday. The high street bank has become the first UK bank to brace itself for a huge penalty over the latest financial scandal. Royal Bank of Scotland is expected to follow suit today when it announces its results and HSBC is also preparing to make a provision in its results on Monday. Barclays has put aside £500million to pay fines for rigging the foreign currency market it has been announced . The measures follow investigations launched last year by regulators in the United States, Asia and Europe. They were looking into whether traders conspired to fix the unregulated ‘FX’ foreign exchange market by rigging rates used when buying and selling currencies. The Serious Fraud Office has also launched a criminal investigation in Britain. Of the £500million provision, Barclays finance chief Tushar Morzaria said: ‘Based on our ongoing discussions with agencies, this is the best estimate of what we will need.’ The revelation came as the bank announced £3.7billion profits for the first nine months of the year. It is also setting aside another £170million to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance, taking its total bill for the scandal so far to more than £5billion. The initial FX fine is expected to come from UK and US regulators and is likely to dwarf the £290million Barclays paid in 2012 for rigging inter-bank Libor interest rates. The Financial Conduct Authority could announce penalties for several banks simultaneously within weeks. Last night Labour’s Chris Leslie, Shadow Treasury minister, said: ‘When will this all end? The UK’s banks really are drinking at the last chance saloon if they want to win back the public’s trust as it is at rock bottom.’ The Bank of England has said that more could have been done to punish traders following 'an appalling cases of misconduct' over the years . It is thought City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority could make an announcement within weeks, and is likely to announce penalties for several banks simultaneously. Banks buy and sell foreign currency on behalf of clients but traders can also bet on whether a currency will move up or down. The probe centres on claims that bank staff are making foreign currency trades before processing customers’ orders. Martin Wheatley, the FCA’s chief executive, has previously warned the foreign exchange allegations are ‘every bit as bad as they have been with Libor’. The foreign currency market is the biggest financial market in the world, with more than £3 trillion changing hands every day. But despite this it is not regulated, with whistleblowers who first exposed the scandal comparing the market to the ‘Wild West’. Banks including Barclays, RBS and Lloyds have already been fined for rigging the London Interbank Offered Rate - or Libor - a benchmark used to set trillions of pounds of financial contracts including the price of mortgages. Barclays has also been fined £26million for rigging gold prices and is fighting a £300million penalty in the US for manipulating energy markets. Banks including RBS and Lloyds, pictured, have been fined for rigging the London Interbank Offered Rate or Libor . The Government has made rigging Libor interest rates a criminal offence carrying a maximum jail sentence of seven years. It wants to extend these powers to cover other markets, including foreign exchange and commoditites such as oil and gold. US lender JPMorgan, Swiss giant UBS and Germany’s Deutsche Bank have each recently set aside more than $1 billion - £625million - in the third quarter for extra legal costs, which is thought to mainly cover potential fines relating to currency market investigations. Earlier this week the woman charged with cleaning up the City of London launched a stinging attack on ‘outrageous’ behaviour in the financial markets. Dr Nemat Shafik, one of four deputy governors at the Bank of England, said more could be done to punish traders following ‘a series of appalling cases of misconduct’ over recent years.","The high street bank is the UK's first to brace itself for a huge penalty .

"The U.S. Supreme Court late Tuesday halted the execution of a Missouri man who killed a woman and her two children, citing concerns that his legal counsel was ineffective. Mark Christeson, 35, was scheduled to die by injection at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday at the state prison in Bonne Terre before the late stay of execution was issued. Missouri Department of Corrections spokesman Mike O'Connell said it wasn't clear what will happen next for Christeson. 'This is something that will be taken up in court,' O'Connell said. Stayed: The U.S. Supreme Court late Tuesday halted the execution of Mark Christeson, pictured, late Tuesday . Jennifer Merrigan, one of Christeson's attorneys, declined comment. The appeal to the Supreme Court raised several concerns about legal counsel Christeson has received over the years, including the failure of some of his attorneys to meet a 2005 deadline to file for an appeal hearing before a federal court. It is uncommon for someone to be executed without a federal court appeal hearing. The high court denied a second appeal challenging the state's planned use of a made-to-order execution drug produced by an unidentified compounding pharmacy. Christeson would have been the ninth man executed in Missouri this year, matching an all-time high for the state set in 1999. Another execution is scheduled for Nov. 19 when Leon Taylor is set to die for killing an Independence, Missouri, gas station attendant in 1994. In Maries County, the rural south-central Missouri county where the crime occurred, there is little argument with the death sentence, prosecutor Terry Daley Schwartze said. 'No matter how anybody feels about the death penalty, you can't find a person around here who doesn't feel it's the right result for this case,' Schwartze said. 'It's so very awful.' Crime: When he was 18, Christeson raped Susan Brouk before he killed her, along with her 12-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son . The U.S. Supreme Court had cited concerns that Christeson's legal counsel was ineffective . When he was 18, Christeson and his 17-year-old cousin, Jesse Carter, came up with a plan to run away from the home outside Vichy where they were living with a relative. On Feb. 1, 1998, Christeson and Carter took shotguns and went to a home about a half-mile away where Susan Brouk, 36, lived with her 12-year-old daughter, Adrian, and 9-year-old son, Kyle. They planned to steal Brouk's Ford Bronco, Schwartze said. The cousins tied the hands of the children with shoelaces. Christeson forced Brouk into a bedroom and raped her. When they went back into the living room, Adrian recognized Carter and said his name. 'We've got to get rid of 'em,' Christeson told Carter. Court records show that Christeson and Carter forced Brouk and the children into her Bronco and took electronics and other items. They drove to a pond. After kicking Brouk in the ribs, Christeson cut her throat, then cut Kyle's throat and held him under the water until he drowned. Carter held Adrian while Christeson pressed on her throat until she suffocated. Carter pushed her body into the pond. With Brouk struggling to stay alive, the men tossed her into the pond, where she drowned. Brouk's sisters discovered a few days later that Brouk and the children were missing. A Missouri State Highway Patrol helicopter spotted one of the bodies in the pond, leading to a search that found all three. Meanwhile, Christeson and Carter drove to California, selling Brouk's household items along the way. A detective in Riverside County, California, recognized Christeson and Carter from photos police had circulated, and the men were arrested eight days after the killings. Carter was sentenced to life in prison without parole after agreeing to testify against Christeson.","The U.S. Supreme Court late Tuesday halted the execution of Mark Christeson, citing concerns his legal counsel was ineffective .

"Tom Ince has spoken for the first time about the 'dream' opportunity Inter Milan have offered him to follow in his father’s footsteps. It is 19 years since Paul Ince left Manchester United to join Inter, where he spent two seasons, and now the Serie A giants are interested in signing his son, who can join up for a nominal compensation fee as his contract with Blackpool about to expire. The England Under 21 international, who spent the second half of last season at Crystal Palace, has options to remain in the Barclays Premier League but it is the prospect of moving to Italy that has captured the imagination and he has a serious decision to make.

The name of Inter, the history, the stature of the club. There are options there. Going abroad wouldn’t faze me. ‘Look at Gareth Bale – it shows that sometimes it is better to make these moves when you are a boy. I have got to make sure that wherever I am next season, I am a better player. There are still things that I need to learn and get better. But that type of interest is fantastic.’ The list of English exports to foreign clubs has barely been added to since Joe Cole’s high-profile loan move from Liverpool to Lille in 2011 and Ince believes the whole experience of moving to Italy – if that is what he decides – would have a number of positive spin-offs. ‘You don’t see many English players doing it,’ said Ince. ‘Whether it is the risk of the language, us English are very lazy because we only want to speak our own language and if no one else does then no one cares. Sometimes you have to look at options like that as it opens up new horizons. ‘Learning a different language and culture, but I haven’t ruled out staying in England.

"Giving children blighted by a cough placebo medicine can prove the most effective treatment, a new study has found. Scientists at the Penn State College of Medicine say opting for a dummy cough syrup could be the best way to treat a child's cough. It defies the commonly-held belief among doctors that common coughs improve on their own, without any specific treatment. The team of researchers compared the effects of an agave nectar - a natural sweet syrup from the agave plant - on night-time coughs, with that of a placebo syrup and no treatment at all. Their findings revealed both the nectar and the dummy treatment produced marked improvements in the participant's conditions. Giving children suffering a cough placebo medicine can prove the most effective treatment, a new study conducted by scientists at the Penn State College of Medicine has found . The team said they believe this may be the result of parents feeling more confident of their child's condition having given them a treatment they believed would help. A group of 119 children took part in the study, carried out by Dr Ian Paul of the Penn State College of Medicine. Researchers analysed the effects of the agave nectar, the placebo treatment and no treatment at all, on participants' coughs and sleep disturbance as a result. The placebo used in the study was a grape flavoured water coloured with caramel. That and the agave nectar were given to the children via syringe by their parents before they went to bed. Children aged two to 47 months took part in the one-night study. They only qualified for the trial if they had experienced a cough for seven days or less. Dr Paul wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Neurology: 'While it is somewhat disappointing that agave nectar does not appear to offer added benefit over a placebo, these findings suggest that the common clinical advice of watchful waiting with no treatment may not be the best advice for parents whose infants and toddlers are struggling with cough and its associated sleep disruption. 'Both physicians and parents want symptomatic relief for children with these common and annoying illnesses. 'The significant placebo effect found warrants consideration as health care providers and parents determine how best to manage the disruptive symptoms that occur in the setting of upper respiratory tract infections among young children. 'Placebo could offer some perceived benefit, although at a financial cost, while reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.' The researchers had hoped to show agave nectar would be a suitable alternative to honey for young children. Honey cannot be given to babies under a year old because it carries a small risk of botulism. Cough medicines are waste of money, doctors declared today. Both NHS bosses and leading GPs have dismissed the products - and say traditional home made remedies with lemon or honey to be the best approach. Cough medicines, which usually cost between £3 and £5 for a small bottle, are part of an over-the-counter healthcare industry worth £3 billion a year. But the NHS Choices website advises: 'There's little evidence to suggest cough medicines actually work, although some ingredients may help treat symptoms associated with a cough, such as a blocked nose or fever.' Cough medicines are a 'waste of money' and you're better off using honey and lemon, doctors have claimed . The webpage adds that the 'simplest and cheapest' treatment for a 'short-term cough' may be a homemade remedy containing lemon and honey. It continues: 'There's no quick way of getting rid of a cough caused by a viral infection. It will usually clear up after your immune system has fought off the virus.' Dr Tim Ballard, vice chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, today backed up the NHS claim. He said: 'The medical evidence behind cough medicines is weak and there is no evidence to say that they will reduce the duration of illnesses - as such, GPs are unlikely to prescribe them.' A Which? investigation two years ago said found many popular cough medicines do not work as well as they claim to. The report authors concluded that studies used to support the claims of effectiveness are often low quality. Many also contain high doses of sugar, with one week of the adult maximum dose of a popular product containing as much sugar as five Mars bars. A bottle of Dry Coughs remedy by leading brand Benylin is sold in Boots for £4.99 for a 150ml bottle. Benylin's website states: 'Through its active ingredients, Benylin Dry Coughs Original helps to suppress the coughing mechanism, reducing the urge to cough.'","Scientists at Penn State College of Medicine compared effects of agave nectar on night-time coughs with placebo syrup and no treatment at all .

Eid al-Adha, or Feast of Sacrifice, commemorates what Muslims believe was Prophet Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Ismail - the Biblical Ishmael, though Christians and Jews believe his other son Isaac was the near-sacrifice - as a test of his faith from God. In the end, he is provided with a sheep to sacrifice instead. In remembrance, Muslims around the world slaughtered sheep and other livestock on Saturday, giving some meat to the poor.

"Next time Oprah Winfrey steps onto the red carpet take a good look at her heels as there's every chance they were designed by this Perth mum. Kym Hall started designing her vintage-inspired shoes just nine months ago and she's already landed an opportunity many designers would dream of. The 38-year-old was initially just asked to send a pair of strappy heels to talk show queen Oprah Winfrey, but now her designs will feature in the $80,000 celebrity gift bags for next year's star-studded Oscars and Emmys . Scroll down for video . Kym Hall's shoe designs from her Jakii brand will feature in the $80,000 celebrity gift bags for next year's star-studded Oscars and Emmys . 'This is really exciting, but it's all a bit surreal. I'm super grateful for the opportunity, I never expected that something like this would happen,' Ms Hall told Daily Mail Australia. The mother-of-one answered a publicity call for Australian designers earlier this year who may have products Hollywood A-listers would be interested in. But she never expected to hear back.

Kym Hall started designing her vintage-inspired shoes just nine months ago from her home in Perth . 'I emailed a paragraph about my business and I sent a link to my website, which was very bad at the time,' she said. 'A little while later I got a call from a lady and I told her why my brand was different. 'She went quiet for a very long time... and then she said ""I think Oprah will really like your brand. Can you send her a pair through us?"". 'Within two hours, I had been sent contracts for five awards ceremonies.' The 38-year-old said she has a list of celebrities she'd like to see in her designs, including the Duchess of Cambridge . Kym Hall said the Duchess had a refined and elegant style, just like her shoe designs . The mother of one started her business so she could work from home to take care of her five-year-old son . Ms Hall's designs are the only pair of shoes featured in the 'swag bags', which will go to award nominees at the Four Seasons Hotel from the Academy Awards, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards, Grammys and Emmys. 'It would be incredible if I saw them wearing them. I don't think I'd sleep for a week,' she said. 'A friend of mine who works in public relations visited the set of Bold And The Beautiful last week and they said it was really hard to get into those bags.

"The widespread adoption of autonomous cars – which is predicted to happen within just 15 years – could lead to the death of railways, one expert claims. The damning prediction comes at a time when governments around the world are planning on ploughing billions into high speed rail projects, such as  HS2 in Britain. One US expert thinks the investments could be made in vain, because the lure of self-driving cars, which could transport people in comfort to any location with minimal effort, will outweigh the appeal of high speed railway lines. The widespread adoption of autonomous cars – which is predicted to happen in just 15 years’ time – could lead to the death of railways, one expert claims This is despite the expected roll-out of high speed rail networks such as HS2 in the UK. A hub station in Crewe is illustrated . Futurologists predict that autonomous vehicles will be commonplace on roads in Europe and the US in just 15 years’ time, as companies such as Google, BMW and Toyota work on self-driving technology. A report by Lux Research predicts that the autonomous car market will be worth $87 billion by 2030, while the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in New York thinks self-driving vehicles will make up 75 per cent of vehicles on the road by 2040. Randal O’Toole, a Senior Fellow of the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington DC, says that they will offer a compelling alternative to high speed rail links for distances of 200 miles (322km), rendering some high speed train lines obsolete, Forbes reported. One of the lines that could potentially be affected is the High-Speed 2 (HS2). The line, which is in the planning stage, would run between London, Birmingham and Leeds and would cost  £42.6billion ($68.6billion). Britain is not the only country with high speed rail ambitions. There are also plans for a high speed rail link in Australia stretching from Brisbane to Melbourne, which could cost $114 billionAUD (£62.5billion). Futurologists predict that autonomous vehicles will be commonplace on roads in Europe and the US in just 15 years’ time, as companies such as Google, BMW and Toyota work on self-driving technology. Google's car is pictured. The expert thinks that the comfort of travelling in such as car will outweigh the speed of trains . The Prime Minister has backed plans for a high speed HS3 rail link in the north of England, the BBC reported. The government plans to put a strategy together looking at options and costs which is set to be released in March. The route would connect Newcastle with Darlington, York and Leeds, with another branch running west-to east, from Liverpool via Wigan to Sheffield and to Leeds and Hull. Mr Cameron said that improving connectivity and cutting journey times is 'crucial' to its long-term economic plan for the north of England. The Indian government is said to be interested in building a high speed network, while the Central Japan Railway Company has been researching new high-speed rail systems based on magnetic levitation since the 1970s, with plans to build a new route connecting Tokyo with Nagoya in 2025. In Britain, HS2 would be completed in around 2030 if it goes ahead, and would therefore be competing with autonomous cars, Mr O’Toole said. While high speed trains could carry passengers at up to 250mph (402kph), they would still have to get to a station to begin their journey. However, passengers in self-driving cars could enter their destination and be driven door-to-door, while working or watching films at around 100mph (161kph). Mr O'Toole explained that in the travel industry, there is a general wisdom that there is a ‘sweet spot’ for  distances, where high speed rail travel looks more compelling than flying and driving. It says that trips shorter than 100 miles (161km) are best made by car and more than 600 miles (966km) by aeroplane, leaving distances in between, perfect for high speed rail. But Mr O’Toole said: ‘I am dubious that such a sweet spot exists. Many people are willing to drive hundreds of miles in order to have the convenience of their car when they get to their destinations, while flying is practical enough for trips of 150 miles or so that airlines currently offer 30 flights a day between Portland and Seattle airports, which are 161 driving miles apart.’ ‘Even if such a sweet spot exists today, self-driving cars will make it even less viable because they will change the way we look at travel time. He claims that if passengers can get on with work or be entertained in their cars, they will be willing to spend more time in them. ‘That means the 100 miles that is supposedly the range in which cars have a competitive advantage will easily increase to 200 miles or more,’ he said. Mr O'Toole believes that self-driving cars will transform the 21st century, just as cars changed the 20th century. Self-driving vehicles as well as new taxi and car-sharing apps like Uber could lead to the death of less flexible and reliable modes of transportation, such as trains, he added. However, trains may thrive for some time yet, because current autonomous cars are facing teething problems. Google’s self-driving cars can’t currently cope in heavy rain or snow – or find their way around 99 per cent of the US. According to MIT Technology Review, the current prototype cars are very reliant on maps to navigate and can’t react like a human driver, dodging potholes and other hazards. Chris Urmson, director of the Google car team, said this is because the detection technology is not yet strong enough to separate certain objects from weather conditions. While the cars’ cameras can spot a traffic light changing, they can be confused by strong sunlight. Despite the cars being allowed on public roads, they need to prepare to set off in more detail than a human driver, because a precise map must be created of exactly where to go – and a car cannot deviate from its route. An area has to be mapped multiple times by a sensor vehicle to record details such as driveways, in order to make the cars' routes - something that will probably have to change if self-driving cars are adopted all over the world. This graphic reveals how Google's prototype driverless car looks and works. The car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do, and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read, in real-time, what other objects are actually doing . The prototype two-seater cars have buttons to autonomously begin and end the drive. The car makes turns and reacts to vehicles and pedestrians based on computer programs that predict what others might do, and data from sensors including radar and cameras that read, in real-time, what other objects are actually doing. The route might be set by typing a destination into a map or using spoken commands according to Chris Urmson, the leader of Google's self-driving car team. The car will be powered by electricity and could go about 100miles (160km) before charging. Its shape suggests a rounded-out Volkswagen Beetle - something that might move people around a corporate campus or congested downtown - with headlights and sensors arrayed to resemble a friendly face. The front of the vehicle has a soft foam-like material where a traditional bumper would be and a more flexible windscreen, in a bid to be safer for pedestrians. In these prototypes speed is restricted to 25mph (40kph) and the ability to self-drive will depend on specifically designed Google road maps tested on the company’s current fleet of vehicles. Ultimately the vehicles will be faster and will be able to use Google's extended maps service. Driving works by using GPS technology to locate the vehicle’s exact position on an electronic map. A combination of radar, lasers and cameras sitting on top of the roof give the car a 360-degree ‘view’, with sensors linked to computer software able to ‘see’ and identify people, cars, road signs and markings and traffic lights.","Randal O’Toole, of the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington DC, thinks commuters will choose autonomous cars over high-speed trains in 2030 .

"George Osborne has been warned he faces a blackhole in the nation’s finances after failing to raise the billions expected form income tax. The official budget watchdog said the Treasury was raking in less money because although there are more people in work, wages have barely increased. The Chancellor was told to expect ‘weaker’ revenues from income tax, forcing him to find the money from elsewhere as the coalition struggles to balance the books. Income tax revenues have been steadily rising since the financial crash, but could fall below the £164billion expected in 2014-15 . Income tax last year generated £154billion for the government and was forecast to hit around £164billion this year. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility warns that the Chancellor is likely to be ‘disappointed’. One major factor has been the move to increase the amount workers can earn before paying income tax to £10,000. The policy has proven popular with voters, but it means many people finding work for the first time are paying little or no income tax at all. In his Tory conference speech last month, Mr Osborne signalled that he would go further and increase the personal allowance further. He said: 'To those in work I say this: where is the sense in taxing you more, only for you to be given some of your own money back in welfare. 'The best way to support peoples’ incomes is to make sure those out of work get a job and those in work pay less tax.' But he also warned that there will need to be another £25billion in spending cuts to eradicate the deficit. The Tories and the Lib Dems have both pledged to increase the personal allowance further to £12,500. Chancellor George Osborne has warned there will need to be another £25billion in spending cuts to eradicate the deficit, but more money will need to be found if income tax revenues fall short . Robert Chote, chairman of the OBR, said it would be better for the Treasury’s bottom line if those in work got better pay rises than more people finding work on low wages. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Fewer pence of revenue [are] coming in for every pound of wages and salaries that’s generated in the labour market and that’s one of the reasons why the receipts have come in weaker. ‘Now, from the perspective of the public finances, that’s not particularly good news. ‘The Chancellor of the Exchequer gets more bang for his buck if wages and salaries rise as a result of people’s earnings going up than if employment goes up – and that’s basically because if earnings go up you’re taking more people into higher income tax brackets, whereas if employment is going up you’re perhaps bringing more people in at the bottom.’ Latest figures show that average weekly earnings are up just 0.7 per cent, less than half the 1.6 per cent rate of inflation. Mr Chote warned that the prospect of wages rising less rapidly than expected and employment growing faster than expected ‘does perhaps suggest that we are more likely to be disappointed than to overachieve on income tax receipts this year’. Robert Chote, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, (left) said it is better for the Treasury if fewer people are in work but getting pay rises. However, Lib Dem Treasury minister Danny Alexander (right) said the government would rather have more people finding work . There has also been a sharp increase in the number of people who are self-employed, hitting the highest level for 40 years. There are now 4.6million who are self-employed, fuelling the growth in the numbers in work. But since 2008-09, average income from self-employment has fallen by 22 per cent. The proportion of people who are self-employed paying no income tax at all has rising from 20 per cent before the financial crash to 35 per cent now, Mr Chote added. However, the government insists it is better to have more people in work, even if it is on low pay. Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said: ‘The fundamental fact about our recovery is... that countries around the world look at the United Kingdom with envy because we have the fastest rate of employment growth in the G7, the fastest fall in unemployment in the G7.’ He said one of the being changes has been a sharp fall in youth unemployment ‘and of course young people at the start of their careers tend to earn significantly below the median income’. He added: ‘From the point of view of the welfare of the economy, the welfare of people across the United Kingdom, having more people in work is the most important thing. ‘And it may cause problems but, frankly, it’s a better problem to have than many other countries in the world are facing right now.’ Labour's shadow treasury minister Chris Leslie said the warning from the Office for Budget Responsibility is a 'cause for concern'. He added: 'The Government is borrowing £190 billion more than planned over this parliament and the OBR is now highlighting the impact of low pay on revenues. Under this Government we are seeing a growing cost-of-living crisis with the average wages of working people down £1,600 year since the election, and George Osborne's attempt to offer unfunded pie-in-the-sky tax cuts at some point in the future won't mask the fact that his failure on deficit reduction means he has chosen to hit millions of working families with a strivers' tax that will cost many families up to £500 a year.'","Office for Budget Responsibility warns Chancellor he will be 'disappointed'

"Police are investigating possible criminal links between slain drug dealer Jamie Gao, a murdered casino high roller and a missing Sydney businessman. Detectives believe the three men, whose deaths and disappearance occurred within four months, may have had common associates within the underworld, reports The Sydney Morning Herald. University of Technology student Gao was shot dead in a storage until at Padstow, in Sydney's south west, on May 20 in what police believe was a drug deal gone wrong. Former detectives Roger Rogerson and Glen McNamara have been charged with the 20-year-old's murder. Scroll down for video . Jamie Gao, 20, was shot dead in a storage unit at Padstow, in Sydney's south west, on May 20. Police are now investigating underworld links between Gao, murdered gambler Peter Ran Hoang and missing businessman Phuoc Minh Nguyen . Jamie Gao was shot twice in the chest in a storage unit at Padstow, in Sydney's south west, in what police allege was a drug deal gone wrong . Businessman Phuoc Ming (Paul) Nguyen, 50, is suspected of having links to drugs and money laundering. He was last known to have been alive on the night of May 1 when he made a telephone call near Bankstown, also in Sydney's south west. Nguyen, who had recently sold two Baker's Delight franchises, was seen driving out of the Hilton Hotel in George Street, Sydney, in a brown Renault Latitude earlier that day. Big-time gambler Peter Tan Hoang, 36, was awaiting trial in Melbourne over the possession of $1.5 million in cash believed to be the proceeds of crime when he was shot dead at Croydon Park in Sydney's inner west on September 7. Detectives are still searching for Hoang's killers and have appealed for anyone who witnessed anything suspicious in Dunmore Street in the early hours of the day he was killed to come forward. A source familiar with the facts of the Gao case said he had not heard Hoang or Nguyen's names linked to that murder investigation but confirmed Gao had associated with Hong Kong triad members. 'He was clearly moving in circles with other drug dealers,' the source said. 'There's no doubt about that.' Phuoc Minh Nguyen, a former Baker's Delight franchise owner, has been missing since May 1. Police are investigating his links to drugs and money laundering and believe he may have been murdered . Peter Tan Hoang gambled more than $90 million at Australian casinos and was awaiting trial for possessing $1.5 million believed to be the proceeds of crime when he was shot dead at Croydon Park, in Sydney's inner west on September 7 . Detectives reportedly believe the three men may have shared underworld connections. 'We believe they may have been associating with the same people and we are exploring the links,' police told the Herald. Gao was shot dead in what police allege was a drug deal gone wrong. Former detectives Rogerson, 73, and McNamara, 55, are on remand charged with his murder. Both have said they will plead not guilty. CCTV footage shows Gao walking from his white Nissan Silvia at a Padstow industrial estate on Arab Street on May 20 carrying a bag police allege contained ice worth $3 million. Cental Local Court has heard Gao got into another car with Rogerson and McNamara, who drove to a nearby storage unit where Gao was killed for the contents of the bag. Further CCTV images allegedly captured McNamara and Rogerson carrying the body of Gao, who was shot twice in the chest, out of the storage unit. His body was found wrapped in a tarpaulin floating in waters off Cronulla a week later. Days after the alleged murder, 2.8 kilograms of ice was allegedly found in McNamara's car. Former detective Roger Rogerson has been charged with murdering Jamie Gao in a drug deal gone wrong at Padstow, in Sydney's south west, on May 20. The decorated officer has been refused bail . Former detective Glen McNamara has been refused bail on charges of murdering student Jamie Gao and commercial drug supply in relation to what police allege was a drug deal gone horribly wrong . Rogerson's barrister, George Thomas, has described the prosecution case against his client as 'weak' and said 'there was enough time for a killing to take place in the absence of my client'. He has conceded Rogerson 'assisted' in removing Gao’s body from the storage space and said it was possible the dead man could have pulled a gun first, leading McNamara to act in self defence. McNamara’s barrister Ian Lloyd QC has previously said his client was involved in the disposal of Gao’s body but said McNamara may have walked into the unit and 'something happened which he did not expect to happen'. In a recorded jail conversation between Rogerson and his wife Anne Melocco, Rogerson said he joined McNamara and Gao inside the storage unit to offer some 'fatherly advice'. 'They’d been in there a fair while, I thought I’d go over and see what’s happening,' Rogerson told his wife on June 24. 'I thought I might be able to give him a bit of fatherly advice.' The alleged murder weapon has not been found. Crown prosecutor Chris Maxwell QC told Central Local Court in August that the two former detectives killed Gao after a plan to supply drugs changed into a 'rip off'.","Slain drug dealer Jamie Gao may have known associates of a murdered gambler and a missing businessman .

' She added: 'Too often we find services that need to change but the people using those services are putting up with awful care and say 'it's not perfect' or 'the staff are very good; you get the odd one but you can't help that'. 'We have to be clear that putting up with poor care is not what anybody is expected to do. 'And let's not forget, it doesn't just affect the individual – it affects the whole family. Sometimes, the worst part of the letters I read is the distress and guilt the family feel when they discover the service they trusted had betrayed the people they cared about. It can be truly heartbreaking. 'These examples of failing care and their impact just reinforce my determination to make sure we call time on poor care.' The Care Quality Commission said that its new inspections system is designed to ensure inspectors are 'consistent when making judgments' and would 'help care providers understand' how ratings are being awarded. Miss Sutcliffe added: 'Ratings characteristics are an important part of our new approach to inspecting and rating adult social care. 'They will allow our inspectors to really get under the skin of adult social care services so that providers know what we are expecting and how we will consistently rate their services. I am sure that this will mean people can be confident in the judgments our inspections will make.'","Elderly in care homes are being treated roughly and suffering bruises .

"A long awaited report on national curriculum has raised concerns about teachers' poor grammar and punctuation. The federal government released the 288-page report by former teacher and Liberal staffer Kevin Donnelly and business professor Ken Wiltshire and its initial response on Sunday. It recommenced a de-cluttered, parent friendly and back to basics approach. Excessive content was affecting students' learning quality in particular at primary school, while literacy and numeracy skills including phonics needed to be prioritised. The national curriculum report has recommended schools get back to basics and has raised concerns about teachers' poor grammar and punctuation . Prime MInister Tony Abbott (pictured) wants to see more focus on getting the basics right so youngsters graduate with the ability to read, write, count, think and understand Australia and the world around them . Prime Minister Tony Abbott believes sending schools back to basics, as recommended in the review, will boost the economy and students' job prospects. But critics warn that approach could leave youngsters without the skills to navigate the 21st century. The Prime Minister wants to see more focus on getting the basics right so youngsters graduate with the ability to read, write, count, think and understand Australia and the world around them. Education Minister Christopher Pyne flagged he'd like to see most of the 30 recommendations adopted and maintained the review was not an 'ideological document'. 'There's nothing in it that I can see that the states and territories would baulk at because none of it is trying to drive a political agenda,' Mr Pyne told reporters in Adelaide. The report was critical of Western civilisation and Australia's Judeo-Christian heritage being demonised in the curriculum. Education minister Christopher Pyne (pictured) says the review was not an 'ideological document' The key findings in the national curriculum report are that more flexibility is needed, greater focus on literacy and numeracy in primary school, more parent friendly, grammar and punctuation training for teachers . It recommended scaling back focus on indigenous history and Asian studies. Mr Pyne said the original curriculum architects might have 'gone too far in one direction'. 'We don't want any politics in schools ... we want our children to be focused on learning,' he said. In relation to teacher's poor grammar and punctuation Mr Pyne said 'It's hard to expect teachers who have never been taught grammar, to teach it.' Opposition education spokeswoman Kate Ellis acknowledged the curriculum implemented under the previous Labor government was not perfect. But she accused Mr Pyne of playing a 'game of distraction' to mask broken promises on the six year Gonski school funding deals. *Curriculum overcrowded particularly in primary years . *More flexibility needed . *More accessibility for special needs children . *Grammar and punctuation training for teachers . *Greater focus on literacy and numeracy in primary school . *Needs to be more parent friendly . *Curriculum body should become a private company .

HISTORY . *More focus on western civilisation and Australia's Judeo-Christian heritage . *Scale back focus on indigenous history and Asia . MATHS . *Progressing through levels to be based on knowledge rather than year level . SCIENCE . *Reduce content and focus on depth . GEOGRAPHY . *Include content on Pacific Islands . *Sustainability is overused . ARTS . *Music and visual arts should be mandatory . The Abbott government has only committed to the first four years. The bulk of the funding was set to come in years five and six. The Australian Education Union said tinkering with the curriculum would not change the disparity between well off and disadvantaged schools. Greens Senator Penny Wright said the review reignited the 'culture wars'. '(The) review seems to be suggesting we can just put Aboriginal culture and history in a box, bring it out once a year, and forget about it the rest of the time,' she said. Queensland Premier Campbell Newman said the education system should help create well rounded members of a liberal democracy. The reviewers received 1600 public submissions. The federal government will release its final response to the review in early 2015 after Mr Pyne has consulted with his state and territory counterparts.

"Andy Murray always enjoys having a relatively low profile at the start of the French Open, but Friday’s draw did at least offer the hope that he can make a run into the business end of the tournament. While Rafael Nadal was looking at a repeat of last year’s final with a match in the last eight against compatriot David Ferrer, the 27-year-old Scot would not look any further than his first round against world No 55 Andrey Golubev. In theory he could meet Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarter-finals and then Nadal in the semis, with Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic together on the other side of the draw. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Mike Dickson preview the French Open . Ready for action: Andy Murray faces world No.55 Andrey Golubev in the first round . It was not, overall, the unkindest hand the Wimbledon champion could have been dealt. Golubev is one of several Russians who have defected to Kazakhstan, enticed by the prospect of greater earnings there. An impressive shotmaker with a career high ranking of 33, he made a slow start to the year but has gradually picked up since. His highs in 2014 were beating Wawrinka in the Davis Cup in February, although the Swiss may have had a hangover from winning the Australian Open. Golubev showed how dangerous he was by beating Fernando Verdasco in the first round of the Italian Open although he had to retire in the next round.

"Sportsmail asked Tottenham fans' blog the Spurs Web to reveal the mood around White Hart Lane following the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino as their new manager. Joseph Meakin discusses whether the board have made the right decision and how the fans feel about their new boss. There has been a huge wave of positivity and excitement around Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, after the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino as our new head coach was confirmed. Memories of last season’s swashbuckling, confident Southampton team live strong in the memory of most Spurs fans, who seem excited to see what Pochettino can do with a squad full of players with more quality than was available at St. Mary’s. New man in charge: Mauricio Pochettino has been named as the new manager of Spurs . Whilst Ajax boss Frank de Boer was the man that most Spurs fans wanted to see take the club forward, the excitement about Pochettino speaks volumes of how well he is thought of by Tottenham fans. I always felt that Pochettino was a . much better fit to what Daniel Levy wants to achieve at White Hart Lane . than De Boer, so I am pleased that we have gone with the Argentinian. Pochettino’s . high-tempo, attacking philosophy can, I believe, be easily translated . to our squad, and Pochettino has managed in England long enough to have . tailored his preferred set-up to suit the physical demands of the . Premier League. On the attack: Andros Townsend can provide Spurs with an outlet for getting forward . The Pochettino way: Sandro, Mousa Dembele and Lewis Holtby play the way the new boss likes . Benefit: Erik Lamela could thrive under Pochettino's guidance . Players . like Lewis Holtby, Sandro and Mousa Dembele have both the ability and . work-rate to press the opposition how Pochettino likes, and in Christian . Eriksen, Andros Townsend and Erik Lamela, I really feel we have a . young, creative set of attacking midfielders who could all benefit from . playing in Pochettino’s exciting system. Whilst . I am very happy to see the back of Tim Sherwood, the work that Sherwood . did to promote players from the academy was refreshing. I am hopeful . that Pochettino will continue this policy at White Hart Lane, and there . is no reason why he shouldn’t. Young hope: Spurs fans would like to see players like Tom Carroll given a chance . Time to go: Spurs fans were glad to see the back of Tim Sherwood as manager . The . likes of Tom Carroll, Nabil Bentaleb, Alex Pritchard, Harry Winks, Ryan . Fredericks and Musa Yahaya are all exciting young players, and players . who will be looking to get a chance under the new manager. I’m . excited; the fans needed a change of atmosphere after the diabolic . season we have just had to endure, and a manager like Pochettino is just . what we needed.

"Phil Bardsley has completed a move to Stoke after signing a three-and-a-half year deal after the out-of-contract defender opted to leave Sunderland. The 28-year-old Scotland international passed a medical in the Potteries to seal a switch from the Stadium of Light after six and a half years. The Black Cats had hopes to extend Bardsley’s stay on Wearside after re-opening contract talks after initial discussions came to nothing, but appear to have had to admit defeat. A new era: Phil Bardsley joins Stoke from Premier League rivals Sunderland . On the move: Phil Bardsley (right) is set to complete a switch to Stoke . Farewell: Bardsley is set to leave Sunderland after six-and-a-half years with the club . Bardsley joined Sunderland from home-town club Manchester United in a £2million switch in January 2008 after loan moves to Royal Antwerp, Burnley, Rangers, Aston Villa and Sheffield United and established himself as first-choice right back. However, he fell out of favour with former boss Paolo Di Canio and seemed destined to leave the club last summer, when only a foot injury scuppered a proposed move to Fulham. Di Canio took a dim view of the player being pictured lying on the floor of a casino covered in £50 notes, and was even less impressed with an ill-advised tweet after the club’s 1-0 home defeat by Fulham, on the opening day of the Barclays Premier League season. However, he was handed a clean slate by new manager Gus Poyet after he replaced the controversial Italian in October last year, and rehabilitated himself to such an extent that he started the Capital One Cup final against Manchester City in March. Manager Mark Hughes believes Bardsley will be a valuable addition to his squad. He told the club website: 'I'm really pleased to bring Phil in to the club. He's a player of great Premier League experience who I think will bring added quality to the squad. 'He has plenty of qualities that will improve us and help move the Football club forward to where we want to be. 'Phil was genuinely excited to join and I'm delighted to bring him in as his personality and desire will shine in the dressing room.'","Phil Bardsley completes his move to Stoke from Sunderland .

"The BBC was last night refusing to say whether DJ Mike Read’s ‘racist’ Ukip Calypso track would be played in full on the radio tomorrow if it remained in the Top 40. The song, which Mr Read pulled after it caused an uproar, was ranked at 21 in the official midweek charts. The former Radio 1 DJ puts on a Jamaican accent to praise Ukip in the Caribbean-style track which has led to accusations of racism. A BBC spokesman last night said: ‘The song is not currently on our playlist and, as the chart is compiled at the end of the week, we cannot say what will be in the Official Chart on Sunday.’ Scroll down for video . DJ Mike Read (pictured) has asked his record company to pull the Ukip Calypso track from sale . His Ukip anthem, sung in a Jamaican accent, warns of 'illegal immigrants in every town' Earlier this week, BBC Berkshire host Mr Read apologised and asked his record company to withdraw his song. But the track was still available to download for 79p on Amazon.co.uk last night. Mr Read said he felt ‘absolutely terrible’ that people might have been offended. He said the Ukip anthem – sung in a Jamaican accent warning of ‘illegal immigrants in every town’ – had been intended as just ‘a bit of fun’. ‘I don’t have a racist bone in my body,’ he added. The BBC faced the same dilemma last year when the Wizard of Oz song ‘Ding Dong! The Witch is Dead’ reached number two in the Official Chart following the death of Lady Margaret Thatcher. Radio 1 ended up playing a seven-second soundbite of the 1939 song accompanied by a news report on the anti-Thatcher campaign.","The BBC stated it 'cannot say what will be in the Official Chart on Sunday'

"There is a wistful look on the chiselled features of Carl Froch as he holds his year-old daughter Natalia on his lap. George Groves would be unwise to seize upon the tender mood of this photograph, taken by Froch’s partner Rachael Cordingley, as indication that the man he is about to fight in front of 80,000 people is going soft in his sixth year as a world champion. The moment is poignant because Froch has been rationing his cherished family time to the barest minimum during his two-and-a-half months of preparation for the re-match which will fill Wembley Stadium to throbbing capacity on Saturday night. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Froch: I've matched my training time from four years ago . Family time: Carl Froch takes a break from training to spend time with his baby Natalia ahead of his re-match with George Groves at Wembley next weekend . Baby Natalia was a distraction for the Nottingham Cobra prior to his controversial first fight with Groves in November. Now she has grown into an intense, additional incentive for him to put down the abrasive challenge from his fellow Englishman, this time for good and all. ‘I don’t like being away from Rachael and the kids,’ says Froch. ‘I didn’t think that sacrifice was necessary for the first fight with Groves so I stayed at home while training. The message is clear: Froch in his gym in Sheffield with the message 'Impossible is nothing' on the wall . ‘That was one of the corners I cut which made that night more difficult for me than it should have been. I’m not making that mistake again.’ The holder of the IBF and WBA super-middleweight titles has been spending most of his nights in spartan accommodation in Sheffield, submitting himself to the punishing regime devised by his trainer Rob McCracken. The diet is as disciplined as the extreme physical demands and the absolute concentration on the tactical and technical details of their fight plan. At the end of a hard day spent with him in the gym at the English Sports Institute, where McCracken also nurtures the British Olympians who landed a shoal of medals at the London Games, he allows himself a visit to a local Italian restaurant. This rare treat amounts to half a chicken breast ‘grilled plain, no oil’ and a small side salad ‘no lettuce, one ounce of vinegar dressing on the side  just in case’ washed down with chilled water. Not that this man o’ war ever has difficult scaling on or below the 12 stone limit: ‘Nah, I could come in on the weight in the morning and wish I could fight him tomorrow night.’ Rather, he keeps himself lean and hungry as he continues to consolidate his family’s future. The Forbes Rich List estimates Froch’s net worth as between $20 to $30 million (£12m-£18m). Whatever the exact figure, the record Wembley gate for boxing and Sky pay-TV sales will boost it by at least £5m. He has earned every penny and dime the hard way. This second encounter with Groves is his 12th  consecutive world championship fight and he has slugged it out with all the finest super-middleweights on earth, beating all but one of them. On the back foot: Froch admits he was not at his best when he fought Groves last year . Flat on his back: Froch was put on the canvas by Groves in the first round last time . Yet it took him time to catch the public imagination and build his earnings base. He recalls: ‘I got about thirty grand for each of my first couple of title fights. But I didn’t waste the money. I bought two small houses in a part of Nottingham which wasn’t very fashionable at the time and rented them out. They’ve paid for themselves now.’ The Froch property portfolio has grown in parallel with his rise in purse-power and he says: ‘First I had Rachael and myself to look after. Then my great lad Rocco came along and now we have Natalia as this lovely extra reminder to me to provide for them for the rest of their lives. ‘I’m fighting for the future of the whole family and I’m not done yet. Not by a long chalk.’ Nor is money the only spur. Fighting passion burns deep inside this man of war-hardened Polish descent, as does pride in being a world champion. Warrior spirit: Froch clawed his way back into the fight and put pressure on Groves . Controversial ending: Referee Howard Foster stopped the fight in Froch's favour in the ninth round . It is those professional instincts which reinforce the most resilient chin in the prize-ring, that granite jaw which enables him to get up from sledge-hammer punches like the one with which Groves floored him in the first round in November and hit back to win. As Froch is pushing himself in training Anthony Joshua, Britain’s super-heavyweight Olympic champion, arrives at the sports centre to help prepare some of McCracken’s GB team for this summer’s Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Joshua is excited to be on the Wembley undercard but he jokes with Froch: ‘Not getting as much as you.’ Froch grins and says: ‘Don’t worry about the money yet Big Josh. I wasn’t earning a lot when I became world champion. I’m getting my rewards now. Concentrate on the prize. For you that’s the world heavyweight title. Get that and everything else follows.’ Start of the journey: Anthony Joshua has set out on his quest to become heavyweight champion of the world . But lose those belts and Froch, at coming up 37, knows it would be a hard road back to the summit. That is one reason why he is pounding the Tarmac with dervish zeal. The furore over his somewhat premature stoppage of Groves, when Saint George of London was ahead on the scorecards going into the ninth round, has resulted in a return bout which will smash to smithereens all box office records for boxing in Britain. The controversy also drives Froch on and up the lung-bursting hills of his regular dawn runs. And no corner-cutting this time. Showing his class: Froch beat Danish boxer Mikkel Kessler in their re-match at the O2 last year . Brutal: Froch beat Lucian Bute in emphatic style back in 2012 . He says: ‘Groves tries to make fun of me keeping my charts and diaries. Well, sport is a science now, George. ‘Before our first fight I didn’t get close to my best times. Now I’m going five or six seconds faster, partly  by accelerating to the top of the steepest gradient of all, a 1 in 4. ‘I couldn’t believe it when I broke my own records.’ If you don’t apply the science, Froch discovered five months ago, the human fighting machine slows down. ‘I have to be honest with you,’ he says. ‘I did most of my running last time on the treadmill. No matter what anyone tries to tell you, it’s not the same. Hold it together: Groves tries to get into Froch's head by whispering in his ear . Push off: Froch's head to head with Groves turned physical at Wembley earlier in the year . ‘I took Groves for granted. I was only at 80 per cent of my best.  If he thinks it will be the same fight over again he’s in for a big surprise. ‘My resting pulse rate is back down to 36, I feel again the way  I’ve usually felt since I became world champion. Like never mind 12 rounds,  I’m your old-fashioned 15-round fighter. ‘Not George.  He did well for six rounds against me but then the tide turned. He weakened as I got back into it. He can’t take the pressure. As I began hitting him with big shots he crumbled. Maybe it was stopped early but it was only a matter of time. ‘He’s one of those who goes into the 10th, 11th and 12th rounds seeing the finishing line and hoping to get through it. Not when you’re a world champion. Not me. That’s when I’m coming to get you.’ Froch admits allowed Groves to get under his skin with his mind games, lost his temper and his focus. He has responded by employing a sports psychologist to ensure he fights with his brain not his emotions on Saturday. Support: Froch is backed every step of the way by his partner Rachael Cordingley . Glamour couple: Froch and Rachael have been together for a number of years . What does Groves keep whispering in his ear? ‘He keeps telling me to try to hold it together,’ says Froch. ‘Hold it together? How many world title fights have I had? He’s had the one and even at my worst I found a way to beat him. ‘So I'm cool now. He no longer bothers me. I’m only interested in being on top of my game and boxing a smart fight.’ Groves has come across as bright and articulate - Machiavellian even - during their grating exchanges. Froch is intelligent, too. That depth is evident when you ask if he thinks Groves is truly convinced when he says he is certain to win second time around. The Cobra hisses: ‘I like this quotation: You can’t get a fool to question his wisdom.’ Other questions were left hanging in the chill Manchester night air when referee Howard Foster abruptly interrupted their violent dialogue. Froch believes he has all the answers. Froch-Groves II will be televised live Saturday night, May 31, on Sky Sports Box Office .","Froch fighting George Groves at Wembley next Saturday .

"King Leo, an obese cat who had lost 10lbs since being found abandoned on the side of a road this summer, has died. The feline, who weighed 30lbs when he was rescued in Nashville, Tennessee, passed away Wednesday morning after going into cardiac arrest.

"Soil microbes that thrive in the deserts, rainforests, prairies and forests of the world can also be found living beneath New York City's Central Park, researchers have discovered. Scientists were stunned to find thousands of different microbes in samples they analysed - the majority being new to science. Only 8.5 percent to 16.2 percent of the organisms discovered in the park soils, depending on their type, had been previously entered into existing databases that describe microbial life . Scientists find one of the most diverse ecosystems on earth - in the soil of New York's Central Park. They analyzed 596 soil samples collected from across Central Park’s 843 acres . The types of plants and animals that are able to live in a particular biome, like the desert, are largely determined by the climate. But microbes appear to be more concerned about the environment in the soil, such as the acidity and the carbon availability, than how hot or dry the climate is. This allows diverse microbial communities to thrive wherever the soil conditions are equally diverse - such as in Central Park. 'We found thousands of different organisms, and it was shocking how few had ever been described,' said Noah Fierer of CU-Boulder, who led the study. 'Not only do they not have a name, but we don't know anything about them. 'We don't know what sort of conditions they like to live under or what role they may play in soil habitat and soil fertility.' The research team analyzed 596 soil samples collected from across Central Park’s 843 acres and discovered a stunning diversity of below-ground life, most of which had never been documented before. The team was surprised to find that the breadth of biodiversity beneath Central Park is similar to the biodiversity found across the world, from the frozen Artic tundra to hot deserts and nearly everything in between. Only 8.5 percent to 16.2 percent of the organisms discovered in the park soils, depending on their type, had been previously entered into existing databases that describe microbial life, according to the study results published today in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. 'If you want to find unique diversity and if you want to find a wide range of different below-ground organisms, you don't have to travel around the world,' said Fierer, who is also a fellow at the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences. 'You can walk across Central Park.' The types of plants and animals that are able to live in a particular biome, like the desert, are largely determined by the climate. But microbes appear to be more concerned about the environment in the soil, such as the acidity and the carbon availability, than how hot or dry the climate is. This allows diverse microbial communities to thrive wherever the soil conditions are equally diverse. The only area that did not have soil microbial communities that overlapped with the samples taken from Central Park was Antarctica, where Wall has done extensive research. 'No one would ever expect to find an overlap in the types of trees we see in Central Park and the type of trees we see in a tropical forest,' Fierer said. 'But that doesn't seem to be true for the microbes living in the soil. We found all these community types just within Central Park. 'Below-ground biodiversity doesn't follow the same rules as the plants and animals living above ground.' 'The soil microbes in Central Park benefit us, benefit soil health, and are linked tightly to the beauty of the trees and other plants we see,' said Professor Diana Wall. The team was surprised to find that the breadth of biodiversity beneath Central Park is similar to the biodiversity found across the world, from the frozen Artic tundra to hot deserts and nearly everything in between. 'The nation's food, cities, clean air and water and economy are all dependent on healthy, fertile soils and that motivates us to understand this fascinating hidden life beneath our feet.' The scientists also compared the below-ground biodiversity in Central Park to 52 soil samples taken from locations spanning the globe, from Alaska to Antarctica. The team was surprised to find that the breadth of biodiversity beneath Central Park is similar to the biodiversity found across the world, from the frozen Artic tundra to hot deserts and nearly everything in between. The only area that did not have soil microbial communities that overlapped with the samples taken from Central Park was Antarctica, where Wall has done extensive research.","Research team analyzed 596 soil samples collected from across Central Park’s 843 acres .

"She is known for her reluctance to take on the role of a traditional Westminster wife. And Nick Clegg’s wife Miriam showed her independent spirit today as she shunned the convention of embracing her husband on stage after his conference speech. Rather than going up to the podium to fawn over her husband, as has become tradition for politicians’ wives, Mrs Clegg, who uses her maiden name, Gonzalez Durantez, waited for him to join her on the conference hall floor. Down he comes: Nick Clegg’s wife Miriam showed her independent spirit today as she shunned the convention of embracing her husband on stage after his conference speech and waited for him to come to her . After waving to the hall full of enthusiastic members, Mr Clegg stepped down from the stage to hug his wife. Mrs Clegg, 46, who is a successful lawyer, wore a business-like white shirt with an £89 yellow below-the-knee wool mohair skirt with folded front pleat from Cos and gold shoes from Spanish brand Uterqüe. Last year, before his conference speech, Mr Clegg said: ‘I have not been successful yet in persuading [my wife] Miriam to march up to the stage and look admiringly at me. ‘But I will certainly come down from the stage and look admiringly at her, as I always do.’ Doing it her way: Rather than going up to the podium like other politicians' wives, Mrs Clegg, who uses her maiden name, Gonzalez Durantez, waited for him to join her on the conference hall floor . Come to me: After waving to the hall full of enthusiastic members, Mr Clegg stepped down from the stage to hug his wife . After Ed Miliband’s speech, the Labour leader was forced to brush off an embarrassing mishap after moving in to kiss wife Justine - who pulled away at the crucial moment. The gaffe occurred when he brought her to the centre of the stage to wave to the crowd and cameras. The pair managed to laugh off the mishap and later had a peck on the lips to make up for it. During the 2010 general election, Mrs Clegg spent less time on the campaign trail than fellow leaders' wives Sarah Brown and Samantha Cameron. She said she was too busy as the partner of a law firm and mother of three young children. Admiring wife: Last year, before his conference speech, Mr Clegg said: 'I will certainly come down from the stage and look admiringly at her, as I always do' What's so funny? Maria appeared to be in a fit of giggle as she listened to her husband deliver his keynote speech to delegates . In a rare interview about her personal life earlier this week, Spanish-born Mrs Clegg revealed that the Deputy Prime Minister shares the house work with her and said they tried to ensure that at least one of them was home with the children every evening. Asked by Sky News if she was an example of how women can ‘have it all’, she said: ‘I never understand what people mean when they say “having it all”. ‘I personally have never wanted to “have it all” as a general aim. I just want to have what men have. ‘Lots of men have a successful professional life - or what looks like success to them - and they fit it together with a family and that is what I want to have. ‘There will be other women who don't want that. It is different for different women and different men. ‘But childcare is an issue, obviously. And I think that, as (Facebook chief operating officer) Sheryl Sandberg said, the most important decision of your life is who you decide to have children with."" ‘There are lots of couples who share more and more (housework), there are lots of men now who are fully engaged with raising the children.’ Power woman: In a rare interview about her personal life earlier this week, Spanish-born Mrs Clegg revealed that the Deputy Prime Minister shares the house work with her . Samantha Cameron may have earned her title as first lady of fashion thanks to her constant on-trend outfit choices but it seems that Miriam  is keen to give her a run for her money in the style stakes. Miriam made a bold style statement today as she joined her husband at the Liberal Democrat Party Conference at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre, Glasgow. The 46-year-old showed off her slender figure in a vibrant £89 yellow skirt, which she teamed with a tailored white shirt, both from Cos, and a pair of beige suede court shoes from Spanish brand Uterqüe.

Tradition: Miriam can be seen with her husband Nick Clegg celebrating last year's speech on the conference party floor . Style statement: Miriam Clegg made her way to the Liberal Democrat Party Conference with husband Nick Clegg in a vibrant  yellow skirt and crisp white shirt . The high-flying lawyer, who had obviously had a bouncy blow-dry for the occasion, appeared in high spirits as she walked hand-in-hand with her husband, who was en route to deliver his keynote speech to conference delegates. Miriam's choice of colour is certainly bang on trend. The bright canary hue is the colour du jour this season and whether it's sherbet, buttercup or mustard, it's hard to go wrong. Plus, the midi style is the only cut to wear for AW14. By teaming it with a tailored shirt, Miriam was also ticking off the androgynous trend, too. Her friend Samantha Cameron is also a huge fan of the style and has been sporting manly shirts over the last few weeks. Androgynous dressing is certainly the style de rigeur. The high street has witnessed sales of trouser suits soar by 157 per cent after recent awards ceremonies such as the Baftas and the Oscars, where fashion's finest were championing the trend.

In good spirits: The 46-year-old Spanish native showed off her slender figure in a vibrant yellow skirt, which she teamed with a tailored white shirt and a pair of beige suede court shoes - a style loved by SamCam and the Duchess of Cambridge . Style icons Cara Delevingne, Kourtney Kardashian, Madonna and Ellen Degeneres have been embracing the manly look since the start of the year. Although the look has been a celebrity favourite on the red carpet, it has crossed over into everyday wear with sales of plain black and navy trouser suits up by 157 per cent along with white shirts increasing by 105 per cent at Debenhams. Bang on trend: Miriam was also ticking off the androgynous trend with her taulored shirt - her friend Samantha Cameron is also a huge fan of the style . Bouncing along: The working mother had obviously had also had her hair styled in a bouncy blow dry for the occasion . Out and about: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, his wife Miriam and Jo Swinson MP visit Castlehill Primary School  in Glasgow, Scotland. Mr Clegg is visiting Castlehill Primary School  to highlight  the Liberal Democrat free school meals and childcare policies . High flyer: With a successful career in her own right as a lawyer, marriage to the Deputy Prime Minister and three young children, Mrs Clegg, 46, is often seen as living proof that women are able to 'have it all' Spanish style: Mrs Clegg chose jeans, shoes from Zara and a red printed top from Spanish brand Dolores Promesas for the visit . Bright shoes: Mrs Clegg attended an 'Inspiring Women in Scotland' event at New College in Kirkintilloch, Lanarkshire as her husband hosted his party conference in Glasgow . Flashback! Miriam also wore the bright orange shoes back in 2012 . It was one of the biggest days for the Prime Minister as he unveiled plans for the Tory government after the 2015 election at the party's conference last week. So as his number one cheerleader, his wife Samantha made sure she dressed up for the occasion. Perhaps fittingly, as her husband promised to scrap income tax, Samantha opted for an austerity-busting high street dress by Hobbs. The lilac Penrose Wrap dress retails for £149, but is currently in the online sale for £99. She teamed the dress with grey court shoes from LK Bennett and a healthy glow. Earlier in the week she look chic in an on-trend black midi skirt, paired with a khaki silk blouse and black heels as she arrived to watch her husband rehearse. On arrival in Birmingham, however, Samantha, 43, embraced a more androgynous style in a pinstriped blue and white shirt, not dissimilar to the one her husband David was sporting, dark cord trousers and navy heels, the mother-of-three exuded an understated yet chic style. Lady in lilac: Samantha Cameron joined her husband on stage at the Conservative party conference wearing a £99 Hobbs dress and grey court shoes . Trendsetter?

"The wife of a controversial MP says she has forgiven her husband despite his plonking and porn scandals. The Liberal National Party's member for the Queensland seat of Redlands, Peter Dowling, gained international notoriety when an explicit picture he sent to his mistress of two and a half years of his penis in a glass of red wine went public. In a pre-selection meeting at Redlands Community on Saturday, he was given the flick by local branch members, who voted 'no' to allow the MP to stand for them in the next state election. Redlands MP, Peter Dowling (pictured left) with his wifer Helen (pictured right) Mr Dowling has been dumped by local branch members . 'He may not be perfect but he is effective,' said wife Helen (pictured) who is standing by her husband .

The Courier Mail reported a shattered Mr Dowling was dumped by 55 votes against, compared to 38 votes for. For the first time since the scandal Mr Dowling's wife, Helen, spoke out, standing by her husband of more than 25 years. 'There would be very few people here that actually could say they are perfect,' Mrs Dowling said. 'He may not be perfect but he is effective.' Mr Dowling who was chairman of parliament's ethics committee was forced to resign last year after details surfaced of his affair and sexting scandal with his secret mistress. The Redlands MP was also close to being dropped by the state's executive this month but was spared.

"A proud homeowner was left terrified after taking a photo of her new house only to notice a ghost staring out from the window. Michelle Midwinter, 30, had gone outside to take a picture of her new home in North Bradley, Trowbridge, Wiltshire, to share with friends on her Facebook page. But it was only when she took another look at the image that she noticed the spooky apparition of a man peering out her window. Michelle Midwinter was taking a picture of her new home when she noticed a man's face in the window . The mother-of-one, who was at home with her two-year-old daughter, ran inside to discover that no one was there. Miss Midwinter, who moved into the house last month, believes the sighting could be the spirit of Samuel Kent - a former factory inspector who worked in the area. She said: 'I decided to take a picture of the front of our house and post it on Facebook to show how well we were all settling in. 'I went outside and took a picture but after initially admiring the brickwork the face just sort of jumped out at me. Miss Midwinter believes the apparition was spirit of factory inspector Samuel Kent who died in 1872 . 'I ran into the house to make sure no one was in there because I knew everyone else was at work, but it was just me and my two-year-old daughter. 'I studied the photo for a while and then put it on Facebook to see if anyone else could come up with an explanation as to how the face could have got there.' Miss Midwinter, a mobile phone case designer, added: 'The photo caused quite a stir on Facebook, but no one could really come up with any plausible explanation. 'Most people thought it was a reflection of the flowers below the window but the angles are all wrong.' 'It's hard to believe but it clearly looks like the face of an old man.' She denies claims the image has been doctored and after witnessing a number of ghostly goings on - including a clock falling off a wall - believes the house is haunted. 'I'm a self-confessed non-believer of ghosts but the picture coupled with a clock randomly falling off the wall and smashing to pieces that morning did creep me out,' she said. 'The clock was there when we moved in, so it hadn't fallen off due to a dodgy fixture we had put up. 'Another weird thing was that my friend saw a door handle move down and the door opened in the same room the face in the window was in. 'I was just so surprised because I thought someone was in the house. We also checked the attic to make sure no one was living up there. Miss Midwinter moved into the house in Trowbridge, Wiltshire, last month and had wanted to share pictures of her new home with friends on Facebook when she discovered the chilling image . The room where the spirit was peering out the window when Miss Midwinter went outside to take a picture . 'I can't really say what I think the face in the window is as I honestly don't know. 'I would like to say an odd reflection but it doesn't make sense, I am a very logical person but I cannot come up with a logical explanation for this photo, it's just spooky. 'And to be honest, I would rather not think about it as we already hear strange scratches in the walls, noises from upstairs and the lights flicker on and off to. Michelle Midwinter with her two-year-old daughter who was at home when she spotted the 'ghost' 'You end up scaring yourself if you think about it too much.' Local historian Andrew Jones, 50, has done extensive research into Samuel Kent, the father of Constance Kent, who brutally murdered her three-year-old brother when she was 16 in the nearby village of Rode in 1860. He thinks the photograph of the shadowy ghoul, dubbed Old Man Kent, bears a striking resemblance to Samuel Kent, who died in 1872. Mr Jones, who is a caretaker at John of Gaunt School in Trowbridge, said: 'From looking at the photograph, to me it looks like Samuel Kent, father of Constance Kent, who committed an infamous murder in the area. 'There are a number of reported ghost sightings in Trowbridge but I have not come across any in North Bradley. 'I know Samuel lived and worked as a factory inspector in the area, so there's every chance it could be him.' Mr Kent was originally a suspect in the 1860 Rode Hill House murder, but his daughter, Constance, was arrested and eventually convicted of murdering his three-year-old son. The Rode Hill House murder case found fame again in recent years thanks to Kate Summerscale's award-winning book The Suspicions of Mr Whicher. The sighting comes after a spate of reports that ghosts have been popping up in photographs across the nation, most recently at Cannock Chase in the Midlands, where a black-eyed ghost child was caught on camera.

Alleged misconduct: Mary Gilles, 28, was arrested at her apartment in Austin, Minnesota, after allegedly engaging in a sexual relationship with an underage male student at Pachelli High School . Leaders at the diocese say it is their policy to try and identify any misconduct and immediateely report it to authorities. 'Our prayers go out to those who have suffered child sexual abuse and who have been harmed,' the Diocese of Winona told KMSP in a statement. 'We encourage anyone with information regarding child sexual abuse to immediately report that information to law enforcement and we remain committed to protect all God's children.' Officials at the school confirmed the student was male, but refused to comment further.

"A drugged up man who shot at police with a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun after a six-hour manhunt with his partner in crime has been jailed for seven years. Cameron James Brasher, 26, and his girlfriend Tereza Anne Loone, 28, taunted police after they stole a hire car and drove from a car park at Arthur’s Lake to the Tasmanian town of Poatina, 60 km from Launceston, on February 25 while berserk on methamphetamine. High on ice during a ‘two to three month meth binge’, Loone posted a selfie of her and Brasher, on Facebook before he shot at police from the smashed window of the car. Scroll down for video . Cameron James Brasher (left) has been jailed for seven years. His girlfriend Tereza Anne Loone (right) posted this selfie on Facebook while police were trying to stop them . In the disturbing photo, the pair, dressed in singlets and covered in tattoos, appear sweaty as they stick out their tongues for the camera. It took 30 police vehicles, a helicopter and a 35km car chase on punctured tyres from police spikes before Brasher came to a stop, The Mercury reported. When he did, he carelessly fired at police and when one officer, Constable Adrian Ayres, tried to arrest him he attempted to grab the officer’s gun off him. During sentencing at the Supreme Court in Launceston on Wednesday, Justice Robert Pearce said: ‘It was extremely fortunate that police officers had not suffered serious injury. When he was fired at, Constable Ayres feared for his life.’ Police were engaged in a six-hour siege while trying to apprehend Brasher and Loone . Brasher told the court he was upset over a custody battle when he carried out the terrifying crime. He pleaded guilty to reckless use of a firearm, evading police, three counts of aggravated assault, resisting and threatening police, firearm offences and three counts of stealing. Back in September, Loone was handed just a $900 fine for her part in the incident. Police alleged they spoke to Loone on the phone during the siege, who essentially told them ‘back off or we will shoot’, The Examiner reported. Brasher was sentenced to seven years in jail at the Supreme Court in Launceston on Wednesday . Their friends were seen leaving court after the sentencing this week . The Bonnie and Clyde style couple’s stolen Ford Falcon was just 10 metres away from a police car when Brasher fired two shots at officers. When Loone appeared in court her defence solicitor Emily Judd, said that the 28-year-old had little memory of the time. However, she said Loone remembered discouraging Brasher from committing suicide when he ‘was sitting beside the shallow grave that he had dug for himself’. Police Association of Tasmania president Pat Allen told Daily Mail Australia they are pleased that Brasher was convicted but only 'reasonably pleased with the sentencing'. 'The effects on Adrian have been quite profound. He is not back to fully operational duty yet and doesn't want to be,' Mr Allen said. 'It's not as if he's not confident or capable, he is a brave man but what he is afraid of now is how he will react if it happens again.' Mr Allen explained that Constable Ayres showed great restraint during the incident and did not shoot back at Brasher. The Police Association boss said ice is an 'epidemic Australia wide'. He warned that police have been given no training on how to handle people on the dangerous drug and 'crime rates are going up again in Tasmania'. 'Ice has become a real issue to officers on the street,' he said. 'I think the whole of Australia are suffering resource wise, I can see the problem getting bigger and bigger.' It took 30 police vehicles, a helicopter and a 35km car chase on punctured tyres from Arthurs Lake to the Great Western Tiers before Brasher came to a stop .","Cameron James Brasher, 26, was jailed for seven years on Wednesday .

A scene from the Final Fantasy XIII-2 installment which is played on the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 consoles . Final Fantasy is a long running Japanese fantasy role-playing game. The massively successful series is comprised of 15 installments, although there have been countless spin offs for other gaming platforms as well as several movies based on its characters and the world they inhabit. First created in 1987, players take on the role of a character inside a fictional universe usually filled with fantasy creatures similar to Lord of the Rings, in which good characters and species use magic, sorcery and brawn to battle villains and other evils. The series is famed for its depth, in which the gamer is immersed into the characters' lives, with a plot that canvasses typical human emotions and experiences such as tragedy, death, love and anger. Players are motivated by the opportunity to develop their characters with 'experience', making them more powerful and allowing them to use better weapons or magic powers. Experience is typically gained by killing enemies and progressing through the plot. Ms Iglesias' inspiration behind her records came from wanting to be recognised as a 'good gamer' and to grant her more exposure on her Youtube channel, where she also shares videos of her singing. Other new gaming record holders include a Tomb Raider fanatic, a Minecraft addict and a German teenager with the highest score on FIFA. Spaniard Rodrigo Martin Santos owns a staggering 2,383 related Tomb Raider items which has earned him the record for the Largest Collection of Tomb Raider Memorabilia. The 27-year-old's collection includes the original costume worn by model Rhona Mitra in Tomb Raider 2 and a life size Lara Croft and Rose statue, of which only 50 were made. Perhaps one of the most quirky new entries is Austrian Minecraft endurance player Martin Fornleitner, 19. He played the phenomenally successful crafting game for a staggering 24 hours and 10 minutes on his Sony Xperia Play handset, earning him the record for the Longest Videogame Marathon on Minecraft. He achieved the record in a glass container watched by the public in Vienna back in 2011 and claimed tiredness was his biggest battle throughout the record attempt. But the score to make FIFA fans around the world envious was achieved by German Patrick Hadler, aged 19, from Hannover. The teenager holds the title for the Highest Margin of Victory against the Computer on FIFA World Cup 2014 with a 321-0 scoreline. Patrick believes commitment, focus and a keen eye for goal was at the heart of his success and wanting to 'feel as good as the real life Germany football team'.

A Polish man has set a new world record for the longest ever individual video game session by managing to play a Second World War sniper game for 141 hours and 41 minutes before finally giving up. Hubert 'Gordon' Blejch picked the shooter game Sniper Elite 3 as his game of choice to set the world record, which was carried out at the Poznan Gaming Arena event in the western Polish city of Poznan. Mr Blejch was allowed a ten-minute break every hour, which he used to make trips to the bathroom, have medical check-ups, receive massages and take very short naps. He originally wanted to man the controls for a week, but fatigue got the better of him and he gave in. Craig Glenday, the Editor in-Chief of Guinness World Records, said: 'Gaming is so dynamic and fast-moving that there's never any shortage of exciting new superlatives for Guinness World Records to explore.

"A father has been charged with voluntary manslaughter after shooting a man he found hiding in his daughter's bedroom in the head. Charles Jordan, 41, killed Marc Carrion, 32, in September believing that Mr Carrion had broken into his daughter's room at their apartment in Philadelphia. In fact his daughter, Brenda Jordan, 20, had been dating Mr Carrion for a month, and told police she invited him up to her room. Charles Jordan, 41, has been charged with voluntary manslaughter after shooting Marc Carrion, 32, in the head in September after mistaking him for an intruder . Jordan found Mr Carrion in his daughter Brenda's room, and believed he had broken in. However, Brenda has since told police the pair were dating for a month and she invited him up . When Jordan walked into his daughter's room, he saw there was something wrong with the window, before noticing Mr Carrion crouching in a corner. In a recording of a 911 call made at the time, Jordan can be heard telling Mr Carrion not to move before a single shot is fired. Jordan claims that he opened fire after Mr Carrion lunged at him. Mr Carrion was taken to hospital, but later died of his injuries. Neighbours reported hearing a woman shouting 'no, daddy, no' at the time of the shooting. The case against Jordan says he killed Mr Carrion 'while acting under a sudden and intense passion, resulting from serious provocation by the deceased'. Crime scene: The shooting took place inside the Jordans' apartment at the Holme Circle housing complex . Jordan, a hotel worker with no priors, was arraigned on Monday and released after posting $15,000 bail. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for November 11. Jordan's attorney, Todd Henry, told The Philadelphia Inquirer that Jordan 'regrets what happened' but 'maintains his innocence.' Mr Henry added: 'He realizes what happened that night was a tragedy, but the actions only happened because he felt threatened in his home, and he feared for his personal safety and his daughter's personal safety.' At the time of the shooting, Marc Carrion's mother, Gloria Moyett, told the Philadelphia Daily News that Charles Jordan’s story about an intruder did not make sense to her. Romance: Jordan and Carrion had met only recently, and on the night of the killing a neighbor overheard the 20-year-old tell her father that the victim was her 'best friend' ‘He's with your daughter, she's not screaming, and you shoot him just because you don't know him?’ she said. Moyett said her 32-year-old son a troubled past, including a drug arrest in 2008, but he had been working hard to rebuild his life. Carrion is survived by three young children from a previous relationship.","Charles Jordan, 41, charged with voluntary manslaughter over shooting .

"For many people, discarded chewing gum is filthy rubbish that costs thousands to clean off the pavements. But for one street artist, a piece of gum left on the road is a tiny canvas onto which he can paint a miniature masterpiece. Talented Ben Wilson can spend as long as 10 hours hunched over the gum painting his eye-catching, colourful pictures on to the sticky surface, which measure no more than an inch in length. Street artist Ben Wilson uses discarded chewing gum left on the roads in north London as his artwork canvas . The talented artist said he took up his 'pavement art' hobby to brighten his neighbourhood in Muswell Hill . He spends up to 10 hours carefully painting each piece of chewing gum to turn it into a unique piece of art . He starts by heating the gum with a small blow torch, then adds lacquer to harden the chewy substance. His designs are then added with special acrylic paints. Mr Wilson started his bizarre hobby as a way of brightening up his neighbourhood in Muswell Hill, north London, and has since created his ‘pavement art’ throughout the UK and abroad. His most recent work has seen him decorate the unsightly mess across Sunderland as part of the Cultural Spring Project, which is bringing art to council wards across the north of the city and in South Tyneside. Mr Wilson starts by heating the gum with a small blow torch, then adds lacquer to harden the chewy substance . He creates each piece of artwork by using acrylic paints and spends whole days hunched over the used gum . His most recent work has seen him decorate the unsightly mess across Sunderland as part of the Cultural Spring Project, which is bringing art to council wards across the north of the city and in South Tyneside . The artist ventured into the city centre last week, where his unique take on the art form proved an immediate hit with the public. 'Ben has been doing this for about 10 or 12 years and before that he was a wood sculptor, so he has always been involved with recycled art,' said Cultural Spring’s Garry Hunter. 'The reaction to his work is incredibly positive - no-one has ever seen anything like it before. 'It is all about bringing art out of the gallery and onto the street. Cultural Spring’s Garry Hunter said: 'It is all about bringing art out of the gallery and onto the street' Mr Wilson, a former wood sculptor, has been decorating discarded chewing gum for the last 10 to 12 years . Since starting his hobby in north London, the creative artist has taken his 'pavement art' around the world . Mr Hunter said: 'Ben’s happy to talk to anyone, so if you see a man lying on the pavement, come and say hello' “There is a pretentiousness about a lot of art that can be intimidating. 'What we are doing is taking it out on to the streets so that everybody can see it and everybody can enjoy it.

"Viagra should be routinely prescribed to prevent heart attacks and strokes, researchers claimed last night. The anti-impotence pills can drastically improve the functioning of men’s hearts, Italian scientists found. They said men with heart failure who happened to be taking Viagra had far more efficient hearts than other patients. Scroll down for video . Scientists in Italy have found the drug has helped men with enlarged heart conditions and are calling for tests to be carried out on women . Among those with an enlarged heart due to a condition called left ventricular hypertrophy, the drug also stopped their hearts growing even bigger, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. Experts believe a key ingredient in Viagra called PDE5i, which relaxes blood vessels, also prevents damage to heart cells. A team from Sapienza University in Rome looked at 24 studies involving 1,622 men, and published the findings in the journal BMC Medicine. Lead researcher Andrea Isidori called for the drug to be tested on women with heart disease, and said that if the results of larger studies matched his findings, Viagra could be prescribed for heart conditions. He added: ‘We found that the main ingredient in Viagra can be used as an effective, safe treatment. Large clinical trials are now urgently needed to build on these encouraging findings.’ Some doctors have suggested the drug be routinely prescribed to men suffering heart conditions . Some 180,000 men are prescribed Viagra and other anti-impotence pills, while many more buy them online. But after Viagra’s patent ran out recently, other drug firms were able to produce cheaper, non-branded versions. The NHS subsequently relaxed its rules, enabling it to be prescribed to any men with serious impotence. Previously, it was only given to those with impotence as a side-effect of illness or treatment such as chemotherapy. The price of copycat drugs is now just £1.45 for four tablets, compared to four of Pfizer’s Viagra pills at £21.27.","Italian scientists found drug improved health of men with certain conditions .

"Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced last night that an ‘army’ of 18,000 people would be deployed by the health service to provide social care to the growing ageing population . A fund to give the elderly better and more dignified care at home is being boosted to £5billion a year, it emerged last night. Ministers plan to join up health and care services to improve home care as well as cut A&E admissions and hospital stays, helping to save £532million. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced last night that an ‘army’ of 18,000 people would be deployed by the health service to provide social care to the growing ageing population. The Better Care Fund is intended to prevent 2,000 people a year being admitted to expensive nursing homes and also prevent 160,000 hospital admissions every year, he said. The fund was first announced by the Government in June 2013, with a value of £3.8billion – but the figure has been increased to £5.3billion each year, which will fund thousands more care workers. Mr Hunt said it constituted a ‘transformation’ in how healthcare is delivered by moving to a system which ‘helps people stay healthy and happy at home’ rather than centred on hospital stays. The Government has already promised to protect spending on the health service in the next parliament if they win the next election. But the Health Secretary suggested some of it would be diverted into a three-pillar plan to adapt to the needs of an ageing society. He said by 2015, there would be a million more over 65s than in 2010, with long-term conditions such as dementia, diabetes or arthritis. ‘The first pillar of our plan is to change the basic NHS model from one centred on hospital care to one that helps people stay healthy and happy at home,’ he said. ‘Prevention is better than cure – not just for the patient, but for the NHS that picks up the tab when things go wrong.’ The scheme will begin in 151 council areas, and he said it would save the NHS more than £500million in just one year. The Better Care Fund is intended to prevent 2,000 people a year being admitted to expensive nursing homes and also prevent 160,000 hospital admissions every year. File picture . The next two pillars of the scheme are to improve efficiency with better IT systems and giving patients access to their own medical records, and changing the health service ‘culture’ to ensure doctors and nurses ‘put patients first’, he said. ‘Too often doctors and nurses have felt frustrated by a culture that stops them putting patients first,’ he writes. ‘We need to change the NHS so that openness about outcomes becomes the norm and we are better at stopping the estimated 12,000 avoidable deaths we still have in the NHS every year.’ Liz Kendall, Labour’s spokesman for care and older people, said: ‘Patients and taxpayers urgently need more joined-up services that help keep people healthy and living at home, rather than ending up in hospital. ‘The Government’s Better Care Fund is depressingly unambitious. It only brings together around 4 per cent of the total we spend on the NHS and social care.’ The promise of better home care support comes only days after charity Age Concern hit out at government plans to restrict help for elderly people to only those who need help with two tasks or more.","Better Care Fund is also intended to prevent 2,000 people a year being admitted to expensive nursing homes .

"Nigel Farage said Ukip could see victory  next year as he hit the campaign trail for Tory defector Mark Reckless today. The party leader looked confident as he spoke with voters in Rochester and Strood this morning after suggesting Ukip had 'enough momentum' behind it to sway the general election in May. Mr Farage, who faced criticism this week for saying HIV-carriers should not be allowed in Britain, added he would not consider a pre-election pact with the Conservative party. Scroll down for video . Nigel Farage was flanked by Tory defectors Mark Reckless (left) and Douglas Carswell (right) as he spoke in Rochester and Strood where the former is standing as a Ukip candidate in a by-election . 'I think that Ukip's in a position now (where) we've got momentum behind us, we've shown we can win under first past the post,' he said. 'An awful lot can happen in seven months for all of us, bu there is a possibility, if we get this right, that we could get enough MPs into Westminster next year to hold the balance of power and that is exactly where I'd like Ukip to be.' The party leader was campaigning in Rochester and Strood on behalf of Mark Reckless, who announced his departure from the Conservatives at Ukip's party conference last month, triggering a by-election. He was the second MP to stray from Mr Cameron following Douglas Carswell's announcement to join Ukip in the summer. The MP for Clacton joined Mr Farage today where the party leader said he would target 'everybody' in his campaign next year. 'It is a possibilty': The party leader said Ukip had 'momentum' behind it following the election of Douglas Carswell (right) in Clacton . Mr Farage added he 'didn't believe a word' David Cameron said and would not consider a pre-election pact with the Conservative Party . 'Let's make the people's army of Ukip march on Rochester and Strood,' he urged. Later, Mr Farage dismissed suggestions of agreeing on a pre-election pact with David Cameron. 'If I was to call a silence and ask our activists here now whether they wanted a pre-election pact with the Conservatives I think I would need to be bundled into that room for my own safety. 'This party is not a splinter of the Conservative party. This party is its own organic force. 'We want to win our own representation in Westminster and we believe only by doing that can we fundamentally change British politics. 'To sell out so that one or two people can have ministerial positions is not what Ukip's about. Jubilant: Mr Farage congratulated the re-election of Douglas Carswell in Clacton (pictured) after the MP defected to UKIP earlier this year . 'I don't trust David Cameron. I don't believe a word David Cameron says and for that reason it would be fruitless to even enter into any negotiation.' The Conservatives have repeatedly told voters that backing Ukip splits the vote and would lead to a Labour victory. But Mr Farage again insisted that the election of Mr Carswell in Clacton shows that support for the party is not a wasted vote. He said: 'What we saw in Clacton was very clear. The people voted Ukip and they got Ukip.' Mark Reckless earlier spoke of backbench Tory MPs who he claimed were unhappy with their leadership. Speaking of his defection, he said he was a 'man of his word to the electorate'.","Ukip leader said party had 'momentum' behind it while campaigning .

"A deadly hospital superbug could be treated using capsules of frozen faeces from healthy people, a new study has found. The gut infection Clostridium difficule (C. difficile) can be life-threatening, especially in the elderly. But scientists in the US found introducing 'normal' gut bacteria from a healthy donor's excrement, rebalanced a C. difficile patient's system, curing their illness. They successfully cured 18 of 20 patients who took part in the study at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston of their diarrohea, improving their condition. A new study has found capsules of frozen facecal matter from healthy donors can cure C. difficile patients of their severe diarrhoea. Doctors in the US cured 18 of the 20 patients taking part in their research. (File picture) In healthy people the bacteria C. difficile lies harmlessly in the gut. But the feared infection is caused when antibiotics upset the balance of the intestines. While natural bacteria that protect against infection are decimated by the drugs, C. difficile multiply. The result is severe diarrhoea, which can cause fatal complications, including swelling of the bowel from a build-up of gas. The new research builds on a UK study published in 2012 where 'stool transplants' were used to restore the balance of the gut in mice suffering C. difficile. But the  methods used were invasive and presented problems for human patients. The researchers developed a method whereby they could freeze healthy stool samples, enclosing them in capsules for patients to swallow. They gave 20 patients 30 of the capsules, which contained gut bacteria from four healthy donors. The aim was to replace the illness-causing bacteria with non-harmful strains. The findings showed 14 of the 20 patients' diarrhoea was cured over an eight-week period. Of the six who showed no signs of getting better, they were retreated and four were subsequently cured. All the patients had suffered at least three bouts of mild to moderate C. difficile and failed to get better after being given standard antibiotics. Some had suffered two episodes of severe infection requiring hospital treatment. The patients ranged in age from 11 to 89. All the study participants were given two capsules on two consecutive days, and doctors followed them up six months later to see if their symptoms had resolved. Those taking part also reported an improvement in their overall health. Asked to rate their condition on a scale of one to 10, patients reported an improvement from an average of five before treatment, to eight after taking the capsules. The results have been hailed significant, due to C. difficile's resistant nature to antibiotics. But researchers warned 'larger studies are needed to confirm these results and to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness'. In healthy people C. difficile bacteria lies harmlessly in the gut. But some antibiotics can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the gut, decimating healthy bacteria that prevents infection, while allowing C. difficile, pictured under the microscope, to multiply, causing severe diarrhoea and potentially life-threatening complications . Dr Ilan Youngster from Boston Children's Hospital, who was also involved in the report, warned against people trying to create their own 'home brew' capsules. He told the BBC: 'The use of capsules simplifies the procedure immensely, potentially making it accessible to a greater population. 'But while we are striving to make this treatment more accessible to patients it is important to remind people of the potential dangers of attempting 'home brew' faecal microbiota transplant using faecal material from family members or friends. 'This procedure should only be performed under strict medical supervision with material from thoroughly screened donors.' Hospitals across the UK face monthly targets for both C. difficile rates as well as those of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). A spike in cases of the so-called 'hospital superbugs' forced the NHS to introduce the new infection-control measures in 2007. Since then the number of cases have fallen rapidly. NHS figures show there were 14, 687 reported cases of C. difficile in England from April 2012 to March 2013, compared with 52,988 in 2007. The study is published the Journal of the American Medical Association.","Introducing 'normal' gut bacteria from healthy donors' excrement helps 'rebalance' a C. difficile patient's system curing their diarrhoea .

"A shocking picture has emerged of an inmate who was viciously beaten by guards while handcuffed at a New York prison. A judge on Monday recommended that six New York City jail guards be fired for the brutal 2012 beating of a handcuffed Rikers Island inmate in a now-shuttered solitary confinement dorm for mentally ill prisoners. The beating left 27-year-old Robert Hinton with a broken nose, fractured back and a bloodied, badly swollen face. Inmate Robert Hinton in a medical clinic in New York, bloodied with a swollen face, shortly after an April 3, 2012 beating. On Monday, a judge recommended that six New York City jail guards be fired for the brutal beating of the handcuffed Rikers Island inmate in a now-shuttered solitary confinement dorm . The Department of Correction said Hinton was beaten after being carried hogtied into a cell for refusing to be escorted and that to justify the use of force, the guards fabricated a story that Hinton put one of them in a chokehold . The recommendation in the Department of Correction's disciplinary case against the five correction officers and a captain was meant to serve as an example and deter other jail workers 'who would participate in or stand idly by when such brazen misconduct occurs,' Judge Tynia Richard said. 'Individuals who themselves are out of control cannot be made the overlords of any group of inmates,' the judge wrote. The Department of Correction said Hinton was beaten after being carried hogtied into a cell for refusing to be escorted and that to justify the use of force, the guards fabricated a story that Hinton put one of them in a chokehold. The recommendation comes in the wake of months of headline-grabbing tales of guard misconduct and the maltreatment of inmates in the nation's second-largest jail system. In March, based on an internal city health study, it was found that nearly a third of Rikers inmates who said their visible injuries came at the hands of a correction officer last year had suffered a blow to the head. And last month, a federal review of Rikers Island by government lawyers found a 'deep-seated' culture of violence in the 10-facility jail complex on the 400-acre island off Manhattan's shores. But the recommendation also provides a small window into the world of internal discipline in the Department of Correction. A federal review of Rikers Island by government lawyers found a 'deep-seated' culture of violence in the 10-facility jail complex on the 400-acre island off Manhattan's shores . In the past four and a half years, the department brought 2,007 administrative cases before the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, according to records. Of those, only 97 resulted in a written report and recommendation. Most cases were settled in exchange for the forfeiture of vacation days and unpaid suspensions, while the details of the incident and names of those involved remain secret. In Hinton's case, surveillance video showed the 6-foot-3 man carried into his cell by Captain Budnarine Behari and other guards, shackled by his hands and feet and lifted off the ground, the judge wrote. The guards involved said Hinton - described by the judge as a Bloods gang member with an attempted murder conviction - kicked Behari twice and put another correction officer in a headlock, resulting in a struggle that led to his injuries. Hinton's version of events, combined with inmate witnesses and surveillance video outside the cell was more believable, Richard wrote, ultimately determining he had remained handcuffed as the guards, some wearing gloves, beat him while an officer calmly stood outside the cell. 'This case appears to combine some of the worst aspects of the use of force cases: a coordinated effort to enter an inmate's cell, serious physical injury, an attempted cover-up, and a lack of provocation by the inmate,' Richard wrote. Hinton is suing the city in federal court. Behari's attorney, James Frankie, said the judge's recommendation was 'very disappointing'. Norman Seabrook, head of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association, said he would ask Commissioner Joseph Ponte to spare the five officers termination. He said the case, while unfortunate, was reflective of a department that lacked sufficient supervisory staff where unqualified captains are promoted. Surveillance video didn't capture what occurred inside the cell, only in the corridor outside. Department of Correction lawyers have denied the public records request for the footage, as well as the  appeal of the denial, arguing in part that the footage was a personnel record and exempt from public disclosure. But the video was played publicly during Behari's hearing this spring before the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, and inmate advocate Hadley Fitzgerald, who watched the video, said it was disturbing how eerily calm the guards appeared in the footage. 'I remember it hit me like a brick,' she said, noting that about 10 minutes passed before Hinton was brought out of the cell, limp, and placed face-down on a gurney and rushed to a hospital. 'You can only imagine what's happening in there. A man who is cuffed, and without weapons, is now in there with all these guys ... It's just very disturbing.'","The beating left 27-year-old Robert Hinton with a broken nose, fractured back and a bloodied, badly swollen face .

"Elisabeth Lorentz and Eric Holder from eastern France have  married despite a French law banning unions between stepchildren and step-parents . It's a union that comes close to breaking the ultimate taboo. A woman yesterday tied the knot with her stepson - after fighting for months with French authorities for the right to marry. Elisabeth Lorentz, 48, finally married Eric Holder, who is three years her junior, in the parish church in the small village of Dabo in Alsace-Lorraine, north-east France. Although it's not quite an Oedipus complex, the complex story behind their marriage is nonetheless almost worthy of Sophocles - although there is yet hope it won't end in tragedy. Ms Lorentz met Mr Holder's father in 1989, when she was 24 years old. The couple had a daughter in 1997 - she is Mr Holder's half-sister, but also his goddaughter. Mr Holder also had a daughter at around the same time. Ms Lorentz married Mr Holder's father in 2003, but they separated three years later. Ms Lorentz told French media her former husband instigated the break up. 'I was not expecting it, it was a shock,' she said. 'I was an adult so I made do. But our daughter who was nine-years-old felt the separation very badly. She cried every day. 'That's when Eric was a great support for us and our relationship evolved.' Mr Holder, who says he did his best to comfort his half-sister, who is also is goddaughter and now his step-daughter, added: 'When my father left my mother, I felt abandoned. I knew how she felt.' With Mr Holder and Ms Lorentz's friendship soon developing into a love affair, it wasn't long before he proposed. But quickly they ran into trouble with French law, which prohibits all unions between stepchildren and step-parents - even former ones. The couple pleaded their case through the courts right up to the Elysee Palace, only to receive a signed letter from President Francois Hollande last year reconfirming that such marriages are banned. They finally obtained the right to marry from a local court in north-east France in June. The prosecutor's office opposed the decision but did not appeal. 'At last, it's the big day! I simply hope that our story will be useful to other couples in our situation, because I know there are some,' said Ms Lorentz. The couple hold up the signed letter from President Francois Hollande sent to them last year reconfirming that such marriages are banned . She has previously insisted that their relationship has been totally accepted by their family, including their children. 'Eric's father, who is also my ex-husband agrees perfectly our history. Our girls too. They have almost the same age and consider themselves sisters. We never differentiate between them. Moreover, they will both be bridesmaids at our wedding,' she told Le Républicain Lorrain. The ex-husband of the bride, who is also the father of the groom, was to be among the 100 or so guests at the civil and religious ceremonies in Dabo. 'He has always supported us,' Ms Lorentz said.","Elizabeth Lorentz broke up with the father of Eric Holder in 2006 .

The web is seen as the last bastion of glasnost - or openness - in Moscow, but now there are fears new curbs will be imposed as they have been on TV and newspapers. The Russian president is summoning a Monday session of his powerful Security Council over the issue. 'Taking into account the complete unpredictability of the United States and European Union, Russia is taking measures to ensure its own security,' Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told AFP. It was vital to act due to 'the unpredictability of our foreign partners', he insisted. He claimed Russia should be 'ready for anything' after the worst rift with the West since the Cold War. Vedomosti newspaper said Russia was aiming to strengthen the 'sovereignty of the Russian segment of the World Wide Web'. This could include powers to unplug Russia from the World Wide Web in 'emergency' situations. These might be protest rallies or military hostilities, the newspaper said citing sources. The web has been a focus of Kremlin criticism over the Ukraine conflict, and the aim would be to prevent it operating internationally in any crisis. The country's citizens would only be able to use a Russian-wide web. This week a major social networking site VKontakte fell completely under the control of a company in the empire of Kremlin-friendly Alisher Usmanov, also a major shareholder of Arsenal Football Club. 'We have a highly reliable backup plan, which maybe discussed at the Security Council meeting,' said a source. The move follows calls from politicians to isolate the Russian web from the US and EU internet which are seen as subversive.

"The proof that some drivers are a complete menace on the roads is all in these pictures. And you certainly don't need to be eagle-eyed to spot them, with drivers taking to highways with over-sized packages hanging from open boots, carpets rolling from the back of vans and mattresses loosely strapped to car roofs. There's even a motorcyclist wearing a chair over his helmet. These do-it-yourself delivery drivers are  taping down illegal fridge loads and strapping four-burner barbecues to the back of boots while making a mockery of the road rules. Now police are fighting back, with the Highway Patrol in NSW posting photographs on their Facebook page of  law-breakers  taken by officers - or stunned members of the public - from NSW and around the world. Scroll down for video . A high visibility singlet attached to a barbecue - on the outside of sedan - certainly isn't legal . Low visibility driving: Two chairs attached to the head of this motorcycle rider while he drives in the centre lane . Half of the driving lane through this car park is blocked due to this overhanging tree . Crazy photographs include trucks taking roundabouts and blocking lanes, ladders in the back of flat-bed utes that aren't tied down and back-seat passengers doubling up as safety restraints, holding on to beds attached to a car roof. The page has gone viral with more than 100,000 'fans' either send images or simply viewing the latest compilation of reckless acts. Police have said while some of the examples are viewed as 'light-hearted fun', they can also lead to serious injury and sometimes death. This oversized boat is about to take a tumble off the side of this badly loaded truck . Another poorly loaded fridge thrown in to the back of this car as it travels along a major road . Do not overtake truck while turning: Impossible - this driver blocked a whole street when he tried to turn right, left ... who knows? I bought a fridge!: Jeep driver tapes his fridge  down to the back of this car . Tall order: This is a ladder, on the tray of a ute without any secure strapping whatsoever . Roll out the brown carpet! Open double doors at the back of this van allows the load to stick out the back . Inspector Mick Timms, of NSW Police, said a motorist was killed last year when a load fell from the back of a truck at Liverpool, south west of Sydney, and crushed the driver travelling behind. He said the images are evidence that these acts are not just happening in foreign countries with lax road laws, but back home in Australia as well. 'We get sent pictures from time to time and it just shows that these acts are not just happening in other countries but here as well,' Inspector Timms said. Mr Timms said where there is enough evidence to investigate a tip-off, police will usually take steps to prosecute drivers. But in most cases - such as the booted-up barbecue - identifying drivers can sometimes be difficult. 'The barbecue driver had no number plates, and there was no date, time or place on the image.' 'It makes it hard to track down.' He said most of the images that filter through are of trucks and large heavy vehicles with illegally stacked or restrained loads. Strange bedfellows: Not one, but two mattresses stacked on one another while they stick out the back of this car's boot . An improvised truck made from wooden slats, used doors and  other implements to transport an unsafe load . Fruit packs illegally tied to the back of this ute make it impossible for this driver to see through his rear vision mirror . The same driver pulled to the side of the road and questioned over the load . A rear on view shows the full extent to which this driver's rear views are obstructed . They're potentially deadly death traps for cars, pedestrians and passing motorcycles travelling behind or past the culprits. NSW Police will launch Operation Slow Down - a high-visibility traffic operation – to combat the long-weekend road toll. NSW Police Force Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn said the need for vigilance was high this weekend. 'This long weekend marks the start of the busy run up to Christmas and the New Year; families returning from school holidays; as well as major sporting events across Sydney. 'We expect to see a large increase of motorists taking to the roads to enjoy these events and the warmer weather, however, this always brings an element of risk.'

Two cars transported illegally towed to the back of this truck landed the driver in hot water with police .

"Barring a late injury scare, Gareth Bale is all set to join an elite list of Britons plying their trade abroad to line up in a Champions League final. It's a monumental moment for the Real Madrid winger, who has enjoyed a season to surpass the expectations of most after his £86million world-record transfer from Tottenham. Twenty-one goals later and Bale is really showing why the club splurged so much money on him in September. The 24-year-old is ready to start for Carlo Ancelotti's side against city rivals Atletico in Lisbon on Saturday night and here, Sportsmail looks at the seven other Brits abroad who've had the pleasure of playing in Europe's showpiece fixture. Inspiration: Paul Lambert (challenging Didier Deschamps) was superb for Dortmund in the 1997 final against Italian giants Juventus . Paul Lambert - Borussia Dortmund 3-1 Juventus (1997) The Scotland man bossed midfield for Dortmund during his solitary season in Germany and immediately became a cult hero with supporters. Not hard to see why really. The Aston Villa boss assisted one of the goals and nullified the threat of a certain Zinedine Zidane, who was just starting to become a real influence on the world stage. Lambert is still talked about over there. In typical straight-talking style, he said: 'I gave the shirts I swapped with the Juventus players after the game to my dad,' he reflected. 'But he's a roof-tiler, wore them to work and they're ripped to pieces. As for the medals, they're round the house somewhere, I don't know where. 'But all the experience that came with winning them is up here [in the mind].' Steve McManaman - Real Madrid 3-0 Valencia (2000) Definitely a midfielder whose talents have now been largely forgotten, but McManaman in his pomp - the run up to his move to Real Madrid and immediately after - was one of the country's more frightening wingers. And he can lay claim to having scored in a European Cup final. Operating centrally, McManaman was at his sublime best. The goal was a stunning volley . Madrid swept Valencia aside at the Stade de France, and it was in part down to the brilliance of the Scouse lad they signed from Liverpool a year beforehand. That's about as good as it got for him. Absurd really that McManaman never truly kicked on after that night in Paris. What a hit! Steve McManaman scored a super volley and was named man of the match against Valencia . That was the one: The Liverpudlian enjoyed his finest night in football at the Stade de France in May 2000 . Owen Hargreaves - Bayern Munich 1-1 Valencia (5-4 pens) (2001) One of those nights where the English press stood up and wondered who this scrawny midfielder - eligible for the national team - was, completely bossing a Bayern Munich midfield. Next to the legendary Stefan Effenberg, keen to banish the nightmare final moments of the 1999 final against Manchester, Hargreaves shone. He had been key in the semi-final win against Real Madrid weeks previously, while the Canadian went on to star at the World Cup in 2002 for Sven-Goran Eriksson. Coming of age: Owen Hargreaves was exceptional for Bayern Munich in their run to the 2001 final . Steve Archibald - Barcelona 0-0 Steaua Bucharest (0-2 pens) (1986) Joined Barcelona in 1984 from Tottenham and Archibald started brightly at the Nou Camp. By the time 1986 came around, he wasn't a regular but did play in the final under Terry Venables. Archibald played a key role in defending from the front in the goalless draw but had been substituted before the penalty shootout. Laurie Cunningham - Real Madrid 0-1 Liverpool (1981) Cunningham is one of the most exciting players to have ever graced the English game, tragically dying in a car accident while at Ray Vallecano in 1989. The winger started his career at Leyton Orient but truly made his name at West Brom before a move to Real Madrid. He was electric for the Spanish giants, but - on the biggest club stage of them all - Cunningham wasn't able to impact on the final. A shame: Steve Archibald wasn't able to add a European Cup winners' medal during his Barcelona career . Struggle: Laurie Cunningham (tackled by Liverpool's Graeme Souness) wasn't able to impact upon the final . Chris Waddle - Marseille 0-0 Red Star Belgrade (3-5 pens) (1991) You could hardly blame him, but when offered the opportunity to step up for Marseille in the final's penalty shootout, Waddle turned it down. After all, it was under a year since that night in Turin when the former Sheffield Wednesday midfielder blindingly smashed over the crossbar at the 1990 World Cup. Kevin Keegan - Hamburg 0-1 Nottingham Forest (1980) His final season over in Germany almost looked like ending perfectly, but Hamburg inexplicably came unstuck against Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. Keegan - much like the favourites - never got going at the Bernabeu and left the club for Southampton that summer. He knew the final was to be his last game, but still it ended in a damp squib.

"The Prince of Wales found himself up a creek without a paddle when he visited a floating farm on the first day of the royal tour of Mexico. Instead of sitting in the flat-bottomed boat of the farm on the outskirts of Mexico City, Prince Charles and a few members of his entourage had to stand precariously as they were punted across the water. Charles laughed as the boat sailed across the murky waters to the floating farm, called a Chinampa, waving his arms up and down as he enjoyed the wobbly experience. Scroll down for video . Without a paddle: Prince Charles sees the funny side of rocking the boat as he is punted across to a floating farm in Mexico . Rock the boat: Charles waved his arms around, pretending to rock the boat as the Prince sailed across to a floating farm . Charles clambered aboard the flat-bottomed boat with a few members of his entourage as he visited the farms near Mexico City . Raking it in: Charles proved to be quite handy on the farm, mucking in with the locals as he raked the land . Charles visited the farms, or 'chinampas', without the Duchess of Cornwall during his tour of the Latin American nation . The journey was only a short one but Charles joked with his fellow passengers about the risks of rocking the boat. When he reached the plot of land he found farmers at work planting spinach in immaculate rows. Not one to shy away from working the land, Prince Charles, who started his Home Farm in the early 1980s, joined in with raking the soil and even planting spinaches. The rectangular plot of land was surrounded on all sides by water and is part of an agricultural system created 800 years ago from reclaimed swamp land that covered much of the area in and around Mexico City. The Chinampas have been lost over the decades to the urban development of Mexico's sprawling capital, but there are efforts to preserve the remaining sites whose produce - from tomatoes to radishes - are used to feed Mexico City. Meanwhile the Duchess of Cornwall visited a human trafficking centre in the Mexican capital, meeting officials and stopping for a cup of tea.

The royal couple also met with Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto and his wife Angelica Rivera for an official ceremony at the National Palace. Earlier today Camilla was left in tears of laughter after being shown a photo album. Exactly what the album contained is unknown, although it is likely that the images showed Prince Charles during one of his earlier visits to Mexico. The Duchess, who is famous for her sense of humour, was left chuckling after seeing her husband's attempt at a Mexican pasty - made during a visit to Real del Monte's pasty museum. Fresh from a successful four-day tour of Colombia, Camilla and husband Prince Charles were making their first stop on the Mexican leg of their journey in a town famous for its links with Cornwall.

Prince Charles gets entangled in his apron as the cooking session gets underway . Tasty: Prince Charles, who is also the Duke of Cornwall, reveals how much he loves his home county's baked goods . Although neither the Duchess nor Prince Charles are known for their cooking skills, both tried their hand at making Mexico's take on the Cornish pasty, which swaps meat and potatoes for tomatoes, spices and a dash of salsa verde. Hundreds of Cornish miners travelled to the town to work in its silver mines during the 19th century, leaving a legacy that includes an appreciation for pasties and cream teas behind them. But it was the Mexican version that left Camilla smiling during the demonstration, although the very British Duchess did toast her culinary efforts with a well-earned cup of tea. As they each took a circular piece of pastry, Prince Charles asked cook and pasty expert Paulina Espinosa how much filling he should use, to which, in true Cornish style, she replied: 'As much as you can!' Charles laughed as he put his effort down on the metal work surface but the Duchess of Cornwall spent longer perfecting hers and finally handed it over with a smile. Speaking after waving the couple off, Ms Espinosa said: 'I think they did great - you do have to practice how to seal it. I don't know if it's the first time they did it but I think they did a great job and it looks like they had fun doing it, they really enjoyed themselves.' As well as their mining expertise, the Cornishmen also brought football to central America, which their new friends in Mexico enthusiastically adopted as their own. How much filling? Prince Charles was fascinated by the pasty making process and asked for tips on how much filling to use .

The Day of the Dead, which sees women paint their faces as skulls, is a major event in the Mexican calendar when families remember loved ones who have died and celebrate them. Hundreds of residents packed the town’s main square close to the cemetery where the royal couple admired a brightly-coloured shrine that had an enormous skull as its centrepiece. There they posed for photos with women dressed as Catrinas - skull faced characters in elaborate gowns who have come to symbolise the festival, which is known as Dia de los Muertos in Mexican Spanish.

Before they left the town, the royal couple visited a secondary school and helped launch a project to build a new football pitch by each digging a spade full of earth. The new pitch - towards which Prince Charles has made a financial donation - is symbolic as the first game of football in Mexico was played near the town of Real del Monte. Later the Prince and Duchess will receive an official welcome from Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto at the presidential palace in the capital, Mexico City. And while Charles tours a unique agricultural area of Mexico which is famous for its unusual 'floating farms', Camilla will visit a safe house for victims of sex trafficking.

"An unlucky-in-love singleton in her late twenties has been put up for 'sale' by her family on eBay - in a bid to find her a steady boyfriend. Sammy Maalem, 27, who lives in Cardiff, has been single for a year after being dumped, messed around, and even cheated on. So her brother Kyle, 28, decided to get involved to find her the perfect man - by selling off a date with the beauty to the highest bidder under the heading: 'Date my sister'. The starting bid was £50 on the internet auction site listing. Scroll down for video . Sammy's listing ended with no bids but has since been relisted . Sammy and brother Kyle who advertised her and said that he would 'judge' every man who bid . The online advert read: 'Firstly this is a serious advert. 'My sister is 27 years old, originally from London but now lives in Cardiff, and is slim and curvy, 5ft 4in, blue eyes dark hair. Very bubbly and outgoing. She not a party animal and very faithful. No kids but would like kids eventually. 'My sister is unlucky with finding a real man. So me and my family are looking for someone who is a great guy who is genuine. Loving. Faithful. Normal. And just very down to earth. Also musts are Must have a job. No bums please. Must have a car or be willing to commute if your far away. Must be decent looking. Pref taller then 5ft 8in Must be kind hearted and genuine. 'Must be aged 27-35. Must be family orientated as we are also a close family. No silly boys. No one expecting 1 night stands. No one confused if they are straight or not. No weirdos. No married or engaged men. No overseas and must be within a 150 mile radius. 'Genuine people only this is for a date with my sister that will hopefully be on-going. This is a genuine advert which my sister knows about.' Sammy was furious when she first found out she was being advertised . Sammy works with Kyle in the family's jewellery business in Cardiff . The advert also joked about free postage and packaging being included and bidders are warned that the 'item' has been previously used. Sammy who works with Kyle in the family's jewellery business in Cardiff said: 'I was absolutely livid when I saw what Kyle had done. Kyle has been threatening for years to put me on Ebay but I never took him seriously, so I was shocked to see myself on there - it was quite scary. It was funny but listing me as used definitely wasn't - the cheek of it. 'I haven't had very good relationships in the past and I have tried dating sites which really wasn't for me. I have a had a few relationship, the longest which lasted two years, but they have never worked out. 'A lot of my friends - even my younger sister - are in loving relationships, some are even married with children and I am sick of going out with immature guys, I need someone I can settle down with. 'All I want is a decent guy with good morals and who is honest and faithful, it really has got harder to meet decent people. 'When the Ebay bids close I will probably go ahead with it, my brother went through all that trouble and because he is vetting the bidders I feel at ease, he is very protective of me so I trust his judgement.' Kyle said: 'I have never thought Sammy's boyfriends have been good enough for her, a lot of them have had quite a lot of baggage and Sammy needs someone without any ties. 'I was tired of her getting messed around all the time, she's a brilliant person and at least now I can vet these guys for myself. 'I have had quite a lot of enquiries, a lot of people asking if it is a genuine Ebay post. I had one guy who refused to give me his Facebook page - at the end of the day I am not interested in any shifty guys for Sammy. 'She has asked me to take the post down quite a few times - she was quite embarrassed, I kind of just told her 'oh sis you're for sale' and she wasn't too happy.' Kyle, right, said: 'I have never thought Sammy's boyfriends have been good enough for her' Sammy's mother Natalie, 52, who has been married for 30 to husband Simon, 54, said: . Mrs Maalen said: 'My daughter is the most warm-hearted person you could ever want to meet and in my opinion the perfect girlfriend. 'She isn't nasty, or possessive or self-centred, she is just a lovely girl who is beautiful both inside and out. 'She has struggled to get a job for the past few months and has been down on her luck so Kyle thought it would be a nice surprise to show off his matchmaking skills. 'Only she screamed the house down when she found out, she was really annoyed that he listed her as used. 'But now she sees the funny side to it and I think she would be up for a date once the bidding is ended provided they are a good guy - her last relationship was over a year ago. 'She has messed around quite a few times in the past and has even been cheated on, I think she deserves a knight in shining armour to take care of her.' 'We have had quite a few calls to the house but until they bid Natalie isn't dating anybody, she really wants to settle down and have children but just can't seem to find the right guy to do it.

"For 20 long years the disappearance of beautiful blonde dancer Revelle Balmain has remained a mystery. The 22-year-old vanished on November 5, 1994, almost without a trace except for one cork-heeled platform shoe. The high-heel was found two days later in a street in Kingsford, a south-eastern suburb of Sydney, scattered alongside Revelle’s cane make-up bag, diary and the keys to her Bellevue Hill unit. It was the first worrying indication police had that Revelle may have been harmed, but two decades later her killer has still not been caught and a $250,000 reward for information leading to an arrest remains on offer from the NSW Government. Scroll down for video . Dancer Revelle Balmain vanished at the age of 22 from a suburban Sydney street .

She never showed up. ‘Later that evening she was to meet her boyfriend, but failed to keep this appointment as well. Her girlfriend last spoke to her by phone at 7:15pm,’ Revelle’s half-sister Sueellen Simpson told the media back in 1994. The alarm was officially raised when Revelle also failed to catch the 9.30am train from Sydney to Newcastle the next day, to say goodbye to her mother before she travelled to Japan. What Revelle’s family didn’t know at the time was that the stunning model was leading a double-life and secretly working as an escort for two high-end agencies. She was about to embark on a six-month dance contract in Japan, following in her mother's footsteps . Police found her belongings, including one wedge shoe and her hand bag, scattered across four streets . On the day of her disappearance she had gone to a house on McNair Avenue, in Kingsford, to visit a client named Gavin Owen Samer. Mr Samer has always maintained to police that he then drove Revelle to the nearby Red Tomato Inn at 7pm that evening, but no one from the Inn ever saw her. Police also spotted scratches on Mr Samer's neck, chest and hands  but he explained he got the injuries from surfing. Mr Samer was named the main person of interest during a coronial inquiry in 1998 and 1999 but no charges against him were ever laid. He denied any suggestions that he may have killed her and Deputy State Coroner John Abernethy said he could not identify any motive. ‘While Mr Samer certainly had the opportunity to kill Ms Balmain, and rightly in my view is the main person of interest to police, there is no plausible motive proved,’ Mr Abernethy said. Mr Abernethy declined to comment on the case when questioned by Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday. A Department of Justice spokesman said: 'He said he conducted the inquest a long time ago and it would be difficult for him to recall precise details.' Revelle's family plastered missing person photographs around the city. 'We are desperately concerned for her safety and welfare,' the posters said . Revelle was reportedly working for two high-end escort agencies at the time of her disappearance . The inquiry also looked into the theory that a person associated with the escort agency, Select Companions, she was working with may have had something to do with her disappearance. Revelle had worked at the agency for six weeks but had fallen in love with a new boyfriend, Piers Fisher-Pollard, and had decided to leave escort work. Mr Samer was meant to be her final client. When the man from the escort agency was questioned he told the police and the inquiry differing tales of his whereabouts on the day Revelle vanished. He has always maintained his innocence. In 2008, Homicide Detective Superintendent Geoff Beresford announced police had new information and forensic test results relating to the case. The evidence reportedly renewed the theory that Revelle was murdered at a house in Kingsford. 'A full forensic search was carried out of the crime scene at Kingsford during the last 12 months,' Detective Superintendent Beresford told The Australian. 'We are able to say we have fresh evidence as a result of those investigations.' Around the same time as the breakthrough, the Daily Telegraph reported that the main person of interest, Mr Samer, had disappeared from Sydney. Police allegedly wanted to find him so that they could take a DNA sample. Daily Mail Australia has contacted NSW Police to find out if they are still looking for Mr Samer, but has not yet received a response. NSW Deputy State Coroner John Abernethy (pictured) said led a coronial inquiry into Revelle's disappearance in 1998 and 1999. He declared it was a cold case and should remain open . Appearing on the ABC’s The 7:30 Report in September 2008, Revelle’s half-sister Suellen described the pain the family still felt 14 years on. ‘The not knowing is the worst. Last week, I saw one girl who looked like Revelle and it took my breath away. I thought my heart would stop because she was so similar to Revelle,’ she said. ‘Fourteen years is a long time to wonder where she is and who murdered her. Why should someone murder her and think that they can walk away and just forget about it. We're not ever going to forget about it - ever. I won't let it happen,’ Suellen added. For Jan, 79, and Ivor Balmain, their daughter Revelle was everything. Their son Matthew had drowned in the pool in their backyard aged just 15 months. Revelle had previously spent 18 months in Japan before returning to Sydney and landing a front cover on Oyster magazine in the years before she vanished . Jan had also been a dancer in her youth and she set up a dance school on Sydney’s northern beaches where she raised Revelle and Suellen, her daughter from a previous relationship. In 2006, Jan told Marie Claire Australia how ‘Revelle became the main focus’ of their lives after Matthew died and they could not conceive any more children. ‘We sent her to a private school, I taught her ballet, tap and jazz, and she rewarded us by growing up into a very warm, kind and happy little girl,’ she said. ‘Years later, when she told me that she wanted to follow in my footsteps and become a professional dancer, I was thrilled and through friends, helped her to get a contract performing in hotels in Japan. I made sure she wouldn’t be doing anything seedy, although I never worried that she would anyway,’ Jan recalled. Revelle spent 18 months in Japan before returning to Sydney and landing a front cover on Oyster magazine. Her career was taking off and her parents had never been prouder. After Revelle disappeared and Jan and Ivor’s world was shattered they eventually moved to Queensland to escape the haunting memories. Tragically Ivor died in 2010 with his daughter’s murder unsolved. Two decades later her killer has still not been caught and a $250,000 reward for information leading to an arrest remains on offer from the NSW Government . Meanwhile, Revelle’s sister Suellen has never stopped looking for answers. During the first 18 months after the model vanished, Suellen called investigating officers every day and was told she ‘needed counselling’. She believed police did not do all they could in the early stages of Revelle’s disappearance because of the fact that she was an escort. She told the Herald Sun in 2011: ‘I never stopped thinking she might walk through a door, make that call or turn up somewhere.’ It has now been 7304 days since Revelle Balmain was last seen alive and the Cinderella mystery remains unsolved. NSW Police told Daily Mail Australia: 'Strike Force Aramac, led by detectives from the Homicide Squad, continues to investigate the disappearance and suspected murder of Revelle Balmain. 'Investigators encourage anyone with information concerning Ms Balmain, no matter how small or insignificant it may seem, to contact Crime Stoppers via 1800 333 000.'","Talented dancer Revelle Balmain disappeared on November 5, 1994 .

"A chronically ill teenager, forced to drop out of school because of her reactive arthritis, has had a complete stranger come to her aid, allowing the young woman to fulfil her ‘high school formal’ dream. Mikaela Peters, a 17-year-old living on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, says she was blown away because she ‘didn’t think there were people like that existed any more.’ When she posted a photo on a public Facebook page, explaining her story and trying to sell the dress, photographer Katie Barnett offered a complimentary photo shoot to give her to opportunity to ‘feel beautiful in the dress’. Ms Peters, who suffers from reactive arthritis says the shoot was ‘amazing, the best experience I’ve ever had.’ 'Words can't explain it. I feel so much better about life. It still helps me,' Ms Peters told Daily Mail Australia.

The original post on Facebook, when Mikaela Peters tries to sell her 'dream dress' The 17-year-old suffers from reactive arthritis and, despite doing everything she could, in February it became clear that she could not continue at school. Mikaela was invited to the formal, but couldn’t bring herself to go. She listed her dress for sale on the Sunny Coast Community Board on Facebook. ‘I’m allowed to go to the formal but it wouldn’t be the same. School means a lot to me and would be too upsetting to attend (the formal),’ she wrote. The school girl was forced to sell her dream formal dress explaining, ‘I’m desperate (to sell the dress) as having it around is hard for me! This is my dream formal dress so it’s a very hard sale! ‘Unfortunately we bought it at the start of the year hoping I would stay well enough to stay in school and go to the formal. ‘Since, I have become extremely chronically ill and had to leave school,’ she wrote. Katie Barnett's kind response, offering a free photo shoot in the dress . The young woman was offered a free glamour shoot from a photographer who saw Miss Peters Facebook post, trying to sell her 'dream dress' because it was too difficult to own the dress, knowing she could not wear it at the school formal . Her reactive arthritis causes the young woman so much pain that she is unable to stay standing or sitting for the duration of a lesson. Her medication also weakens her immune system, making her incredibly ill if she comes in contact with even the mildest contagious diseases. Ms Barnett, a teacher and part-time photographer, was moved by Ms Peters’ story and commented on the post, offered the teen a glamour shoot with the dress before she had to give it away. ‘I was just happy to do something nice for someone so deserving. ‘I wanted to give her an opportunity to wear the dress and do something special, because she’s been going through such a tough time,’ Ms Barnett told Daily Mail Australia. ‘When she described it as her “dream dress”, I realised just how much it meant to her. Understanding that going to the formal wasn't an option, Ms Barnett wanted to give the teen her own happy memory. ‘When she said going to the formal would have been too difficult, I wanted to give her a positive memory with the dress without having to go through the difficult emotions.’ The shoot took an entire day and captured more than 90 photos. The photographer, Katie Barnett, also paid for Mikaela Peters to have her make up done to enjoy a 'glamorous, special' day . The shoot took an entire day and they captured more than 90 photos. Ms Barnett not only took the photographs, but paid for a professional makeup artist to help with Ms Peters’ special day. ‘It was a great experience to meet her. She’s such a lovely girl and it was fun to spend the day making her feel pampered. She really deserves it,’ said Ms Barnett. Ms Peters also took some photos in her big sister Krystie’s 21st dress as a way of saying thank you. ‘My sister has been amazing and has helped me a lot. She’s a paramedic and is so supportive. ‘I wore her dress because it’s special and as my way of saying thank you to her,' said Ms Peters. The young woman wore her formal dress in the photo shoot, as well as her sister's 21st dress (pictured) as a sentimental way of saying thank you to her older sister, who has been a huge support during her ill health . Ms Peters is looking to the future, and hope to become a paramedic one day, just like her beloved big sister. Ms Peters says her condition is still the same, but is working through the pain. She is currently working fulltime and looking forward to finishing her studies through a bridging course at university. As a teacher, Ms Barnett says she was also drawn to the story due to Ms Peters’ desire to learn. ‘I was disappointed that Mikaela had to drop out of school, because I’m passionate about encouraging my students and helping them feel motivated,' said Ms Barnett. ‘We spoke during the shoot about what she’s been going through, so I had the opportunity to speak to her and tell her to keep going to fulfil her dream of being a paramedic,’ Ms Barnett told Daily Mail Australia.' The Sunshine Coast teen received the photos a week ago when she was discharged from hospital, which helped to lift her spirits. ‘After having met her, I can see that my photos have captured not only her external beauty, but also her internal beauty,’ said the photographer, Ms Barnett. ‘After having met her, I can see that my photos have captured not only her external beauty, but also her internal beauty,’ said Ms Barnett. ‘It was so nice to give her the photos. She was blown away and sent me a beautiful email saying the photos made her fall in love with the beautiful photo shoot all over again.’ Ms Peters is now being inundated with offers from people who have heard her story. This includes people who want to help her manage her pain, through complimentary physical therapy and holistic healing, in the hope the resilient young woman does not have to miss out on any more opportunities due to her poor health. ‘Going through her sickness must be hard, but she now has the support of the whole community,’ Ms Barnett told Daily Mail Australia. ‘There’s so much negativity in the world but we can do so much to make the world a better place by pulling together and supporting each other. ‘I thought it was just a small little gesture to help brighten her day!' The 17-year-old did not sell the dress. She still has it hanging up in her closet, because it is now a reminder of a wonderful experience.","Sunshine Coast school girl enjoys free photo shoot from kind stranger .

"An eight-year-old girl has envisioned all her mother's favorite TV shows with some very creative doodles. San Francisco-based blogger Sunny Chanel says her daughter has never watched Mad Men or Girls, but that didn't stop her from drawing colorful sketches that portray a surprisingly realistic albeit adorably simplistic view of the shows. In her drawing of Downton Abbey, for instance, three women with old-fashioned hairstyles, long gowns and white gloves stand in a row - presumably Edith, Mary and Sybil.

She told her mother that she believes the show is about 'people who live in a great big castle in London, and they have lots of parties and spend a lot of money on really pretty clothes.' Sunny writes on Mom.me that she discovered her daughter's talent for artistic interpretations when she said to her one day: 'Mommy, I'm gonna draw you a picture, okay?' She returned ten minutes later with a sketch of Piper Chapman from Orange is the New Black. 'Before you call child services, I should mention that my third-grader has never watched even a second of Netflix's most popular show,' writes Sunny.

"The battle to nail down a starting place for England's World Cup opener against Italy on June 14 starts tonight. With Peru visiting Wembley in the first of three warm-up matches ahead of the big kick-off in Brazil, manager Roy Hodgson will be looking for early clues as to the best balance of his side. Nailed on: Glen Johnson (centre) and Gary Cahill (right) are guaranteed to start for England at the World Cup . Hodgson can lay down the foundations . of his team: Joe Hart in goal with and a back-four which virtually picks . itself - Glen Johnson, Gary Cahill, Phil Jagielka and Leighton Baines - . screened by Steven Gerrard. The captain can either anchor a . midfield trio, with energetic runners covering the ground on either . side, or operate in tandem with one other deep-lying midfielder, most . likely Jack Wilshere or Jordan Henderson. Both are expected to be given chances to stake their claims tonight. Captain fantastic: Steven Gerrard (centre) will lead England in the World Cup in Brazil . Forward from this point lie the options for Hodgson to tinker with the balance, depending on the style of opponents, conditions and Hodgson’s tactical fancies. Extra pace on the break? Use Raheem Sterling? More defensive protection and industry? Send for James Milner? Adam Lallana’s 30-minute cameo as a substitute against Denmark confirmed his place in the squad, but has he done enough to force his way into the team against Italy? Lallana looks made for international football, with the vision and invention to see patterns and find passes. If anything, he looks even better with better players around him and he is versatile. He, . more than most, will give Hodgson the scope to flex his formation . without making substitutions. He can pick Lallana wide in a 4-2-3-1 . shape or tuck him inside and play 4-3-3 for a period if the game . requires. What is certain . though, is that Lallana will need a strong performance against unfancied . Peru if he is to earn his place in the side. Option: Adam Lallana (left) could force his way into the starting line-up for the tournament . Skills: Raheem Sterling had an impressive season for Liverpool and could now start for England . Skipper Gerrard is delighted with the competition in the side ahead of the tournament. He told the Evening Standard: 'It's exciting. That's why the supporters are excited. There are two quality players in every position.

"Residents of Norfolk Island are outraged by a request from the Australian Government asking them to use the Advance Australia Fair as their official national anthem, it has been claimed . Since Queen Victoria handed over control of the small island - off the coast of Australia - to Pitcairn islanders in 1856, the 2,000-strong population have been singing God Save the Queen to showcase their allegiance to the British monarchy. But residents have refused to comply with the Australian Government's request that was made last month by its newly appointed administrator Gary Hardgrave, U.K. paper The Times reported. Residents of Norfolk Island are outraged the Australian Government have asked them to stop using God Save the Queen as their official national anthem . In the ultimate act of revolt, attendees of the island's annual Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Show on Monday proudly belted out a rendition of God Save the Queen - with some brandishing the Union Jack flag. Mr Hardgrave wrote to Norfolk Island Chief Minister Lisle Snell last month saying the act of singing God Save the Queen was 'surely wrong' as it had been '40 years since God Save the Queen was first replaced as the national anthem of the Commonwealth of Australia'. But Mr Snell fired back at the administrator and wrote they were a nation of 'staunch monarchists', and had a long and binding history with the British royals. In his letter of reply, Mr Snell protested against the change and flatly refused to adopt the move. 'Norfolk islanders in general regard their island as the homeland of descendants of the settlers from Pitcairn Island who, in 1856, were moved as a community to Norfolk Island, a community that came as a fully self-governing ethnic community with its own laws, language culture and traditions,' he wrote. Norfolk Island Chief Minister Lisle Snell (left) and Administrator of Norfolk Island Gary Hardgrave (right) have locked horns over the national anthem issue . Mr Snell went on to say that it was a controversial matter and God Save the Queen had been the chosen anthem for many years, which was sung on days that paid tribute to the fallen soldiers of World War I and World War II. Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Office of the Prime Minister in relation to this matter. Mr Hardgrave - a former Queensland Liberal National Party MP - was appointed in July as the 37th Administrator of Norfolk Island. But it appears it has not been smooth sailing for the nation island - who usually enjoys its autonomy from Australia - since Mr Hardgrave took the post. In a Norfolk Island Government press release date October 9, Mr Snell accuses the Federal Government of taking away the nation's rights to self govern, which it has done for four years. 'I believe the Federal Government intends to impose on Norfolk Island a slightly modified Christmas Island model, which has proven to be dysfunctional, inoperable and does not allow for community representation and input above that of Local Government status as clearly identified by the recent Administrator of Christmas Island,' he said. Norfolk Island is located more than 1,400km off the coast of New South Wales . Norfolk Island when the Pitcairn people arrived after it was abandoned in 1853 . Sydney Bay at Norfolk Island in 1885, about 20 years before the federation of Australia in 1901 . After the British invasion of Australia in 1788, Norfolk Island - which was originally inhabited by East Polynesians - became a convict settlement. It lay abandoned from 1814 to 1825 until it was decided by the then-Governor of NSW that the criminals who committed the most severe offences would be sent there due to its remote location. Again the island was abandoned in 1853 and then re-inhabited when Tahitians and mutineers of HMS Bounty were sent to it when the Pitcairn Islands were no longer suitable for the size of the population. Soon farming and whaling became sources of income for those living on the island. Norfolk Island was given the right to govern as an external territory after the federation of Australia in 1901. It was also used as an airbase and a refuelling station for planes during World War II.","Australia has been using Advance Australia Fair as its national anthem for 40 years now .

"Women are more likely to wear black on a Monday than any other day of the week, according to research by Tu at Sainsbury's (file picture) For some it reflects their downbeat mood as the working week begins, for others it is a way to get themselves in the right frame of mind. But women are more likely to wear black on a Monday than any other day, according to research. They generally dress in darker colours early on but then brighten up their clothes as the week goes on. A study of 2,000 women carried out by Tu at Sainsbury's to mark the tenth anniversary of the supermarket chain brand also found that one in five pick different colours for different days. The feeling that bright clothes reflect a happier outlook and have the ability to lift mood was the strongest reason cited for choosing colourful outfits ahead of the weekend. Anna Clarke, head of womenswear buying for Tu at Sainsbury's, said: 'The links between colour and mood are well established and looking vibrant can encourage the same feeling in the wearer. 'Black clothing will always have its place but embracing colour and being adventurous with your style can have added bonuses on our happiness levels. 'Whatever the essentials a woman swears by, the results show that finding your confidence and the colours that work for you only grows with age.' The study also found that black is currently the most-worn colour, followed by blue. It also emerged that the choice of a black outfit can boost a woman's confidence. The second most popular confidence-boosting colour is red. The study also discovered a woman's clothes confidence grows with age. As well as colours and confidence, the research also examined the dramatic changes in fashion over the last ten years and revealed women's favourite fashion innovations. Skinny and slim cut jeans came top followed by ultra high heels, large handbags and big sunglasses. Wearing trainers for fashion rather than sport or exercise also made the list. Bolder prints, clashing prints, oversized jumpers and bright colours also made the hall of fame. And while trends are always changing, some things really do stand the test of time - six in 10 women have an item of clothing they've owned for more than 10 years, results showed. The study of fashion attitudes also found certain items transcend time and compiled women's top 20 wardrobe essentials - a black cardigan emerged as the most voted for item followed by a little black dress and skinny jeans. The feeling that bright clothes reflect a happier outlook and have the ability to lift mood was the strongest reason cited for choosing colourful outfits ahead of the weekend, the study by Sainsbury's found (file picture) A maxi dress and a push-up bra were also deemed to be 'must-haves' for any modern woman's clothing repertoire. While denim jackets, neutral wedges and a white shirt can also be found among the top 20 wardrobe essentials. Ms Clarke added: 'The study shows the strength of correlation between how a woman feels and the colours she chooses to dress herself in. 'Black is a very versatile colour and can help generate a working mind-set as the results clearly show but it's interesting to see that when it comes to feeling good and more positive a splash of colour really does make the difference. 'There was a clear trend towards wearing more colour towards the end of the week and a visible boost to a woman's mood when wearing brighter colours.'","Study of 2,000 women found that most are likely to wear black on Monday .

"A bizarre cloud over parts of Victoria caused a flurry of concern and awe on social media as witnesses labelled the formation the 'rapture cloud'. The rare cloud, known as a Fallstreak Hole, appeared over the Wonthaggi, in the Gippsland area of Victoria on Monday, flecked with colour and giving the appearance of a hole in the sky. Social media users flocked to the web to speculate what the cloud was, with some claiming that it was a 'rapture' cloud. Scroll down for video . The rare cloud, known as a Fallstreak Hole, appeared over the Wonthaggi, in the Gippsland area of Victoria on Monday, flecked with colour and giving the appearance of a hole in the sky . Ben Stewart was with his family on Phillip Island when they spotted the unusual cloud formation in the sky . On Twitter user said, 'Rapture's here, folks. Some weird rainbow/ cloud action going on in Wonthaggi right now'. Another asked, 'What's going on over Wongthaggi?' According to Science Magazine, the holes can be caused by a phenomena called 'seeding', when planes fly though clouds causing ice particles to freeze in the air as it flows around the aircraft. Ben Stewart was with his family on Phillip Island when they spotted the unusual cloud formation in the sky. 'We just looked up and there was this thing that looked like something out of Independence Day,' he told Daily Mail Australia. The IT consultant from Melbourne said that they stood staring at the sky for a while, trying to figure out what it was. 'Other people spotted it as well, and most of the theories as to what caused it had to do with an aircraft or helicopter, definitely man made,' he said. 'One of my friends did say in jest that it was the rapture. It definitely looked out of place in the sky.' 'I guess now we're all just waiting for the mothership to come.' Mr Stewart said that he often saw unusual weather patterns as he grew up in northern Victoria, but that this was one of the more bizarre. 'It was a perfectly sunny day, and quite warm, so it just seemed to come out of nowhere,' he said. Michael Efron from the Bureau of Meteorology's duty forecaster, said that the cloud could also be called a punch hole cloud. 'They form when the water temperature in the cloud is below freezing, but the water has not yet frozen due to a lack of ice nucleation particles,' Mr Efron told Fairfax Media. 'In this case, when the water does start to freeze, it falls down to the surface ... so you're left with this cloud surrounding it, this clear area.' The fallstreak hole is seen in the skies above Wonthaggi in southeastern Australia by dairy farmer Leesa Willmott, 47, on Sunday. On the right the rare cloud formation is seen with a rainbow streak running through it . The flecks of colour were called iridescence, and can also be found in other natural objects such as sea shells, soap bubbles and even butterfly wings. 'This type of [cloud] iridescence occurs with high level cloud and with diffraction, [meaning] that water droplets are gathering light,' Mr Efron said. There have been other recent sightings of fallstreak hole clouds, with one forming over Perth in early October. A spokesman from the Bureau of Meteorology told Perth Now that 'It doesn’t occur often so it’s no surprise that it’s causing quite a stir'. In May the same type of cloud formed over Northern California, sparking debates of UFO's and conspiracies. 'So the @WhiteHouse wants you to believe what happened over the skies of Stockton yesterday was a ""cloud formation"" ? GTFOH #iKnowWhatiSaw,' tweeted one user. Others pointed to government controlled weather manipulation and wormholes for the cloud's unusual appearance.","A bizzare cloud formation appeared over Victoria, ringed by a rainbow and giving the appearance of a hole in the sky .

"Blackpool have performed a U-turn in appointing a new manager after deciding against employing Brian Flynn. The Seasiders have been without a permanent boss since Paul Ince’s sacking in January and the former Wrexham boss was set to take over at Bloomfield Road.

"A 73-year-old Montreal drama teacher who appeared in some softcore budget films over 40 years ago - one called The Secret Diary of a Nymphomaniac - has been fired from her position at the elite private school after some students traced back her racy roles. Jacqueline Laurent-Auger says she briefly worked as a young erotic actress in Paris - appearing in titles like Swedish Sex Games and Nathalie: Escape From Hell, but nothing pornographic - in the 1970s before returning to her native Quebec. She continued a career in TV and film before settling as a teacher, having taught at the prestigious private school Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf for the last 15 years, according to The National Post. However Laurent-Auger is now out of a job after some male students tracked down some of her work online, presumably by accessing her IMDB page. Scroll down for video . Fired: Drama teacher Jacqueline Laurent-Auger, 73, as fired from private boys school Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf after some students tracked down a set of erotic films she appeared in between 1960 and the 1970s . Controversial: One of the racy titles Laurent-Auger appeared in was Campo de Perversion, which was released in English as Nathalie: Escape From Hell and was set inside a Nazi war camp . Tasteful: In Nathalie: Escape From Hell, Laurent-Auger plays a 'sadistic female SS officer' who tortures an American doctor imprisoned at a Nazi concentration camp . Finale: In this scene, Laurent-Auger's character is shot and killed by the Americans . Sex cinema: Le journal intime d’une nymphomane (The Secret Diary of a Nymphomaniac) and Lorna The Exorcist are some of the titles Laurent-Auger appeared in as a young woman . The school deemed the material - some of which included nude scenes - as unacceptable behavior of a teacher, regardless of when it was filmed. 'The fact these films were made 40 years ago does not change their risqué, suggestive — explicit even — nature,' the school told The National Post. 'Thanks to the Internet, it appears these types of films from the 1970s have come back in fashion. 'As educators, we had to ask what message is transmitted to all our students, boys and girls, from the first year of high school to the fifth, by the fact that the teacher of their drama workshops could now be seen on the Internet in the most suggestive of scenes.' Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf is considered the best school in Quebec. However Laurent-Auger thinks the move is outrageous. She believes, as an elderly woman, the decisions she made in her twenties should not have any great leaning on her life. 'It’s completely absurd,' she told Radio-Canada. 'I’m 73 years old. Elite: Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf is considered the best boys school in Quebec . 'When I made those films I must have been 28 or 29. 'It was to make a living so that after(wards) I could work with great teachers and actors, in Paris and in Quebec. Come on.' 'It is too bad (the principal) said something so stupid, that I was distracting (the students). 'They should have been made to understand what was the cinema of that period.' Laurent-Auger said the films reflect what was happening in cinema at the time and are not considered pornographic but just 'open-minded'. An online petition has been start in order to get Laurent-Auger her job back. There were reports late Wednesday Laurent-Auger had been talking with the school about a new outcome.","Jacqueline Laurent-Auger appeared in some small-time erotic films as a young actress in Paris in the 1960s and 70s .

"A company has created a revolutionary cylindrical tool kit for campers, hikers and even those who are afraid of a zombie apocalypse. Called the VSSL Outdoor Utility Tools, it consists of tubes each just 7.8 inches (20cm) long but holds an impressive essential 15 items. Each of the items, including a compass and matches, can be taken and put back into the cylinders as required. Scroll down for video . An inventor in Vancouver has designed multi-tool cylinders.

The cylinders come in four different forms, each with different tools . They are called supplies, shelter, first aid and zombie. Each costs about £50 ($80), although all four can be bought for £140 ($225). The supplies kit costs the most items and includes things like a flashlight, compass, matches and more. The shelter kit contains a tent, rope, compass and flashlight. And the first aid cylinder predictably contains first aid supplies. However, while all of those can be classed as useful, the 'zombie' kit is a more tongue-in-cheek design for those afraid of the apocalypse. Originally this had been planned to contain a 'zombie spike' but Kickstarter ordered the company to remove this as they have a no weapons rule. So instead it now apparently contains a 'zombie pacifying bouquet of flowers' the team joke on Kickstarter. Each cylinder holds an impressive 15 essential items. All of the items fit into tiny 'capsules', are then placed into the larger cylinder. Pictured here is the first aid kit . The cylinders come in four different forms, each with different tools.

The unique device can then be easily placed into bags and even fits in trouser pockets. It comes with tools including a first aid kit, compass, matches, whistle, razor blade, mirror, can opener, LED light, a wire saw and more. The cylindrical tool kits are made from seamless extruded military specification aluminium. 'It was something I've been thinking about since I was a child growing up in Northern Canada,' said Mr Weimer.

"The fiancée of convicted rapist Ched Evans stepped out in public today sporting her new engagement ring. Natasha Massey was spotted out and about for the first time since news of her engagement to the disgraced footballer emerged. Ms Massey - who has led the campaign against the Evans's conviction - looked relaxed as she walked through Alderley Edge, Cheshire, carrying a Prada handbag and wearing a Rolex watch. Natasha Massey, the fiancée of convicted rapist Ched Evans, stepped out in public today, sporting her new engagement ring . Ms Massey was spotted in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, just one day after it emerged she had agreed to marry the disgraced footballer . It emerged yesterday that Evans, 25, proposed to Ms Massey two weeks after being released from prison. The former Sheffield United and Wales striker was released from Wymott prison, Lancashire, on October 17 after serving half of a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old in his hometown of Rhyl, North Wales. Ms Massey, the daughter of a millionaire, has constantly shown her public support for Evans and even appeared alongside the footballer in a controversial video he made last month in a bid to 'clear his name'. In the clip, Ms Massey appeared to be wearing an 'engagement' ring, but it is now thought to have been a 'commitment ring' which the footballer gave his girlfriend while in prison. Evans had not wanted to propose while he was in jail, but planned to asked Ms Massey to marry him as soon as he was freed, it was said. In the video - which was the first time he had spoken out about the crime - Evans insisted he was guilty only of 'infidelity' against his girlfriend and not the rape for which he was jailed. Ched Evans, pictured left, proposed to Ms Massey shortly after being released from prison, where he served time for raping a 19-year-old girl . Ms Massey, who has continued to protest Evans's innocence since he was convicted of the crime, was seen wearing a ring in a recent video the footballer made in which he claimed he was only guilty of infidelity . But he was heavily criticised for offering no remorse to his victim - who had previously been named by trolls on Twitter and forced to change her name as a result. Instead, he offered an apology to Ms Massey, who he described as 'the woman I love with all my heart'. He said: 'I've constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it. 'The support that's been shown by Natasha, our friends and family during the trial and the time spent in prison has kept me strong. It is thought Evans, pictured with Ms Massey before he was convicted, did not want to propose from jail . 'It can't have been an easy thing to stand by someone who the court found guilty of such a destructive act. I will be forever grateful. 'Even though I've been released from prison I'm determined to continue to fight to clear my name.' Ms Massey has continued to protest Evans's innocence since he was convicted of rape in April 2012. Shortly before his release earlier this month, she wrote on the ChedEvans.com website: 'Not a minute passes when I don't think about Ched, his mental and physical strength is admirable and keeps us all positive. Ms Massey, pictured with Evans last week, is said to be 'over the moon' after he proposed to her . 'When Ched is released the fight to clear his name will continue, however long it takes this is one fight we will not lose. 'My boyfriend was wrongly convicted and we are doing everything in our power to clear his name.' She later told ITV's This Morning: ‘As soon as I found out that he’d been questioned over rape, my instinct was kind of protective of Ched, and I thought I have to stand by him. ‘So my thoughts and feelings over the cheating were put to one side and I just stepped in to help him through this terrible time. ‘I know Ched and I knew he wouldn’t be capable of committing a crime like that.’ Evans's own family have also criticised his lack of remorse, with his aunt Nina Evans, 56, urging him to apologise to his victim. Ms Massey, pictured on ITV's This Morning, said she put thoughts of Evans's infidelity 'to one side' His victim's father has also spoken out about Evans's ongoing campaign, saying it is making life unbearable for his daughter. He said: ‘He’s shown no remorse and every time he makes some fresh appeal or comment, he draws attention to my daughter and risks her being identified and found. ‘She went into hiding because people were trying to track her down and kill her.' Evans was jailed for five years at Caernarvon Crown Court in April 2012 for raping the 19-year-old waitress, who was judged to be too drunk to have given her consent to sex. By law, the victim has a right to lifelong anonymity. Yet following the jury’s unanimous verdict, her name was tweeted by Evans’s supporters and then re-tweeted more than 6,000 times. Police gave her a new identity but her cover has been blown twice more, forcing her to adopt a new name each time in a fresh location. Evans was jailed in April 2012 at Caernarfon Crown Court and was released from Wymott prison, Lancashire (pictured) after serving half of a five-year sentence . The much-covered story unfolded on May 29, 2011, when Evans, his brother, another man and another footballer, Port Vale defender Clayton McDonald, went out in Rhyl, North Wales. McDonald encountered the victim in a takeaway kebab shop, where she was already unsteady on her feet. She agreed to go back to his hotel. The court was told how McDonald and Evans both had sex with the girl. Evans insisted the sex was entirely consensual, but nevertheless chose to leave the hotel via a fire escape. The girl was so drunk she could remember nothing of the evening. She woke up the next morning naked and confused. She told the court she thought her drink had been spiked and called the police later that day, reporting what she thought was the theft of her bag. Following the police investigation, both men were charged with rape. McDonald, 25, was subsequently acquitted. The Criminal Cases Review Commission is currently examining Evans's case as part of his hopes to launch an appeal. He has not been re-signed by his former club or any other team since his release. Evans was jailed for five years in April 2012 for raping the 19-year-old waitress, who was judged to be too drunk to have given her consent to sex. The victim has a right to lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has made and allegation of a sexual assault — but her name was revealed on Twitter and retweeted more than 6,000 times by those backing Evans. The young woman was labelled a ‘slag’, ‘tramp’, ‘bitch’ and ‘whore’ and was subject to death threats. Nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012. Police put her ‘relocation package’ together and she had to start a new life away from her friends and family in north Wales. Some of the abuse amounted to ‘psychological GBH’, to use the description of one senior detective, which left the girl ‘traumatised’. But Twitter trolls continued to pursue her even though illegal naming carries a maximum fine of £5,000. She had to change her name two more times. Police also launched an investigation after CCTV footage of his victim was published on Ched Evans's official website. Under a video titled 'Too drunk to remember?', the woman could be seen walking into the Premier Inn in Rhyl where she was attacked by Evans. After his release, the father of Ched Evans's victim pleaded for the former Sheffield United striker to stop trying to clear his name because it is 'destroying' his daughter.","Natasha Massey seen with ring one day after news of engagement emerged .

"An Arizona school district says it's investigating after doubts were raised about a high school teacher and volleyball coach who said she earned a PhD as well as won an Olympic silver medal. Christie Slegers has taught science at Fountain Hills High School since 2013 and recently took on coaching responsibilities for the girls varsity volleyball team. 'I played college ball before making the U.S. team,' Slegers told the Fountain Hills Times when she started her coaching stint. 'So, yes, I am an Olympic silver medalist. I know a little bit about volleyball.' No glory: USA Volleyball says Christie Slegers, who coaches volleyball at Fountain Hills High School, was not an official member of the delegation at the 1984 Olympics, where the women's team won silver . When she told the team that she was a medalist, a suspicious parent investigated the claim and notified the school. Fountain Hills High School principal Tom Brennan responded: 'We are satisfied with the information Dr. Slegers provided to us, and consider this matter closed.' KPHO contacted USA Volleyball, who said Slegers, under her maiden name, was never a medalist. 'Christie Currie (Slegers) was not a member of the official delegation/team for the 1984 U.S. Olympic Volleyball Team,' the organization responded. When it came to her academic qualifications, there were more questions. Fountain Hills High School's website calls Slegers the science department chair and she's listed as having a PhD. Falcons: Slegers chaired the science department and coached volleyball at Fountain Hills, though the school district's superintendent says she's now under investigation . Even Slegers's LinkedIn doesn't mention a PhD, saying she studied at St Cloud State University in addition to earning a bachelor's in biology and chemistry from Hamline University. 'Christie Jean Currie did not earn a degree at St. Cloud State University,' St Cloud confirmed to KPHO. 'She earned the equivalent to a Biology major at the undergraduate level.' Now the issue has gone up to the district, with superintendent Tom Lawrence telling KPHO: 'The investigation is ongoing, and I cannot comment beyond that.'","Christie Slegers coaches and chairs the science department at Fountain Hills High School .

So much so, that the used cutlery and crockery is simply placed 'in the vicinity' of the dishwasher instead of in it. In his latest tongue-in-cheek offering, Mr Reid, from Southampton, has some advice for his teenage children, James and Beth, on how to load the dishwasher. Writing on his YouTube page, he says: 'I honestly didn't think there would be another one as the first one was spontaneous and meant as a joke. A joke that seems to have struck a chord with quite a few people!! 'I have really enjoyed reading all your comments and suggestions and because of that, I decided to give it a go and see what you all think. 'All I ask is please don't take any of this too seriously. It is all just a bit of fun and who knows, maybe James and Beth may one day actually load the dishwasher or change the toilet roll?!! Sandra and I certainly hope so!!' Managing to keep a straight face as he explains his aims of the short film, Mr Reid pans to some crockery and rubbish on the worktop, helpfully telling us that 'not all of this goes into the dishwasher.' Reid is hoping his video will strike a nerve with other parents who struggle to get their teenagers to tidy up . The distressed dad shows the 'advanced level', which involves switching the dishwasher on . Take note, James and Beth. 'It's really just the plates, and the knives and forks and spoons. There's a few dirty things already in here already,' he says as he opens the dishwasher door. 'But that goes in there like that, you can put a plate in there like that.' The exasperated father then points to a bowl that 'needs to be rinsed out a bit' as it has 'congealed' after being left in one of his children's bedrooms. 'Really that's about all there is to it,' adds Mr Reid, before educating teens on the 'advanced level'. 'Put a dishwasher tab in here, and these buttons on top are like the buttons on your Xbox or PlayStation that make it work, or effectively boot it up. Give that a try and let me know how you get on, and thanks for watching.' Helpfully, Mr Reid points to where the 'tab' goes so his children have no excuse . In a message on his YouTube page, Mr Reid writes: 'I hope this raises a smile and maybe some knowing nods' 'If it does, please share and let's see what happens. 'Despite my kids saying that I'm not funny and no one would be interested, I guess I have shown them that maybe Dads do know a thing or two about the internet! Who would have thought?!!!'","Exasperated dad Will Reid hopes teenage children will learn from video .

"Dame Maggie Smith has said portraying the withering Dowager Countess of Grantham on Downton Abbey has made her too famous to go out alone. On a recent visit to Paris, the 79-year-old actress said she was 'besieged' by American fans of the ITV drama. 'That's never happened to me before,' she said, according to the Telegraph. Scroll down for video . The actress said she was 'besieged' by American fans of Downton Abbey while in Paris for her latest project . 'It's very difficult when you're alone because you have no escape.' She added: 'It was awful. I love wandering round on my own and I just couldn't.' Dame Maggie was in the French city filming 'My Old Lady' which is set to be released this month. A full interview with the actress will appear in Saturday's Review magazine. Last month, the actress was honoured by the Queen at Windsor Castle and made a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, joining an illustrious group of recipients - including Professor Stephen Hawking and painter David Hockney. Maggie Smith says her role in the ITV drama has made her so famous she can't go out without being mobbed . The withering put-downs she delivers portraying the Dowager Countess of Grantham have become the stuff of Downton Abbey legend . Younger audiences will recognise Dame Maggie for her role as sharp-tongued Professor McGonagall in the Harry Potter movies . And while Dame Maggie might be famous for playing the Dowager Countess of Grantham, she's also well-known for portraying the equally sharp-tongued Professor Minerva McGonagall in the Harry Potter movies .

"The sister of terror suspect Omarjan Azari was charged with assaulting and intimidating police officers at the family home during last month's dramatic counter-terrorism raids. Police alleged in court on Wednesday that Mursal Azari, 23, assaulted a male constable between 4:45 and 4:46am as officers stormed the brick property in Guildford, in Sydney's western suburbs. During that same tense minute on the morning of September 18, Ms Azari also allegedly intimidated a female constable, police told a court. Scroll down for video . Pleaded not guilty: Mursal Azari, 23, was charged by police over allegations she assaulted a male constable and intimidated a female officer . Accused of conspiracy to commit terrorism offences: Omarjan Azari faced Central Local Court last month . Dramatic raids: The Azari family property in Guildford swarmed with police officers on September 18 . Digging: Police were photographed digging up part of the Azari family home's front yard on the day of the terror raids . The raids saw Ms Azari's younger brother, Omarjan, arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit acts in preparation of a terrorist attack. Police alleged he was involved in a plot to behead a random member of the public. At Parramatta Local Court on Wednesday, Ms Azari pleaded not guilty to both charges through a solicitor. The case is expected to be heard again on December 3. Ms Azari declined to comment at the family home on Thursday morning, referring any questions to a barrister who has been reported as representing her brother. Ms Azari's solicitor, Penelope Purcell, told Daily Mail Australia: 'We are going to be defending the charges', but refused to provide further comment. Police inspect the boot of a car parked at the Azari residence on September 18 . Counter-terrorism raids: Uniformed police officers surround a young man during the counter-terrorism raids on September 18 . Tied up: A man is detained by police during the dawn counter-terrorism raids . AFP officers inspect under a car at a residence in Marsfield, in Sydney's west, on the day of the nation's largest ever counter-terrorism raids . By some indications, Azaris' family life has returned to somewhat normal since the raids, while Omarjan Azari remains incarcerated. The raids involved more than 800 New South Wales police officers and were the largest operation of its kind in the nation's history. AFP and NSW police officers executed search warrants across the western and north-western suburbs of Sydney, executing search warrants in Beecroft, Bellavista, Guildford, Merrylands, Northmead, Wentworthville, Marsfield, Westmead, Castle Hill, Revesby, Bass Hill and Regents Park. Bundles of cash and a curved sword - later identified as plastic and as possessing religious significance - were some of the evidence removed from a Sydney home. Helicopters swooped overhead and dozens of police crowded into the Azaris' Guildford street that September morning. The street had been under surveillance since the second week of May. In evidence tendered to Central Local Court, police alleged Mr Azari received a phone call from Mohammed Ali Baryalei - the former Underbelly actor and bouncer who security agencies have identified as a leading recruiter of Australian Islamic State militants - where the conspiracy was discussed. Terror kingpin: Security agencies have named Mohammed Ali Baryalei, a former Underbelly bit-part actor, as a major recruiter of Australian Islamic State militants . According to reports, security officials believe half of the 60 Australians fighting for militant groups in the Middle East were recruited by Baryalei. Ms Azari's parents, Amaljan and Gulpeika, were overseas on the annual Hajj pilgrimage at the time of the raids. It is understood they have since returned to Australia. On Thursday morning, a young man at the Azari residence, believed to be a sibling of Omarjan, headed to his place of work as a tradesman and a small kitten played in the sunshine in their front window sill. Last month, relatives of Omarjan Azari told Daily Mail Australia he was a 'gentle loving person' who had been fanatical about soccer and a keen cricket fan. They said the allegations did not make sense. His cousin, Rami, said last month that Omarjan, who was very religious, 'didn't have time' to be involved in any terror plots because 'he studies at night'. Rami said Omarjan had been aware he was being followed. 'He's only a kid. He was petrified. He's been scared for a long time,' he said. 'He's been scared for a long time because he was being followed.' Rami said when they talked, Omarjan would insist they put their mobile phones in the car, so they could ensure no one was listening. For that reason, he could not believe police had any evidence of a phone call. Omarjan Azari will return to court in November.

"More than 74 years after the Battle of Britain, aviation buffs will be able to take to the skies in the very same planes in which thousands of heroic RAF pilots fought for their country against the Luftwaffe. Boultbee Flight Academy, based in Sussex, has become the first in the country to offer passenger flights inside Spitfires. From £2,750, Britons can experience what it feels like to soar in one of two reconditioned fighter planes - which were seen as a key aircraft in Britain's survival during the Second Wold War. Take to skies: Britons will be able to experience flying in reconditioned WWII spitfires . A 50-minute flight to the white cliffs of The Needles at Alum Bay, Isle of Wigh will cost £4,750, while a package for two - involving flying in formation, comes to £10,000. Passengers can enjoy a 30 or 50-minute flight in the two-seater planes, which has a Rolls-Royce Merlin engine and recorded speeds of up to 400mph. Matt Jones, managing director of Boultbee Flight Academy, said: 'Flying on one of these iconic war birds is an exceptional experience that everyone should have the opportunity to try. Patriots: 1,878 RAF pilots participated in the Battle of Britain in 1940 . The WWII air campaign by the German Air Force occurred over several months in 1940. The UK suffered devastating aerial bombings as the Luftwaffe attempted to destroy Britain's air defences. The RAF's efforts prevented Hitler's plans to invade Britain and was a crucial turning point in the war, marking Germany's first major defeat. 348 British pilots were killed during the campaign. 'Trust me when I say that it is the most emotional, historical and exhilarating experience available in aviation today, and we very much look forward to sharing the aircraft with everyone who comes to visit.' The new offer, which sees the Spitfires take off from Goodwood Aerodrome in Chichester, West Sussex, is also being hailed as a way to conserve the Vickers Supermarine Spitfires for years to come. Mark added: 'Their involvement will contribute significantly to ensuring Spitfires keep flying well into the future.' Boultbee Academy is the only accredited Spitfire training school in the world. The full experience, including briefing and flight, lasts four hours and is available in morning and afternoon slots.","Boultbee Flight Academy, Sussex, first to offer passenger flights in aircraft .

"Have you ever wondered what you would look like if you were a little skinnier or your nose were a little straighter? For one photographer, wondering wasn't enough. Scott Chasserot has created images that explore what ordinary people would look like as their 'ideal self.' The photographer wanted to investigate our subconscious beauty ideals in order to display the gap between how we look and how we long to look. Scott Chasserot has created his model's 'ideal appearance' (right) by manipulating their original portrait (left) The project, Original Ideal combines portrait photography with neuroscience combining psychology, brain scans and photo shop. Scott begins by taking a portrait image of each subject. He told Buzzfeed that he looks for models who are  'facially very interesting. Or that have interesting stories. A few people on are transgender.' The alterations vary from a change in eye size to skin tone . The subjects are presented their alternative images while attached to a brain scanner . After taking the original image, Scott creates 50 more portraits by making small adjustments using Photoshop, altering anything from the size of their eyes to the tone of their skin.  . The subject is presented with the various versions while attached to a brain scanner which records their reactions in order to determine the version they prefer. Some of the changes to the images were barely noticeable but in other cases the subject's ideal appearance was unrecognisable to their first image . Scott combined photography with neuroscience to complete his project . When selecting his models Scott opted for those that he described as 'visually interesting' Once Scott has uncovered which of the images the subject has the most positive reaction to he displays it next to the original image, showcasing the contrast between the original image and the model's ideal. In some of the photographs the change is barely discernible, with the smallest of tweaks - such as a slight re-positioning of the eyes - needed to make the subject satisfied with their appearance. However, in some cases the second portrait is completely different to the first, with a change in eye colour and size seeming to make the most noticeable change in overall appearance. Several of Scott's subjects were transgender, however their identities have been kept secret . The most stark contrasts appeared when the second image saw a change in eye colour and size . Scott believes that even from a young age we still have an idea of what we would prefer to look like . For this subject a change as subtle as an extended forehead was all that he sees as an improvement to himself . The photographer alters the original image 50 times on Photoshop and then uses a brain-scanner to measure which image the subject reacts most positively to .

"Meghan Trainor's 'All About That Bass' leads an all-female top five on the Billboard Hot 100 for a nrecord-breaking fifth week in a row. The girl-power message spans throughout the top of the list: Taylor Swifts 'Shake it Off' came in at number two, Iggy Azalea's 'Black Widow' featuring Rita Ora at number three, Jessie J, Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj's 'Bang Bang' at number four, and Nicki Minaj's 'Anaconda' at number five. The girls continued to lock the boys out of the lead with Tove Lo's 'Stay High' coming in at number six. Scroll down for video .

Body image: Trainor told Billboard that she wrote the song for herself due to her struggles with body image . This top five female domination puts the ladies along side greats like Donna Summer, Anita Ward, and Sister Sledge, who are three of the five that make up Billboard's first-ever all-female top five. This week is the fourth time in Billboard's 56-year history that females have done this, according to Billboard. However, this is the first time an all-female top five has been in place for a consecutive five weeks. Unlike their predecessors, this group of women isn't topping the charts with mushy romance ballads, theirs is a message of one thing: girl power. From Trainor telling women not to 'worry about your size' to Swift encouraging females everywhere to forget their critics and 'shake it off,' Billboard boasts that songs like these celebrate a strong self-image. In July, Trainor told Billboard that she wrote the song for herself due to her struggles with body image. 'If other girls can relate to the song,' Trainor said, 'it makes me feel even better. It's unreal that I'm kind of helping people.' Though the females have locked guys out of the top five for the fifth consecutive week, Billboard reports that this is only the second week that female artists have knocked boys out of the top six in Billboard history. The first occurred Feb. 27, 1999 when artists such as Monica, Cher, Houston, Spears, McLachlan and Cox did so.

"A 15-year-old girl who was caught on camera for allegedly attacking a former school friend in a park has broken her silence and revealed she is 'not sorry' for what she had done. The shocking video shows the girl dragging a 16-year-old by the hair as she bashes her before a final kick to her face in a suburban park in Cranebrook, which is 60km west of Sydney's central business district last Saturday afternoon. 'I'm sorry for - I don't regret what I done but I'm sorry for the way I done it,' she told Nine News. 'I didn't mean to hurt her the way I did, and all that stuff.' Scroll down for video . Swift and vicious: This is the final, terrifying moment of the assault in which a 15-year-old schoolgirl brutally kicks in the face a girl, 16, from the same school in a beating which took place in a suburban park last Saturday in the far western Sydney suburb of Cranebrook . During the attack, filmed on a phone by a third girl who sings and laughs during the assault, the victim apparently anticipates the violence and repeatedly asks for someone to take her phone. 'Can't you just take no for an answer. I am not fighting you right now,' the victim said in the video. 'No I am not getting away from the baby because I'm not fighting you. 'I have never had a fight in my life.' before another intervenes and says: 'Well it's time to experience them.' Headed for trouble: The 16-year-old girl (pictured wearing a dress) heads through the trees in the Cranebrook park followed by her assailant wearing a dark blue hoodie and lighter blue jeans moments before the confrontation .

About to happen: It''s seconds before the assault begins and the girl, 16, anticipating that it's about to get nasty pleads with someone to take her phone from her . The victim is seen pushing an infant on a swing before she tries to walk away from the bullies but they follow and surround her. The pair clash, the victim holding up both hands in a defensive manner, then the 15-year-old assailant knees her and pulls her down by her long blonde hair and kicks her. While the victim is lying on the ground, the younger girls delivers a direct and brutal kick in the face, and the victim emits a whimper. The girl filming the attack laughs as the victims remains on the ground. Hands off: The 16-year-old holds up he hands as the younger girl marches in for the attack. The video is being filmed by a girl who is singing and then laughing her way through, while others watch on in .

The victim's aunt, Tanya, told Ray Hadley her niece went to the same school as the 15-year-old. The girl who filmed the attack uploaded the video onto Facebook, after which the victim's family reported the incident to police. Police from Penrith Local Area Command have interviewed the girl and charged her with Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm. The teenager, from Bidwill, has been placed on strict bail conditions and will appear in the NSW Children's Court next month.

"Hundreds of students pelted each other with shaving foam today as part of a 600-year-old ritual at Scotland's oldest university. The annual foam fight at St Andrews University marks the culmination of Raisin Weekend, where student 'parents' inflict tasks on the unfortunate first-years they have adopted as 'children'. It usually takes place in the tranquil setting of St Salvator's Quad, which dates back to 1450, but this year the students transformed the university's Lower College Lawn into a sea of white. Scroll down for video . The giant annual foam fight at St Andrew's University marks the culmination of Raisin Weekend, a 600-year old tradition . It usually takes place in the tranquil setting of St Salvator's Quad at the oldest college, which dates back to 1450 . But this year the students transformed the university's Lower College Lawn into a sea of white because of a restoration project . Each year hundreds of students descend on the historic courtyard for the foam frenzy, covering each other from head to toe in white . In exchange for being dressed up in embarrassing costumes and taken on a pub crawl, the students usually give their academic 'parents' a present. This is normally a bottle of wine but traditionally it used to be a pound of raisins, hence the name. But the origin of the ritual remains a mystery to this year's intake of students. Jack, 17, a classics student, said: 'This is Raisin Monday, and it's a supposed tradition every year that you get academic parents, and on the Sunday you have a good time with them, get drunk, and then on Monday you have a foam fight. 'It's just an excuse to have fun, really. I don't know much of the history behind it but it's a good day. It evolved from a tradition where senior students were given a pound of raisins by new students in gratitude for welcoming them . On Raisin Sunday children bring gifts to their 'adopted' mothers and fathers and celebrations go on through the night . In previous years alcohol-fuelled high jinks have prompted complaints from members of the public as students became rowdy . Students have already been warned by police that anti-social behaviour will be taken seriously and action taken if necessary . 'The foam feels pretty weird. Some people are using top-quality stuff like Gillette, which isn't quite as sore on the eyes, but the Sainsbury's stuff is a bit sore. 'It's weird, it's fun, everybody is having a good time. It's bizarre but I'm enjoying it.' Shona, 19, an English and history student who is studying to be a teacher, said: 'On Raisin our academic mum dresses us up and our dad gives us something to carry into town in a procession, and we all have big foam fight. 'It is traditional. I know that they have done it for a long time, but I'm not totally sure where it came from originally.' Founded in 1413, St Andrews is Scotland's oldest university and is also where Prince William met Kate Middleton. It is traditional for academic mothers to give each of their children 'Raisin Strings', decorated with trinkets at some point during the weekend. These are usually small tokens that mean something to the academic mother and child. The number and colour of the Raisin Strings depends on the year that the mother is in. Academic fathers present their children with Raisin Receipts to take to the Quad for the foam fight. They were traditionally written on parchment and must include a Latin phrase.

"Separated parents who refuse to pay child maintenance will face the threat of being declined credit such as mortgages, credit cards and mobile phone contracts as a result. Under new Government plans, from next March parents across Britain who fail to keep up with contributions towards their child’s upbringing will risk of harming their own credit rating. Arrears built up in the child maintenance system will potentially have the same impact on a non-payer’s credit score as other debts where someone has defaulted on their payments. New scheme: Separated parents who refuse to pay child maintenance will face the threat of being declined credit such as mortgages, credit cards and mobile phone contracts as a result . Having a weak credit rating can mean people are refused forms of financial credit such as personal loans, mortgages, credit cards, hire purchase finance arrangements and mobile phone contracts. The Government plans to introduce new powers which will enable the Child Maintenance Service and the Child Support Agency to start sharing certain information from their clients’ payment records with credit reference agencies. This data can then be used by financial firms to help them decide whether or not they want to offer someone credit. Determined: Child Maintenance Minister Steve Webb said the Government will take action to stop a minority of parents being able to get away with not paying maintenance . Even if someone is not rejected outright for credit, a blotted history could mean that they are given a smaller credit limit and are charged a worse rate of interest than they might otherwise be eligible for, as financial firms see that person as more “risky”. Information about non-payment of child maintenance would potentially be shared with credit reference agencies at the point where a liability order is made against a parent. Liability orders take place in a small minority of child maintenance cases. They are granted after an application is made to a court for legal recognition of a debt. The process involves informing parents before the application is made. Just under 1.5 million child maintenance cases are being overseen by the Child Maintenance Service and the Child Support Agency and in the majority of cases, parents who no longer live in the family home do contribute towards their child’s upbringing. Between April 2013 and March 2014, 12,410 liability orders were granted. The new powers, which are subject to parliamentary approval, will also mean that parents with a good payment record can ask that this information is shared if they feel that it could boost their ability to get credit. The Department for Work and Pensions already has existing contracts with credit reference agency Experian and the new powers will be exercised as an extension of this relationship. Child Maintenance Minister Steve Webb said: 'For too long, a minority of absent parents have got away with failing to pay maintenance, leaving families without that financial support. This Government is determined to take action to tackle this kind of irresponsible behaviour and support families. 'I would hope that we see this power used very little, because the deterrent effect of a possible negative mark on a person’s credit rating will convince those who have previously failed to pay towards their children’s upbringing to do the right thing.' The Child Maintenance Service was introduced in 2012 and it will eventually replace the Child Support Agency, which is gradually closing its cases over the next three years. The Government's latest plans for changes to the rules highlight the number of ways your rating can be affected negatively. So having a good handle on your credit history - and ensuring there are no mistakes - is important. This is because making sure your rating is accurate and working to improve your score is essential to getting the best mortgage, credit card, or loan and also affects other products such as mobile phone contracts. There are some basic checks you can make to improve your rating: . Read more here. Check your credit rating for free .

"Former prime minister Julia Gillard did not commit any crime in relation to an alleged corrupt slush fund operated by her one-time boyfriend, an inquiry has been told. Ms Gillard, who served as Australian Prime Minister from December 2007 and June 2010, denied that renovations to her home in 1990 were paid for by a union slush fund which her former lover, union boss Bruce Wilson established. The lawyer leading inquiries for the trade unions royal commission has recommended a finding that Ms Gillard did not commit any crime and did not know about allegedly criminal activity by Mr Wilson. Former prime minister Julia Gillard did not commit any crime in relation to an alleged corrupt slush fund operated by her one-time boyfriend, an inquiry has been told . The recommendation is among the written submissions to the commission by counsel assisting, Jeremy Stoljar SC, published on Friday. However Mr Stoljar reports that some aspects of Ms Gillard's professional conduct as a solicitor 'appear questionable'. He further said that she likely did receive money from Mr Wilson for her home renovations. Ms Gillard was questioned in the commission in September about off-the-books work she did as a young lawyer for Mr Wilson when he was an official in the Australian Workers' Union. Ms Gillard advised Mr Wilson and his union bagman, Ralph Blewitt, on setting up the AWU Workplace Reform Association (WRA) in the early 1990s. Ms Gillard was questioned in the commission in September about off-the-books work she did as a young lawyer for Mr Wilson when he was an official in the Australian Workers' Union . The commission has heard Mr Wilson used WRA as a slush fund to secretly receive thousands of dollars from a construction firm for work that was never done. Ms Gillard's failure to open a file for the work on the office system and rumours money from the fund paid for her renovations have dogged her career across two decades. Mr Stoljar wrote, 'Had she adopted a more rigorous approach to the task, it might have been more difficult for Mr Wilson and Mr Blewitt to have behaved as they did'. He concludes: 'The evidence supports a finding that Ms Gillard was the beneficiary or recipient of certain funds from Mr Wilson.' Mr Stoljar has also urged the commissioner to find that Health Services Union (HSU) whistleblower Kathy Jackson made a false claim for funds to Victoria's Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and that charges be considered. The submissions also recommend charges be considered against Victorian Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) boss John Setka. Mr Stoljar reports that Mr Setka 'committed the offence of blackmail' in a dispute where concrete firm Boral was banned from work-sites as part of a confrontation between the CFMEU and construction firm Grocon. Charges have also been recommended against NSW CFMEU state secretary Brian Parker and Cbus Superannuation officers Lisa Zanatta and Maria Butera in relation to a leak of confidential superannuation member information and 'obviously perjured evidence' to the commission. Commissioner Dyson Heydon will consider the submissions in compiling his interim report, due to be handed to the federal government on December 15.","Lawyer leading inquiries has recommended that Ms Gillard did not commit any crime and did not know about allegedly criminal activity by former lover Bruce Wilson .

"Republicans are bracing for a 'wave' election on Tuesday that could put them in control of both houses of Congress for the last two years of Barack Obama's presidency. They already run the House of Representatives, and expect to enlarge their majority. But the battle royale is in the Senate, where the GOP's 45 seats could become as many as 54 by the time the dust settles. 'Democrats are expecting an old-school shellacking,' a campaign consultant  who worked for Obama's 2012 campaign in Iowa told MailOnline on Monday. He was promised anonymity so he could speak freely. 'President Obama has been the worst thing that could have happened to Dems in the Senate this year. Everything Obama touches this year turns to s**t. The Republicans are going to laugh all the way back to Washington, and the president is going to be on defense until he leaves.' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, though, insisted on Monday the president believes Democrats will retain control of the Senate. And Vice President Joe Biden said CNN that he doesn't 'agree with the oddsmakers. I predict we're gonna ... keep the Senate.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . HAPPY AS A PIG IN SLOP: Republican former hog farmer Joni Ernst looks to upset Rep. Bruce Braley Tuesday in Iowa . IS IT ENOUGH? Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (left) brought out Hillary Clinton's big guns to help her combat former Republican Sen. Scott Brown in New Hampshire . Obama has largely stayed off the campaign trail as his fellow Democrats find it a liability to be seen with him in public. He showed up in Michigan on Saturday to help Congressman Gary Peters – who is already leading by an insurmountable margin. Iowa is one of the most hotly contested races, with both Bill and Hillary Clinton showing up in person in recent weeks. Nationally, the electoral map favors Republicans this year because Democrats are defending just 15 of the 21 seats up for grabs. In 2016 the tables will be turned, however, leaving the GOP with a two-year window to bring sweeping changes to Washington – with a recalcitrant president standing in their way. A cavalcade of Republican senators and Senate hopefuls have promised voters everything from new trade authorizations to a complete repeal of the Obamacare medical insurance law if they find themselves in charge Wednesday morning. Obama would veto a mass-scale rewrite of the Affordable Care Act, but Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and other hard-line conservatives have suggested firing off an endless series of bills attacking individual portions of the law – putting the president in a position to either compromise or accept the label of obstructionist. 'I am absolutely convinced that you’re going to see with a Republican led Senate – if we are lucky enough to get that – you’re going to see bills get to the president’s desk,' 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said Sunday on the Fox News Channel. 'He will sign some. Some he won’t sign, no question about that. He’ll veto some, but I think at that point we’ll find out who really is ""the party of no"".' IMPOTENT? Obama will be powerless to dictate the terms of legislation or stop Senate votes from happening if Republicans perform Tuesday as expected . Just weeks ago the Senate election outcome seemed anyone's guess. But the final opinion polls have put enough contests in the likely 'win' column for the Republican Party that even analysts atThe Washington Post, which typically supports Democrats, has acknowledged that the GOP has a 94 per cent chance of winning Senate control. In New Hampshire, former Republican Sen. Scott Brown has turned a deficit into a 1-point lead, according to an New England College poll released late Sunday night. The once-tight Iowa race has turning into a runaway, with former pig farmer Joni Ernst going ahead of Democratic Congressman Bruce Braley by 7 points in a Des Moines Register poll. Ernst, who grew up on a hog farm, put herself on the map during the primary season with an ad recalling her chore castrating pigs – as a signal that she would 'cut pork' in Washington. Incumbent Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu looks to be in serious trouble in Louisiana, despite leading Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy by eight points in Sunday's NBC News/Marist poll. A quirk in the Pelican State's election law provides for a runoff if no candidate wins 50 per cent of the vote and avoid a December 6 runoff. In the same poll, voters said they would prefer Cassidy by a 50-45 margin in a head-to-head do-over. Georgia is the other state with a runoff clause in its election law. That race, pitting Democratic former nonprofit leader Michelle Nunn against Republican businessman David Perdue, might not be decided until January 6 – three days after the new Congress is sworn in. That scenario, comical for its timing, looks to become a reality. Tom Cotton, Arkansas . ALASKA . Mark Begich (D) Dan Sullivan (R) ARKANSAS . Mark Pryor (D) Tom Cotton (R) Cory Gardner, Colorado . COLORADO . Mark Udall (D) Cory Gardner (R) GEORGIA . Michelle Nunn (D) David Perdue (R) Joni Ernst, Iowa . IOWA . Bruce Braley (D) Joni Ernst (R) Bill Cassidy, Louisiana . KANSAS .

Jeanne Shaheen (D) Scott Brown (R) Thom Tillis, N. Carolina . NORTH CAROLINA . Kay Hagen (D) Thom Tillis (R) Perdue has led in each of the last five polls, but by only 2 or 3 points – not enough to push him over the 50 per cent mark. The spoiler is Amanda Swafford, a Libertarian Party candidate who is pulling enough votes from Perdue to keep him from winning the seat outright on Tuesday. The other wild card is in Kansas, where a court battle allowed independent pol Greg Orman to replace the only Democrat on the ballot. If he beats incumbent Republican Sen. Pat Roberts, he could choose to caucus with either party. That race is a statistical dead heat according to a new Fox News poll, with Roberts ahead by only a single percentage point. If Republicans have only 50 Senate seats at the end of the night, he could play the role of kingmaker – with Republicans and Democrats wooing him with promises of committee chairmanships and pork-barrel projects for his home state. Should the final numbers read 50-50, Biden would exercise his official role an President of the Senate and cast tiebreaking votes – leaving things in the hands of Democratic Majority Leader Sen. Harry Reid. Other races are tightening as Election Day draws near. In Colorado, Republican Rep. Tom Cotton's lead over Democratic Sen. Mark Udall has shrunk from 6 points to just 2 in the past two weeks, according to the latest Quinnipiac University poll. The GOP expects to snatch Democratic seats easily in West Virginia, South Dakota and Montana, anomalous 'red' states that elected Democrats six years ago when President Obama's massive support at the polls benefited his party in other races. Democrats will handily hold on to their seats in Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, Massachusetts, New Mexico and Minnesota. Staying in the GOP column without a struggle will be Oklahoma, Maine, Tennessee and Idaho. LOSING IT: Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada could find himself out of a leadership job if Republicans perform as expected . Alaska is a toss-up, with incumbent Sen. Mark Begich struggling to mobilize the state's native tribes that have traditionally sided with Democrats in the way African Americans have in the 'lower 48' states. North Carolina is in the same boat, as Sen. Kay Hagan tries to hold on against Republican Thom Tillis, a member of the state legislature. Kentucky looks to remain with Sen. Mitch McConnell, likely the next Senate Majority Leader, who is handily leading the state's Secretary of State, Alison Lundergan Grimes by trading on both his voting record and his seniority. 'It gives our state an enormous advantage, he said in a weekend stump speech, 'to have the agenda setter for the entire country looking out for Kentucky on a daily basis.' Grimes also shot herself in the foot in October by refusing to say if she had voted for the politically nuclear Obama.","GOP could gain as many as NINE Senate seats but needs just six to take over both houses of Congress .

"This is the shocking moment three armed raiders threatened Domino's Pizza staff with a knife and guns before making off with cash - in a raid which lasted less than 60 seconds. The men stormed into the takeaway in Corby, Northamptonshire, after pulling up outside the entrance in a red Saab. CCTV footage shows the masked trio sprinting into the store before diving head first over the counter and rounding up the frightened staff inside. Scroll down for video . CCTV footage captured the moment a masked gang of three men burst into the Domino's Pizza in Corby, Northamptonshire. One of the robbers can be seen holding a worker at knife point (right) while another rifles through the tills . The footage shows the robbers storming into the takeaway after pulling up outside the entrance in a red Saab . The gang fled from the takeaway in their getaway car just 55 seconds after they had entered the outlet . One of the men, wearing a red jacket, then grabs a worker around the neck and threatens her with a knife while another rifles through a till in a back room. The gang - who appear to be holding black handguns - can then be seen running back out of the store and vaulting over the counter before getting back into the waiting Saab. Northamptonshire Police have released footage of the raid which shows the robbers fleeing in their getaway car just 55 seconds after bursting into the takeaway last Thursday night. A robber appears to hold a gun as he issues instructions to a terrified worker kneeling on the floor. In the background, another member of staff is held at knifepoint . A robber wearing a red hooded top could be seen brandishing a knife during the 55-second raid last Thursday . Officers believe the red Saab - which could have been a 9-3 model - was stolen from a property in Barton Seagrave, Northamptonshire, overnight on September 22 and 23. A police spokesperson said: 'At about 10.55pm, three offenders entered the shop in Rockingham Park and threatened staff with a knife and what appeared to be handguns, forcing them to hand over cash. 'Another person remained outside in a vehicle - a red Saab, possibly a 9-3 model. CCTV footage shows the masked trio sprinting into the store before diving head first over the counter and rounding up the frightened staff inside .

"A mixed-race clubber arrested over a taxi rank bust-up has finally won a five-year legal battle with police over racial discrimination. Bianca Durrant, 35, claimed she was wrongly arrested in Bristol in 2009 and ill-treated by police officers due to the colour of her skin. The reveller and two friends were involved in a row which saw officers swiftly arrest Miss Durrant but leave her two white friends alone. Bianca Durrant (pictured), claimed she was wrongly arrested in Bristol in 2009 and ill-treated by police officers due to the colour of her skin . It was only when taxi marshals continuously said the others had also been involved that they were eventually arrested too. Miss Durrant was charged with assaulting a taxi marshal and a public disorder offence but was cleared at a trial when no evidence was offered. She immediately complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which rejected her claim, forcing her to take her protest to the High Court. For the last five years she has represented herself in a legal battle with Avon and Somerset Police. The clerk claimed racial discrimination, false imprisonment, assault, malicious prosecution, breach of her Human Rights while in custody, misfeasance in public office and defamation. Her civil case was finally heard this summer in front of Judge Anthony Seys Llewellyn QC, who has now found against her in every claim - except racial discrimination. He ruled that, although the fact Miss Durrant had been arrested was not discrimination, the way in which she was cuffed - with her hands behind her back - was. Her friends, Lisa Putterill and David Allen, were not treated in the same manner and the officers must have 'proceeded on the basis of racial stereotype', he concluded. Miss Durrant is planning to appeal the ruling but said she was pleased with the result. 'Racial discrimination was the most important claim, one which is normally so hard to prove against police,' she said. 'I would like to know what the constabulary's legal services have to say now, as their Professional Standards Department twice stated there was not a trace of racial discrimination demonstrated by police officers.' The court was told Miss Durrant and Miss Putterill got into an argument with a taxi driver after a night out in Bristol in 2009, when he insisted they pay an up-front fare. They ended up in an altercation with two taxi marshals and police were called after the girls, alongside another bystander Mr Allen, were identified as assault suspects, the court heard. Officers swiftly arrested Miss Durrant, from Downend, Bristol, but pushed Miss Putterill and Mr Allen away. For the last five years, Bianca Durrant has represented herself in a legal battle with Avon and Somerset Police. the Constabulary's headquarters is pictured . After protests they later arrested Miss Putterill, who was cleared of an assault charge, and Mr Davis, who was cleared of breaching the peace. Judge Seys Llewellyn said: 'The case in racial discrimination was not, as I read it, solely that the claimant was arrested, but that the claimant was arrested and the others, in the first instance, not. 'The other two were not merely not arrested by the police officers present, but were directed away by police officers, physically pushing Lisa Putterill away, and leaving the two to walk away. 'It is only the visible intervention of a taxi marshal which persuades one police officer, a little while after, to follow the direction where Lisa Putterill and Mr Allen had walked away. 'I do not consider that any difference in treatment of the claimant, compared with Lisa Putterill (or Mr Allen) was consciously motivated by racial discrimination. 'There is a notable absence of any suggestion of racist language, or overt racist approach, on the part of the police officers. 'I find that in the omission to take any steps to detain, or arrest, the other two persons pointed out to them, and in the rear handcuffing of Miss Durrant, the police officers concerned must have proceeded on the basis of racial stereotype. 'I do not find that in arresting Miss Durrant herself, they did so.' Miss Durrant also claimed she felt racially discriminated against because she was put in the cage in the police van on the way to the police station, while her fellow detainees were allowed to sit in the main part of the van. 'I find the evidence of the claimant persuasive that she did not resist arrest at the scene,' the Judge said. 'I conclude, on the balance of probabilities, that she did not resist arrest at the scene. 'I do not consider it particularly striking that she was placed in the cage of the police van, if she was the first to be arrested; and space is limited.' Although the level of damages for racial discrimination is unlimited the Judge said the pay-out was likely to be 'modest'. Miss Durrant has also made a complaint to the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office against the judge over alleged issues after the case was heard. A spokesman for the JCIO confirmed that a complaint against the judge has been received. Paul Richards, Head of Professional Standards, said: 'We recognise the judgement made by the High Court and welcome the fact the judge found the arrest to be lawful. 'We will review the judgement and consider whether any further action should be taken and whether there are any learnings to be taken from the case.'","Bianca Durrant claimed she was wrongly arrested and ill-treated by police due to colour of her skin .

"A mother and daughter have won national beauty contests after they were inspired to lose weight from 'shocking' holiday photos. Tiffany Brown, 20, has been named Miss Northumberland, while her mother Lisa has won the UK body figure and fitness (BFF) title for over-35s. And the pair from Ulgham, near Morpeth, both embarked on a fitness journey and changed their lifestyles to achieve their admirable feats. Lisa and daughter Tiffany were inspired to lose weight after browsing shocking family photos . Lisa, 47, was not a stranger to the fitness world, having first competed in body building contests in the 1990s, but raising a family put a stop to her competing. But she hadn't stepped foot in a gym for more than 20 years when in 2012, she decided things had to change. 'I went on holiday with my husband Phil and when we came home I looked at our holiday photos,' Lisa said. 'I was horrified at how much weight I had gained over the years, and I knew something needed to change. 'At this stage my son Rick Hall had become really involved with the gym and fitness lifestyle. He was well on his way to becoming a champion himself. 'We all went to see him compete and once I was sitting in that crowd something just clicked. Lisa before the weight loss (l) and (r) after winning the UK body figure and fitness title for 35+ . Tiffany Brown reluctantly having her picture taken (l) and (r) after losing 5 st and becoming a beauty queen . 'It was the inspiration I needed. I realised that training hard and being on stage was something still close to my heart.' Rick, who runs his Protein Card business in Newcastle, helped his mother prepare her meals and train until it became second nature to her. Two years later, she picked up the trophy in Nottingham. Lisa said: 'My age didn't discourage me - I feel younger than ever. 'I combine progressive weight and cardio training and I follow a strict diet in which I only eat natural whole foods. It means I'm never hungry and I feel so energetic. 'I feel like I could live until I'm 100!' Lisa, who now works with Rick and has slimmed down from a size 12 to a size six to eight, was so inspired that when Tiffany had a similar life-changing realisation, she was eager to help. The pair, pictured with their trophy and sash, revolutionised their lifestyles together . New Miss Northumberland Tiffany said: 'When I was younger I did some modelling and was a dancer but when I had my son Charlie 14 months ago, I put on a lot of weight. 'I lost my self-confidence - I didn't go out the house. When my son got christened in February, I looked back at the few pictures I let people take of me and thought, ""am I really that big?"" 'My mum helped me lose five stone and after I managed to lose the weight, I felt like I wanted something to show for that hard work.' Unbeknownst to her family, Tiffany decided to apply to Galaxy Pageants UK and weeks later she was selected from hundreds of applications to represent Northumberland in the 'Miss' category. Judges complimented her 'striking eyes and hair'. In February 2015, she will compete for the national crown of Miss England in Lancashire and the chance to travel to Orlando, Florida, for the international Miss Galaxy contest. The trainee mortgage advisor, who is now 9st 7lb, added: 'I am still in shock I have made it and that I applied at all. I guess I was having a brave day and just went for it. 'It is great for my self confidence and I feel like I am getting back to my old self now. It is a great reward for achieving all my weight loss. Now I have people ringing me for photo shoots.' The Morpeth beauty is now planning North East charity events with the help of the competition, and her chosen cause is the Children's Heart Unit at the Freeman Hospital (CHUF). Meanwhile, Lisa is training to take part in the IFBB Arnold World Championships, named after former Mr Olympia Arnold Schwarzenegger, in Ohio next year. Bodybuilder Lisa Brown, 47, from Ulgham, with her beauty contestant daughter Tiffany, 20 . Dad Phil Brown, 55, said he was very proud of their achievements. The independent financial advisor said: 'They have both shown a lot of focus and dedication - not giving up when the weather is cold and dark in the morning. 'To lose the weight they have is a fantastic achievement in itself but then to go further and earn their respective honours is quite something.' When asked how he intends to keep up, Phil said: 'I have lost 2st myself but am too busy with work to do what they have done. 'I do eat healthier now but that is mainly because I have to eat what they eat!'","Lisa Brown, 47, slimmed 3 dress sizes to win fitness title for over-35s .

"Infected: Dr Craig Spencer, 33, became New York's first Ebola case when he was diagnosed on Thursday evening . Colleagues of the New Yorker who caught Ebola treating victims of the outbreak in West Africa have said he was always 'rigorous' over the elaborate safety procedures for Western doctors. Dr Craig Spencer, 33, tested positive for Ebola on Thursday after coming back from Guinea, and is currently being treated at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. Today fellow health workers at a Doctors Without Borders clinic in Gueckedou said he would always follow the rules surrounding what protective gear to wear and how to disinfect it. But they also admitted that the risk of catching Ebola comes with the territory, adding that all health workers 'rub shoulders with death every day'. The workers, a hygienist and a social worker, were not named. The social worker said: 'We are demoralized and saddened by what's happened to Craig. He did excellent work.' Spencer's work included direct contact with sick people: taking their temperature, following the evolution of their cases, taking their vital signs and ensuring the clinic was properly maintained, he said. 'I'm asking myself how he got the virus because he was a rigorous man,' added the hygienist, whose job is to clean patients, who often have severe diarrhea and are vomiting and bleeding profusely. 'Since we learned that he was infected, we've had low morale. And we understand that we are also at risk despite the measures.' While he was working in Guinea, where he was posted midway through September, Dr Spencer posted pictures online of himself dressed in protective gear before work. Rigorous: Spencer was always cautious about wearing his extensive gear, colleagues said . 'Low morale': Health workers say they are worried after Spencer's infection became known. Pictured above are Doctors Without Borders workers at the Gueckedou clinic where Spencer worked . He also sent his fiancée, Morgan Dixon, a 'photo essay' showing how he put on each of his eight layers of protection. A friend of the couple told the New York Times: 'Eight layers later, you can’t even tell who he is. I’m just perplexed how this happened. Now no one’s going to want to go there and treat people.' The Gueckedou clinic is at the epicenter of the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa. The first cases were reported in that region in March, and the epidemic has since grown into the largest ever outbreak of Ebola, with more than 10,000 cases and nearly 5,000 deaths. Treatment: Spencer is being cared for on an isolated ward at Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan . Doctors Without Borders has been a major provider of care during the current Ebola outbreak and in all recent ones. Its procedures for everything from how clinics should be set up to how doctors and nurses should take off protective equipment are considered the gold standard when dealing with highly infectious diseases, like Ebola. At Ebola clinics, there are elaborate procedures for how health workers undress and disinfect their equipment and the site, and the hygienist said the disinfection teams at Gueckedou make sure those procedures are followed to the letter. Dangerous: A worker in a hazmat suit removes a barrel of potentially infected material from Spencer's apartment in Harlem . But Doctors Without Borders has warned that no matter how careful health workers are, the risk can never be zero. It said Friday that it did not yet know how Spencer became infected but that it is investigating. Staff at the Gueckedou clinic are also redoubling their efforts to stay safe, the hygienist said. 'Since his sickness was announced, I've seen the bosses here looking to reinforce our protections and to see where there are weaknesses,' he said. Both workers said they thought the Gueckedou clinic is well maintained, with nothing taken for granted. The hygienist said: 'We are praying for Craig and for ourselves because we rub shoulders with death every day.'","Colleagues of Ebola-stricken Dr Craig Spencer, 33, defended him today .

Heather Watson could make it a highly unusual British double on Friday if she can overcome Estonian Anett Kontaveit in the women’s final qualifying round to also make it into the main draw of the clay court Grand Slam alongside Andy Murray. While Ward has to wait and see who he plays Murray was given a middling sort of draw, facing Kazakhstan’s world number 55 Andrey Golubev in the first round with a possible quarter final against Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka. British number three Ward will probably be gone by then, but yesterday was a reminder of the stirring Davis Cup performances for which he is best known. An avid Gooner, his three-match run into the main draw had unpromising beginnings when his passion for Arsenal got the better of his professional instincts. He not only got to watch the final but met up with a few of the players afterwards before catching the train to Paris. 'I probably should have been in Paris preparing early but I couldn’t say no to Arsenal', he said. 'To be honest, at 2-0 down after 10 minutes, I was thinking: ‘Everyone who knows I am at this game is going to absolutely slaughter me.’ 'My coach probably wasn’t too happy with me but he knows that I am  mad about Arsenal, so he let it go. Even though he’s an Aussie, he realised that we haven’t been in too many finals lately. Ending the drought: Ward emulated Arsene Wenger by breaking a long-standing duck this week . Hopeful: Heather Watson could join Ward and Murray in the French open if she wins her final qualifier . 1st round A. Golubev (KAZ)2nd round M. Matosevic (AUS) 3rd . round P. Kohlschreiber (GER) 4th round R. Gasquet (FRA) QF: S. Wawrinka (SWI) SF; . R. Nadal (SPA) Final N. Djokovic (SER) 'Someone said to me earlier on today: ‘Fight like the Arsenal.’ And I thought: ‘Why not?’ And it worked for me today.' In emulating John Lloyd from 1973 and wiping out another awkward statistic for British tennis he needed to save two match points at 6-7 in the decider against a player ranked 76 places above him at 94. Having failed to serve it out at 5-4 in the third Ward showed impressive nerve to hang on, but then the money is a massive incentive for someone in his position. 'It’s very difficult at the 100-250 ranking to make a living really,' he said. ' It’s very difficult because there’s my expenses, my coach’s, food, the hotel, your travel, for the two people and if you lose first round (at Challenger level) you’re getting $300, minus tax, it’s embarrassing, really. 'There shouldn’t be such a massive gap to the guy who can’t even get a transport leaving here, because he’s lost in first round qualies, it’s embarrassing. Even in the past, at the US Open you get refused entry the day after you lose. 'When you’re in the top 200 players in the world and you have to get somebody to pick up your laundry because you left it in there the day before. Those are the sorts of things that need to change.' Murray seemed reasonably unfazed about his draw, although is aware of the danger Golubev presents. Ready to go: Andy Murray, practicing today before the Grand Slam, will play in Paris without a coach . Tough draw: Murray is aware of the threat posed by Golubev (above), his first round opponent . 'He plays exciting tennis, goes for his shots, and when he’s on he makes it very difficult. His form has been inconsistent because of his game style but he beat Wawrinka in the Davis Cup this year, he’s got a big forehand and doesn’t hold back.' Murray claimed again that he is getting closer to appointing a new coach, although a few of his signs are contradictory on this. 'I wouldn’t expect anything in the next few days but I’m closer than I was in Rome last week. It’s not about rushing.' It was not all joy for the Brits yesterday, with Jo Konta losing in the final round of women’s qualifying 6-7 7-5 6-0 to Yuliya Beygelzimer and Dan Cox going out of the second round of the men’s event 6-3 7-6 to Paolo Lorenzi.

"Soaring immigration has sparked a baby boom in Britain outstripping almost every other country in Europe, official figures have revealed. Across the EU, the number of babies being born has dropped since the financial crash – sparking falls in population in some countries. But the UK has bucked the trend, with soaring birth rates in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds contributing to a boom in the number babies being born. Scroll down for video . Women in outer London have more babies than anywhere else in the country - or even Europe - official figures revealed today . British women are having two babies each on average – higher than anywhere else in Europe, apart from France and Ireland. Overall, London is now seeing more babies born per 1,000 of the population anywhere in Europe, according to the EU’s official statistics body. Across the EU, there were 10.4 babies born per 1,000 people. But in the capital, the birth rate has hit 17.7. At least 14 births per 1,000 population were recorded in the west Midlands, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire as well – a rate only matched in Brussels and Paris. The UK, Germany and Austria were the only countries in Europe to report an increase in their birth rates from 2009 to 2012. Almost every other country in Europe saw the number of babies fall. The figures were buried in the EU Commission’s annual statistics release. The official figures exposed the impact of mass migration into the UK over the past decade. Immigrants moving to Britain are often in the key child-bearing ages, contributing to the spike in babies born across the country. Sir Andrew Green, the chairman of Migration Watch UK, which campaigns for low immigration, said: ‘This is yet another example of the impact of mass immigration on our society.’ The EU, meanwhile, said more babies were being born in countries where the family is ‘relatively weak’. Official figures released by the EU today show Britain is in the midst of a baby boom. In this map the darker the colour the higher the birth rate . More babies are being born per thousand of the population in London than anywhere else in Europe . It said fertility rates were higher in countries where there is a ‘low proportion of people being married and a high proportion of births outside marriage’. It added that ‘couple instability’ and high divorce rates also contributed. Fertility rates were lower than 1.5 live births per woman in 13 – the lowest rate being recorded in Portugal — one of the countries most severely hit by the financial and economic crisis — at 1.28 live births per woman.","Number of babies being born in the EU has dropped since the financial crash .

"Nurses working for the Texas Department of Health and Human Services have not received ‘a single email about any process changes’ in the wake of the Ebola outbreak. This is just one of the shocking claims made by Texas nurse, Jordan Dewberry, who has launched an online petition demanding that the CDC provide US health-care workers with ‘hazmat suits and decom protocol.’ Ms Dewberry’s message could not be clearer. She wrote, ‘We are NOT ready for this disease.’ Nurses working for the Texas Department of Health and Human Services (not pictured) have not received ‘a single email about any process changes’ in the wake of the Ebola outbreak . In a fulsome statement posted today (Saturday) she explained, ‘I work for the Texas Department of Health and Human Services and we have not received a single email about any process changes. Nothing.’ The registered nurse continued: ‘Recently, National Nurses United – the country’s largest nursing organization – found that 76 percent of its members said their hospitals hadn’t communicated any policy about admitting Ebola patients. ‘Without the proper plan and equipment in place to keep us safe, we have a major problem.’ The petition, posted on change.org had already garnered close to 12,000 signatures – just 3,000 short of its aim - within just hours of being posted. According to Ms Dewberry, ‘Today many nurses don’t have the most appropriate resources (fluid-resistant gowns, goggles, gloves etc). So I’m asking the Centers for Disease Control: Why is the team decontaminating the nurse’s apartment in full hazmat gear when our health care workers caring for Ebola patients are provided with less than adequate protection?’ The Center for Disease Control has come under increasing fire for its failure to contain the virus brought into the country by Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, last month. The Center for Disease Control has come under increasing fire for its failure to contain the virus brought into the country by Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, last month . Two of the nurses who treated Mr Duncan at Texas Presbyterian Hospital, Dallas, are now fighting for their lives having been infected by Ebola themselves. Nurses Nina Pham, 26, and Amber Joy Vinson, 29, have now been moved to other facilities with isolation units capable of treating them. But concerns over just how sick nurse Vinson was when was given the all-clear to travel from Dallas to Cleveland and back on a bridal shopping trip continue to grow, along with grave concerns at the CDC’s handling of the crisis. A third health-care worker who handled Mr Duncan’s lab work has now shown Ebola symptoms after being allowed to board the cruise ship currently returning to Dallas after it was turned back from the ports of Belize and Mexico. Now, in her statement accompanying her online petition nurse Dewberry has brought fresh concerns to light and cast further doubt on the Administration, Texas State Health Department and CDC’s assertions that they are equipped to handle this crisis and have acted with ‘an abundance of caution’ at every step. A third health-care worker who handled Mr Duncan’s lab work has now shown Ebola symptoms after being allowed to board the cruise ship currently returning to Dallas after it was turned back from the ports of Belize and Mexico (not pictured) Texas Presbyterian Hospital has vigorously defended itself. In a statement issued last week the hospital pointed to the CDC’s constantly shifting guidelines as a cause of ‘frustration’ among healthcare workers struggling to abide by them. They added that many of the stories that have emerged – including claims that waste was left to pile ‘ceiling-high’ in Mr. Duncan’s treatment room – were ‘gross exaggerations’ and claimed that the hospital’s policy of ‘non-retaliation’ rendered such anonymous reports unnecessary and unhelpful. But Ms Dewberry is far from alone in her assertion that health-care workers are not being afforded the protection they so desperately need if the virus is to be contained and stopped in its tracks. She said, ‘Nurses are absolutely loud on their point: they want change and they want it now. ‘It’s time we stand up and demand that the CDC provide proper protective equipment to our healthcare workers caring for a patient with Ebola.’","Texas nurse Jordan Dewberry wrote that the state's Department of Health and Human Services has not received a 'single email about any process changes'

"Controversial post: Forrest and Charlotte Lucas pictured at the Alzheimer's Association Rita Hayworth Gala 30th anniversary in New York. Charlotte Lucas wrote a controversial Facebook message last week criticizing minorities . The multi-millionaire owner of Lucas Oil has backtracked and apologized after she posted a furious rant to Facebook bemoaning the Muslims, atheists and minorities she claimed were 'running' the country. Indianapolis Colts backer Charlotte Lucas, 65, who is worth $300 million and founded Lucas Oil in the late 1980s with her husband, Forrest, 69, posted the controversial message to the social network on Thursday before deleting it. 'I'm sick and tired of minorities running our country!' wrote Lucas. 'As far as I'm concerned, I don't think that atheists (minority), muslims (minority) n (sic) or any other minority group has the right to tell the majority of the people in the United States what they can and cannot do here. 'Is everyone so scared that they can't fight back for what is right or wrong with his country?' Lucas confirmed the posting was written by her to an ABC affiliate, although the car lubricant multi-millionaire claimed that she was emotional when she let fly her invective against minorities across the country. 'I was very upset when I wrote that,' she said to ABC 6, without explaining what caused her furious attack on Muslims, atheists and other unspecified minorities. 'I will not elaborate other than to say that there are certain people who are trying to make the whole world eat what they want to eat and do what they want to do.

It has been speculated that Lucas may have been referring to Michelle Obama's 'Let's Move!' health campaign in mentioning eating habits, but in the absence of a full explanation it is not entirely clear. Taking her apology further, Lucas said that she recognized her attack could have been construed as insensitive, but she had no regrets. 'I apologize to everyone for the insensitive comments posted on my Facebook account,' she said on Saturday. 'My comments did not reflect my personal views about any individual or minority group, only my frustration that our government system sometimes seems out of balance.

'My comments did not reflect my true feelings, and I am sorry for anyone may have been offended.'

"An Australian band has taken the internet by storm - but not for their music. Melbourne band The Bennies - who describe the genre of music they play as 'Psychedelic Reggae Ska Doom Metal Punk Rock From Hell' - have introduced the world to 'photobonging'. Similar to photobombing, photobonging is a spontaneous act where someone unknowingly appears in the background holding a bong - a device that is used to smoke marijuana. Melbourne band The Bennies have kicked off a new social media trend called photobonging . The Bennies tried to kick off the trend three weeks ago with another photo but on Sunday it took off after they posted a photo of three members holding up beers while the fourth member of the band is seen in the reflection of a sliding door lighting up. The photograph has become so popular that it has earned its own Reddit thread, with more than 3,200 upvotes in the past 24 hours. In last month's photo, members of the band pose in front of a white van while a man sits in the front seat smoking a bong. The ban also tried to get it to take off about three weeks ago by posting this photo . Currently touring the U.S., the band seems to have earned themselves some new fans because of the photo. 'Discovering this band was the best thing to happen today. Thanks man!' one Reddit user wrote. Another said: 'This seems like it should be on the inside cover of a greatest hits album.' The band is not shying away from the international media attention they have been receiving over the photos, posting some of the reports on their social media pages - including Facebook and Twitter. One of The Bennies told Music Feeds: 'The first photobong we did happened in Canberra about two weeks ago. 'Been pounding beers over here! There's also been plenty of bongs around the place, so it just kinda happened again.'","Melbourne's The Bennies have started a new trend called photobonging .

"As he waited for those behind to . finish, Rory McIlroy sat in the recorder’s area with his face in his . hands, shaking his head in disbelief. Even . by his own standards for shoving a cold shoulder in the face of the . conventional, what happened at Wentworth on Sunday was simply stunning. A . week that had begun with one jaw-dropping statement concerning his . split from fiancee Caroline  Wozniacki had ended with another and a . final-round 66 that earned him the unlikeliest of victories in the . European Tour’s flagship event, the BMW PGA Championship. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rory McIlroy say it has been a week of mixed emotions . Champion: Rory McIlroy won the BMW PGA Championship by five shots on Sunday with a final round of 66 . Pure joy: McIlroy throws his ball into the crowd after holing a birdie putt on the 18th at Wentworth . On form: McIlroy celebrates chipping in for birdie at the 10th hole during day four at BMW PGA Championship . Tough shot: The Northern Irishman chips from a bunker at the BMW PGA Championship . Heartbroken: McIlroy split with his fiancee and tennis star Caroline Wozniacki earlier in the week . The 25-year-old had started the final round trailing overnight leader Thomas Bjorn by seven shots. Thanks to his own brilliance and the shortcomings of Bjorn, another leading Danish sports figure was left with an aching heart as McIlroy claimed his first ever professional title in Europe and a handsome £640,000 first prize. McIlroy has been playing well all year and was just waiting for the sort of final round he enjoyed here to finish things off. Few, however, would have predicted it would come at the end of this of all weeks and on this of all courses, where he has enjoyed so little joy in the past. Runner’s-up spot went to Irishman Shane . Lowry, who finished a stroke behind, with Bjorn having to settle for a . tie for third place with Wentworth specialist Luke Donald. Poor . Bjorn. Five shots is the sort of final-round advantage no class player . should cough up but how many times have we seen it happen over the . years? All it takes is one bad hole and here the demons that have . tormented the doleful Dane throughout his career made a wretched . reappearance once he made a complete hash of the  par-four sixth. A . triple-bogey seven there and the two Irishmen from north and south of . the border had a veritable sparkle in their eye. Then there was Donald, . who summoned up commendable resolve to come back from a seven of his own . at the sixth to make a wonderful fist of winning his third PGA title in . the space of just four years. He chipped in twice on the back nine but . ultimately left himself with too much to do. In the mix: But Shane Lowry was struggling to keep up with McIlroy in the final round . Scandinavian pride: Thomas Bjorn hit a 62 on the opening day but couldn't replicate that form on Sunday . Wentworth master: Luke Donald hit some sumptuous shots in a fine back nine . There’s nothing in golf . that  compares with watching someone of McIlroy’s ilk when they get the . scent of victory in their nostrils. At times he can look such an average . putter but it’s uncanny the way they start dropping when nothing else . will do. He chipped in for a birdie at the 10th then holed a good . six-foot putt for another birdie at the 12th.  Perhaps the biggest one . of all was the 30-footer that disappeared below ground at the 13th. Ten . minutes later, McIlroy was receiving his second helping hand of the day . after Bjorn’s early collapse when Lowry, who had moved into a . three-shot lead, hooked his drive at the 13th and ran up a double bogey. McIlroy was worried his concentration might waver during this event, . given all that had happened off the course in the build-up. But there . was no chance of that now as he was fully engaged in pulling off the . victory. At the 16th he made another good up and down, and then another . at the 17th for a fourth birdie on the back nine. That one might have . been the sweetest of all. For the first time in the entire tournament, . he had hit the front. Sandy landing: bjorn blew the tournament open when he triple bogeyed the 6th hole . At the par-five 18th, McIlroy hit a wonderful . drive but pushed his second shot into a greenside bunker. Once more, his . short game saved him as he splashed out to six feet and holed yet . another gutsy putt for his sixth birdie of the day to go with an eagle . at the fourth. After his opening round on Thursday, McIlroy’s . expectations were so modest he expressed the hope he would simply be . around for the weekend. Now here he was, in such a commanding position . that Lowry could hole a mammoth 50-footer for a birdie on the last but . still come up a shot shy. Donald had no option but to go for the . green at the last since he needed an eagle three to tie, and he was . unlucky to see his ball splash down in the water hazard about three . yards short of where he was aiming. Nightmare hole: Donald also struggled on the 6th landing in the bunker and  taking a drop out of the bushes . Never mind a week is a long time . in politics. Five days seems to be an eternity in McIlroy’s world. Was . this the same man who sat in the interview room on Wednesday looking so . devastated it appeared it might be towards the end of summer before he . would be back to his best? As it turned out, it took until the end of . the week. This win is his first of the year and comes just three . weeks before the US Open over a Pinehurst course where the long  drivers . and the demon  short-game merchants will have an enormous advantage. In . other words, exactly the qualities that got the job done for McIlroy . last week — that, and a new-found resolution when things are not going . so well that he showed on Friday, and the requisite touch of luck. At . the par-five fourth, his eagle putt hovered on the edge of the hole for . a few seconds before it eventually dropped. In the end, that proved the . difference.What a finish to the 60th edition of the PGA . Championship, then. A little sprinkling of McIlroy stardust and suddenly . a previously flat golfing season has positively ignited.","Rory McIlroy wins the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth .

"It is expected that Packer will Join Crowe at the Rabbitohs next year . Billionaire James Packer  is reportedly close to signing a major, multi-million deal to buy-out Peter Holmes a Court's share of the South Sydney Rabbitohs and  join Russell Crowe as co-owner of the club. Negotiations between the parties are being finalised more than a year after they began, but have been kept silent in the hope that they would not disrupt the NRL club's tilt at a drought-breaking premiership. But now, two days after the Rabbitohs broke their 43-year losing streak by winning Sunday's Grand Final, it is understood Packer is poised to pounce on a 37 per cent share in the club still owned by Holmes a Court. Packer, whose father Kerry was a Rabbitohs supporter, has described the Rabbitohs as one of the world's greatest sports brands and was considered a leading contender to join  Crowe at  after rumours surfaced that Holmes a Court was looking to exit. While Crowe had pledged his ongoing commitment to the ­Rabbitohs, Holmes a Court had remained tight-lipped on his plans in terms of future ownership. ­Speculation was rife that James Packer — whose company Crown Resorts is the club’s major sponsor — wanted to buy Holmes a Court’s stake in the Rabbitohs because his interest had waned since moving overseas. Now the Daily Telegraph has reported that a deal is close to being hatched following the Bunny's victory on Sunday. Scroll down for video . The pair have watched on from the stands during the team matches this season . If the deal is announced it would mean both Packer and Crowe would hold a joint 75 per cent share in the club, while its members would hold on to the remaining 25 per cent. Packer is a lifelong Sydney Roosters fan, although his late father Kerry supported Souths. Mr Holmes a Court worked with Crowe during his eight-year rein at South Sydney to build the club up from cellar  dwellers to NRL champions. Now based overseas Holmes a Court is proud of what he has achieved and believes now is the right time to sell his stake as it is difficult for him to keep a vested interest from afar. Before the pair made a bid to buy the club in 2006, the Rabittohs were in financial ruin and it was widely reported that the pair helped salvage them from disaster. Since that time, both have been forced to inject further funds into the club, although in recent years that has no longer been required. It is now reported that the club is valued at around $20 million. On Sunday South Sydney won its 21st premiership on  and its first since 1971 when they claimed the NRL's most coveted prize by defeating the Canterbury Bulldogs 26-6.
