University of Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman had not been drinking alcohol before making remarks at halftime of a football game, the school said in a statement on Monday. 'It was an unfortunate set of circumstances that led to the audio distortion,' spokesman Rick Fitzgerald said. The 'awkward audio' was a result of Coleman attempting to slow down her speech, according to Fitzgerald, because of the significant feedback she was hearing from Michigan Stadium's public-address system. Scroll down for video . University of Michigan president Mary Sue Coleman was forced to say she had not been drinking at a football game after she slurred her words during a speech . 'She, absolutely, had not been drinking alcohol,' Fitzgerald said. 'I want to underscore that point in the strongest possible way.' Coleman was honored at halftime of Saturday's game against Nebraska because she is planning to retire in July. 'We were trying to do something thoughtful to honor President Mary Sue Coleman for her service to the university and athletic department and unfortunately the sound system backfired on us,' athletic director Dave Brandon said in a statement. 'We rarely use live wireless microphones at Michigan Stadium because of the way that sound is distributed; it travels from the north scoreboard across the field to the south. There was significant wind that caused the sound to be delayed and distorted and created feedback during President Coleman's speech.' Fitzgerald said Coleman didn't have experience using the wireless microphone provided to her and she wasn't expecting to be recognized during the game. 'She struggled with the feedback and tried to adjust to the sound delay and the reverberation by slowing down her words,' he said. The university president made a speech during Saturday's game because she is due to retire . 'She had hoped to communicate her gratitude for the recognition and her enthusiasm for Michigan.' Coleman attended non-alcoholic events before the game and hosted one during the game, Fitzgerald said. Michigan fans were quick to post to Twitter after hearing Mrs Coleman's speech and a video was posted to YouTube. One wrote: 'I, Mary Sue Coleman, pregamed at DTD today.' The Deadspin.com sports website posted a video Sunday night of Coleman's address that has gone viral with a headline: 'Did Michigan's President Deliver A Drunken Halftime Speech Yesterday?' However Brandon answered the question in his statement. 'I was with President Coleman and the current social media speculation is without merit and 100 percent inaccurate,' Brandon said. 'We were together at multiple campus events throughout the day and I walked with her from the suites to the field prior to the halftime recognition. 'I have sincerely apologized to President Coleman for the failures in our sound system and the difficult situation this has caused for her.'","President Mary Sue Coleman blamed the 'awkward' audio equipment .

Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei controls a business empire worth around $95 billion (£59 billion) - a sum exceeding the value of his oil-rich nation's current annual petroleum exports, a six-month Reuters investigation shows. The little-known organization, called Setad, is one of the keys to the Iranian leader's enduring power and now holds stakes in nearly every sector of Iranian industry, including finance, oil, telecommunications, the production of birth-control pills and even ostrich farming. Setad has built its empire on the systematic seizure of thousands of properties belonging to ordinary Iranians - members of religious minorities, Shi'ite Muslims, business people and Iranians living abroad. Growth: Under Khamenei (above), Setad has expanded its corporate holdings, buying stakes in dozens of Iranian companies . The Reuters investigation documents how Setad has amassed a giant portfolio of real estate by claiming in Iranian courts, sometimes falsely, that the properties are abandoned. The organization now holds a court-ordered monopoly on taking property in the name of the supreme leader, and regularly sells the seized properties at auction or seeks to extract payments from the original owners. Reuters reporters identified nearly 300 properties that Setad put up for auction in May alone, many worth millions of dollars. The organization's full name in Persian is ‘Setad Ejraiye Farmane Hazrate Emam’ - Headquarters for Executing the Order of the Imam. The name refers to an edict signed by the Islamic Republic's first leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, shortly before his death in 1989. His order spawned an entity intended to manage and sell properties abandoned in the chaotic years after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. According to one of its co-founders, Setad was created to help the poor and war veterans and was meant to exist for just two years. Almost a quarter-century on, Setad has morphed into a business juggernaut with real estate, corporate stakes and other assets. While Setad controls a charitable foundation, it's not clear how much money goes to charity. Setad has built its empire on the systematic seizure of thousands of properties belonging to ordinary Iranians, Reuters claims. Pictured are people at one of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's Friday prayer sermons in Tehran . Under Khamenei, the organization has expanded its corporate holdings, buying stakes in dozens of Iranian companies, both private and public, with the stated goal of creating an Iranian conglomerate to boost the country's economic growth. The supreme leader, judges and parliament over the years have issued a series of bureaucratic edicts, constitutional interpretations and judicial decisions bolstering Setad. ‘No supervisory organization can question its property,’ said Naghi Mahmoudi, an Iranian lawyer who left Iran in 2010 and now lives in Germany. In June, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on Setad and some of its corporate holdings, calling the organization ‘a massive network of front companies hiding assets on behalf of… Iran's leadership.’ The Iranian president's office and the foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment for the series. Iran's embassy in the United Arab Emirates called Reuters' findings ‘scattered and disparate’ and said that ‘none has any basis’ but did not elaborate. Setad's director general of public relations, Hamid Vaezi, said by email in response to a detailed description of this series that the information presented is ‘far from realities and is not correct.’ He did not go into specifics. In a subsequent message, he said Setad disputes the Treasury's allegations and is ‘in the process of retaining U.S. counsel to address this matter.’ He added: ‘This communication puts you on notice that any action by your organization could prejudice our dispute in the United States and harm our position for which we hold you responsible.’ Setad's total worth is difficult to pinpoint because of the secrecy of its accounts. Reuters estimates it at around $95 billion, made up of about $52 billion in real estate and $43 billion in corporate holdings. The estimate is based on an analysis of statements by Setad officials, data from the Tehran Stock Exchange and company websites, and information from the U.S. Treasury Department. The amount is roughly 40 per cent bigger than Iran's total oil exports last year, which totalled $67.4 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund. There is no evidence that Khamenei is tapping Setad to enrich himself. But Setad has empowered him. Through Setad, Khamenei has at his disposal financial resources whose value rivals the holdings of the shah, the Western-backed monarch who was overthrown in 1979. As Iran's top cleric, Khamenei has final say on all governmental matters. His purview includes his nation's controversial nuclear program, which was the subject of intense negotiations between Iranian and international diplomats in Geneva that ended Sunday without an agreement. It is Khamenei who will set Iran's course in the nuclear talks and other recent efforts by the new president, Hassan Rouhani, to improve relations with Washington. The investigation into Setad shows that as well as political power and military force there is a third dimension to Khamenei's power: economic might. The revenue stream generated by Setad helps explain why he has not only held on for 24 years but also in some ways has more control than even his revered predecessor. Setad gives him the financial means to operate independently of parliament and the national budget, insulating him from Iran's messy factional infighting.","The empire was built on the seizure of Iranians' property, a report claims .

Sweden striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic last night scored the ‘greatest goal ever’ to round off a crushing victory over England in the first match at his national stadium. The talented footballer's remarkable overhead kick came when he was 30 yards from goal. He sprang six feet into the air to arch the ball over the helpless goalkeeper and into the net.

Silence . fell as those inside the arena held their breath. and watched the . flight of the ball. Then the noise exploded as it landed in the net. Even England . supporters stood to applaud the audacity of Sweden's captain, thrilled . to witness such a brilliant flash of sporting beauty. Ibrahimovic ripped off his shirt, tossed it towards the crowd and shrugged as he was shown a yellow card. Asked to rate his international career . out of 10, Ibrahimovic replied: ‘Ten. When I saw the goalkeeper was out . of his net, I tried to put it over him. It was a good try, and when it . comes off it’s fantastic.’ Former England manager Graham Taylor said: ‘That’s the greatest goal I’ve ever seen.’ England manager Roy Hodgson, who . suffered his first defeat over 90 minutes, said: ‘Ibrahimovic’s fourth . goal was extraordinary and it put the tin lid on the game. It was a . fantastic goal. 'But it was the second and third goals which killed us. 'For 60-70 minutes we played very well and deserved to be leading. There . are lots of reasons to be optimistic.’ Opener: Ibrahmovic fires Sweden into the lead after 20 minutes - but Danny Welbeck and Steven Caulker put England ahead before half-time . Hat-trick hero: Ibrahimovic curls home a free kick to put Sweden in front again in the final 14 minutes, and his fourth goal was then the icing on the cake . Sweden's star man famously once said: 'Guardiola (then . Barcelona manager) drove me like a Fiat... I am a Ferrari.' It was a typical comment from a man who, despite his . doubters, has never been short of confidence in his own ability. And while Ibrahimovic's performances against English clubs in . Europe have often fallen short of his high standards (before last night he had . scored just four goals in 1,556 minutes against English clubs and England) his . wider statistics mark him out as one of the best players of his generation. He is the only player to have scored for six different clubs . in the Champions League, and up until last season he had won eight consecutive . league titles (Ajax 03/04, Juventus 04/05, 05/06, Inter 06/07, 0708, 08/09, Barcelona . 09/10 and AC Milan 10/11). And a number of managers and chairmen have recognised his . talent - he has cost a combined total of £150m in transfer fees. But missing from his CV is a Champions League victory and . honours at international level. Until those blanks are filled - though playing for Sweden . makes the latter unlikely - doubts about his greatness may remain. But . certainly not in his own head. Sweden substitute Tobias Sana said: . ‘It was Zlatan against children. He has been criticised in England and . this proves them all wrong.’ The Sweden player became the first footballer to hit four in a match against England. No-one had even scored a hat-trick against England since Marco van Basten in 1988. The . two England goals came after Ibrahimovic opened the scoring in the 20th . minute, with Danny Welbeck and Steven Caulker taking the national side . to a half-time lead. The . excitement was abruptly cut off in the last 14 minutes, however, when . Ibrahimovic scored three more and went down in history. Overshadowed: England captain Steven Gerrard, appearing for the national side for the 100th time, jostles with Ibrahimovic on the pitch before praising the player's skill after the match . Historic moment: The Swedish press lauded Ibrahimovic as 'incredible' as the footballer covered the front pages . The debate as to whether Zlatan Ibrahimovic's goal was the . greatest ever will rage long and hard - but it is certainly up there with the . best. But here are a few other spectacular overhead kicks that are . vying alongside it to be recognised as the best ever. Rivaldo, Barcelona v Valencia, La Liga, June 17, 2001 . Barcelona went into the last game of the season needing a . win to qualify for the Champions League. With two minutes to go, the score was . 2-2, with Brazilian legend Rivaldo having scored both Barca's goals. Then as the home side poured forward the ball was again . chipped into Rivaldo as he stood on the edge of the box with his back to goal. Two touches later - one with the chest, one an acrobatic swing of the right . boot - and the ball had nestled into the bottom corner and Barca's place in the . following season's Champions League was assured. Trevor Sinclair, QPR v Barnsley, FA Cup Fourth Round, . January 25, 1997 . Ask any fan of QPR - and a large number of other supporters . - and they will tell you the greatest goal that will ever be scored came from . the right foot of Trevor Sinclair back in 1997. The flying winger met a looping cross from the right a full . 20 yards from goal with an acrobatic overhead kick that flew into the back of . the net . After the game Sinclair reported: 'I try them all the time . in training but they’ve never come off like that.' It was such a good strike that it beat David Beckham’s goal . from the halfway line against Wimbledon to be crowned Match of the Day’s Goal . of the Season. Wayne Rooney, Manchester United v Manchester City, Premier . League, February 12, 2011 . Just 13 minutes were left with a disappointing Manchester . derby poised at 1-1. Nani swung in a cross that looped up off the back of a . City defender. Waiting underneath it was Rooney, who leapt up, arched his back and . executed the perfect scissor kick into the top corner. 'I think so,' said Rooney when asked if it was the best goal . of his career. 'I saw it come into the box and thought ""why not?"" 'Thankfully it finished up in the top corner. I was trying . to get in a good position for when Nani crossed it. Nine time out of 10 they go . over the crossbar. Today it ended up in the top corner.’ Pele, Allied PoWs v Germany, Paris (from the film Escape to Victory) The Allies went 4-0 down in the first half before pulling a goal back on the stroke of half time. Pele, who the Germans had succeeded in kicking off the park, roused himself for the treatment table to help the team's cause.

With the score clawed back to 4-3 and the clock ticking down Pele sprayed the ball wide to Booby Moore who took it down on his chest before standing up a cross into the box. Pele, holding his damaged arm to his chest, leapt into the air swung up his right boot and made it 4-4. Cue celebrations and a sneaky escape thanks to the Parisian crowd.

The comet which astronomers had been watching with great interest because it was passing so close to the sun on Thursday appears to have been destroyed. Comet ISON, which had been branded the 'comet of the century,' was making its closest approach to the sun, skimming about 730,000 miles above its surface, when it disappeared from the view of space telescopes. 'Comet ISON probably has not survived this journey,' Karl Battams with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and the NASA Comet ISON Observing Campaign told a NASA Google Hangout on Thursday. Scroll down for video . In this composition image obtained from NASA, Comet ISON (bottom) moves towards the sun in this image from ESA/NASA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory captured at 10:51 a.m. EST on Thursday . Experts said it appears ISON broke up into chunks and the sun evaporated it. Observers had been hoping that ISON would survive its Thanksgiving Day close encounter with the sun and emerge to put on a big sky show in December. 'We have never seen a comet like this,' Naval Research Laboratory astrophysicist Karl Battams had said during a NASA news conference on Tuesday. 'It has been behaving strangely.' According to Johns Hopkins University scientist Carey Lisse, even if the comet has died there is a good chance that people on Earth will get an interesting cosmic show. The comet's remnants could paint the sky with a wide swath of green in the Northern Hemisphere. Comet ISON, which had been branded the 'comet of the century,' was making its closest approach to the sun, skimming about 730,000 miles above its surface, when it disappeared from the view of space telescopes . Here, Comet ISON enters the field of view of the ESA and Nasa's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory on November 27. In this picture, called a coronagraph, the bright light of the sun itself is blocked so the structures around it are visible. The comet is seen in the lower right and a giant cloud of solar material, called a coronal mass ejection is seen billowing out under the sun . The comet - two-thirds of a mile wide - is made up of loosely packed ice and dirt, essentially a dirty snowball. It is a 'dinosaur bone,' from the formation of the solar system 4.5 billion years ago, Lisse said. It has been in 'deep freeze' for billions of years in the Oort cloud, a vast area of comets and debris that never formed into planets that's between 450 billion and 9 trillion miles from the sun, he said. The comet is racing around the sun, pulled close by our star's massive gravity, which can also break apart the dirty icy core. Comet ISON was first spotted by a Russian telescope in September last year. While many comets come out of the Oort cloud and return after a long trip through the solar system and many comets graze by the sun, this is the first one that astronomers have watched that is from the Oort cloud and is skimming the sun. Lisse said ISON could behave just like last year's comet Lovejoy, which fell apart a couple days after passing by the sun. Its remnants were visible like 'a beautiful paintbrush swath in the sky' in the Southern Hemisphere, he said. Comet ISON was discovered by two amateur Russian astronomers in 2012 and will come within 730,000 miles of the Sun today . Appearance: Comet ISON entered the view of NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on Nov. 21, 2013, where it can be seen with Earth, Mercury and comet 2P/Encke . Unlike many blue comets, ISON has . been more lime-green because it doesn't seem to have as much carbon . monoxide as other comets, Lisse said. If . the comet does make it around the sun intact and returns past Earth, . the Northern Hemisphere should get good naked-eye views just before . sunrise and just after sunset in the first couple weeks of December, . Lisse said. But this . probably won't be as bright and visible as 1997's Comet Hale-Bopp, said . Geoff Chester of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington. Over . the last few weeks, the reports weren't good for ISON's survival. On .

Alex Salmond was accused of producing a ‘fantasy’ manifesto last night as he tried to shore up faltering public support for his dream of Scottish independence. The Scottish National Party leader unveiled a 670-page ‘blueprint’  setting out the case for independence ahead of next September’s landmark referendum. Mr Salmond, Scotland’s First Minister, said the document laid out ‘a prospectus for the kind of country we should be’.  He added: ‘Scotland’s future is now in Scotland’s hands.’ Scroll down for video . Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond presents the White Paper for Scottish independence at the Science Museum Glasgow . But critics said the manifesto was an . uncosted ‘wish-list’, which failed to answer key questions such as what . currency an independent Scotland would use. It also emerged that English taxpayers . would be asked to continue propping up the Scottish economy, even if . Scotland becomes ‘independent’. The Bank of England would be expected . to bail out Scotland’s banks, and the SNP said Scotland would refuse to . take on its share of the UK’s national debt unless it was allowed to . keep the pound. Former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling dismissed the . document as a ‘work of fiction’. Mr Darling, leader of the cross-party . Better Together group which wants to retain the union with England, said . the White Paper on independence had ‘failed to give credible answers on . fundamentally important questions’ in areas such as currency and tax. He went on: ‘It is a fantasy  to say we can leave the UK but still keep all the benefits of UK membership. ‘The White Paper is a work of  fiction. It is thick with false promises and meaningless assertions. ‘Instead of a credible and costed . plan, we have a wish-list of  political promises without any answers on . how Alex Salmond would pay for them.’ Mr Salmond and Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hold copies of Scotland's Future, claiming it sets out how a Yes vote in next year's referendum could pave the way for a new era for the nation . At a packed press conference the Scottish National Party set out its case for independence in the glare of the media spotlight . Opinion polls over the last year have . consistently shown a majority in Scotland are against independence, . although a significant number of voters remain undecided, making the . outcome uncertain. Mr  Salmond said an independent Scotland would keep . the pound, the Queen and popular BBC  programmes such as Strictly Come . Dancing, EastEnders  and CBeebies. The SNP’s long-awaited document . includes a raft of populist policies, many aimed at women voters who are . disproportionately sceptical about the idea of independence. The SNP also insisted that Scotland . would remain part of the EU, with the document even describing Scotland . as its ‘29th member’. But there was little sign of how the party would . overcome warnings from the European Commission that membership would not . be automatic. Incredibly, the new document suggests . that English students would continue to have to pay  tuition fees to . attend Scottish universities, even though those from Scotland, and all . other EU countries, pay nothing. The UK Treasury suggests that . independence would leave Scots facing average tax rises of £1,000 a . year. But the SNP claimed that increased revenue from oil would leave . Scots better off. Downing Street yesterday said it was . ‘highly unlikely’ England would want to continue in a  currency union . with an independent Scotland, leaving the Scots to create their own . currency or attempt to join the euro. Alex Salmond, yesterday published an extraordinary wish-list designed to convince Scots they would be better off voting to dissolve the  300-year-old union with England. Here, JAMES SLACK analyses the reality behind the SNP’s uncosted and often fanciful list of promises. Funding the giveaways . CLAIM: Scotland can afford an extraordinary list of giveaways, including 30 hours of childcare per week in term time for all three and four-year-olds; abolition of the so-called ‘bedroom tax’; increasing the State pension by £1.10 a week and ensuring the minimum wage rises in line with ‘cost of living’. All existing perks, such as free prescriptions and no tuition fees, remain. REALITY: Even before yesterday’s wish-list, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated Scotland had a £3billion black hole in its finances. The SNP claims the money will be recovered by tackling tax avoidance, ending the married couples’ tax allowance (which hasn’t been introduced yet) and no longer funding the Westminster parliament. The No campaign insists the pledges are unaffordable without swingeing tax rises. Keeping the pound . CLAIM: Scotland allowed to keep the pound. Bank of England is lender of last resort. REALITY: George Osborne and Labour’s Ed Balls have both made clear they would not agree to this. Oil and gas riches . CLAIM: An oil and gas-rich Scotland would be the eighth richest country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The SNP invited ridicule  yesterday when it boasted its vision for Scotland made the US Declaration of Independence ‘look like a Post-It note’. Its 670-page manifesto includes a mass of trivial detail – such as a pledge to continue broadcasting pre-school channel CBeebies – without answering key questions on its future currency or membership of the European Union. By contrast, the US Declaration of Independence sets out the fundamental belief that ‘all men are created equally’ and is considered to be one of the most influential documents in history. The comment was made by a  parliamentary aide to SNP leader Alex Salmond in the Daily Record. REALITY: The figure is based on gross domestic product (GDP) data for 2011. But a huge proportion of the income from North Sea oil and gas goes to foreign investors, and gross national income (GNI) is therefore the figure that should be used. No Scottish data on GNI is available. UK oil and gas production has fallen by an average of 7.8 per cent a year since 1999. Nuclear disarmament . CLAIM: Trident nuclear weapons, currently based on the Clyde, removed by 2020. Scotland to remain in Nato. REALITY: Senior Nato officials have warned Scotland could be barred from joining in the event of a dispute over Trident. Under article 10 of the Nato treaty, the SNP, which is opposed to nuclear weapons, would be forced to accept the alliance’s first strike nuclear policy.abandoning the BRITISH ARMY . CLAIM: Scotland protected by a new defence force with 15,000 regulars and 5,000 reserve personnel. REALITY: A survey by the respected Henry Jackson Society found a ‘majority’ of Scottish soldiers will prefer to remain in the British Army, rather than sit ‘twiddling their thumbs’. Border checkpoints . CLAIM: Border checks with England will not be put in place. For non-EU migrants, a more relaxed points-based system to that used by Westminster. Dungavel Detention Centre in Lanarkshire closed and dawn raids ended. REALITY: If Scotland adopts a more lax approach to immigration, there will be a clamour for checks to take place on the English side of the border. Otherwise, Scotland would become a gateway for illegal entry to rest of the UK.the terrorist threat . CLAIM: Scotland kept safe by a single security and intelligence agency, combining work of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ. REALITY: Security officials in the UK – and our allies overseas – would not be obliged to share secrets with an unproven spy agency. A report produced for the Home Secretary warned Scotland would have a ‘reduced capability to tackle a persistent threat’. Joining the Euro . CLAIM: Scotland will immediately be allowed to join the EU. It will not be forced to join the euro. REALITY: Spain may block Scottish membership, amid fears it will encourage separatists in Catalonia and the Basque region. New countries joining the EU are required to adopt the euro as soon as relevant criteria have been met. Ditching the Beeb . CLAIM: A Scottish Broadcasting Service (SBS) would be established using the assets of BBC Scotland. SBS would broadcast Strictly Come Dancing, Doctor Who and CBeebies in return for giving the BBC access to its existing resources north of the border. REALITY: Programmes such as Strictly have huge commercial value. The BBC could charge a premium for the show and use the money to establish its own facilities in Scotland. Popular BBC shows like Strictly Come Dancing and Doctor Who would not disappear from Scottish TV screens if the BBC becomes a 'foreign' broadcaster, Mr Salmond told reporters . The Citizenship Question . CLAIM: British citizens habitually resident in Scotland will automatically be considered Scottish citizens, as will Scots-born British citizens living in England. REALITY: Many Scots living in England are furious that while Mr Salmond wants to give them a passport, he will not let them vote on independence. English people living in Scotland might want to refuse citizenship. The independence referendum, to be . held on September 18 next year, gives voters ‘a choice between two . futures’, the paper states. A . Yes vote will mean ‘the most important decisions about our economy and . society will be taken by the people who care most about Scotland, that . is by the people of Scotland’. It adds that ‘the door will open to a new era for our nation. Scotland's future will be in Scotland's hands’. But it claims a vote in favour of staying part of the UK would mean that ‘Scotland stands still’. As . a result of that, the paper states a ‘once-in-a-generation opportunity . to follow a different path and choose a new and better direction for our . nation is lost’. In . addition to negotiating with London on retaining the pound, an . independent Scotland would also be plunged into protracted talks to . rejoining the European Union. Sir Chris Hoy with his gold medal during London 2012 . Scottish athletes could still represent Team GB at the Olympics even if Scotland became independent. Future sports stars would have to choose between a Scotland-only team or a British one, the Scottish Government said. But Scotland would still field a separate Olympics team.At present, athletes can choose which country they represent if they meet its qualifying criteria. The Scottish Government said while it ‘hopes that all athletes who are qualified to represent Scotland will do so, this is a  personal decision’. The Better Together campaign has seized on Team GB’s success at last year’s Olympics as evidence Britain does better when united.","Voters go to the polls in referendum on 18 September 2014 .

Tragedy: Lady Jean Hilda Patricia Bancroft, from Wandsworth, London, died after her legs became tangled in her dog's lead and she fell over . The elderly widow of a top civil servant died after tripping over when her legs became tangled in the lead of the dog she adored. And such was her devotion to cairn terrier Cassie, that despite needing urgent treatment to a serious head wound, Lady Jean Bancroft refused to go to hospital until she was assured her beloved pet would be cared for. An inquest heard that passers-by rushed to Lady Bancroft’s aid after the fall outside her home in Wandsworth, South-West London, on August 5. An ambulance was called, but when paramedics tried to take her to hospital the 87-year-old turned them down, determined to go home with her dog instead. Westminster Coroner’s Court heard that Lady Bancroft, whose husband Baron Ian Bancroft was head of the Home Civil Service before his death in 1996, was ‘fiercely independent’ and took Cassie out for a walk each day despite health problems and a history of falling over. However, once she arrived at hospital her condition quickly worsened, and she lost consciousness and slipped into a coma. She died a week later after several days on a life support machine. Coroner Dr Shirley Radcliffe gave Lady Bancroft’s cause of death as severe traumatic brain injury. Lady Bancroft’s daughter Emma Haines, 54, said: ‘Mum loved  animals and had several dogs –  previously they were retrievers. She had had Cassie for seven years and adored her. ‘She had a dog walker in recent years to take Cassie out in the morning, but she would still go out herself in the evenings to take her for a walk locally.’ Lady Bancroft met her husband when he was studying at Oxford in 1948, and the couple married at the city’s register office in 1950. An inquest heard that Lady Bancroft, whose husband Baron Ian Bancroft was head of the Home Civil Service before his death in 1996, was 'fiercely independent' and took Cassie out for a walk each day despite health problems and a history of falls . Determined: Lady Bancroft, who married Baron Bancroft in 1950 and has two sons and a daughter, refused to accept she had been momentarily knocked unconscious, despite the one inch cut on her head . Baron Bancroft rose to his position . at the top of the civil service in 1978, but Prime Minister Margaret . Thatcher effectively ended his career by  abolishing the Civil Service . Department in 1981. The . couple had three children, Emma and brothers Simon, 60, and Adam, who . died in 1999 of cancer aged 43. Eight grandchildren followed and, eight . months ago, Lady Bancroft was ‘thrilled’ when her granddaughter Megan, . one of Simon’s children, gave birth to great-granddaughter Emily. Mrs Haines said: ‘Mum loved  life, she adored her family. Her children, grandchildren and great-grandchild were everything to her. She had lots of friends and was very much loved. Death: She eventually went to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, pictured, but sadly died a few days later . She donated to the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability because my father was chairman for a while before he died. ‘Mum kept in contact and raised money for them. ‘She . was full of vim and vigour – and she died only just before what would . have been her 88th birthday. She was very independent for her age – she . was still driving and we went on holiday with her to Dallas in May.’ Lady . Bancroft’s funeral was held at Putney Vale Crematorium on August 28, . when Mrs Haines said three rangers from Wimbledon Common formed a guard . of honour on horseback outside. ‘Mum spent a lot of time on the common . with her dogs – she was a supporter of the conservators and was great . friends with the rangers,’ Mrs Haines said. The inquest heard that Lady Bancroft had medical problems and a history of falls. Delivering . her verdict, coroner Dr Radcliffe said: ‘Lady Bancroft was a fiercely . independent 87-year-old who had significant medical problems and a . fairly consistent history of falls. ‘She was walking her dog when the lead became tangled in her legs. I conclude that she died as a result of an accident.’","Lady Bancroft, 87, fell over after becoming tangled in her dog's lead .

Police in Cleveland, Texas are investigating the horrifying possibility that another gang rape has occurred in the small town of 8,000, just three years after an assault by 20 men on an 11-year-old girl shocked the nation. The latest crime involves a 15-year-old girl who has told Cleveland police that she was drugged, attacked and raped by four men in an abandoned home over the weekend before last. The girl's parents made the complaint to law enforcement on Tuesday and the girl was taken to a Houston medical facility to be examined by rape experts before she was interviewed in a secure environment at a child advocacy center. Scroll Down for Video . Horror: This is the abandoned home where the 15-year-old girl alleges that she was raped by as many as four men in late September . 'Right now it’s just an alleged rape. We are running down all the leads,' said Cleveland Police Chief Darrel Broussard to the Cleveland Advocate. 'It's sad,' said a mother who didn't want to be identified to KHOU.Com 'We have too many kids getting hurt in Cleveland.' At this point, there are no charges and no one has been arrested - but the case has reopened the wounds of three years ago - when twenty men and boys were charged with raping an 11-year-old. All of them have either accepted plea deals or were convicted. Investigation: Police in Cleveland, Texas have said that they have made no arrests at this point . Police say the girl was raped repeatedly between September 15, 2010 and December 3 of that year by a gang of 20 boys aged between 14 and 27. The victim has admitted to being a a consenting participant in the encounters and has acknowledged that she never made an outcry until she was questioned by authorities once sex tapes filmed by the boys surfaced at Cleveland High School. Prosecutors argue, however, that an 11-year-old's consent is meaningless because she is not emotionally mature enough to understand what she is doing. Crime scene: Authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in November 2010 in the town of Cleveland, Texas . Dirty: The attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home, pictured, where the victim was assaulted by as many as 20 men . When the case surfaced three years ago, the father of the girl said he discovered the abuse in November 2010 after being sent sexually explicit pictures of his daughter on his cell phone. Speaking to the New York Times, the victim's father said he had been worried about his daughter for 'months', as she had been climbing out of her bedroom window at night, coming home as late as 12 p.m. One night, she returned home at 3 a.m. shaking and crying. The girl told her parents she had been visiting 'friends.' He said: 'Her mind is a child’s mind. That’s what makes me so angry. 'She will never recover from this.' He told the paper that although she was tall for her age, the girl remained a child; her bed piled high with stuffed animals. Several of the suspects have serious criminal records while others have children of their own, including one nicknamed 'Mookey', who was ordered to pay child support for five children within the past year. Accused: Kelvin Rashad King, left, and Devo Shaun Green, right, were among those accused of raping the girl . Gang-rape: Xavier King, left, and Marcus Anthony Porchia, right, are among the 20 men and boys in the case . Among those accused are two sets of siblings, Xavier Montreal King and his older brother Kelvin.Xavier, nicknamed 'Youngmoney', has just become a father with his 15-year-old partner Markeya Mallet. Police became aware of the alleged rape after the girl told a school district police chief about the incident on December 3, 2010. Alleged attacker: Jared Glenn McPherson, pictured, is one of the men accused of raping the 11-year-old . One school employee spoke with several students: 'Who had seen the cell phone videos or heard of the incident,' the affidavit said. The victim was then interviewed at a child advocacy center. According to documents, one of the suspects called her, 'and asked if she wanted to ride around,' the warrant said. Three of the suspects then picked her up and took her to one residence where a fourth suspect lived. A fourth suspect told the young girl to disrobe, she said, adding that she would be 'beaten up if she did not comply,' an affidavit recorded. The girl was then said to have engaged in sexual acts in the bedroom and bathroom of the house.While in the bathroom, the girl said she heard one suspect calling and inviting other people to have sex with her. After she left the bathroom, she saw four men she did not know, the affidavit said. The party was disturbed, however, when the aunt of one of the suspects returned home. The alleged victim and the men then 'left the residence in haste through the rear window of the house,' the affidavit said. The group then moved to an abandoned trailer where the sexual acts continued. The alleged victim 'stated that digital still images and digital video images of the sex acts were recorded by one or more individuals using cellular telephones.' The incident raised racial tensions in the 8,000-strong community of Celveland, Texas, as the suspects are all black and the girl is of Mexican descent. Latino community leaders defended the young girl, saying people who have questioned her parental supervision and dress are re-victimizing her.","Girl, 15, reports she was raped in abandoned home in the small Texas town .

Charged: Phone users are being charged up to £5 to obtain a single number from directory enquiries, with costs spiralling further if customers agree to be connected to the number . Phone users are being charged up to £5 to obtain a single number from directory enquiries. In a shocking rip-off, the cost spirals further if customers agree to be connected to the number, because each extra minute costs £5. Citizens Advice raised the alarm about the extortionate prices after one man told them he had been charged more than £100 for a single call to a 118 number. The mobile phone company O2 has set the minimum charge for calling 118 numbers at £5 – compared with £3 previously. The £5 levy is 20 times the 25p that BT was charging when its monopoly of the national directory service ended in 2003. The onward connection fee imposed by O2 can make the cost of a four- to five-minute call £25. Calling from landlines can also be expensive. BT, for example, has a minimum call charge of £2.98 to reach its own 118 500 service. It charges £3.58 to reach the rival 118 118 service. The directory enquiries shake-up in 2003 was ordered by the then telecoms regulator Oftel despite huge misgivings among consumers who were happy with the 192 service. Oftel wanted to bring in a raft of exciting and cheap rivals – but instead produced a wave of confusing and expensive tariffs. Calls are understood to have halved in recent years. Many customers have switched to the free services available on the internet, which can be accessed from smartphones or computers. However, a large part of the population, particularly the elderly, still need the telephone service. Gillian Guy of Citizens Advice said: ‘People are being hit with eye-wateringly high phone bills after calling a 118 number. One Citizens Advice Bureau helped a man who had unknowingly spent £100 on a single telephone call after using a 118 service. An increase in call costs will make these bills even bigger. ‘Consumers who don’t have access to the internet are more likely to rely on these expensive services and are at a greater risk of getting a shock bill. You can be Ripped off P7.jpg . ‘Mobile providers need to be clearer about the cost of calling these numbers and how people could save money by getting the number they need, then putting the phone down and calling directly.’ Ofcom, the telecoms regulator which replaced Oftel, has admitted the system does not work and it is about to unveil new rules it hopes will make the charges clearer. Firms will be required to offer a single flat fee to access any 118 or non-geographic number beginning with 08. They will have to advertise this and include details on bills and in their contracts. The firms will also have to spell out their own fees in their advertising. Ofcom claims this new regime will make the charges clear and create competition between the phone companies with the hope of reducing fees. However, the new system will not come into effect until May 2015 at the earliest. Price rises: O2 defended its price rise saying it had increased the charges to call 118 numbers as the company had been subject to price hikes from the providers . The market is dominated by 118 118, which is run by The Number, and 118 500, which is the BT service. They take 80 per cent of business largely because they have spent the most on marketing. David Hickson of the Fair Telecoms Campaign said: ‘These very high costs make it imperative callers do not let themselves be tricked into taking advantage of the offer to connect the call, at the same rate.’ O2 defended its price rise saying: ‘We’ve increased the charges to call 118 directory enquiry services as we have seen a number of price increases to us from the providers during the past 12 months.’ All the phone companies offer their own directory enquiry services which are cheap or free to their own customers, however these numbers are not heavily promoted.","Citizens Advice told by customer that he was charged £100 for call .

The mystery of a 'possessed' rotating statue that had experts in a spin due to its unexplained movement during the night has been solved following a scientific investigation. The 4,000-year-old Egyptian statue had curators at Manchester Museum puzzled after it began to mysteriously rotate overnight, despite being housed in a secure glass case. Neb-Senu is a 10in (25cm) statuette made in about 1800 BC as a medium for the soul of an ancient Egyptian man. The mystery of the 'rotating' statue has been solved following a scientific investigation which showed it moved as a result of vibrations from passing footfall and traffic . Neb-Senu is a 10in statuette made in about 1800 BC as a medium for the soul of an ancient Egyptian man . Explanations for its movement ranged from mystical and magical ancient myths, curses and spirits to the object being possessed. But, following an investigation, a far more 21st century reason has been unearthed - that the figure rotated as a result of vibrations from passing footfall and traffic. ITV's Mystery Map, which investigates myths and mysterious stories, enlisted specialists to place sensors under the cabinet to detect vibrations, which dispelled some of the more outlandish claims. Vibration expert Steve Gosling undertook a 24-hour test by placing a specialist three-axis sensor under the wall-mounted cabinet containing the relic, to record any vibrations present. Vibration expert Steve Gosling undertook a 24-hour test by placing a specialist three-axis sensor under the wall-mounted cabinet containing the relic . Figuring it out: Steve Gosling said the vibration comes from a combination of multiple sources . Beginning the test at 6pm, he found there was a peak in vibration level which correlated with movement at this time. Overnight the vibrations stopped and the statue stopped rotating. Movement began again at 7am the following day - at the same time the vibrations also started again. Mr Gosling said: 'The vibration is a combination of multiple sources so there's buses outside on the busy road, there's footfall activity. And it's all of those things combined.' When asked why other displays were not rotating, he added: 'This statue has a convex base. There's a lump at the bottom which makes it more susceptible to vibrations than the others which have a flat base. This is conclusive.' Anna Garnett, an Egyptology curator, previously attributed the mysterious movement to 'a force beyond the physical' whilst Yulan Li, a student, ascribed the motion to magic. Professor Brian Cox previously said he thought the movement was a result of friction between the carved serpentine figure and the glass shelf. :: Mystery Map is presented by Ben Shephard and Julia Bradbury and is on ITV at 8pm today.","Neb-Senu statuette began to mysteriously rotate overnight .

The calendar has failed to sell a single copy - with just 41 days until the New Year.

Jobless under-25s will be banned from claiming benefits under plans being considered by the Labour party. All young people would be barred from receiving Employment Support Allowance and Income Support, and only those from low income families would receive a new ‘youth allowance’ to help them find work. Rachel Reeves, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, is examining the plan drawn up by a left-leaning think tank to counter claims the party is soft on welfare. Tough: Rachel Reeves has vowed to tackle Labour's image as being soft on welfare since becoming shadow work and pensions secretary in last month's reshuffle . The Institute for Public Policy Research is expected to set out its proposals for a means-tested youth allowance for 18 to 24-year-olds who are not in work or education this week. Youngsters with parents who earn more than £25,000 will not be eligible. Under-25s would only be able to claim the allowance if they are in ‘purposeful’ training or can prove they are ‘intensively’ looking for work, according to IPPR. Speech: Labour leader Ed Miliband told his party conference that school leavers should not face end up in a life on benefits . Under the plan the youth allowance would be set at £56.80 in line with Jobseekers’ Allowance for over-25s. But . under-25s would not be allowed to claim Employment Support Allowance . and Income Support, potentially saving the taxpayer £1.3 billion-a-year. Ms Reeves has vowed to tackle Labour's image as being soft on welfare since becoming shadow work and pensions secretary in last month's reshuffle. Labour leader Ed Miliband signalled a tougher approach in September, when he told his party conference: ‘If the school system fails our young people they shouldn’t be ending up on benefits. ‘They should be ending up in education or training so they can get back on the road to a proper career.’ A week later David Cameron called for under-25s to lose the right to claim the dole. The Prime Minister used his conference speech to reveal the next Conservative manifesto is likely to promise to withdraw benefits for school leavers so that they can no longer 'opt for a life on benefits'. It is estimated that more than 1million people could be affected, including more than 360,000 aged 18-25 claiming Jobseeker's Allowance last month. Removing housing benefit from under-25s is estimated to save the Treasury £2billion. Research by the IPPR found that countries like the Netherlands and Denmark that block young people from claiming conventional benefits also have lower rates of youth unemployment. In Denmark just 7 per cent are of young people are not in training or employment, in Netherlans just four per cent but in the UK the figure is 14 per cent. Despite the economic recovery taking hold, there are still almost 1million under-25s who are out of work . Graeme Cooke, from the IPPR, told the Daily Telegraph: ‘Gaining decent qualifications and practical work experience are the two most important things affecting young people’s job prospects. ‘Yet the current welfare system prevents young people from continuing to study and permits them to spend unlimited periods on benefits without work.’ Labour insiders admit the party is stung by Tory claims of being the party of welfare. Sources today said the party would wait until the IPPR report had been published before making a decision.","Young would lose Income Support and Employment Support Allowance .

Geoffrey Blore, 82, died after being hit from behind by a Ford Focus near Leominster, Herefordshire . An 82-year-old author died after he was knocked off his bicycle accidentally by a driver who became dazzled by the winter sun. Geoffrey Blore, an RAF veteran who wrote an acclaimed account of his life as an evacuee, was cycling near his home town of Leominster in Herefordshire when he was hit from behind by a Ford Focus driven by Catherine Jones. Police cautioned Ms Jones, but brought no charges. She told them she had held up her hands to shield herself from the glare - which may have blocked her view of the pensioner. An inquest heard Mr Blore, a keen marathon runner, was wearing a high-visibility jacket but no helmet when the fatal crash happened south of Leominster on January 15. He was airlifted to Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth hospital but died of a severe head injury the same day. The RAF veteran and father-of-four was the author of Dicky Blood's War, which told the true story of how he was evacuated in 1941 from a working-class Birmingham district to the village of Yoxall, Staffordshire. Hundreds of wide-eyed Birmingham children who had never left the city descended on the village - which only had 700 residents - causing a culture clash which was at once touching and amusing. The book describes how he and his friends adapted to life on rural farms, including discovering how watermills worked, and how they coped once they returned to city life. It was praised by the Evacuees Reunion Association as 'so much more than the average evacuees story... vivid, but very accurate.' The inquest at Hereford Coroners' Court heard the accident happened at 10am - when the low-lying sun and damp impaired the view of the road. Dazzled: Part of Hereford Road, south of Leominster, near the stretch on which cyclist Geoffrey Blore died . Tragic: The inquest took place at Hereford Coroners' Court, pictured. No criminal charges were brought . PC Bill Taylor, of West Mercia Police, told the inquest Ms Jones’ view of Mr Blore would 'have been obscured when she put her hands up to shield her face'. Other drivers also described the visibility as seriously challenging. Minibus driver Ryan Waygood said he was only aware of a cyclist from about 20 yards away. Herefordshire coroner Mark Bricknell recorded a verdict of accidental death and said visibility was a significant factor. Tina Pritchett, who worked at Mr Blore’s Norfolk House residence, described him as a 'perfect gentleman'.

The cousin of a four-year-old girl whose body was dumped in a picnic cooler beside a Manhattan highway 22 years ago has pleaded not guilty to her murder - despite claims he has already confessed. Kitchen worker Conrado Juarez, 52, denied killing Anjelica Castillo. Until this year she was known only as Baby Hope. And his attorney Michael Croce said a supposedly 'coercive' confession, in which Juarez is said to have admitted having sex with her and smothering her with a pillow, is 'completely suspect'. Conrado Juarez, 52, during his arraignment hearing on October 12. Prosecutors say he sexually assaulted his four-year-old cousin Anjelica Castillo, known for 22 years as 'Baby Hope', and smothered her with a pillow . Naked and tied with rope, Anjelica's . body was found beside a highway in Washington Heights, New York, in 1991. There was . semen on her body, assistant district attorney Melissa Mourges told a . judge. For more than two decades, detectives did not even know her name. They nicknamed her Baby . Hope and paid for her headstone at St Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx. Only when the NYPD renewed its appeal in July, on the 22nd anniversary of her death, did investigators find her mother. She told them she had left Anjelica and another daughter with their biological father on the night she died. Authorities say he then left them with relatives in an apartment where Juarez was also staying. Identified: Last week Anjelica Catillo's headstone in the Bronx was finally given her name, 22 years later . Cold case: There were many appeals over the years by investigators but leads in the Baby Hope case dried up . Last week the headstone was finally engraved . with Anjelica Castillo's name as her mother left flowers and lit candles in her memory. She would have been 26. Juarez's reaction when detectives arrived on October 11 was: 'What is this about?', prosecutors said. Over the next 14 hours, Ms Mourges said he first told detectives he had helped his sister dispose of the cooler, unaware of what was inside. Then he recounted finding Anjelica dead on the floor, it is alleged, packing her body into the cooler, piling soda cans on top to try to conceal the body and helping his sister drop it by the highway. Later, Juarez recounted sexually abusing the child while drunk but said that was unrelated to her death, prosecutors said. 'Finally, he admitted that he had sex with the victim and killed her by smothering her with a pillow,' Ms Mourges said. The district attorney's office has not released Juarez's eventual written and videotaped statements. Prosecutors are also awaiting DNA test results. Juarez's attorney Mr Croce has declined to describe his client's version of events. Blessing: dozens of people - including police who investigated the case for years - showed up to bless the newly engraved tombstone in the Bronx last week. It was nameless for 22 years . Monster: Authorities say Castillo's cousin Conrado Juarez sexually assaulted her before suffocating her and leaving her body on the side of a highway. He has denied this saying a confession was 'coerced' Speaking as Anjelica's tombstone was re-engraved last week, her sister Lorena Castillo told NBC New York: 'I'm just glad that her name is on her stone.' Father Rudy Gonzalez, who presided over the ceremony, blessed the grave site, telling mourners, 'Bless the engraving of Anjelica's name and bless any child who at this moment may be suffering at the hands of evil hearts.' Authorities canvassed the Washington . Heights neighborhood in July with flyers with a sketch of the mystery girl to find new leads. Just a day after they reopened the case, a call came into Crime . Stoppers - the NYPD's tip line - from a person who claimed to have . information about the case. The . caller 'gave specific family members, where to look -- ethnicity, . origin, approximate dates of birth, and she turned out to be right,' detective Elena Donnell said. That tip led to the arrest of 52-year-old Juarez, who is a cousin on Anjelica's father's side. Juarez recently gave a jailhouse interview to the New York Times claiming that he didn't actually kill the girl, but he did help dispose of the body. He told the paper that Anjelica and her sister, Maribel, had been living with him and his sister in their . Astoria, Queens, apartment. One . day, the girls' father never came home, and Juarez said he and his . sister - who has since died - were then tasked with caring for the . girls. Never forgotten: Police reopened the 'Baby Hope' case this year, which led to the discovery of the girl's identity . 'Like garbage': Castillo's body was found dumped on the side of a highway inside a cooler . 'I told my sister: ‘'You should get some kind of receipt,’” Juárez said. 'Even if it’s not notarized or formally prepared by a lawyer, get the real mother to sign something. You are going to be the one raising those girls.’ Juarez claimed his sister called him one day on his cell phone and told him that Anjelica had fallen down the stairs and that she needed help getting rid of the body. As the Times notes, fewer than three-percent of Americans had cell phones in 1992 - when the alleged murder was committed - and the probability of a poor, immigrant kitchen worker being amongst those with a cell phone is beyond slim. In his confession, however, authorities say Juarez admitted to things that only the killer would know. They say he sexually assaulted the girl in his apartment then smothered her with a pillow when she wouldn't stop crying. He then stuffed her lifeless body into a cooler, took a cab to Washington Heights and dumped the body on the side of the highway, they say. Juarez is now set to face a full murder trial.","Authorities identified baby as Anjelica Castillo, who was murdered in 1991 .

A British backpacker sparked a major search and rescue operation in Australia after his belongings were found at a suicide spot - while he spent the night with two girls he met on a night out. Joe Stuttle, 19, was touring Tasmania on a bike on his gap-year when he left his bike and bag containing his passport chained to a fence while he hit the bars. But unbeknown to him, the student had left his belongings at a notorious suicide spot when he went into a nearby town to watch the Christmas lights get switched on. Happy ending: Joe Stuttle, pictured with a wallaby while in Tasmania, was feared dead when his belongings were discovered near a notorious suicide spot . Mr Stuttle went drinking and met two girls who invited him to stay at their house and only returned to get his valuables the next day. He was amazed when he turned up at Launceston Gorge at lunchtime last Saturday and found dozens of officers and TV crews searching for him. Police had even contacted his parents in Billingborough, Lincolnshire, telling them their son was missing. But an embarrassed Mr Stuttle had to admit to police he had spent the night with two local girls which is why he left his belongings chained up and his tent was left empty. Alert: Joe Stuttle's belongings were discovered not far from a bridge in Cataract Gorge, Tasmania, which is a notorious suicide spot . Speaking earlier today, he said: 'It's a long story. I met someone and slept in Launceston. I had a great night but when I came back in the morning, I found my bike stolen. 'Thankfully there were 30 officers in hiking gear from state police so I asked them and it turned out they were looking for me. 'There was an incredible fuss but it really is a reflection of the fantastic work of Tasmanian police. They were efficient, fast and friendly. 'They had a formal press announcement within two hours of finding the bike, after interviewing everyone who had seen me. 'They phoned people I knew in England and Australia, organised search parties and informed my family. 'But when I sauntered back like an idiot, they didn't even seem to mind. They were just happy I was safe. 'I shouldn't have left my passport and everything out all night and I should have come back at 8am instead of noon. 'But I got a bit on two TV stations and a ride in a Holden police car, which I've wanted to do ever since I've arrived.' False alarm: Backpacker Joe Stuttle returned to the area he had left his gear after spending the night in Launceston, Northern Tasmania, to find police and TV crews carrying out a massive search operation . Mr Stuttle apologised for causing such worry, particularly for his parents, and said he was grateful that Australian authorities had taken the incident seriously. Blogging about his night, he described the moment he met his new friends before realising the commotion at the suicide spot was about him. He wrote: 'I end up meeting a man called Cat and two cousins called Steph and Alita. 'They are, like all Tasmanians, comically friendly. 'We just met in the street and became friends, it was as easy as that. 'I get a bed for the night with these girls just like it's nothing and it seems strange to them that I'm so grateful. 'Hungry as I am I keep turning down food as these people on this island seem so friendly that to abuse their hospitality would be tantamount to gross disrespect. 'I woke up at 11 and say my farewells to my new friends.' When he got back to the beauty spot he believed his belongings had been stolen when he was unable to find them, unaware the police had seized them as possible evidence. His parents Lorraine, 49, and Chris, who still live in Billingborough, were away on holiday and were thankfully not too worried about their son's antics. His father said: 'Anyone who knows Joe will not be in the least surprised by this story. It certainly didn't come as any surprise to us.' Joe plans to spend the next 11 months in Australia, after studying at the Robert Manning Technology College, now the Bourne Academy, Bourne Grammar School and The Deepings School.","Joe Stuttle, 19, was travelling around Tasmania on a gap-year .

A four-year-old girl has taken her first proper steps thanks to the generosity of Britain’s biggest lottery winners. Chris and Colin Weir dipped into their £161million EuroMillions jackpot to pay for Skye Swinton, who has cerebral palsy, to have revolutionary spinal surgery. She has now undergone the complex operation and taken her first tentative steps with the aid of walking sticks. Skye Swinton, four, has taken her first steps after lottery winners Colin and Chris Weir paid for her to have pioneering cerebral palsy surgery . Her mother, Ruth, 39, hopes she will soon walk unaided and go on to live a normal life. Mr and Mrs Weir paid the £28,000 needed for the Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy operation after Ms Swinton wrote them a letter asking for help when her local NHS trust refused funding. She was stunned to receive a phone call informing her that the kind couple – who are Britain’s biggest single jackpot winners - would stump up the cash. Ms Swinton, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, said: ‘The operation was a success and so far she’s making good progress. ‘She is already walking better, which is fantastic, and where her muscles were tight before, it has taken that away. ‘She had to lie flat for 48 hours after the operation, but now she is moving well and can already notice the difference. Mr and Mrs Weir won an £161 million EuroMillions jackpot in 2011 making them Britain's biggest jackpot winners. They donated the money for Skye's operation after her mother wrote to them asking for help . Skye (pictured with her parents, Ruth and John) was dependent upon a wheelchair before she had the operation but she is now taking her first tentative steps . ‘In the past she couldn’t move her toes very easily whereas now she can. We’re really pleased with how it went, and of course extremely grateful to everyone who made it possible.’ Skye was born 13 weeks premature weighing just 1lb 15oz and suffers from spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, which has largely confined her to a wheelchair. She was unsteady on her feet, unable to walk any distance without tiring and dreamed of walking and running like other children. Her family and friends managed to raise £12,000 for surgery to allow her to walk normally but were still a long way from the £40,000 needed. So, Ms Swinton wrote to Mr and Mrs Weir, of North Ayrshire in Scotland, and asked them to donate the rest of the cash. Ms Swinton said: 'The operation was a success and so far she's making good progress. She is already walking better, which is fantastic, and where her muscles were tight before, it has taken that away' The operation at Frenchay Hospital, in Bristol, took four hours to complete. Although the procedure has been carried out in the U.S. for many years, it is new to the UK. Without the operation - which involves partially cutting the nerve roots where they join the spinal cord to loosen the muscles - she would have needed major corrective surgery in a few years and faced spending lots of her time in her wheelchair. Ms Swinton, a full-time carer for Skye, said she could already see the difference in her little girl. ‘The way she moved before put a lot of strain on joints and muscles which would have led to long-term problems,’ she said. ‘Now she is walking properly with the help of a tripod and she is getting stronger all the time. In a statement Mr and Mrs Weir said they hoped their donation would allow the Swinton family to concentrate on Skye's welfare . ‘We hope within a couple of months she will be able to walk unaided. ‘Certainly in the long term the operation will have a big impact on improving her quality of life. ‘Skye is in very positive spirits too which is wonderful to see.’ In a statement Mr and Mrs Weir - who scooped their jackpot in July 2011 – said they hoped their donation would allow the Swinton family to concentrate on Skye’s welfare. They said: ‘Skye faces many challenges in the next year and she needs her mum and dad to be focused on her. ‘That’s why we’ve given a donation. Without the additional worry and pressure of fundraising, their time can be spent on Skye.’ Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs.","Chris and Colin Weir gave £28,000 of their £161m EuroMillions jackpot to pay for Skye Swinton to have the surgery she needed to walk .

Scotland will be forced to quit the sterling if it votes for independence next year, the Scottish secretary has warned. Alistair Carmichael said the country could not guarantee a currency union with the UK after becoming independent. It is the most prevalent warning yet for Scottish voters to remain in the UK in the referendum on September 18 next year. Speaking about the possibility of keeping sterling, Mr Carmichael told The Financial Times: 'George Osborne has said ... it is highly . unlikely. 'Most people in Whitehall understand that if George Osborne . says something is highly unlikely, it is not going to happen.' And when asked if he believed an independent Scotland would be excluded from the currency, he simply replied: 'Yes'. Mr Carminchael's comments come as the Scottish National Party prepares to unveil its blue-print for its the vision of an independent Scotland. If the country achieves independence, party leaders are expected to insist that it should be able to keep the sterling as an 'asset' that is partly owned by Scotland. This would allow the country to continue sharing the benefits of the Bank of England. Earlier this year, George Osborne warned that Scotland could end up 'like Panama' if it gains independence, but keeps the pound.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 05:41 EST, 30 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:21 EST, 30 October 2013 . Maths: Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.ON, said he had not 'done the arithmetic' on what impact green levies make on bills . Energy bills will still rise even if the government cuts green levies, one of the country’s biggest power firms admitted today. Tony Cocker, chief executive of E.ON, signalled that his firm will join the other four big energy firms in pushing up prices before the winter hits. Yesterday he compared environment charges on bills to a 'stealth poll tax' pushing up prices for everyone. But today he admitted that he did not actually know what their impact was and had not ‘done the arithmetic’ on how much they actually added to bills. MPs last night tore into the Big Six energy companies, accusing them of 'abuse' by driving up prices, which means families across Britain struggle to afford to heat their homes. They accused the firms of giving 'meaningless' statements as they sought to blame variously increased transport costs, green energy schemes and investment in new power stations for their decision to hike bills. Mr Cocker was the only senior executive to appear, with the other firms sending junior managers or PR men. Four of the Big Six firms have already announced big price rises, with ScottishPower bills going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase. Today Mr Cocker stepped up his criticism of environment measures, which the government demands are funded through bills. But he refused to rule out price rises in the coming weeks, saying on BBC Radio 4: ‘Our prices have not yet gone up, we haven’t announced anything. ‘We continue to keep it under review. We will keep any price rises as low as possible for as long as possible. ‘Fundamentally things in the energy mix keep driving costs up.' The price hikes will add £50 to every family's bill with some households seeing annual rises of more than £100 . the cost of going green . The Big Six energy firms are ripping off customers and acting 'like a cartel', the boss of a smaller competitor has claimed. Ecotricity's Dale Vince said energy companies had been taking advantage of consumers since the utilities were privatised and the market is 'dysfunctional'. Mr Vince said wholesale costs alone could not justify the increase in bills. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'They have cited three factors: the rising cost of wholesale fossil fuels, Government levies and the cost of distribution. 'All three of those are valid, in the case of wholesale price rises right now, if you look back over 12 months, then they are not justified in raising their retail prices because of wholesale movements in this year. 'We had a close look at that and therefore announced our own price freeze.' Mr Vince added: 'I don't think you need an inquiry to tell you this market is dysfunctional, you just have to look at it. Six big players have a 95 per cent market share and they seem to operate like a cartel, the prices go up in conjunction.' Mr Cocker again complained about social costs, environmental obligations and the upgrading of networks as reasons for companies continuing to put prices up. He said: ‘If you take those [green taxes] off then pound for pound we will take off those costs.’ But when pushed on how much those costs are, Mr Cocker said he had not got the exact figures to hand. ‘I haven’t done the arithmetic to see what the total picture is but what we would say is pound for pound we would take those costs off.’ David Cameron has promised to ‘roll back’ green levies on bills, with the government expected to fund insulation programmes and help for elderly people to keep warm through general taxation. Mr Cocker added: ‘There are many more discussions to be had with the Government to remove these [green taxes] from the bill and make them as efficient as possible.’ Companies have estimated that bills could be cut by around £60 if the green taxes were scrapped. Mr Cocker told MPs yesterday that green levies acted as a 'regressive stealth tax essentially' and should be paid for from general taxation and not imposed on energy . bills. Neil Clitheroe, chief executive . officer of Scottish Power, revealed the firm's planned rise of 8.6 per . cent had triggered a furious response from customers. He told MPs: 'We immediately got customers calling us worrying about their bills after our price rise last week. 'We had 60,000 customers call us almost straight away with worries about their bills.' But during the hearing in Parliament yesterday, Labour MP John Robertson warned that 'thousands' of people were dying of hypothermia because they could not afford to pay their bills. He said customers who fell into debt were being moved onto pre-payment meters which effectively forced them to 'self-disconnect' because they could not afford to buy any credits. Labour MP Ian Lavery highlighted reports that more than three million elderly people feared that they would not be able to keep themselves warm during the winter. 'The report also said that 24,000 people could die because of the hikes in energy prices from yourcompanies. 'It is an absolute outrage that that is being allowed to happen in one of the richest economies in the world. It is an absolute abuse from the big six energy companies,' he added. Soaring profits: This graph shows how energy firms have seen their profits soar as bills go up. The wholesale energy cost has remained relatively stable . Ofgem analysis shows that the average bill stood at £1,320 this month, up £70 or 5.6 per cent on the same month last year. Wholesale energy costs – which . make up the singled biggest part of the bill - have barely changed, up . just 1.67 per cent or £10 in a year. VAT, operating and other costs make up £1,255 of the bill, up £40 or 3.29 per cent. However the biggest increase is the average net profit margin made on bills, up 111 per cent from £45 in 2012 to £95 now.

Jailed: Peter Clarke, pictured, was today sentenced to 16 years in prison at Preston Crown Court after admitting drugs and firearms offences . Police have seized a terrifying array of weapons, including machine guns, pistols, machetes and a pump-action shotgun from a violent, drug-dealing gang boss. Peter Clarke, 35, used to be a firearms instructor in the army, but turned to crime and was today jailed for 16 years on drugs and firearms offences. Preston Crown Court heard that Clarke was involved in dealing heroin, cocaine and cannabis, and was also involved in a £50million money laundering operation. And when investigators cracked down on his criminal ring, they found the huge stash of firearms locked up in a garage. Officers said they were used to 'intimidate and strike fear' into gangland rivals. The cache of weapons included a MAC-10 sub-machine gun, a Glock pistol, Luger handgun, two revolvers with silencers, stun guns, machetes a samurai sword and a sawn-off, pump-action shotgun. Investigators also uncovered 10kg of cocaine. Clarke, who pleaded guilty to drugs offences, assault, conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and possession of a firearm and ammunition, lived a life of luxury on the back of his criminal activities. He drove expensive cars, including Audi, Jaguar and BMW models, and regularly holidayed in destinations including Las Vegas, . Paris and Dubai. He . moved into a smart £400,000 detached house in the former Viking village . of Tarleton, Lancs and used his wife to help hide his ill-gotten wealth. Clarke had served in the Army, as part of the King's Regiment, until 2001 when he was convicted of a gangland murder. Scroll down for video .

He spent five years in prison for the murder of Stephen Lawlor, but was released in 2006 when the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction. But he turned to crime after he was freed, amassing an array of weapons which police said were 'available to be used if and when required in the drug dealing enterprise'. He . and his brother, who has also been jailed, made contact with drug wholesale suppliers in the . Netherlands, Spain and France and 'cleaned' their dirty money via a contact in Derby. In .

Detective Superintendent Jason Hudson, head of operations at Titan said: 'The Clarke . brothers were sophisticated and experienced criminals who would go to . great lengths to protect their drug dealing empire from both the police . and their rivals. 'Our . investigation unearthed a terrifying array of weapons, including . semi-automatic firearms, which were used to intimidate and strike fear . into the hearts of their rivals and enemies.

Clarke was able to live a luxurious life from the proceeds of his crimes . Pills: Preston Crown Court heard that Clarke's gang dealt in cocaine, cannabis and heroin . 'Their drugs will have been traded in deals that will have fuelled other violent disputes and rivalries. The users who took them may have committed further crimes to pay for their addiction.

With people increasingly using social media websites to sell all kinds of stuff, Instagram is growing in popularity as a digital marketplace for people trading in firearms. Traditionally the photo-sharing app, which was bought by Facebook last year for $1 billion, was a forum for people to show off their glamorous lifestyles but that’s changing as users realize it can be just as effective for more shady dealings. With no stated policy barring firearm sales - unlike established e-commerce site such as Ebay or Craigslist - both dealers and enthusiasts are exploiting the situation to privately buy and sell guns with next to no need for background checks, license verifications, etc. With people increasingly using social media websites to sell all kinds of stuff, Instagram is growing in popularity as a digital marketplace for people trading in firearms . A simple search on the increasingly popular photography app reveals a host of semi-anonymous dealers advertising, negotiating, and selling firearms, claims The Daily Beast. Users can easily find ‘a chrome-plated antique Colt, a custom MK12-inspired AR-15.tricked out with “all best of the best parts possible,” and an HK416D .22LR rifle’  by combing search words and hashtags, like  #rifle, #ar15 or #forsalegun, the report notes. With no federal law banning online sales and differing, loophole-ridden state laws, Instagram is providing an unregulated market that is a cause for concern for gun control advocates. ‘We are definitely concerned about the public safety implications of unregulated online gun sales, primarily the ability of sellers to skirt background checks and trafficking in firearms - both legal and illegal guns - to prohibited persons,’ Sam Hoover, an attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, told The Daily Beast. A simple search on the increasingly popular photography app reveals a host of semi-anonymous dealers advertising, negotiating, and selling firearms . In the meantime a wide array of weapons including handguns, shotguns and even assault rifles are for sale and the Instagram users selling them aren’t really doing anything that is illegal. The directness of many of the transactions is shocking. ‘LWRC 10’ SBR FOR SALE!!! Come get it! Includes AAC suppressor tip, ergo grip, 3 magpul pmags, 2 40 round mags, bungee sling, and about 500 rounds of .556. Message me if interested,’ reads one example.

With no federal law banning online sales and differing, loophole-ridden state laws, Instagram is providing an unregulated market that is sure to cause concern for gun control advocates . Negotiations over a sale often start in the comments section – free for all to see since Instagram doesn’t monitor - before the two parties take things offline to email, text message or phone call to discuss further. The law surrounding the sale of guns within the U.S. is complex and full of loopholes. The sale of guns between private persons, is largely permitted by law as long as said persons aren’t making transactions on a regular basis. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives’ (ATF) encourages both parties to finalize the sale through a licensed gun dealer who can run a background check, but it depends on the state regarding if that step is carried out. Individuals are largely permitted to freely sell guns to other private citizens within their state, but it is a crime to sell a firearm to any individual known to be prohibited from possessing such items (such as convicts, fugitives, and drug addicts). Federal law also prohibits so called 'straw purchases,' when a buyer purchases the firearm from a federal firearms license holder for somebody else - as long as it isn’t a gift.

A town hall spent £5,000 on an investigation into Jim Allan's tweets - and then decided he'd done nothing wrong . Town hall chiefs spent £5,000 on an ‘Orwellian’ investigation into a councillor’s tweets – before deciding he had done nothing wrong. The row erupted when Labour member Jim Allan used Twitter to criticise a decision by the previous Tory administration on North Tyneside council to outsource jobs to private firms. A complaint was made by a Tory councillor and an inquiry was launched into whether Mr Allan’s conduct had damaged the authority’s reputation. It is estimated that the full cost of the investigation exceeded £5,000, including wages and travel expenses. There was even a two-day hearing at the Langdale Centre in Howdon, North Tyneside. The tweets, published towards the end of 2012, related to a council decision to outsource 800 jobs to private companies Balfour Beatty and Capita Symonds. Mr Allan, who leads the Labour group that now has control of the council, said on the social networking site: ‘How could they make a decision without looking at the risks.’ He later tweeted a link to a news item about outsourcing at Barnet Council in London, saying: ‘We have already crossed the line via a Tory cabinet who did not consider the risks.’ On Wednesday, the hearing concluded that Mr Allan was not in breach of the council’s code of conduct. He said: ‘The amount of money spent on the investigation has been an absolute disgrace. ‘We are all in financial difficulty at the moment, and North Tyneside council is no different. ‘The money and time could have been spent in far better ways. ‘I have the right to freedom of speech. There was nothing nasty in what I tweeted, nothing slanderous, and nor did I refer to the council by name. ‘The whole thing was politically motivated. It has been stressful, but I am glad it is over, and the hearing ruled in my favour. ‘I am shocked they spent so much time investigating something that has not affected anybody. ‘It is beyond belief.’ It is estimated that the full cost of the investigation exceeded £5,000, including wages and travel expenses . The TaxPayers’ Alliance also criticised the expense. Campaigns chief Robert Oxley said: ‘It’s ludicrous that North Tyneside council has wasted money on an Orwellian investigation into a simple, and perfectly legitimate, tweet. ‘Councillors should be allowed to express an opinion, that’s what we elect them for after all. This appears to be a spurious complaint that should not have been allowed to consume so much council time and money.’ A spokesman for the council confirmed at least £5,000 was spent on the investigation. She added: ‘The council has an agreed procedure, in line with national guidance, that it must investigate any complaints in relation to breaches of the code of conduct by any member. ‘We received a complaint and, in view of the allegation made, agreed it was important that an independent investigation was carried out into this matter. ‘That investigation culminated in the hearing this week. After giving full consideration to the evidence, the panel decided on a majority basis that councillor Allan was not in breach of the code of conduct.’ She said the council had engaged an independent agent to conduct the investigation.","Row erupted when Labour's Jim Allan criticised decision by previous Tory administration on North Tyneside council to outsource jobs to private firms .

Charlie Paterson, 14, who died on Friday after plunging from the top of the tower block he lived in in Bow, east London . A Roman Catholic chorister has died after plunging from the top of the 19-storey tower block he lived in. Former choirboy Charlie Paterson is said to have crashed through a ceiling and onto a concrete floor after the fall from an enclosed chute next to a stairwell. Police were called to reports of an injured boy at Winford House in Bow, east London, where Charlie lived with his mother, stepfather and younger brother, at 6.30am on Friday. Paramedics carried out extensive treatment but Charlie, who turned 14 at the start of the month, was pronounced dead at 7.07am after plunging from the top floor of the tower block. A witness, who did not want to be named, said: 'I saw him on the ground. He crashed through the ceiling.' Devastated relatives and friends from Bishop Challoner Catholic School in Tower Hamlets, where Charlie was a pupil, have left floral tributes and candles at the foot of the stairwell where his body was found. A single rose believed to have been left by Charlie's mother, Emma Jewell, carried the message: 'Love you loads, always . will. Always in our hearts and thoughts. Hope you're at peace now and . happy. Sweet dreams, love Mum and Ian. A yellow football was left in tribute bearing the message: 'Love you big bro. Every goal I score will be for you. Love, hugs and kisses. Harvey.' And a bouquet of colourful flowers . carried the message: 'To our lovely grandson Charlie. We will miss you . lots. Love forever, nanny and granddad.'

China is to relax its controversial one-child policy because of concerns over slowing economic growth. Couples will be allowed to have two  children if one parent is an only child, the state news agency Xinhua reported. The policy was introduced in the late 1970s  to control the huge population, now the world’s largest at 1.4billion. Exceptions already exist. Some cities allow a second child if both parents are only children, and rural families can also try for a second if their first born is a girl. Couples who flout the rules face hefty fines, seizure of their property and loss of their jobs. Long-term: China's one-child policy has been in place for decades . But many well-off families in the . booming cities are willing to pay fines and the authorities have been . known to turn a blind eye. Although the deeply unpopular law - often . brutally enforced through forced abortions - was effective at slowing an . unsustainable birth rate, it has led to a shortage of working-age . people who can care for and fund the ageing population. Communist . leaders fear this imbalance could spark widespread social unrest and . threaten the party’s  64-year grip on power.

A former Royal Navy officer has become the 10,000th person to receive government help to start their business after banks refused to help. David Cameron today revealed Iraq and Afghanistan veteran Allen Martin will receive £10,000 towards launching his own business, just months after leaving the forces. The Prime Minister said he was determined to make money available to people with business ideas but who ‘through no fault of their own they can’t get the money to make a go of it’. Ex-Royal Navy officer Allen Martin is the latest to receive a Start-Up Loan, launched after ministers became frustrated with high street banks refusing to take risks. After being medically discharged from the forces, Mr Allen plans to launch a property management firm in Cornwall . The state-backed Start-up Loans initiative has now lent £50 million to entrepreneurs across the country, and has a target to help 30,000 new businesses with £151 million by 2015. It was launched after ministers became frustrated with high street banks refusing to take risks with entrepreneurs wanting to go it alone. Mr Martin is one of the first ex-forces personnel to benefit from the scheme, after ministers agreed to lift the age limit which meant only people aged 18 to 30 could apply. After two decades in the Navy, rising to Petty Officer, he was injured in an accident re-fuelling an aircraft and was left with chronic seborrheic dermatitis which led to a reaction with dealing with fuels and oils. Mr Marting told MailOnline: ‘I had a medical discharge so I had a short space of time to get from the military into Civilian Street. ‘I found a company called X-Forces. They helped me deal with the transition. It is a lot easier for us from the forces to get on the business ladder now.’ The former Petty Officer was injured in an accident re-fuelling an aircraft which led to a reaction when dealing with fuels and oils . After finding out that his military career was over, he says he needed to find a ‘game plan’ and ‘knew in my heart that I wanted to be my own boss’. He plans to launch Eclipse Property, a property management company in Truro where he lives with his Gayle and three children, Lauren 15, Harrison 7 and Aston 3. ‘I have spent the last two or three months planning, getting things in place. We should be ready to go in January,’ he added. He plans to use the money to set up an office and launch an advertising campaign online and through billboards to establish a foothold in a competitive market. In addition to the repayable loan, the scheme also offers a business mentor for entrepreneurs across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Ministers argue that the scheme has a positive economic benefit, even allowing for some of the businesses to fail. Mr Cameron said: ‘Start-Up Loans are helping budding entrepreneurs across our country achieve their dreams - people who have got ideas, determination and costed business plans but through no fault of their own they can’t get the money to make a go of it. ‘New businesses are the lifeblood of a healthy, expanding economy: a symbol of aspiration and a source of jobs, that’s why Start-Up Loans matter to me - and it’s why they’re a key part of my plan for Britain.’ Mr Martin had just a few weeks to adjust to life out of uniform as he planned what he would do in Civvy Street . David Cameron said he was determined to make money available to people with business ideas but who 'through no fault of their own they can¿t get the money to make a go of it' The businesses get help drawing up a business plan and preparing a pitch for the money, and after securing funding will be offered advice by mentors for several months. Business Secretary Vince Cable admitted that not all of the businesses would succeed, but it was better than people living on out-of-work benefits. He told ITV’s Daybreak: ‘Of course what we’re talking about here, about a third of the people on the scheme haven’t got a job, they would be unemployed otherwise, but they’re trying their hand at business. ‘They’re properly vetted, there are professional people vetting them, they’re given mentoring, they’re given advice, they’ve got every opportunity to launch a successful business. ‘But business is competitive, it’s risky, that’s the nature of it and some of our most successful businesspeople failed before they succeeded, so not all of them are going to succeed.’ ‘The banks have walked away from high-risk lending, it’s one of the consequences of the banking crisis. ‘The people we’re talking about here, who get these start-up loans don’t have any collateral, they don’t have any property to offer as security, so the banks won’t go anywhere near them.’","Ex-Royal Navy officer Allen Martin received £10,000 state-backed loan .

It was a daring SAS raid when just four men, led by a gallant major changed the course of World War Two by destroying desert fuel and petrol supplies. And details of the mission were revealed this week as a bravery medal received by Major Charles 'Pat' Riley, who led the party, is set to make £60,000 at auction. Major Riley, from Haltwhistle, Cumbria joined the Coldstream Guards in 1939. He went on to become one of a quartet of elite soldiers who formed the L Detachment Special Air Service Brigade in North Africa in 1941. The unit's remit was to operate behind enemy lines and sabotage and destroy German and Italian weapons, machinery, vehicles and supplies. The first raid that he led on the harbour at Bouerat al-Hsun in Libya took out 18 vitally important petrol tanker lorries and four food dumps. The operation caused major supply . problems for the enemy, commanded by Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, and . ultimately helped the British win their first battle of the war. Major Riley's medals, which are expected to make £60,000 when they go to auction on Thursday . After taking control of North Africa, the Allies went on to launch the successful invasion of Italy from there. Major Riley was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM) for the part he played in the 1942 raid. The medal is only bettered by the Victoria Cross in gallantry awards. He and three comrades paved the way for . formation of the SAS when they launched a surprise raid by going under . the wire and infiltrating the enemy position with great success. (seated far right) Sergeant Riley, in the Coldstream Guards where he began his career in the armed forces . The quartet became known as the Tobruk Four and were asked to join the SAS by legendary Colonel Sir David Stirling. In January 1942 Col Stirling identified Bouerat Harbour as an important location to supply Rommel's forces and tasked the L Detachment with blowing up enemy ships, petrol dumps and tankers. The raiding party consisted of 16 men split into two groups, with Maj Riley leading one of them. Major Riley (right) was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for the part he . played in the 1942 raid on the harbour at Bouerat al-Hsun in Libya where . he took out 18 vitally important petrol tanker lorries and four food . dumps . As they made their way to Bouerat, his men were spotted by an enemy plane and shot at, with rocks they were hiding behind being shattered into tiny pieces. After being sighted the group were subjected to bombing and strafing by more planes for several hours but escaped unscathed. Undaunted, Major Riley led his six men into Bouerat at just after midnight on January 23 and they had two hours to carry out the mission, setting the explosives for 2.30am. Their biggest feat was attaching bombs to 18 large petrol carriers that were full with tens of thousands of gallons of fuel. The DCM, along with Maj Riley's campaign medals, are now being sold for the first time and have been given a pre-sale estimate of £50,000 to £60,000. Oliver Pepys, of Spinks of London auctioneers which will sell the medals tomorrow, said: 'The SAS today is synonymous with bravery and gallantry and the likes of Pat Riley personifies that traits. 'Pat Riley was one of the founder members of the SAS and his gallantry in North Africa set the tone for the conduct of the regiment today. Major Riley left the army in 1945 and joined Cambridgeshire police but found it too sedate and volunteered as a Captain with the Malayan Regiment. He was based in the Far East until 1955. After leaving the army again, he ran the Dolphin Hotel pub in Colchester, Essex, and then retired to Hastings, East Sussex in 1980. His wife, Kaye, died in 1996 and he passed away in 1999 aged 84. Captain Riley, in his role in the Malayan Regiment after World War Two . At 2.30am, while the raiding party made their escape, the desert sky lit up from the explosions. As they sped off into the night in a truck they were ambushed by four Italian guards who peppered the vehicle with machine gun fire at point-blank range. The truck driver ploughed through the bullets and mowed down the guards in the process. Major Riley's recommendation for the DCM was published in the London Gazette in November 1942. It read: 'By skilled and daring leadership he succeeded in bluffing the enemy sentries. 'Thereby he avoided giving any alarm which would have interfered with the work of other parties operating in the same area. 'He has shown the greatest gallantry and the highest qualities of leadership.'","Major Charles 'Pat' Riley led 'Tobruk Four' in daring desert raid .

Serial killer Joseph Paul Franklin was granted a stay of execution Tuesday only hours before he was set to die of lethal injection in a Missouri jail. Mr Franklin, 63, and his legal team were able to successfully argue the state was at risk of violating the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment by using pentobarbital as an execution drug. The drug is slowly starting to replace previously used lethal injection cocktails because drug manufacturers will no longer provide them to US prisons. Through the years: Joseph Paul Franklin as seen in a series of booking photos from 2005 to 2012 . The Neo-Nazi who claims he tried to start a race war in the late 1970s was scheduled to die at 12.01am Wednesday morning will instead likely be sleeping inside his cell only days after confessing to killing 17 more people than previously confirmed. The state had originally planned to use propofol, the same drug that killed Michael Jackson from an overdose, but recent shortages forced officials to find an alternative. A judge ruled Tuesday afternoon that a lawsuit filed on behalf of Mr Franklin and 20 other Missouri inmates on death row contending arguing the dangers of propofol must be resolved before anyone can be executed. Lawyers for the serial killer have argued the drug can cause contamination and pain above and beyond thresholds allowed by the Eight Amendment - which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. The judge agreed, writing that the state 'has not provided any information about the certification, inspection history, infraction history, or other aspects of the compounding pharmacy or of the person compounding the drug.' A separate ruling from another judge called Mr Franklin's mental capacity into question, and said his mental illness should be reviewed before he is put to death. His mental state is such that he wasn't even aware he was on death row. 'He was happy,' his attorney told the St Louis Tribune. 'I’m not really convinced that he totally understands that he was going to die.' The state appealed the appeals court ruling as it relates to the use of pentobarbital, reported the Tribune. It is not clear if the ruling regarding Mr Franklin's mental state will also be appealed. Tools of hate: This grab from CNN shows the rifle and guitar case carried by the notorious serial killer . Mentally detached: Mr Franklin's lawyer says he was likely unaware he was on death row . Mr Franklin earlier this week confirmed to CNN he was responsible for . the cold-blooded execution-style deaths of 'approximately' 22 people. He was devoid of emotion as he attempted to justify his killings - . which famously included an attempt on the life of Hustler porn supremo . Larry Flynt - who incredibly tried to stop his shooters execution. Following his 1980 arrest, Mr Franklin told detectives that he selected the St Louis synagogue from the Yellow Pages of the telephone directory because he wanted to 'find a Jew and kill him,' according to reports. The white supremacist was also convicted in the 1977 killing of an interracial couple in Madison, Wisconsin, as well as in the 1980 shooting deaths of two black joggers in Salt Lake City. Mr Franklin's other convictions include the murders of a two teenage black boys and the bombing a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1977. 'I felt like I was at war. The survival of the white race was at stake,' he told Kyung Lah of CNN in an interview that was to be his last before being executed. 'I consider it my mission, my three-year mission. Same length of time Jesus was on his mission, from the time he was 30 to 33.' Death row: Joseph Paul Franklin is scheduled to . die by lethal injection at 12.01am on Wednesday for the sniper killing . of 42-year-old Gerald Gordon outside a suburban St. Louis synagogue in . 1977 . Investigators believe his cross-country crime spree was fueled by a hatred of blacks and Jews. Mr Franklin confessed collared in 1980 after the Salt Lake City killings. Among his alleged crimes were two high-profile shootings — of civil rights leader Vernon Jordan in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1980, and the man he calls his 'old pal' - porn mogul Larry Flynt, in Lawrenceville, Georgia, in 1978. Both men survived. Mr Franklin told CNN he believed he was going to start a race war and that his preferred method to kill his victims was to stalk them and set up a sniper's nest from which he pick them off using a high-powered rifle. Seemingly still in denial, Mr Franklin tried to blame his rough childhood on his three-year orgy of violence. Offending magazine: These are the front covers from the 1975 edition of Hustler magazine that enraged Joseph Paul Franklin . 'My momma didn't care about us,' he said, as he complained he wasn't fed properly and not allowed to play with other children. Finding another family in the white supremacist groups in the American South in the 1960s, Mr Franklin felt he found his calling after reading Adolf Hitler's political manifesto 'Mein Kampf'. 'I've never felt that way about any other book that I read,' he said, 'it was something weird about that book.' At 26, he changed his name to Joseph Paul Franklin to honor Nazi propaganda minister Paul Joseph Goebbels and founding father Benjamin Franklin. He even attempted to link himself to infamous serial killer Charles Manson by having the words 'Helter Skelter' tattooed on his arm in reference to |Mr Manson's inspiration provided by The Beatles 'White Album'. The tattoo artist rebuffed the attempt, the tattoo never came. Mr Franklin explained that he hoped his early murders would set an example to other would-be soldiers in his one-man war on minorities. Hatred: . The neo-nazi has also been convicted of killing an interracial couple . in Madison, Wisconsin in 1977, two black joggers in Salt Lake City in . 1980 and bombing a synagogue in Chattanooga, Tennessee in 1977 . 'I figured once I started doing it and showed them how, other white supremacists would do the same thing.' Mr Franklin then shockingly claimed minorities he once targeted now have a kinship with him. 'When you commit a crime against a certain group of people, a bonding takes place. It seems like you belong to them,' he said. In addition to the murder of Mr Gordon outside a bar mitzvah, Mr Franklin was convicted of killing Alphonse Manning and Toni Schwean in Madison, Wisconsin, because they were an interracial couple. He also confessed to shooting dead college student Rebecca Bergstrom, after she told him in passing that she dated a Jamaican man. His most shocking murder was that of 13-year-old Dante Evans and his cousin 14-year-old Darrell Lane in Cincinnati -  two African Americans jogging with white female friends. Joseph Deters, who prosecuted that Cincinnati case said, 'He's just a creep. There's no other way to describe him. And what he did to those two kids because of the color of their skin is incomprehensible.' Victim: Larry Flynt says he doesn't to see the man who shot him put to death . Hustler chief Flynt was standing trial on an obscenity charge in Georgia in 1978 when he was wounded by a sniper's bullet. No one was arrested at the time, but the shooting has since been linked to Mr Franklin. Gwinnett County, Ga., District Attorney Danny Porter said he is convinced Franklin shot Flynt because Franklin provided information only the shooter would know — details about the shooting location, the type of weapon used, even the maker of the gun. The details were divulged while the killer served time in the 1990s in a Georgia prison. Mr Franklin said he shot the pornographer because of a magazine front cover showing an interracial couple. 'I saw that interracial couple he had, photographed there, having sex,' he told CNN, referring to the December 1975 issue of Hustler . 'It just made me sick. I think whites marry with whites, blacks with blacks, Indians with Indians. Orientals with orientals. I threw the magazine down and thought, I'm gonna kill that guy.' However, Mr Porter said he opted against filing charges because Franklin had already been convicted of multiple killings and said it didn't make sense to bring him back to Georgia to face trial for shooting Mr Flynt. Incredibly, the Hustler founder has become an unlikely supporter of Franklin's - in so much as he doesn't want him to face the death penalty. Mr Flynt would rather his shooter rot away in a prison cell. 'The government has no business at all being in the business of killing people,' said Flynt. '(It's) much more punishment to put somebody in prison for the rest of their lives than it is to snip their life out in a few seconds with a lethal injection.' Mr Flynt's sadistic hopes have been kept alive for the time being.","Joseph Paul Franklin admitted to killing 22 people across multiple states between 1977 and 1980 .

Loss: Thomas Pizzey from Banbury, Oxfordshire, pictured before he was disabled, died after he was flung from a car that was hit by a train . A wheelchair-bound pensioner was killed when a train slammed into a car he was in that had cut out on a railway level crossing, a coroner has been told. The vehicle, which contained 85-year-old Thomas Pizzey, who was sat in his wheelchair inside the vehicle, stalled and broke down as it was being driven over the crossing. Mr Pizzey, of Banbury, Oxfordshire, died instantly when he was flung from the car and his wheelchair as the train passed through the level crossing and smashed into the car. Seconds earlier driver Malcolm Kimberley had stalled as he drove across the tracks before the barriers were activated. He frantically tried to restart the car as the barrier closed while the train bearing down on them. Motorists from another car scrambled to help the stricken driver and his disabled passenger in the 'nightmare' scenario, the inquest in Oxford heard. However, the car would not start and the train had no time to stop, leading to the fatal crash. Mr Pizzey, aged 85 years, was in the back of the Kangoo car being driven by his civil partner Mr Kimberley. Oxford deputy coroner Alison Thompson heard how the 78-year-old drove onto the line in Sandy Lane, Yarnton, Oxfordshire, on January 3 this year, when the engine cut out. After trying a number of times to restart the car nearby motorists Stephen McDermott and partner Louise Poulter rushed to the 'panicking' driver who was still trying to start the car as it was hit. Mr Kimberley survived the impact but suffered serious injuries as a result of the collision. Investigating officer Detective Constable Nicola Wood told the inquest the driver of the train, which was travelling from Manchester to Southampton, braked and sounded the horn on approach. Terror: The car drove onto the line in Sandy Lane, Yarnton, Oxfordshire, on January 3 this year, when the engine cut out . 'As the driver accelerated to come across the crossing the car stalled and the engine stopped,' she said. 'He tried to start the car a number of times but with no success.' She told the inquest Mr Kimberley had . previously reported to a garage that the car had once failed to start . but it passed an MoT test in March last year. Thames . Valley Police vehicle examiner Philip Balderstone said the extent of . damage to the car meant tests were inconclusive but the 'most probable' reason was a failure of its engine management system. Britain's 500 most dangerous level crossings are to be shut after nine were killed and hundreds narrowly avoided death in the past year alone. There are 7,000 in the UK and for years there has been growing pressure to act following a spate of deaths. Almost £110million has been set aside for the purge, which will also pay for new bridges, underpasses, gates and signs to make the thousands of others across the UK safer. This has been spearheaded by the parents of Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and her friend Charlotte Thompson, 13, who died when they were hit by a train in 2005 as they crossed the tracks at Elsenham station footpath crossing in Essex. Network Rail section supervisor Jon Waddy said the crossing’s barriers were operated automatically by track circuits which detected approaching trains. These give a minimum of 27 seconds from the barriers coming down until a train passes through. The pensioner’s car was hit after 45 seconds . 'If somebody had picked up the phone immediately and said ‘stop’ it may well have been still too late', Mr Waddy added. Recording a verdict of accidental death, Mrs Thompson said Mr Pizzey’s wheelchair was not totally secured into the back of the car. He was wearing a seatbelt and the wheelchair winch mechanism was attached but two other tether points were not. He died from impact injuries sustained when he struck the ground. She said of the 'nightmare scenario': 'The horror of being there and not being able to start the car does not bear thinking about. 'Had the wheelchair been tethered properly it is more likely he would have remained in the vehicle and he would have suffered less severe injuries.' She also concluded there 'was a problem with the engine management system' but added that 'we can’t take it further than that'. Two nieces who attended the inquest said the family felt 'very sorry' for the train driver who they did not hold responsible in any way for the collision. “This was a very tragic way for my uncle to die and the family are sad that his long life ended in this way”, they said. *Just 10 days ago a woman aged in her 40s had to be cut free from her Volkswagen car after being struck by a train at the same crossing. She suffered non-life threatening injuries and was detained under the Mental Health Act.","Thomas Pizzey, 85, died when he was thrown from the car in his wheelchair .

An electrician who died while repairing a faulty microwave at a Marks & Spencer store had not unplugged the device, an inquest heard this week. Grandfather-of-seven Philip Dodd was called to the store in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on November 3 last year to fix the microwave in the staff canteen. But when the 62-year-old, of Horley, Surrey, went to fix the microwave he did not unplug it from the mains, the inquest heard on Thursday. The Marks & Spencer store in Royal Tunbridge Wells where Philip Dodd suffered the electric shock . The court heard how Mr Dodd suffered as fatal electric shock as he tried to fix the microwave when he accidentally touched an uninsulated controller to a magnetron in the microwave. Staff at the store said they came to Mr Dodd’s aid after hearing a ‘terrific crash’ in kitchen - finding him dead on the floor and the microwave plugged in. Tunbridge Wells Borough Council environmental health officer John Broughton told jurors: 'It appears he was electrocuted when he inadvertently touched a live conductor to the magnetron he was trying to repair. 'The machine should have been disconnected from the power supply before he attempted that.' The inquest heard how Mr Dodd was working for engineer providers Millers Vanguard, part of the AFE group, and had been an electrician for 28 years. AFE chief executive Tim Smith said: “The company’s procedure states that microwaves should not be worked on live and our training mantra of the three D’s - disconnect from main supply, discharge and open the doors - had unfortunately not been complied with.” A jury returned a verdict of accidental death and coroner Roger Hatch expressed his sympathies to Mr Dodd’s family. The Kent & Sussex Courier reported that shocked staff who were 'directly affected' by the incident were given as much time off as they needed by Marks & Spencer.

Listeners to the BBC's flagship news programme Today are used to a sober diet of political interviews, thoughts for the day and the shipping forecast. But this morning fans of the programme accused presenters of 'sinking to a new low' after Sarah Montague and John Humphrys began quizzing each other about their favourite music and most embarrassing moments. During an item on good music to listen to in the morning, Humphrys, referred to by BBC Radio 6 host Shaun Keaveny as 'The Humph', told a story about meeting Ella Fitzgerald and said it was his 'second greatest humiliation'. Montague quizzed him on what his greatest humiliation might have been, suggesting it was to do with his getting a tattoo, but Humphrys refused to be drawn, and when he told Montague it was time to move on to the next segment, she replied 'Sod the timings'. 'Like drunk colleagues': Today presenters John Humphrys and Sarah Montague bantered on air this morning . 'Is this Daybreak?' Radio 4 listeners took to Twitter to express their surprise as the presenters joked . Fans of the show took to Twitter to express their surprise at the show's diversion from its usual sobriety, with one suggesting it was more like breakfast television, while another wrote: 'Has someone lost the script?' The banter, which Twitter user JD Penelope likened to 'a drunk conversation between colleagues', began after a discussion over which music was most suitable to play on early morning radio, if any. Radio 6 breakfast show host Shaun Keaveny said he liked to play motown or funk, but said he understood 'the Humph's' disdain for music too early. Humphrys went on to say he enjoyed listening to jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald, and told how he met her in Cardiff as a teenage journalist and provoked her ire by smashing a mirror in her dressing room. He said: 'She erupted.  This huge mountain of a woman said ""Get that kid out of here"". 'I was 16....It was the greatest humiliation, no, the second-greatest humiliation of my life.' Montague, who also referred to the veteran broadcaster as 'the Humph', then interrupted to ask: 'What is the greatest humiliation of your life, Mr Humphrys?'. But the 70-year-old refused to say, urging his colleague instead to hurry to the weather report. 'Awkward': While some listeners enjoying hearing the presenters' japes, not all were convinced . Montague goaded him: 'It was something that went wrong with your tattoo, wasn't it?', to which Humphrys replied: 'Ooh, you heard about that?'. He then pressed his colleague on her musical preferences, saying: 'Your favourite songs, go, quick,' to which Montague, who has a biology degree from the University of Bristol, retorted: '""Quick""?  God no, go away'. Listeners surprised by the change in tone wrote on Twitter: 'Is this Daybreak?', while others wanted to know what the presenter's greatest embarrassment was. However Humphrys was not to be drawn, and requests from MailOnline to discuss it, and his rumoured tattoo, went unanswered. Earlier this week the 75-year-old presenter of BBC's Question Time, David Dimbleby, was shown getting a scorpion tattooed onto his shoulder. The presenter, who has anchored every the BBC's general election coverage since 1979, said he chose a scorpion to fulfil a long-held secret ambition because his star sign was Scorpio.","BBC Today programme's music interview descends into farce this morning .

Network Rail is to plead guilty on Tuesday in a criminal prosecution brought against it over the tragic death of two teenage girls at an unmanned level crossing, rail bosses told the father of one of the victims last night. Best friends Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte Thompson, 13, were killed after being hit by a train at the level crossing in the Essex village of Elsenham as they went Christmas shopping in December 2005. Rail watchdogs launched a criminal prosecution against Network Rail in November. Network Rail could face fines of up to £1million. Any conviction could also have implications for thousands of rail crossings across the country. Rail deaths: Teenagers Charlotte Thompson (left) and Olivia Bazlinton were hit and killed by a train at Elsenham Station in Essex in 2005 . Olivia’s father Chris Bazlinton said last night: ‘Network Rail have told us they will be pleading guilty this Tuesday 31 January 2012 to criminal charges brought by the Office of Rail Regulation in November 2011’. He added:’The case will be heard at Basildon Magistrates Court probably in front of a district judge who will pass it on to the Crown Court for sentencing this spring/early summer.  This is unlikely to be the end of the matter as there are still many unanswered questions which we will be pursuing.’ Mr Bazlinton added that rail crossing safety was still a big issue: ‘Sadly, yesterday a 15 year old girl died on a crossing in Bishops Stortford about three miles south of Elsenham - there was a previous death there ten years ago.’ The prosecution over the deaths on the Liverpool Street to Cambridge line is being brought by the Office for Rail Regulation under Health and Safety legislation and follows a row over an alleged cover-up concerning risk assessment reports into the crossing. The families of the two girls believe Network Rail deliberately suppressed a risk assessment report into the crossing carried out three and a half years before the accident. This had recommended that the pedestrian gates be locked when trains approach. The deaths of Olivia and Charlotte sparked a huge safety controversy over thousands of railway crossings. The pedestrian crossing at Elsenham had ‘wicket’ gates which, unlike the road crossing gates, were never locked as trains approached. Community in distress: The Network Rail-owned station, with flowers and a banner, after the accident in December 2005 . On December 3, 2005, the girls used Elsenham station footpath crossing - owned and operated by Network Rail - to reach the station platform. The teenagers had been to the ticket office and were dashing it catch their train before it left. The station's footpath crossing was fitted with warning lights and ‘yodel’ alarms. A London to Cambridge train passed over the crossing with the red lights and yodel alarm sounding - a warning for foot passengers not to cross the footpath crossing. After the train passed, the lights remained on and the alarms continued to sound as another train, travelling to Stansted airport in Essex, was going to pass through the station. article-Safety questions: The level crossing had a wooden gate that the girls were able to open when they wrongly thought all trains had passed . Opening a pedestrian gate, they walked into the path of the 7.24am express from Birmingham New Street to Stansted and died instantly. Olivia had celebrated her 14th birthday just days before the accident. She and Charlotte, from Thaxted, both attended Newport Free Grammar School. They were described by friends as ‘lovely, lively girls.’ The father of Olivia - known to her family as Liv and who would have been celebrating her 20th birthday next Monday - welcomed the action by the Office of Rail Regulation. Chris Bazlinton said: ‘I’m very happy the prosecution will be going ahead. ‘They have discussed it with us and told us what they are planning.’ He said it was right that people ‘will be brought to account’ adding: ‘We never felt that we had heard the whole story. Back in 2006, when the various inquiries were held, there seemed to be unanswered questions, and we were very disappointed with the inquest, at which Network Rail’s lawyers squashed discussion on rail safety. ‘We are pleased that ORR has decided to take action. None of this will bring back Liv or Charlie but, hopefully, other families will not have to go through what we have.’ The rail regulator said Network Rail two charges under the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 and one charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 adding: ‘These result from Network Rail’s failure to carry out proper assessments of the risks to the safety of members of the public using the footpath crossing or to have in place adequate arrangements to underpin these assessments.’ The rail regulator re-opened its investigation into the deaths of the two teenage girls in February when new evidence – in the form of a previously unseen document - emerged about Network Rail’s risk assessments into the gates. The company has denied suppressing the document. But it was never seen by the girls’ families, the coroner who investigated the deaths, the rail regulator or government inspectors from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch. Campaign: Olivia's father Chris Bazlington said he's been told Network Rail will admit criminal charges . The risk assessment only came to light after the settlement in January of a civil case against Network Rail. The company did not mount a defence and settled with the families out of court. Mr Bazlinton said at the time: ‘We are very glad that Network Rail is now being prosecuted. What is appalling is that key information was withheld not just from us but from the coroner and the rail regulator. ‘Network Rail’s risk assessment strategy was appalling. It failed them. It failed the public, it failed us, it failed Olivia and Charlotte. They behaved appallingly and they lied. It is right there should be retribution.’ In August 2006 Network Rail reversed its opposition to locking the gates. A Rail Accident Investigation Branch report in December described the risk assessment, carried out by Network Rail in April 2005 before the accident, as ‘substantially flawed’. It recommended locking the pedestrian gates at Elsenham and for a footbridge to be built. An inquest held in January 2007 recorded a verdict of accidental death. In late 2008 Olivia’s mother, Tina Hughes, launched a civil case against Network Rail on behalf of herself and her first daughter Stephanie Bazlinton, now 22, alongside a similar case by Charlotte’s father Reg Thompson on behalf of his family. Network Rail did not submit any evidence in its defence and an out-of-court settlement was agreed in November 2010. The maximum payment for a fatality is £10,000 plus expenses which in the case of a child is limited to the cost of the funeral. ORR's railway safety director Ian Prosser said at the time of the prosecution in November: ‘After careful consideration and examination of Network Rail documents not previously seen by ORR, we have concluded that there is enough evidence, and that it is in the public interest, to bring criminal proceedings against Network Rail for serious breaches of health and safety law which led to the deaths of Olivia Bazlinton and Charlotte Thompson at Elsenham station footpath crossing in December 2005. ‘Legal papers have been lodged at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court today.’ Mr Prosser added: ‘My thoughts are with the families of Olivia and Charlotte. ORR will do everything it can to ensure that the prosecution proceeds as quickly as possible.’ Network Rail chief executive David Higgins said in November: ‘This was a deeply tragic event. Since this accident in 2005 we have launched a major programme to update the assessments of all our 7,000 level crossings, improving risk management and safety, and we have closed over 500 crossings since 2009.’","Olivia Bazlington and Charlotte Thompson died at level crossing in Elsenham, Essex, in 2005 .

A drug-crazed thief was Tasered after he threatened to hack off a police dog's head with garden shears, in an incident captured on CCTV. Jamie Swann, 28, was filmed jumping the fence of terrified neighbour Jane Green, 59, and then attacking her car with the bladed tool in the middle of the night. The maniac then wildly waved the 2ft long garden implement around his head and violently smashing up the Ford B-Max, before police shot him. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Danger: This is the terrifying moment a drug-crazed criminal threatened to hack off a police dog's head with some shears as he stands on his neighbour's car . Punishment: An armed officer Tasers the maniac, which sends his garden shears flying through the air (centre) as electricity is pumped through him . Rush: Police then flooded into the property and detain him after an incident that has put him in jail . Brave: Grandmother Jane Green runs from the cover of her house to open her gate for police while the criminal climbs a fence behind her . The disabled grandmother-of-four can then be seen leaving her Nottinghamshire home in her dressing gown to allow police onto her property. She then ran back into her house in Clifton and locked herself in to watch the tense 10 minute stand-off with officers that followed on her CCTV monitor. Swann, wearing a white t-shirt and blue trousers, is seen ranting at police - even putting the shears around his own neck and threatening to chop his head off. At one point the raging thug viciously snaps the weapon at a police dog as he stands on top of Jane's car screaming at officers. He can be seen finally being stopped in his tracks after being tasered with the 5,000 volt stun gun, which sends him crashing down on the roof of the vehicle. Sequence; Mrs Green can be seen on her own CCTV camera opening her gate for officers because she spotted Swann stealing copper from her home . Damage: He then climbs on to her car and begins attacking it as the authorities arrive at the scene . Danger: Waving the shears, and even holding it round his own throat, her screams at police and ambulance workers . Eight officers then swarm the garden to arrest Swann as he convulses on the ground as a result of the electric shock. On Tuesday Swann was jailed at Nottingham Crown Court after pleading guilty to criminal damage and using threatening words to cause alarm or distress. He was imprisoned for 22-months, four-months for the incident and a further 18-months for breaching a suspended sentence for theft, burglary and theft of a motor vehicle . Today Mrs Green described the terrifying moment she spotted Swann on her CCTV monitors after hearing him climbing on her roof at 2am on October 14. 'I came downstairs to switch on the security lights and called 999. He was stealing my copper piping,' the retired medical secretary said: . 'My front gate was locked and I didn't want to be locked in with him so I ran past him to unlock it for the police. 'I don't know how I did it - it must have been adrenaline - I thought 'you're not going to get away with this'. 'I then ran back inside and locked the door and watched him on my CCTV monitor. Under control: Having refused to leave the car or drop his weapon a Nottinghamshire police officer then takes aim with his Taser . Hurt: The flash of electricity can be seen from the Taser as the thug falls down after being shot . 'He was definitely on drugs and when the police came in he tried to hack their dog with the shears - he was threatening to behead the dog. Living in fear: Jane Green says the 'The whole ordeal has left me a nervous wreck and badly out of pocket' 'Once he was tasered, the dog dragged him off to the side. 'I thought he was trying to break into my house. 'I was terrified - afterwards I did not sleep for weeks and I still struggle now. 'I feel like moving house - it has petrified me and I am a prisoner in my home because I don't dare go out. 'The man was totally unknown to me and he was shouting about guns and waiving around my garden shears which he picked up. 'The whole thing was a nightmare and I can't remember ever being so frightened in my life.' Swann caused £920 damage to Jane's mobility car and car-port but no penalty charge was imposed by the court. The mother-of-two, who suffers from fibromyalgia - a disorder of the nervous system that leaves sufferers in chronic pain - added: 'I have paid for a new roof, windscreen, bonnet and car port. 'He also ripped all the copper piping off the side of my house, which I have also had to replace. 'I have not got any compensation because he was not ordered to pay any - its disgusting. 'The whole ordeal has left me a nervous wreck and badly out of pocket.' Crime scene: Mrs Green where she and police confronted a maniac armed with a pair of shears in her front garden . A Nottinghamshire Police spokesman said: 'While we appreciate how unnerving this incident was for the person at this address, thankfully random attacks on property are rare. 'This offender is now in prison so we hope that this sends a message that intimidating behaviour and causing damage to someone's property will not be tolerated.'","Jamie Swann, 28, filmed threatening to cut off a police dog's head .

George Zimmerman's now-estranged girlfriend claims the guy she once called 'Georgie' spiraled into a deep depression after his acquittal in the Trayvon Martin case and has tried to kill himself multiple times, once putting a gun in his mouth and threatening to pull the trigger. Samantha Scheibe was spotted leaving her Florida home Wednesday with an armed escort and under a towel, two days after the couple's violent argument, which saw Zimmerman ordered to stay 1,500 feet away from her at all times and hand over his array of guns. But a revealing series of text messages and phone calls leading up to the blonde's frantic 911 call has painted a clearer picture of their volatile relationship and Zimmerman's life post-trial.

After Shellie filed for divorce, Zimmerman moved into Scheibe's Seminole County home but their relationship soon fell apart because of his depression. In late October, she demanded he get professional help but she said this made him angry and he moved all her furniture, clothes and food out of her home. 'She's scared is the bottom line,' Scheibe's mother, Mason, wrote in a text message to ClickOrlando.

Scheibe described how he spent days in bed, refusing to get up. One day she found him passed out with an empty bottle of sleeping pills on his sidetable. She claims he overdosed and she wasn't able to revive him but noticed he was still breathing. When he did wake, she said he started crying and then put a gun inside his mouth, telling her he was ready to end it all. She said she talked him out of killing himself.

'You have ruined my life forever, do you realize that?' the teenager asked. 'Now I will have to live my life without a mom.' The driver: 36-year-old John David Coe had twice the legal amount of alcohol in his system when he caused the Nevil family's car to crash around last Thanksgiving . 'Maybe he [God] one day will forgive you, and you can go to heaven, where you forced my mom to be today. May God show you the right path to lead you on,' Lauren added. Last November 16, Mrs Nevil, her husband Steve, and their son Will and daughter Lauren were driving from their home in Franklin, Tennessee to spend Thanksgiving with family in Texas. Originally they planned to spend the night in Texarcana, but changed their minds and decided to drive straight through to Texas. On a dark stretch of Interstate 30 near Hope, Arkansas, Coe came barreling down the road and hit the Nevil's car, hurling it off the road. At the time, Coe had more than twice the legal limit of alcohol in his system while driving his daughters Gracie, 9, and Chloe, 12. After the crash and her mother's death, Lauren spent 161 days in the hospital recovering from her very serious injuries. She suffered a broken femur, collapsed lung, three broken ribs, a mutilated right foot and a traumatic brain injury.

They may look more like Wall-E than the raging humanoid robots in 'I, Robot', but these thespian actors are certainly causing a stir. RoboThespian is the creation of Cornish engineer Will Jackson who had an idea to develop an artistic robot that could react with its audiences. Six years ago he embarked on a project to create a robot that would save tour guides from tediously repeating the same script each day. Today, around 35 RoboThespians are delighting theatre-goers and tourists throughout the world. Scroll down for video . A nearly completed RoboThespian robot inside the Engineered Arts workshop is tested. The Cornish company, operating from an industrial unit near Falmouth, is the world's only maker of commercially available life sized humanoid robots . Engineered Arts design and production engineer Marcus Hold works on a nearly completed RoboThespian robot. Now in its third generation, the fully interactive and multilingual RoboThespian robot is sold around the world to science centres and visitor attractions, but increasingly to academic research groups and universities where they are used as research and development platforms . They are also trained to recognise gestures such as waving goodbye and are able to copy body poses. They are multi-lingual and can even sing. But not everyone is pleased with the humanoid robots. Jackson told Humans Invent how one RoboThespian was punched by someone in Germany. In a separate event Jackson describes how ‘a guy took offence because he thought the robot had looked at his girlfriend’s tits basically and tried to attack it. ‘They said the robot always had a habit of looking low which caused this problem. It never made eye contact, it always looked at people’s mid body’. RoboThespians have in-built cameras, depth perception and facial recognition allowing them to react and adapt their script accordingly. They are also trained to recognise gestures such as waving goodbye and are able to copy body poses . RoboThespian's actions are based on a piece of software called SHORE developed in Germany. This allows them to compare faces to a large database to extract where somebody is, whether they are male or female, their age and whether they are happy or angry, neutral or disinterested . Jackson’s company, Cornish-based Engineered Arts, is the world's only maker of commercially available life sized humanoid robots. It produces the parts from an industrial unit near Falmouth with one robot costing around £55,000. They can also be rented out for a day or leased for a year. Their movements are based on a piece of software called SHORE developed in Germany. This allows them to compare faces to a large database to extract where somebody is, whether they are male or female, their age and whether they are happy or angry, neutral or disinterested. Now in its third generation, it’s not just theatres, science centres and visitor attractions, that are benefiting from the talents of RoboThespian. RoboThespians recently reached new artistic heights by appearing in a live stage show, the Legend of Robotland: Tria's Star, featuring a completely robotic cast . Mammal-like robots with whiskered . touch systems, machines powered by slime and dancing humanoids that can . communicate with humans are just a few of the robots invading the . Science Museum today. The International Living Machines conference is including robots that move and sense like animals, biohybrid exhibits . that mix biological and artificial parts. The conference is . concerned with the development of future technologies using the . principles underlying living systems and the flow of communication . signals between living and artificial systems. Professor Tony Prescott from the . University of Sheffield’s Department of Psychology said: 'These . technologies will have a profound effect on many different aspects of . our future lives, posing important ethical questions and practical . concerns that this event gives us chance to address.' The company claims that increasingly academic research groups and universities are using the robots in their research and development platforms. The application programming interface (API) is open, which means anyone can extend the software with software of their own. A restaurant in Seoul, where robots cook all the food and robots take your order, is also using RoboThespians as part of its operations. Meanwhile, three RoboThespians recently reached new artistic heights by appearing in a live stage show, the Legend of Robotland: Tria’s Star, featuring a completely robotic cast. And TV viewers saw RoboThespian and his glamorous assistant, Marcus, take part in the Ben Earl: Trick Artist show on Channel 4 last month. The theme of the episode was Science and the object of the trick was to see if a humanoid robot, with a sensor and camera could be fooled by sleight of hand. ‘If you walk past it, it looks at you and it will try and work out what you are doing,’ explained creator Will Jackson in an interview with Humans Invent. ‘It can see 14 to 15 people standing around and it will flick its gaze and attention between them. It is designed to be as natural in its behaviour as possible. ‘Also, from a technical point of view, it’s a hybrid robot, so it is partly pneumatic and partly electric. Most robots are one or the other and generally they are all electric.’ The group is now embarking on a two year project to make a full walking, running, jumping version. It is also developing a smaller half-body robot which has got a projected face, called Sociobot, which will be designed for the retail environment.

Sadia Abdinur, 35, has been shunned by her friends and neighbours because they are convinced she has been possessed by the Devil. The mother-of-two contracted elephantiasis and, as a result, is immobile and unable to feed her children. Sadia Abdinur, 35, was shunned by her friends and neighbours in Somalia because they became convinced she had been possessed by the Devil when she contracted elephantiasis . Ayan, nine, and Ayub, seven, are now forced to wander the streets begging for scraps to keep their family alive. The children even hug their mother goodbye each night believing she will be dead in the morning. But now, Ms Abdinur has been given hope by a British surgeon who has offered to carry out life-saving surgery free of charge. A charity is trying to raise funds to fly Ms Abdinur to the UK so top vascular surgeon Professor Nigel Standfield can perform the 10 hour operation. Surgeons in Nairobi, Kenya, refused to treat her because they do not have the expertise or facilities, but without treatment it is likely she will die prematurely if an infection occurs. Ms Abdinur, whose first husband was shot dead in front of her by bandits, said: ‘Please save my life. I have been abandoned and the world is not within my reach.’ In 2006, Ms Abdinur became ill after picking up an infection. Slowly her left leg began to swell and she now has severe lymphedema caused by ‘elephantiasis parasitic infection’. The UK-based Alhidaya Charity found . her abandoned and destitute after she was cast out by her community and . decided to act to help her. They are now battling to get visas and passports so Ms Abdinur can be flown to the UK. Professor . Nigel Standfield, head of the London Postgraduate School of Surgery and . Professor of Vascular Surgery and Surgical Education at Imperial . College Healthcare NHS Trust, has even offered to waive his fees to save . her. He said: ‘This . very unfortunate lady has elephantiasis which is a neglected tropical . disease and is a type of acquired lymphoedema caused by the lymphatics - . which drain fluid from the tissues - becoming blocked by a parasitic . worm. Her children have to beg for food on the streets as she is immobile so is unable to feed them. Without treatment she will probably contract a fatal infection . ‘At this very . late stage the tissues of the leg are fibrotic, scarred and far beyond . treatment of the worm itself, which is now dead. ‘I . am an acknowledged expert in the management of lymphoedema and this is . one of the most extreme cases I have seen. This lady must be virtually . immobile. Elephantiasis' medical name is lymphatic filariasis. It is a tropical disease that occurs when parasites are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The . parasites are deposited on a person's skin from where they enter the . body and migrate to the lymphatic vessels where they develop into adult . worms. The infection usually occurs in childhood but the disfiguring effects are not often seen until adulthood. It can cause permanent disability. The . majority of people who are infected by the parasite do not develop any . symptoms but in acute cases elephantiasis can develop. The . swelling is usually the result of a bacterial skin infection after . normal immune defences have been partially lost due to lymphatic damage. The . parasites can be cleared from the body with drug treatment but if . elephantiasis has developed, complex surgery can be required. Source: World Health Organisation . ‘The operation to treat her is very complex and will take possibly eight to 10 hours. ‘It requires the most sophisticated management of blood and fluid loss and I respect the surgeons in Kenya for saying that they are unable to treat her. ‘Without treatment she will die prematurely of overwhelming infection if cellulitis occurs. ‘Eventually she will become completely . immobile. Because this involves the whole length of her leg up to the . groin, amputation is not an option and would not be possible. ‘Excision with reconstruction and skin-grafting are required if anything is to be done to help this lady.’ The charity needs to raise at least £30,000 to fly Ms Abdinur to the UK, book a theatre and cover private care after the operation. Shugri Hussein, trustee of Ahidaya International UK, has written to David Cameron and the Queen in a desperate bid to raise awareness. He said: ‘If Sadia doesn't get help soon she will die. Every day her life is becoming more and more difficult.’ ‘On top of her depilating condition, she's ostracised in her local community where elders believe she's possessed and a product of witchcraft. ‘People think Sadia must have HIV or cancer. They call her the “evil woman”. There is such ignorance and we are trying everything we can to save this woman's life. ‘Sadia's kids are confused too. They thought they would grow the same leg because it must be a genetic deformity. ‘Sadia's story really touched me and on the phone she could not stop bursting into tears. ‘She begged me to call her twice every day to see if she was alive and to help her kids if the worst happens. ‘I have done so ever since, and beg that people join me in resolving her ordeal. ‘We're calling on the British public to donate whatever they can to get Sadia the help she desperately needs.’ Donations of up to £10 can be made by texting SADI11£ and then the amount to text 70070.

Behind bars: Florida resident, John David Baker, 29, who is a British citizen, has been sentenced to 25 years for using a fake persona online to solicit child pornography . A Florida actor and talent judge who helped audition young people for the entertainment industry has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for engaging in internet child pornography. John David Baker, 29, who lives in Celebration, Florida, but is a British citizen, was arrested for creating a fake online persona and persuading children to send him sexual images of themselves. According to court documents, beginning around November 2008 through August 2010, Baker engaged in online conversations with several minor children over the internet. During this period, Baker worked as an actor and helped train and audition adults and children who were attempting to pursue careers in the entertainment business, according to  Florida's District Attorney's office. Working at the same time as a judge for a talent competition in Florida, Baker met minor children who were auditioning to obtain work in the art and film industries. Federal agents began investigating Baker after concerned parents told authorities he had contacted their child online. Baker told investigators he chatted with children from a talent competition online and that many of those conversations were sexually oriented. He admitted he sent or traded numerous sexual photographs of himself during the chats, and that he ‘meant no harm’. He stated that through his work in the talent industry he received photos of individuals, some through his request and some not solicited by him. According to Baker, he had solicited photos from at least 10 children in the talent competition. Abused his power: Baker worked as a judge for the Celebration Talent Competition in Florida, where he met minor children who were auditioning to obtain work in the art and film industries . In one instance, he had pretended to be a 15-year-old girl online and used the fake identity to persuade at least two children to send pictures and videos of themselves engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Investigators found chat logs on Baker's computer which showed he watched one girl perform sex acts via a live web camera. When questioned by detectives in March 2012, Baker did not deny his online interactions with that girl. He blamed drinking, depression and poor relationships for his actions, according to the Orlando Sentinel. Baker, who was arrested on September 7 last year, pleaded guilty in April. In addition to prison, Baker was ordered to serve a 15-year term of supervised release following his incarceration and to register as a sex offender.","UK citizen John David Baker, 29, who lives in Celebration, Florida, was arrested for persuading children to send him pornographic images .

Another nine airports have been asked to install full body scanners, bringing the total up to 19. The scanners, designed to stop terrorists using bombs not made of metal, will be put in at Bristol, Liverpool and Newcastle airports, among others. However starting today passengers are able to opt for a full body search by hand rather than a scan if they would prefer. Nine more airports are to get full body scanners, including Newcastle, Liverpool and Bristol. Trials at Aberdeen and Stansted are also being made permanent . The transport secretary Patrick . McLoughlin said: 'The overwhelming evidence from airports is that nearly . all passengers accept the use of security scanners and find the process . quick and convenient. 'However, I appreciate a small minority may still prefer to request an alternative procedure for a variety of reasons.' The search would require items of clothing to either be loosened or removed, he added. The other airports getting scanners will be Belfast City, Cardiff, East Midlands, Glasgow Preswick, Leeds Bradford, and Luton. The original scanners, which produced a nearly-naked image (left) have been replaced with ones which only show a stick-figure with danger areas highlighted (right) Trials of the scanners at Stansted and Aberdeen will also be made permanent, while airports that already have the scanners are being asked to think about installing more. All of the scanners in the UK will also use millimetre wave technology, which is similar to x-ray but with no known health risks. Since the security measure was introduced the technology has been upgraded so that officials checking the images are shown simple stick figures with danger areas highlighted, rather than a shadowy naked figure. Previously anybody refusing a scan would be stopped from flying, but that will only happen now if they refuse both a scan and a search. Defending the scanners' use, Mr McLoughlin pointed to an attempted attack in 2009 when a man tried to ignite a device by injecting it with liquid. He also cited an incident in Yemen in 2012 when an explosive intended for an aeroplane was recovered before the United States-bound flight took off. Neither of the bombs would have been detected using conventional metal detectors.","Bristol, Newcastle and Liverpool among those to get scanners .

A Massachusetts teenager accused of using a broomstick to rape a freshman student at a sports camp pleaded not guilty in state Superior Court yesterday. Galileo Mondol, 17, entered the plea to seven charges, including aggravated rape on a person under 16. The 17-year-old Mondol was allowed to remain free on the $100,000 bail he posted after his district court arraignment, with the same conditions. Galileo Mondol (right) seen walking into court yesterday, he pleaded not guilty to raping a freshman with a broomstick . Galileo Mondol, 17, is charged with one count of aggravated rape of a child, and six counts of assault . Prosecutors say Mondol was one of three Somerville High School soccer players, in suburban Boston, charged in connection with the alleged assault on Aug. 25 in a cabin at Camp Lenox in Otis. The school had rented the camp for preseason team-building. Mondol's lawyer declined to comment after Thursday's proceedings, The Berkshire Eagle reported. Another defense lawyer previously said evidence against the teen is thin. The other two students in connection with the incident have not been named but are both 16 years old. Mondol was not involved at first but joined in, Berkshire Assistant District Attorney Rachel Eramo said in September. 'I want to have a crack at that,' Mondol is reported to have said, according to Eramo. The three defendants then tried to convince the accusers not to report the attack, she said. Arraigned: Galileo Mondol, 17, of Somerville, Massachusetts, stands with his attorney William A. Korman, right, at Central Berkshire District Court in September .

Mondol pleaded not guilty to charges of aggravated rape of a child, assault on a child with intent to commit rape, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, indecent assault and witness intimidation in September. The two 16-year-olds were arraigned in juvenile court on similar charges. 'Even . the other defendants and the victims said my client had nothing to do . with the incident in question,' William Korman said at the earlier trial, adding that Mondol . even tried to stop the attack.

The shocking figures add to growing fears of a casualty crisis in hospitals, which the College of Emergency Medicine say could be the worst ever (picture posed by model) At least 12,000 patients spent 12 or more hours on trolleys in casualty units last year. Another 250 waited for a minimum of 24 hours and one was left for an astonishing 71 hours and 34 minutes – all but three days. That case – at North West London trust, which runs Northwick Park and Central Middlesex A&E units – emerged in a Mail investigation using freedom of information laws. Hospitals were asked how many patients were in casualty for more than 12 hours, for more than 24 hours and what their longest wait time was in 2012/13. One waited for 37 hours at Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen A&E while another waited for 33 hours at Ashford and St Peter’s in Chertsey, Surrey. Campaigners said the figures showed the situation in accident and emergency departments was getting ‘worse and worse’. ‘Patients who are forced to spend that length of time on trolleys will be in a far worse state than when they arrived,’ said Roger Goss of Patient Concern. ‘People feel they have nowhere else to go. They can’t get an appointment with their GP and their out-of-hours service – NHS 111 – tells them to go to A&E.’ Casualty units are dealing with growing numbers of patients and a desperate shortage of doctors. Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said this winter would ‘probably be worse than last winter, which was the worst we have ever had’. He added: ‘It’s not chaos in emergency departments, but it is a crisis.’ The Prime Minister has intervened to help draw up contingency plans that would see beds freed up in private hospitals should A&E units become too full. David Cameron has also demanded weekly updates on the situation. And tomorrow, the NHS’s top doctor, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, will set out a major report setting out what needs to be done to avert a major crisis in A&E. Doris Miller, pictured with son Michael, was left lying on a hospital trolley in the accident and emergency department at East Surrey Hospital for 28 hours . Doris Miller was abandoned on a hospital trolley for 28 hours. The 95-year-old had been taken to A&E in an ambulance  after falling in the shower and hurting her leg. She was wheeled into a sideroom at East Surrey hospital in Redhilll and left frightened and exhausted – and given nothing but a sandwich. It later transpired that staff had forgotten about her and recorded that she had been discharged to a care home. She was found the following afternoon after her son Michael, 68, phoned the chief executive and threatened to report her to the police as missing. He said: ‘I was furious. This is what happens when you put too much pressure on a system that doesn’t work. ‘I asked which home she was in, but they wouldn’t tell me because of  data protection. I rang the ward, but they said they had never heard of her. ‘The next morning, I was told she was on another ward, so I checked with that ward, and again they said that they had never heard of her. ‘When I finally saw her, she looked dehydrated, confused and distressed. She had received no proper care.’ The hospital insisted Mrs Miller was properly cared for in 2011 but launched an inquiry into the communication breakdown. Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said many of those forced to wait on trolleys would be ‘in distress’ and have nowhere else to go. ‘The types of people on the trolleys for days are the elderly,’ he added. ‘These are the people who go to the back of the queue. While they are in distress and discomfort, they are not critically ill. ‘It’s really distressing to think of patients in their twilight years being treated this way.’ Dr Carter said many of the longest waits were not recorded by staff and would not show up in the figures. Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said many of those forced to wait on trolleys would be 'in distress' and have nowhere else to go (picture posed by model) One patient waited for 37 hours at Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen A&E, above, the statistics showed . If patients are left in corridors or . X-ray rooms just outside A&E, staff can tick a box to state they . have left the department. The number of patients arriving in A&E has soared by a third over the past decade and 22million were logged last year. Rising numbers of old people and the decline in out-of-hours care by GPs have been blamed. Yesterday Monitor, a hospital watchdog, warned the closure of 50 walk-in centres had piled further pressure on casualty units. Staff shortages are also a factor because doctors are increasingly reluctant to work the long and antisocial hours. Half of senior casualty posts have been left unfilled over the past three years. Action plan: Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured during a visit to the Salford Royal Hospital in August, has asked for a contingency plan to be drawn up to combat a potential casualty crisis . Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘David Cameron has presided over the worst year in A&E for a decade, but until now the true human cost has been hidden. ‘These devastating findings reveal the suffering behind the statistics.’ The Great Western Hospital in Swindon . admitted that 12 patients a day have to wait on trolleys in corridors in . A&E and at North Cumbria hospital it happened ten times a day. North Cumbria admitted patients were ‘occasionally’ left on trolleys in the relatives room. Criticism: Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, above, said David Cameron has presided over 'the worst year for A&E in a decade' At South Warwickshire hospital . patients have been put in operating theatres when A&E is full and at . Walsall they have been put in X-ray rooms. A . spokesman for North West London hospitals said the 71-hour case was due . to ‘exceptional circumstances’ and insisted the patient was ‘cared for . safely by staff who are skilled in dealing with emergencies’. A . Department of Health spokesman said: ‘People should not be stuck in . A&E for hours on end and these hospitals will need to explain what . has happened in these cases.’ One in 20 nursing posts is vacant – 20,000 full-time hospital jobs. Figures obtained by the Royal College of Nursing also show 6 per cent of nursing or midwifery posts are unfilled at hospitals. The college says too few nurses are replacing those who have retired because ministers have cut the number of training posts. Cash-strapped trusts have also been using recruitment freezes. ‘Understaffing remains a real issue across the NHS, and we know that many trusts are down to the bone in terms of the number of frontline nursing staff they have due to cutting posts to save money,’ said Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the college.","Figures show shocking number of patients left in casualty units .

A patient who used his engineering skills to repair his own heart defect has helped save the lives of 40 people. Tal Golesworthy, 57, suffers from Marfan syndrome, a genetic, life-threatening condition that left his aorta - the largest artery - in danger of splitting. But faced with gruelling surgery and a lifetime on blood-thinning drugs, he designed himself a made-to-measure knitted polyester sleeve to fit around his aorta. Tal Golesworthy, 57, suffers from Marfan syndrome, a genetic, life-threatening condition that left his main artery in danger of splitting. He designed himself a made-to-measure knitted polyester sleeve to fit around the artery . He persuaded doctors to use him as a guinea pig - and the ground-breaking procedure was a complete success. Inspired by its success, Mr Golesworthy and a team of surgeons decided to make the technology available to other patients. To date, more than 40 patients - the youngest being just 16 - have had their own individually designed surgical sleeve fitted in London, the John Radcliffe Hospital, in Oxford, and the Leuven University Hospital in Belgium. Mr Golesworthy is now calling on surgeons across Europe to start a trial to test his device against more conventional therapy. Around 12,000 people in Britain suffer from Marfan syndrome, a genetic defect which causes abnormal growth of bones and weakness of connective tissue. This leaves the neck of the aorta - the main artery in the heart for carrying oxygenated blood - stretched dangerously thin. He invented a polyester sleeve to fit around his aorta and persuaded surgeons to try it on him. It was so successful that it has now been used to treat 40 other people . A normal aorta has a diameter of around one-and-a-half inches, but in Marfan syndrome sufferers this can weaken and stretch to a staggering four inches wide. If the aorta splits, it is often fatal. Each sleeve is created using scans of the individual patient’s aorta and computer-assisted drawing to produce a bespoke device. Mr Golesworthy, of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, designed the sleeve because he had severe concerns about the old-style surgery that would have left him on anticoagulant drugs for the rest of his life to prevent blood clots. The conventional surgery involves either repairing or replacing the aorta but has to be carried out before it becomes too weak. Mr Golesworthy is now calling on surgeons across Europe to start a trial to test his device against more conventional therapy . He said: ‘I just thought the operation sounded awful. The doctors were being asked to do an engineering job when they weren’t engineers. I decided there had to be a better way.’ Mr Golesworthy, who markets the device through his firm Exstent, became the first recipient of his own brainchild called EARS - external aortic root support - on 24 May 2004 at London’s Royal Brompton Hospital. Nine years on from his two-hour operation his aorta has not grown in size. He said: ‘All of a sudden my aorta is now fixed, I began to breathe easy and sleep well and relax in a way that I hadn’t done for years and years before. ‘To conceive of the idea of an external support was easy, there are any number of armchair inventors about. ‘To build technical and commercial teams, raise the finance, run the project and volunteer to be the first patient was not so easy, particularly as I was trying to operate as a rational project manager when I knew the outcome of the project could have such a profound impact on my future health.’ More than nine years after having the pioneering operation, Mr Golesworthy said his life has been transformed as he no longer has to take any medications and he can live a 'normal' life . But more than nine years after having the pioneering operation, Mr Golesworthy said his life has been transformed. The research and development engineer in the areas of combustion and air pollution control, added: ‘I take no prescription drugs, in particular I am not dependent on anti-coagulation. ‘I am living a life so “normal” that all the usual banalities have crowded in to irritate, work, money, the health of other family members, etcetera, but I have a freedom and emancipation that only an experience as profound as cardiothoracic surgery (or similar) can bring. ‘Since the operation I have been living a completely normal life, drinking alcohol when I feel like it and not taking anti-coagulant drugs. Each sleeve is created using scans of the individual patient's aorta and computer-assisted drawing to produce a bespoke device . ‘I don’t have to worry anymore because everything works fine. The stress and worry used to be horrendous but all that has been removed.’ Andrew Ellis, 27, a keen footballer, has benefited from Mr Golesworthy’s inventiveness. Five years after his surgery he remains fit and healthy and ‘feels like someone without a heart condition’. ‘Tal’s invention has taken away the looming threat of a major operation that was hanging over me for so long,’ he said. Mr Golesworthy was able to apply his . engineering skills to develop the life-saving sleeve with medical advice . from Professor John Pepper and Professor Tom Treasure. He lives with wife Teresa, 55, but revealed he does not have any children because Marfan syndrome is genetically transmitted. Professor Graham Cooper, consultant cardiac surgeon at Sheffield Teaching Hospital NHS Trust, said it would be a long time before the operation was rolled out. He said: ‘We have been doing the traditional operation for over 20 years and it is proven to be very safe and effective - we know it stops people from dying. ‘This new operation may have some advantages - it may mean patients have less time in hospital and undergo a less complex procedure - but it will still be a long time before we have the data to compare different approaches.’ Marfan syndrome is a disorder of the body's connective tissues. Children usually inherit the condition from one of their parents - if a person has the syndrome there is a one in two chance of their child having it. Some people develop it despite not having a parent with the condition. Some people are only mildly affected while others develop serious symptoms. Typical characteristics include being tall, having abnormally long fingers, heart defects and eye problems. A person with the syndrome does not have enough of a protein called fibrillin in their connective tissue. This means parts of their body can stretch abnormally when put under stress. The defective fibrilllin gene also causes some bones to grow longer than they should. There is no cure so treatment focuses on managing the symptoms. The life expectancy of people with the condition is reduced if their heart or aorta is affected. Marfan syndrome affects about one in 5,000 people.

Two air passengers branded 'idiots not terrorists' were cleared of threatening to blow up a plane today. Tayyab Subhani, 30, and Mohammed Safdar, 42, were arrested on May 24 after a Boeing 777 heading from Lahore, Pakistan, to Manchester was forced to make an emergency landing at Stansted Airport in Essex. Prosecutors had told the courtroom of the 'fear and panic' caused by the alleged bomb threats but in the witness box passengers and flight crew admitted no bomb threats were heard and many had been angry the flight was diverted for such a 'trivial incident'. The judge in the case has now ruled they had no case to answer. Cleared: Mohammed Safdar (left) and Tayyab Subhani (right) were dubbed 'idiots not terrorists' and have been cleared of threatening to blow up a plane . Peter Rowlands, representing Mr Subhani, told the court today: 'In fairness to the prosecution, it is now common ground that had certain documents held by Pakistan International Airlines been made available from the outset these two men would not have had to face trial.' It had been claimed Safdar, supported by Subhani, had made threats to kill crew and passengers after an argument broke out with air stewards at 30,000 feet. But passengers had said Safdar had acted like an 'idiot' but they were not threatened by him. Today jurors at Chelmsford Crown Court were instructed to find the men, from Nelson in Lancashire, not guilty of endangering an aircraft. Judge Charles Gratwicke described the case as 'tenuous and peppered with inconsistencies'. He added: 'Under the circumstances no jury can properly convict these men.' Prosecutor Brian O'Neill said: 'In light of the state of the evidence, it has been decided it is no longer appropriate to seek convictions in this case.' Incident: The two passengers were on this aircraft when it had to be diverted from Manchester to Stansted . Held: One of the acquitted men is patted down by forensic police after the plane was brought into Stansted by the RAF . A series of witnesses told the court that although the men had acted like idiots, they had not heard a bomb threat. Nadeem Sufi, captain of the Pakistan International Airlines flight PK709, originally alerted the authorities to the scare. But he later told the court that, as the severity of the diversion became apparent, he tried to reverse this decision by telling air traffic control the men were 'laughing and joking'. In statements read outside court, both men said they were relieved that their ordeal was over and they had cleared their names after wrongly being branded terrorists. Solicitor Raza Sakhi said: This is a victory for Mr Safdar, his loved ones and those that knew he was innocent of the allegations he was facing.' In the sky: The PIA plane as it was being escorted by a RAF jet over Britain into Stansted in May . Path: The flight from Lahore to Manchester was diverted to Stansted following the 'incident' 10 minutes before it was due to land . The court heard that Pakistan International Airlines had released its own internal inquiry, which contradicted evidence given by its staff to police and in court, only when ordered to by the court. Barristers for both men said they did not blame the police or Crown Prosecution Service for the case being brought to court. Peter Rowlands said: 'In fairness to the prosecution, it is now common ground that had certain documents held by Pakistan International Airlines been made available from the outset, these two men would not have had to face trial.' Speaking for Safdar, Mr Sakhi added: 'Due to the misinformation supplied to the UK authorities by members of the crew of flight PK709, the UK was put to considerable expense. 'Mr Safdar was wrongly vilified as a terrorist based on the same information. 'Mr Safdar was separated from his family and remanded in custody for 73 days as a result of this misinformation.' Scare: Police meet passengers as they are led from the plane after it landed in an emergency at Stansted Airport, in a case that was dropped today . He added that Safdar was grateful to his own legal team, the prosecution and police for eventually 'uncovering the truth'. 'His simple lifestyle has turned into one of the most challenging experiences a person can endure. He wishes to move on with his life and put this terrible ordeal behind him,' he said. Biant Bansai, speaking on behalf of Subhani, said: 'This case has collapsed after it became clear that witnesses against him had not told the truth. 'This brings an end to six months of stress and anxiety for Mr Subhani and the cost to him and his family has been very high. 'He's delighted that his name has now been cleared and we will press for a full inquiry as to the conduct of Pakistan International Airlines in this case.'","Mohammed Safdar, 41, and Tayyab Subhani, 30, 'have no case to answer'

A woman who accidentally backed over and killed her long-term girlfriend in their driveway after a row has been sentenced to seven years in prison. Angelia Hanson, 30, from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, pleaded guilty to first-degree involuntary manslaughter last month, telling the judge she did not want to cause anyone any more pain. On Monday, Judge William Syler handed out the maximum sentence for the charge after agreeing with prosecutors that Hanson's history of drug arrests showed a pattern of reckless behavior. Hanson has repeatedly said that the death of her girlfriend, 43-year-old Jody Lane, was an accident after a heated argument, calling the woman 'my love, my strength, my motivation'. Heartbroken: Angelia Hanson, left, has been sentenced to seven years in prison for accidentally backing over her long-term girlfriend Jody Lane, right, after they had a row in July . The tragedy unfolded on July 19 after the women argued about running late to work that morning, the Southeast Missourian reported. Hanson told investigators that Lane told her she was heading back inside the house so Hanson 'floored it' and hurtled backwards down the driveway around 8am. She felt a bump but told investigators she thought she had hit the curb. Only after dragging her girlfriend several feet did she realize she had hit her, according to a probable-cause statement filed in the case. Lane died later in hospital. In court on Monday, Hanson's attorney, assistant public defender Patti Tucka, asked the judge for leniency, pointing out there had been no malice or intention in the death. 'This is a woman who is devastated by . what happened that day when she lost Jody Lane, her partner, her . friend,' Tucka said. 'This was careless. It was not intentional.' Scene: She left their house, pictured, but believed Lane had gone back inside and 'floored it' as she left. She only realized she had hit her girlfriend after dragging her body for several feet . Tucka added that two police videos revealed how devastated Hanson was after the accident. 'She broke down. She cried; she wailed; she was barely able to go on,' she said, the Missourian reported. 'She will live with this every day of her life.' Assistant prosecuting attorney Jack Koester acknowledged Hanson had not intended to kill her girlfriend but said that her history of drug, alcohol-related and assault charges, suggested a pattern of reckless behavior, leading him to recommend the full term. Speaking to the Missourian, Cynthia Hanson, Angelia Hanson's older sister, said her sibling 'loved that woman more than anything in this world'. She said the couple spoke of marrying and that her sister had treated Lane's children as if they were her own. She added that her sister had struggled with absent parents and suffered from bipolar disorder and left home at 15 after coming out as a lesbian to her parents. Angelia and her father were working towards rebuilding their relationship at the time of the tragedy. 'The whole family is just completely devastated,' she said. 'Just heartbroken.'","Angelia Hanson 'floored it' after an argument with her girlfriend Jody Lane and did not realize the woman was behind her .

The flamboyant tycoon, 52, has decided to remove himself from the public eye in a bid to 'stop unnecessarily p****** people off', adding: 'I'm getting in the way'. 'I'm getting in the way': Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has decided to remove himself from the public eye . Mr O'Leary, who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years. He has seen it through two decades of extraordinary growth - culminating in record profits growth of one per cent to 602million euros (£509.7million) last year.

He told The Guardian . that he plans to take a step back from press conferences, interviews . and other publicity events claiming that a more grown-up Ryanair is . 'where it's got to be'. However, . he added that he will retain his position of chief executive while new . succession plans are put in place. The low-cost carrier is currently . advertising for a marketing director, who will deliver the airline's . messages on 'safety, customer service and low fares'. Outspoken: Mr O'Leary, who has gained a reputation as a corporate loudmouth, has been the face of Ryanair for almost 20 years. He has seen it through two decades of extraordinary growth . Mr O'Leary's decision comes as Ryanair - which was recently voted the worst of 100 big brands by Which? readers - tries to revamp its negative image. Pay-per-pee . In 2009, Mr O’Leary announced that passengers could be asked to pay as much as a pound to use the bathroom during a flight. 'We’re . thinking of putting a coin slot on the toilet so people may have to . spend a pound to spend a penny,' he told the BBC Breakfast show. When . asked if he would charge more than a pound, he replied: 'If someone . wanted to pay £5 to go to the toilet I would carry them myself. I would . wipe their bums for a fiver.' Vertical seats . A . year later, the controversial tycoon asked customers whether they would . think of vertical seats, akin to bar stools with seatbelts. His . theory was that by removing 10 rows of seats and replacing them with 15 . rows of vertical seats, flights could carry 30 per cent more passengers . and slash costs by 20 per cent. Reservation charge . This . month, Ryanair has announced it will begin to allocate seats from next . year - but it will still cost almost £5 if you want to choose it . yourself. From February . travellers can pay five euros - £4.23 - to choose their seat while the . rest will be allocated in the 24 hours prior to departure. Who needs co-pilots? Mr . O'Leary once remarked that co-pilots were only there to 'make sure the . first fella doesn’t fall asleep and knock over one of the computer . controls'. He declared aviation authorities should axe the 'unnecessary' position and instead train a member of cabin crew to act as 'back-up' should anything happen to the pilot mid-flight. It . has embarked on a series of steps to re-brand itself, including cutting . penalties for baggage and lost boarding cards, introducing allocated . seating and allowing customers to take a small second bag of . hand-luggage on board for duty free goods. Yesterday, . the airline announced plans to significantly increase the number of . flights to major European cities from Stansted airport in the hope of . expanding its business market. However, Mr O'Leary said he believes potential business passengers are being put off by his 'cheeky chappie' personality - declaring: 'This is where it has to change. I'm getting in the way of the brand stuff'. And on Tuesday, the budget airline unveiled a new, more corporate-looking blue and white colour scheme - with customers able to book a flight using less than half the number of clicks previously needed. Mr O'Leary's decision to retreat from the public eye is also likely to help keep the airline out of the headlines for all the wrong reasons. Last month, the outspoken tycoon was bombarded on Twitter after agreeing to host a question-and-answer session from customers. He posted a picture of himself on the social networking site dressed as a leprechaun before fielding tweets. Many customers told Mr O'Leary what an ‘a***hole’ they thought he was - with user Andrew Riddell asking him: 'Have you by any chance just hired British Gas's former head of publicity you Plum'. The Ryanair boss replied: 'Hey, don't call me plum. Pudding would be more accurate!', before later admitting: 'I'm an a***hole. But they still love me.' In an interview this month, Mr O'Leary claimed he was a 'Neanderthal' who believed men should not feel any pressure to help bring up their own children. He also compared himself to Jesus and insisted Ryanair only punishes customers who fail to comply with its rules. Only ten days earlier, he had declared that a passenger who complained at being charged to print out a new boarding pass was 'stupid'.","Michael O'Leary, 52, has declared he is 'getting in the way' at Ryanair .

Conman: James Whitehouse, pictured, was jailed for two years in October after he defrauded £1,800 from his lovers . A conman used a dating website to trick women into thinking he was ‘the perfect man’ before stealing their identities to take out payday loans. James Whitehouse, 30, left four women riddled with debt after charming them online. He spent months gaining their trust and told them he loved them, but then used their personal details to take out loans from companies including Wonga and Payday UK. When the women became suspicious, he would end the relationship and move on to someone else. Whitehouse, who drove one of his victims to bankruptcy, was arrested in October 2012 after one woman reported him to police, but he went on to deceive two more. The gambling addict pleaded guilty to four counts of fraud totalling around £1,800 in October this year, and was jailed for two years at Birmingham Crown Court. But the scam artist’s dealings are still affecting his victims. Emma Warren, 34, from Shirley, West Midlands, faced threats that bailiffs would be knocking on her door when she refused to pay three of the loans Whitehouse had taken out. The single mother of one was encouraged by friends to join the dating site Plentyoffish.com.‘His first messages were very normal and both being parents, we had a lot in common,’ she said. The pair met in person six weeks later in December 2012. Miss Warren said: ‘He was just so easy to be with. He was a real charmer, always attentive and complimentary.’ After three weeks Whitehouse told her he loved her. But when the couple booked a holiday, he asked for her bank details to transfer his share of the money. Weeks later, she was stunned to find it was overdrawn. She noticed the money he had sent her was a loan from Payday UK and other loans had been taken out in her name. Whitehouse refused to answer her calls. Miss Warren said: ‘I contacted the bank straight away...  but they didn’t stop £200 being taken by Payday UK. All together the loans initially came to about £700. Victims: Emma Warren, left, and Emma Taylor, right, lost hundreds of pounds after Whitehouse took out payday loans in their names . ‘But when I contacted the companies and explained that I hadn’t taken out these loans, they said I still owed the money.’ Whitehouse also ‘borrowed’ £2,000 in cash from her grandmother, claiming he needed it to look after his seven-year-old daughter, but it was never paid back. Miss Warren, who can no longer give her three-year-old daughter the Christmas she had planned, added: ‘The payday companies need to make their policies stricter so not just anyone can get a loan with your name and account number.’ When she met Whitehouse he was still conning Emma Taylor, 28, from Birmingham, who met him on the same website in September 2012. Miss Taylor lent him £200 but he repaid her with money from payday loan firms TXT loans and Minicredit, taken out in her name. Judge William Davis QC said the conman had ‘defrauded vulnerable women one after the other, purely to support [his] gambling habit’.","James Whitehouse, 30, spent months gaining the trust of four women .

When veteran television presenter Johnny Ball’s friends discovered he had been mugged during a trip to Ukraine, many of them were no doubt anxious to help him out. After all – as a rather alarming email had informed them – he would be trapped abroad until he found £1,950 to settle his hotel bill. But if any kind-hearted souls were moved to answer Mr Ball’s desperate plea for funds, then that was very likely to have been the last they ever saw of their money. The 75-year-old former Strictly contestant appears to have become the latest victim of an internet ‘phishing’ scam – which sees fraudsters hack into people’s email accounts and beg their contacts for emergency aid. Friends received a desperate plea for money from Johnny Ball (pictured with his daughter, Zoe) Mr Ball’s friends received an impassioned message from his personal email account on Monday. Entitled ‘Travel Issues’, the missive explained that he had fallen victim to foreign thieves. It said: ‘I made a trip to Kiev, Ukraine and had my bag stolen from me with my passport and personal effects therein. ‘The embassy has just issued me a temporary passport but I have to pay for a ticket and settle my hotel bills with the manager.’ Describing his friends as his ‘last resort and hope’, Mr Ball – or rather his impersonator – continued: ‘I have made contact with my bank but it would take me three to five working days to access funds in my account. ‘The bad news is my flight will be leaving very soon but I am having problems settling the hotel bills and the hotel manager won’t let me leave until I settle the bills.’ The message went on to say: ‘I need your help financially (£1,950) and I promise to make the refund once I get back home.’ Yesterday, internet security experts described the email as a classic online con-trick, known in the industry as a ‘stranded traveller scam’. The 75-year-old former Strictly contestant appears to have become the latest victim of an internet 'phishing' scam . Professor Tim Watson, director of the Cyber Security Centre at De Montfort University, said: ‘This particular scam has been going for quite a while now, at least 12 months, and seems to be increasingly popular. ‘It varies depending on which email you get, but is always along similar lines. You get an email from a friend saying they have been robbed abroad, and they need money. If you email it, you will get a response telling you where to transfer the funds.’ He added: ‘There is a community of scammers online who share the most effective email templates. ‘They operate from all over the world, although many certainly seem to be based in Nigeria. ‘Sadly, the scam is surprisingly effective. We are used to looking out for dodgy emails pretending to be from your bank, but not from people we know and trust.’ Another expert advised Mr Ball – who is the father of DJ Zoe Ball and used to present shows such as Play School and Think of a Number – to avoid future attacks by updating his computer’s anti-virus software. Tony Neate, CEO of internet safety group Get Safe Online, said: ‘He needs to make sure all his systems are up to date. ‘This almost certainly originated from a virus downloaded when he clicked on a website or email. ‘The virus can then read all your email contacts and message them all automatically. These scammers have no morals. They deliberately play on your heartstrings. ‘Mr Ball’s friends may think it is a plausible story, as he is a well-travelled man. It is easy to imagine someone you know lost in a foreign country. With the added sense of urgency, you are even more likely to respond.’ He added: ‘If nobody replied to these emails, they wouldn’t get sent. But unfortunately they catch people out all the time.’ Internet security experts described the email as a classic con-trick, known as a 'stranded traveller scam'","Friends informed he would be trapped until he found £1,950 to pay hotel bill .

Divers recovered another 16 bodies today from the shipwreck of a fishing boat packed with 500 African migrants which sank off an Italian island. The official death toll now stands at 127. Up to 250 people are missing and 155 have survived the accident. Frogmen resumed their search this morning off the island of Lampedusa after a 48-hour delay due to bad weather. Scroll down for video . Grim: Soldiers carry the body bags of African migrants from the wreckage of the fishing boat off the Italian island of Lampedusa . Toll: A lorry door is opened to receive the bodies of the migrants who will be taken to a makeshift mortuary at the local airport . Tragedy: Italian soldiers carry one body ashore. The death toll is now officially 127 . Soldiers wearing masks brought the bodies ashore and placed them onto trucks to be taken to the makeshift morgue at the airport. Many more victims are believed to be trapped in the wreck in deep water, about one kilometre (half a mile) off the southern Italian island. Today Pope Francis took a moment of silent pray in St Peter's Square for the victims who had sailed from many North African countries in the 20m (66ft) long boat. Financial police Major Leonardo Ricci said the search and recovery would continue 'as long as the sea is calm and there is light.' Emotional: A soldier buries his head in anguish as another body is brought ashore from the sunken ship . Guard: Italian Integration Minister Cecile Kyenge leaves after a news conference at the Lampedusa island . The boat sank last Thursday after a fire was set on board to attract attention of passing boats or people on shore when it ran into trouble. It had travelled for two full days from the Libyan port of Misrata and those aboard thought they had reached safety when they saw the lights of Lampedusa. It is thought to have capsized when everyone moved to one side. Some of the survivors were in the water for three hours clinging to anything buoyant - even empty bottles.

The BBC reported that France has called for an urgent EU meeting after Italy requested help to deal with the influx of migrants. Italy has said it will amend immigration . laws. Members of parliament have complained that some of its provisions . discourage people from helping migrants in distress. An Italian fisherman who arrived first at the site of the accident, has claimed coastguard officers wasted time filming the rescue operation . He was quoted by Ansa news agency as saying: 'They refused to take on board some people we'd already saved because they said protocol forbade it.'

Some were in the water for three hours . Earlier this week, the scale of the tragedy of Lampedusa was made shockingly clear when survivors of the tragedy paid their respects at the morgue inside an airport hangar. All of the caskets had a single white rose on top except for the four of the youngest victims, which had stuffed animals.

"By . Ap Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 19:18 EST, 22 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:18 EST, 22 November 2013 . The company that employed the Washington Navy Yard shooter pulled his . access to classified material for two days in August when mental health . problems became evident, but restored it quickly and never told Navy . officials about the withdrawal, The Associated Press has learned. An initial Navy review revealed that the Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based . company, The Experts, ordered computer contractor Aaron Alexis back to . Washington, D.C., after a police incident in Rhode Island in August, . according to senior U.S. officials. The company then withdrew his . ability to access secret-level data for two days, said the officials, . who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to . publicly discuss the investigation. It did not disclose why his access . was reinstated. Less than six weeks later, the former Navy reservist . gunned down 12 civilian workers in a Navy Yard building, and police . fatally shot him. The Experts did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Access denied: Navy Yard shooter Aaron Alexis had his access to classified information denied six weeks before the shooting . The classified access revelation has raised questions about whether the company's disclosure of the discipline could have brought Alexis to Navy officials' attention earlier and perhaps prevented the massacre. The Navy did an initial review into the matter, but it has not yet been released. Officials also have done a full investigation, including what prompted the company's decision and why the government was never told. Naval leaders now are reviewing that report. The shooting spree triggered several Navy and Defense Department reviews into base security and contractor requirements, including questions about how thorough the background checks are for security clearances and whether more vigilant monitoring and reassessments should be done. While the Navy reviews have not been released, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus has sent out a notice to the fleet directing all commanders and civilian leaders in the Navy to scrutinize the records of any personnel who are allowed to access classified information. Psychological reasons: Alexis' access was denied for psychological reasons after an incident with police in Rhode Island . In the message, Mabus said that this new records review should look at credit card delinquencies, discipline, police or legal reports and urinalysis reports. Mabus said that if information is discovered that had not been disclosed already, it must be reported, and commanders must determine whether the employee's access to classified data should be cut off. He ordered commanders to submit full reports to Navy and Marine leaders on what they found and any actions taken by mid-January. According to officials familiar with the Navy investigation, The Experts removed Alexis' access to secret information on August 7 and restored access on August 9, but there is nothing in the record explaining the decisions. The timing, however, aligns with the day Alexis called Newport, R.I., police, complaining that voices were harassing him through a wall at his hotel and he worried they might harm him. Killer: Alexis killed 12 people during his assault on the Navy Yard building before being fatally shot by police . Police said they were called to the Marriott around 6 a.m. on Aug. 7, and Alexis told them he was in town as a naval contractor and that he believed people were following him and using a microwave machine to send vibrations into his body so he could not fall asleep. Police alerted the local Navy base that day that Aaron Alexis was hearing voices, but the information went no further. Under U.S. rules, The Experts was required to report any behavior that could be considered detrimental to security, and that information was supposed to be passed along to the commander at the Washington Navy Yard. Alexis began working at the Navy Yard this summer refreshing computer systems. The Experts said it ran two background checks on Alexis that turned up only a traffic violation. It also said the Pentagon confirmed twice that Alexis had a valid security clearance. Alexis was granted a secret-level security clearance while in the Navy, and it carried over when he went to work as a computer contractor. He was granted access to the Washington Navy Yard and to Building 197 as an employee of The Experts, a Hewlett-Packard subcontractor. Delusional: Alexis had been suffering from hallucinations and other psychological issues prior to the shooting . Hewlett-Packard Co. has said it was severing ties with The Experts, saying the company failed to respond appropriately to Alexis' mental health issues. HP has told U.S. officials that it did not receive any adverse information reports on Alexis before the September 16 shooting. In a note he left behind and found by investigators after the shooting, Alexis claimed that he was driven to the shooting rampage because he was being bombarded by extremely low-frequency radio waves. The FBI has said that the note, along with peculiar carved notations on his gun, suggested he was in the throes of profound paranoia and delusions. His shotgun, which he purchased two days before the shooting from a gun shop in Virginia, was etched with messages including 'My ELF Weapon!' — an apparent reference to extremely low-frequency waves — and 'End to The Torment!' In response to the shooting, Mabus ordered a series of reviews, including four quick studies on Alexis' Navy career, contractor obligations, the security clearance process and physical base security. He also ordered two longer reviews — one on physical security and one encompassing a full investigation into exactly how the events of the shooting unfolded. All six reviews have been completed, but they have not yet been released. Mabus said that investigation into the shooting must determine whether HP and The Experts complied with background investigation requirements; find out who knew about the August police incident and clearance action; figure out what happened and whether it was reported as required; and if government or military officials were notified, find out whether proper procedures were followed.","Alexis' access to classified information was revoked for two days in August after an incident with Rhode Island police .

A Navy veteran who refused to kowtow to Hitler has finally been stopped in his tracks – by 'ageist' health and safety red tape. Albert 'Dusty' Miller, 89, has been barred from serving as a marshal and standard-bearer at Royal British Legion events because he is too old to be insured. The ex-serviceman – who served with distinction in the Royal Navy both in the Atlantic convoys and as a submariner in the Burma campaign – was told he could no longer help organise and lead parades, a role he has carried out for 38 years. Albert 'Dusty' Miller, 89, served with distinction in WWII but was told he could no longer act as parade marshal because he was too old . Mr Miller was given the bad news just before the dedication of Liverpool's Garden of Remembrance – and told he could only attend future events as a 'guest'. Jim Ryan, chairman of the Legion's Merseyside and West Lancashire branch, said he had not been eligible for insurance since he was 85, but the organisation had only just realised the oversight. Mr Miller, from Kirkby, Merseyside, said: 'Hitler couldn't stop me but red tape has rained on my poppy parade. 'I never even knew standard-bearers had to be insured.' A close friend of Mr Miller's, who still works with the Legion and refused to be named,  said: 'To say that anyone over 85 is redundant to an organisation like the Royal British Legion flies completely in the face of  that message. 'It is indirect ageism by jobsworths – and from an organisation that highlights the plight of war veterans that is crazy.' (File picture) Mr Miller, from Kirkby, Merseyside, served on the Atlantic convoys in World War II . Mr Miller joined the Royal Navy at the age of 16 as a cadet and received four campaign medals – the 39-45 Star, the Atlantic medal for the convoys, the Burma Star with a Pacific clasp, and the International Submarine Service medal. The Royal British Legion insisted that its hands were tied for 'health and safety reasons'. A spokesperson said: 'The Legion has a duty of care towards all parade marshals and standard bearers. 'For health and safety reasons, the Legion's insurance policy only covers persons up to the age of 85.

The outlook for the British economy has improved by more than any other developed nation over the last six months, an international watchdog declared yesterday. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said it now expects the UK economy to grow by 1.4 per cent this year and 2.4 per cent in 2014. That is far stronger than growth rates of 0.8 per cent and 1.5 per cent predicted in May, marking the biggest upgrade for any of the world’s major economies. The UK is now forecast to grow by 2.4 per cent in 2014, up from the OECD's prediction in May of 1.5 per cent . The forecast provided further good news for George Osborne ahead of next month’s Autumn Statement. The Chancellor is expected to report that borrowing will be much lower than expected this year as the recovery boosts tax receipts. The upgrade to the UK’s prospects came as the OECD cut its growth forecast for the global economy from 3.1 per cent to 2.7 per cent for this year and from 4 per cent to 3.6 per cent for 2014. It expects output in the eurozone to contract by 0.4 per cent this year before growing by just 1 per cent in 2014. Boost: Chancellor George Osborne is expected to use next month's Autumn Statement to offer measures to ensure ordinary people benefit from the effects of the recovery . The OECD said economic activity in Britain has 'picked up and . broadened', supported by a turnaround in private sector confidence and . continued monetary stimulus. It also noted how government . intervention in the housing market, including its mortgage lending . schemes, was helping to fuel the recovery. It said: 'Growth is projected to . strengthen further in 2014 and 2015, mainly supported by an upturn in . gross fixed investment and exports. 'Despite exceeding the inflation . target of 2 per cent, headline inflation is projected to fall gradually in the . next two years.' The Treasury said the report ‘provides more evidence that the UK’s hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity’ despite the uncertain outlook around the world. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has vowed to keep interest rates at historic lows, at least until unemployment rates fall below 7 per cent. The OECD welcomed efforts to put banks back on a firmer financial footing, and warned against a change of course. 'While headline deficits are . expected to shrink as growth recovers, it is important to maintain . existing consolidation plans to restore fiscal sustainability,' it said. And it urged the government to do more to stimulate housebuilding to prevent a new property price bubble. 'Further . relaxing the barriers holding back housing supply is an important policy . priority to contain house price inflation.' David Cameron has vowed to press ahead with planning reforms, warning that opponents in rural areas are killing off the chances of young people achieving the ‘dream of home ownership’. The Prime Miinster said: ‘Planning reform is important. It’s important that we build more houses because the average age of the . first-time buyer has crept into the 30s, and I believe in a socially . mobile society where people can achieve their dream of home ownership.’ The OECD said the overall global recovery was 'real' but moving at a 'slow speed' and warned that there could be further turbulence ahead, warning that political brinkmanship over the US economy could derail progress. Warning: The OECD said the global recovery was 'real' but moving at a 'slow speed', as it published this map on predicted levels of growth around the world in 2014/15 . A Treasury spokesman said: 'The OECD have revised their forecast for UK GDP up by more than any other G7 country over the next two years. 'This provides more evidence that the UK's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity. Today's report also highlights the risks that remain to the recovery and urges the UK to stick to the Government's plan that is growing the economy, lowering the deficit and inflation, and creating jobs. 'This is the only sustainable way to raise living standards for hard-working families.' But Labour's Chris Leslie, the shadow chief secretary to the treasury, said: 'After three damaging years of flatlining this OECD forecast for the UK is welcome, but for millions of families this is still no recovery at all. As the OECD says, real wages are still falling in Britain. 'In fact working people are on average £1600 a year worse off since David Cameron came to office.'","Respected think tank revises up UK growth by more than any G7 nation .

What happened? Ryan Singleton, 24, a former model who dreamed of becoming a filmmaker, vanished in July and his body was found in the Californian desert in October. His organs were missing . But when the friend arrived, there was no sign of Singleton and a missing person's report was filed. It was two months before joggers came across Singleton's decomposing body, which was missing its organs, investigators told his mother, Iris Flowers. She said she now knows little more about his death than she did then - when investigators called her and said: 'Ma'am, there were no eyes, there was no heart, there were no lungs, there was no liver, there were no kidneys.' The San Bernardino County Coroner’s . Office said there was no official cause of death after the body was . found, but that 'the body was severely decomposed. Animals might have . been involved.'

'But if you know anything about Kithe Brewster I can I will find them and the people who took him away will be caught! I can accomplish I will!

He suggested that Singleton could have been targeted as he was openly gay, or he could have fallen victim to an organ theft ring. He added that he does not believe his husband was killed where he was found, and instead suggested that he was killed and then put back there. Nancy Scheper-Hughes, a medical anthropologist and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told Fox it is 'highly unlikely' that Singleton was killed so his organs could be harvested.","Ryan Singleton left Atlanta, Georgia for a short trip to Los Angeles in July and broke down in the desert while driving to Las Vegas .

The desperate search for the toddler dominated family life, as years passed and he was never found. To some victims of such appalling circumstance, having another baby would defy contemplation. But Ben's sister, now 20, has revealed she is pregnant - despite being petrified of the same thing happening to her baby. Leighanna Needham, left, was born after her brother Ben, right, disappeared while he played with toys on the Greek island of Kos. Leighanna, now pregnant, is 'terrified' - but says she will not be a helicopter parent . And she has said she refuses to be a helicopter parent after watching the terrible effect Ben's disappearance had on her mother Kerry. The trainee accountant, who has been with her window fitter boyfriend Craig . Fisher, 24, for five years, realised she was expecting a daughter when she fell ill on holiday in Turkey. The news came despite doctors once telling her she might never conceive. She told the Daily Mirror: 'Of course I am terrified my baby will be stolen like Ben. Every parent would be. 'My family have been through hell but I am not going to let that affect the way I love my child. I will not clip her wings.' Ben was 21 months old when he vanished while playing with his toys in the garden of his grandparents' retirement farmhouse on the Greek island of Kos. Still missing: Ben Needham was 21 months old when he vanished from a farmhouse on the Greek island Kos . Mystery: Ben before he disappeared in 1991, left, and how he may have looked on his 21st birthday, right . The case gained international media attention which would be dwarfed only by that given to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann 16 years later. It resurged this year amid claims Ben may have been abducted by members of a Roma gypsy camp in Greece. A 22-year-old man had his DNA tested against Ben's, but the test came back negative. Ben's mother Kerry, pictured, struggled with alcohol after his disappearance . Unlike in the McCann case, the Needham family were unable to gather millions in donations. For years they were going it alone, with no hope of finding Ben on the horizon. Leighanna's and Ben's mother Kerry could not cope with the pain, falling into a spiral of drink and nightclubs which ended in Leighanna being sent to live with her grandparents for two months. Leighanna, from Sheffield, told the Mail on Sunday last year: ‘I’ve been wrapped up in cotton wool all my life. I wasn’t allowed to do anything as a child. ‘I couldn’t even stay over at a friend’s house until I was 13. I was always told it was “just in case”.' She added: 'She has since told me that after Ben went missing, she used to hear him crying. She had a bedroom full of his toys for when he came home. 'She used to get up in the night and go to rock him to sleep and he wasn’t there. Before I was born, she was going insane with grief. ‘She had counselling and was advised to have another baby.  At first she said she couldn’t do it. It hurt her to have me. Now I understand.' Although she blames her mother for nothing, Leighanna is determined to allow her own daughter more freedom. And she told the Daily Mirror: 'I want Ben home more than ever now. I want him to know he's going to be an uncle.'

The £135 Moto G is a 4.5-inch handset running the latest version of Android and will launch across Latin America, Europe, Canada and parts of Asia in the coming weeks. A notable omission in the rollout plans, however, is China - a region that Apple recently considered important enough to include in its iPhone and iPad release, but one that has a chequered past with Motorola's parent company, Google.

Speaking at the event, Motorola's CEO Woodside said: 'Most people in the world can't afford a $500 or $600 phone. 'The average price is close to $200 and the experience of these devices is really, really bad. 'We . think the industry should deliver more value, we think people deserve . better. So that's why today, we're introducing Moto G.' The firm chose Brazil as the first country on its rollout schedule because the South American region is seen as an important emerging market for smartphone makers. It is seen by many to be as significant as the emerging markets of China. Apple certainly believes China is a lucrative country after the tech giant made its new iPhone 5S and 5C phones, as well as its new iPad Air, available in the region from launch for the first time ever.

Tourists who have escaped to Venice for a final summer romantic break have had to swap their sandals for wellies as the city is hit with an early seasonal high tide. Partly engulfed by the high waters, some of the city's most iconic and romantic sites have become underwater obstacle courses for visitors. Holding suitcases high and dry over their heads, buying emergency pairs of Wellington boots and wading through the knee-deep water, some tourists took the challenge in their stride while others seemed less impressed. Coping: Tourists in Venice's St Mark's Square were forced to go barefoot as the water level rose unusually high for this time of year . Closed up: Shops were closed and only the bravest visitors ventured out into the flooded streets as the tide engulfed parts of the city . Locals, wearing full dry-suits and prepared for the seasonal flooding, looked un-phased by the unusually high tide, going about their normal day but surrounded by water. The high water, known as 'acqua alta', usually happens between autumn and spring, but appears to have arrived early this year. The unusually high tides occur for a number of reasons, but primarily because of the addition of certain weather conditions coupled with the astronomical high tide caused by the alignment of the sun, moon and other planets. Fascinated: This tourist seemed entertained by he high water level in the city, caused by a combination of astronomical tides, weather systems and Adriatic tides . Some seemed to take the event in their stride while others looked less impressed with the challenge . Dampener: The bad weather and unseasonably early acqua alta may have put a dampener on those hoping to grab a late summer romantic break . Low pressure systems in the Tyrrhenian Sea, to the West of Italy, and strong southerly winds, known as scirocco, are both causes for concern when tides are high during the winter months. The Adriatic Sea also has it's own oscillating tide, known as the 'Adriatic seiche'. While not as noticeable as the astronomical tide, when the two are in sync, the water level is likely to rise and fall further. Since 1867, exceptional tidal events have been recorded - the first being in 1867 itself, when the water level rose 153cm above sea level.

High and dry: Tourists queued along a raised platform in St Mark's Square to take a boat to a drier part of the city, while seagulls made the most of the novel waterways . Bad weather in Venice has in part played a role in causing the unusually early acqua alta this year . The year 1966 also saw an unprecedented acqua alta, after which the city established a dedicated service to monitor and analyse tidal data and predict when tidal flooding was likely to occur. Today's tidal flooding was short-lived however, and posed a challenge only for tourists wishing to take a coffee sat in Saint Marc's square for example. But even that was still achievable, if visitors were happy to either get their feet wet or sport some sensible water-proof footwear. Sign of the times: Gondoliers are soon to be fitted with GPS systems to monitor the speed and position of boats in the wake of calls to better regulate Venice's waterways . They have navigated the lagoon city for hundreds of years, with only the stars and a wooden oar to steer them on their way. But Venice’s famous gondoliers will soon be dragged into the 21st century- their boats are set are fitted with GPS systems. The new regulatory bit of kit, which . will monitor both the speed and route of the vessels, comes as part of a . crackdown on water traffic following the death of a tourist on the . city’s canals. Fifty-year old Joachim Vogel from . Germany died in August when the gondola he was travelling on collided . with a vaporetto water bus. Until now Venice has operated as . something of a free for all with cruise ships speed boats and water . taxis joining small craft jostling for space on the major canals. But following the accident on the . 17th August the council have set out proposals to bring Venice closer in . line to cities based on dry land. The city’s mayor Giorgio Orsoni said . after the accident: 'We have to think of the Grand Canal as a street, a . main street like that of all cities, with particularly heavy traffic. We . need some discipline.' Under the clampdown the gondolas will . also have to have number plates like cars, and reflector strips to make . them more visible to night-time traffic. Processions of gondolas floating . together to enjoy a traditional serenade will soon become a thing of the . past as groups travelling together are considered a hazard. Under proposals already announced, . the city is to introduce a floating congestion zone, which would prevent . the gondolas operating in the congested Grand Canal before 10.30 am. If approved the plans will also include breathalyser tests for gondoliers and a ban on mobile phones. Changes: Venetian lawmakers want to bring the city's watery transport service in line with land equivalents, following the death of a tourist travelling in a gondolier which was hit by another boat . Ugo Bergamo the councillor who drew . up the new regulations said ‘We have no alternative, we can no longer . pretend that problems do not exist.’ There was a need to cut water traffic . on the most overcrowded stretches of the Grand Canal by 50 per cent, he . said. A recent study showed that in the space of just 10 hours, 1,600 . vessels passed under the Rialto Bridge. Aldo Reato, the president of the . gondoliers' association, said his members had yet to sign up to all the . proposals and would make their views known at a meeting this week. Jaochim Vogel and his family were . flung into the water when their gondola collided with a vaporetto water . taxi, near the famous Rialto Bridge, one of Venice’s most popular and . picturesque sights. Mr Vogel was crushed to death. His three-year-old daughter was treated in hospital for head injuries, but survived.","Venice's high tide, or 'acqua alta', normally occurs in the winter months .

He's back: Darwin Vela, 22, was located Friday afternoon after going missing two days ago while walking his Chocolate Lab, who returned home with blood on his leash . A California man who disappeared while walking his dog the day before he was supposed to testify in a burglary case involving Nicolas Cage’s ex-girlfriend turned up alive today. Darwin Vela, 22, was located at about 1.30pm, the Los Angeles Police Department said in a written statement. There was no immediate word on his condition. ‘The detectives are talking to him to find out the circumstances’ of his disappearance, Officer Gregory Baek said. TMZ reported Friday that Vela allegedly told police that he was kidnapped, but he somehow managed to get away from his abductors and asked a passerby to call 911. Vela was last seen around 9 p.m. Tuesday when he took his 3-year-old chocolate Labrador, Koco, for a walk in South Los Angeles. His fiancee, Kelly McLaren, said the dog later returned to their home hunched over and 'crying' with a 6-inch smear of blood on its leash. No one heard from Vela, who was recently unemployed, and he had left his cellphone, wallet and keys at home, McLaren said. On Friday, an officer at LAPD's Pacific Station in the Del Rey neighborhood told McLaren and Vela’s mother that the 22-year-old was 'bruised' but otherwise fine, KTLA reported. Vela was last seen leaving his home in the 2900 block of South Redondo Boulevard about 9pm on Tuesday, according to Los Angeles police. A short time later police said the dog returned alone. Missing: Darwin Vela, 22, went for a walk with his dog in Los Angeles on Tuesday night and never returned . Witnesses: Vela and his girlfriend, Kelly McLaren were scheduled to testify against a man who is standing trial for breaking into the home of Nicholas Cage's ex-girlfriend, Christina Fulton . Vela’s girlfriend said she noticed blood on the dog’s leash, according to KTLA. 'He [the dog] was crying, and Darwin wasn't anywhere,' McLaren said. 'So I took the leash, and I noticed on the leash there was a thumb print of blood and a drag mark, where it looked like the leash had been pulled from his arm.' Vela has never gone missing before and his family and friends are very concerned for his safety, police said. McLaren fears Vela’s disappearance could be linked to a high profile case the couple is involved in, in which they were both expected to testify. ‘We were witnesses to a crime and we were supposed to testify today,’ McLaren told KTLA. The crime was a break-in at the home of actor Nicolas Cage's ex-girlfriend, Christina Fulton, earlier this year.

Marijuana use in one of London's most notorious jails was so rife that visiting officials carrying out an inspection noticed their clothes smelt of it, a shocking new report has revealed. Inmates of A and B wings in Brixton prison in south London are said to have smoked so much cannabis that its distinctive smell tainted the clothes of guards and visitors from the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB). The IMB report said the easy availability of illegal drugs in the Category C prison, which only had one sniffer dog, was a 'major concern' and was to blame for 'gambling, indebtedness, bullying and intimidation' amongst inmates. Cannabis use is so widespread at Brixton Prison, pictured, that visitors' clothes smelt of it, a new report says . Referring to concerns over bullying at the jail, it said: 'The fuel for much of the bullying was the availability of illegal drugs – much more noticeable than when Brixton was a local prison. 'Cannabis was sometimes being smoked so much on A and B wings that officers’ and IMB members’ clothes smelt of it.' The report said the drugs were largely being brought into the prison by men who had gone out on temporary licence - on day or overnight release - and said there had been a 'significant failure' by prison authorities to address this problem. It went on: 'A major concern for the Board this year has been the availability of illicit drugs, mobilephones, and other items of contraband. 'This has led to gambling, indebtedness, bullying and intimidation, resulting, in some areas, in a significant deterioration of the generally harmonious regime in the prison.' Other concerns were the availability of the synthetic marijuana drug known as Spice, and prisoners using home-made hooch. The independent report said cannabis was being brought into the jail by inmates who'd been on day release . The independent report concluded that a staff shortage at the prison was to blame. It said: 'Brixton is having to shoulder the burden of a significant headcount reduction. The prison’s staff complement fell about four per cent in the year covered by this report. 'By January 2014 there will be a 17% reduction compared with September 2012. This is bound to weaken further the regime’s effectiveness'. The report said there should be more searches of both prisoners and visitors, and said a second sniffer dog should be brought in to help.","Report noted easy availability of drugs amongst A and B wing prisoners .

If seeing GIFs across the web isn’t enough to satisfy your need for the short moving clips, you can now buy a machine that plays them without the need for electricity or an internet connection. Called a Giphoscope, the custom-built machine turns GIFs, short video clips and vines into a series of images that are printed onto the flip pages of the device. Users crank the handle on the side of the Giphoscope to move these pages and the images appear to play, similar to images in a flip book. Called a Giphoscope, the custom-built machine turns GIFs, short video clips and vines into a series of images that are printed onto the flip pages of the device . Brooklyn-based designers Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx recently created a company called Gifpop! It aims to print animated GIFs onto lenticular film. Lenticular film, which shows pitted, prismatic plastic pictures, used to be popular in childhood stickers and notebooks. The image in lenticular film appears to move as the viewer moves, with its animation looping through a short number of frames. The technology dates back to World War II. It is the brainchild of Italian designers Marco Calabrese and Alessandro Scali, and the idea is based on the 19th century Mutoscope players. The Mutoscope was an early motion picture device developed by Herman Casler in 1894. It worked in a similar way to flip books and was seen as the follow-up to Thomas Edison’s Kinetoscope. On the Mutoscope, images were slotted into flexible see-through cards and rotated around a central wheel. The machines were traditionally built at eye height so the average person could stand and watch the images, and the Giphscope is a modern-day, desktop version of this. Each Giphoscope is custom-built in Italy and costs €300 (£251) to make, plus shipping costs. The images are rotated around an aluminium core fitted to a wooden base that can be stuck to any surface using glue pads.The crank turns using ball bearings. Once a customer has sent a digital copy of their GIF the designers match the colour of the metal, handle and base to complement the images. Each model takes between seven and ten days to make.

Ken Ham, president of Answers in Genesis, claims that the God favouring billboards are not meant to ‘attack’ the atheists. ‘We're not against them personally. We're not trying to attack them personally, but we do believe they're wrong,’ he said. The Creation Museum represents the creationist belief in a literal interpretation of the book of Genesis. They believe that the Earth was created in six days less than 10,000 years ago. ‘The Bible says to contend for the faith,’ Ham said. ‘We thought we should come up with something that would make a statement in the culture, a bold statement, and direct them to our website.’ This billboard posted by the American Atheists in December of last year started a billboard war between atheists and creationists . The American Atheists, the organization responsible for the atheist billboards, finds the creationist billboards humorous and without validity. Dave Silverman, the president of the American Atheists said, ‘They refuse to look at the real world. They refuse to look at the evidence we have, and they offer none.’  He continued, ‘They might as well be saying, “Thank Zeus you're wrong” or “Thank Thor you're wrong.” ‘ . Many American’s think the creationists are right. Studies provided by Gallup Inc. in June 2012, show that 46% of Americans believed in creationism, 32% believed in evolution guided by God, and 15% believed in atheistic evolution. Creationism was the most popular answer for as long as Gallup conducted the survey. According to Ham, ‘We're a biblical authority ministry. We're really on about the Bible and the Gospel. Now, we do have a specialty in the area of the creation account and Genesis because that's where we say God's word has come under attack.’ Answers in Genesis is posting billboards in New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles this week . By ‘attack,’ Ham may be referring to the atheist billboards posted in December of 2012. A Former Minister named Dan Barker defended the atheist billboards last December. ‘I understand how [people] might feel that nonreligious displays during December “ridicule” the precious beliefs of Christians, but what is wrong with ridicule? What is wrong with protest, in this great country that cherishes the freedom of speech and the freedom of religion?,’ said Barker . Silverman said of the creationist billboards, ‘I would suggest, if they're actually trying to attract atheists, they should talk about proof and reason to believe in their god, not just some pithy play on words,’ Silverman said. The Answers in Genesis is hoping to attract more creationist followers with their video ad campaign. IRS filings for Answers show a yearly operating budget of more than $25 million. Ham said the marketing budget is about 2% of that, about $500,000 a year. The billboard war between the atheists and creationists may not have one winner yet, but one billboard certainly costs more than the other. Silverman noted that his billboards were not video and cost approximately $25,000 last year. He said that more atheist billboards would be appearing soon. The billboard war continues.","According to a study, 46 per cent of Americans believe in creationism .

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned delaying the recruitment of reservists would cause chaos . Defence Secretary Philip Hammond today agreed to hold an annual review of the fighting power of the Army Reserve in a bid to head off a Tory rebellion. The government faced a crunch Commons . vote after Conservative backbenchers threatened to delay plans to . expand the Army Reserve to 30,000 to offset cuts of 20,000 in regular . forces by 2020. Mr Hammond pleaded with Tory rebels not to derail his plans to replace thousands of professional soldiers with reservists. But he accepted a separate amendment which will require annual external reports to Parliament on recruitment and retention to the Army Reserves. The government is reducing the total standing armed forces to just 82,000 under plans to save billions of pounds, as the British military pulls out of Afghanistan. Ministers argue that having 30,000 reservists on standby will mean the UK is still able to launch a sustained military campaign lasting years if it was necessary. Figures released earlier this month showed the Army's reserve numbers fell from 19,220 in October 2012 to 19,090 in October 2013, raising further concerns about the ability to meet the Government's target. Opponents, led by Tory MP John Baron, warn recruitment targets have been ‘badly missed’, with costs rising and ‘herculean assumptions’ being made by the Military of Defence to ensure that the plan works. However, Mr Hammond argues that the cuts to the regular army are already being made, and halting the recruitment of reservists would cause more problems for the forces. ‘I believe it would be very confusing, very chaotic, for the Army to have the course on which it is set interrupted at this stage,’ he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme . ‘We cannot go back. The Army has set out a course, it's executing its plan and to halt that or to seek to reverse it at this stage would simply create confusion in the ranks.’ Top brass: Head of the Army Sir Peter Wall (left) has joined Mr Hammond in warning the Tory rebels against derailing the military reforms . Mr Hammond said he was ‘confident’ that the additional numbers of reservists needed under the plan would be delivered in the next five years. Military top brass also joined Mr Hammond in urging the rebels to back down. General Sir Peter Wall, the head of the Army, said: 'Increasing and rebuilding the Army Reserve is crucial to delivering the fighting force of the future. 'To reverse course at this stage would be . destabilising and damaging, leave a gap in our capability and deprive . talented young people of an opportunity to benefit from military . service.' Ringleader: Tory MP John Baron said the reaction to his call for delay had been 'hysterical' The threat of rebellion on an amendment to the Defence Reform Bill which would force the the Defence Secretary to report to Parliament on the ‘viability and cost-effectiveness’ of his plans appeared to recede after Mr Hammond's concession. It would have forced him to spell out in detail how he intends to implement his plans, and would not be permitted to go ahead without the approval of both Houses. Mr Baron claimed criticism of his amendment had ‘bordered on almost hysteria’. But Mr Baron told the BBC: ‘We have concerns about its viability and cost-effectiveness. There are a number of things that are not going right with this plan and the Government have not been able to answer our questions. ‘We have badly missed reserve recruitment targets, we have decline in TA (Territorial Army) numbers, costs are rising, there are herculean assumptions to make the plan work. ‘All we are saying with these amendments is they will stop the implementation of the Government's reservists plans until their viability and cost-effectiveness has been presented to and accepted by Parliament ... Some of the accusations against this amendment have bordered on almost hysteria.’ Retired officer Colonel Ian Brazier, who heckled Mr Hammond over cuts during his Tory party conference speech last month, warned the expensive plan could endanger lives. He said: 'Reserve recruitment is catastrophically failing to meet targets, and those reservists who are recruited will be dangerously under-trained. 'Providing only 40 days of training a year for is irresponsible and demonstrates a worryingly cavalier attitude towards lives.' The Territorial Army is set to be renamed the Army Reserve and minsters insist a new recruitment drive is already underway. Retired Colonel Ian Brazier (left) who heckled Mr Hammond at the Tory conference, warned the changes could put lives at risk . In a letter to potential rebels last night Mr Hammond said: 'I hope colleagues will support the Government in resisting John's amendment. 'To do otherwise will not only give a significant fillip to the Labour Party but, more significantly, would risk serious damage to our future armed forces. 'There is a very significant risk that halting, or threatening to halt, the implementation of measures in the Reserves White Paper would hit morale among the existing reserve forces, confuse employers, and make future recruitment a much more difficult task.'","Philip Hammond warns Conservative MPs it is too late to change course .

Terror journey: School bus driver Tia Denton carried out her afternoon shift while three times over the drink-driving limit, Columbus, Ohio police say . 'She's going to kill us!' screamed terrified children as their school bus driver sped through city streets while nearly three times over the limit, police and witnesses said. Tia Denton, 51, told police that she had drunk two beers and a 'tall cup' of whisky before setting off for her afternoon shift driving pupils home in Columbus, Ohio. Parents waiting for their children could only watch as she sped straight past stops and up and down the wrong streets after she took charge of the youngsters from Southwood Elementary on Monday afternoon. One concerned grandmother searching for her three grandchildren, who were about an hour late, found Denton's bus idling at a corner with its stop sign out and hazard lights flashing. Lisa Hass told the Columbus Dispatch of the moment she confronted the drunk driver. 'She said, ""I’m not an hour late."" She said, ""I don’t have your kids on my bus."" My granddaughter had walked to the front of the bus by that time,' said Ms Hass. She described how Denton had incredibly asked the other children still aboard the bus, none of whom were older than 12, which way to go next. Ms Hass went on: 'I asked my grandchildren if they were OK. They said they were scared, they were nervous. I said, ""Where have you been?"" (They) said, ""We don’t know. We’ve been all over the place.""' Concerned, she decided to follow the bus as it continued its erratic journey through the neighbourhood, still with its hazard lights flashing, its stop sign extended, and several terrified children still on board.

Ellen Richardson, who is paraplegic, went to Pearson airport to fly to New York City, where she was to embark on a Caribbean cruise.The agent who refused Richardson entry cited the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, Section 212, which denies entry to people who have had a physical or mental disorder that may pose a 'threat to the property, safety or welfare' of themselves or others. Refused: Ellen Richardson was looking forward to a 10-day Caribbean cruise but a U.S. border agent refused to let her fly to the States because of a 2012 hospitalization for depression . Holiday cancelled: Ellen Richardson never made it to New York from Toronto Pearson International Airport in Canada . According to The Star, the agent gave Richardson a document that said 'system checks' has uncovered details of her hospitalization and that she would need special clearance before being allowed entry into the States. Richardson is now left wondering how the agent had access to her private medical records. She had organized her cruise with about 12 others and paid $6,000 for the 10-day vacation. 'I was so aghast. I was saying, ""I don’t understand this. What is the problem?""' Richardson told the Star. 'I was so looking forward to getting away...

As a disabled person, Richardson cannot easily re-book her holiday, which takes a lot of planning and organization. In addition, she does not qualify for a refund for her trip because her insurer, Ingle International, does not cover clients who are denied boarding. According to the Star, in order to receive clearance to travel to the U.S., Richardson would have to examined by one of only three doctors in her native Toronto whose assessments are accepted by U.S. Homeland Security. Richardson has long suffered from mental illness. In 2001, she became paralyzed from the waist down after attempting suicide by jumping from a viaduct.

Despite this, she has traveled to the United States on three separate occasions since 2001, and no security agent has made mention of the attempt. The security agent who refused her entry to the States on Monday also seemed unaware of the suicide attempt, mentioning only Richardson's 2012 hospitalization.

More parents are giving their children middle names than ever before, with their use more than doubling in a century. Eighty per cent of children are now given a middle name, compared with the 37 per cent revealed in an audit of the 1911 census. Eleven per cent of children have at least two. Trend: Eight in ten children are now given a middle name, compared with 37 per cent in 1911 (file picture) The main reason for the trend is the commemoration of a family member, and most are traditional. James, John and William are the most popular for boys, and Louise, Rose and Grace top the girls’ list, according to research by the Ancestry.co.uk website. Some 55 per cent are selected to remember a loved family member, while 15 per cent have run in the family for generations. Miriam Silverman, of Ancestry.co.uk, said: ‘Middle names are a relatively new phenomenon, having only become the norm over the last 100 years, driven by the desire to commemorate ancestors. ‘This will have become particularly prominent following the two world wars. These affected the entire country and resulted in millions of Britons commemorating lost loved-ones as babies were born following the conflicts. Decision: The father is twice as likely to have a say with the middle name than the first name (file picture) ‘As a result, middle names are less likely to follow popular culture and more likely to reflect age-old traditions or names that were popular in our parents’ or grandparents’ generation – hence the very  traditional make-up of today’s top middle names.’ While most second names are commemorative, a small number of parents do opt to be more creative, with a significant minority (seven per cent) purposefully selecting more ‘colourful’ second names or taking inspiration from television, film, music or modern culture by having their middle name taken from a celebrity, fictional character or royalty (five per cent). When it comes to selecting the middle name, the father is twice as likely to have a say with the middle name than the first name (14 per cent compared to eight per cent), although both are most commonly chosen equally. 1 James2 John3 William4 Thomas5 David6 Robert7 Edward8= Peter8= Lee10= Christopher10= Alexander . 1 Louise2 Rose3 Grace4= Jane4= Elizabeth6 Anne/Ann7 May/Mae8 Marie9 Mary10= Amy10= Catherine .","Only 37 per cent of newborns were given a middle name in 1911 .

A British woman is being forced to bring up her daughter alone after her medic husband was denied permission to join her in the UK. Elizabeth Celi Parr met Ramiro Alexander Celi Moreno in his native Ecuador - the couple have been married for two years and had their first child, Olivia, 21 months ago. But despite his medical training, he has been banned from moving to Britain because the Home Office says the family does not earn enough to support itself. Family: But Elizabeth Celi Parr and Ramiro Alexander Celi Moreno are currently forced to live separately after he was denied permission to move to Britain to be with his wife and daughter Olivia . Wedding day: The couple were married in 2011 after meeting in Mr Moreno's native country of Ecuador . Ms Parr - the daughter of two Conservative councillors - says that both she and her husband have been offered jobs at the family firm and rent-free accommodation with her parents in Devon. 'I am a British citizen, we are happily married and both very skilled - I never thought for a moment I would not be allowed to come back to live in my own country with my husband,' the 29-year-old said. 'The ridiculous thing about not allowing Alexander to come here, where he could earn good wages, is that I am now a single mother. Were it not for my parents I would probably have to go on benefits. 'We would not be a burden and there is plenty of room here - even with me, my parents and my sister we are rattling around here. 'The Government idea is supposed to be to lessen the burden on taxpayers but it increases it - I cannot understand how these rules are helping anyone.' Alone: Ms Parr is now living with Olivia at her parents' home in Devon while fighting the Home Office . Father and daughter: A screengrab of a Skype conversation between Mr Moreno and Olivia . Ms Parr met Mr Moreno, 33, in 2006 - ironically, when she was struggling to secure an Ecuadorian visa allowing her to work as an English teacher. The pair wed in 2011 and lived in Argentina and Chile, but when Olivia was born they decided to settle near Ms Parr's family in Colyton. They were confident that Mr Moreno's background as an on-call doctor would enable him to secure a well-paid job, while Ms Parr was receiving maternity pay from her previous job at an investment bank. She was being paid £13,000 - but even though she had substantial savings, the application was refused because she did not meet the £18,600 threshold required by the Home Office in order to ensure that prospective immigrants can support themselves. A large proportion of British families would fail to meet the income requirement, which is much higher than the minimum wage. Together: Mr Moreno is not even allowed to visit the UK in case he stays in the country illegally . It was imposed by Home Secretary Theresa May in 2012 as part of Government attempts to reduce net immigration below 100,000 a year by the time of the next election. However, despite the crackdown which has left families such as Ms Parr's separated, citizens of Romania and Bulgaria will be allowed to come to Britain without any restrictions from January. In addition, the Government has struggled to deport a number of criminals and anti-British activists such as Abu Hamza and Abu Qatada, who both put up legal fights for years before finally being forced to leave the UK. Ms Parr lodged an appeal against the decision in April, and was told this month that she would have to go to court to contest the visa refusal. Mr Moreno is not even allowed to apply for a tourist visa to visit his wife and daughter for a short period, because officials say he might attempt to stay in Britain illegally. Heartbreak: Ms Parr insists the family is able to support itself thanks to her husband's medical training . Playing: Ms Parr is now working at her family firm, a traditional tannery based in Colyton . 'Myself and Olivia went over for a holiday in July, but it was a nightmare - I spent 24 hours travelling with a crying baby,' she said. Ms Parr has now set up a support group for other families in the same situation as her, and has met with the Archbishop of Westminster in a bid to further her cause. She is working as a project manager for the family business, a leather tannery named J & FJ Baker & Co Ltd which has been owned by her relatives for 150 years and still uses traditional oak bark techniques. Her father Andrew is chairman of the local parish council, while her mother Helen sits as a Conservative on East Devon district council. A spokesman for the Home Office said: 'Mr Celi Moreno’s application was refused because it did not meet the necessary financial requirements. As there is an appeal outstanding in this case it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage.'","Elizabeth Celi Parr married Ramiro Alexander Celi Moreno in Ecuador .

A widow whose husband died from a heart attack after being told four times he had indigestion and muscle ache has been awarded £100,000 compensation. Ian Jardine, of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, suffered pains in his chest and shortness of breath at work before he was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, Norfolk. However, medics in Accident and Emergency diagnosed the pain as a muscle ache and sent him home. He was also told to take painkillers and medication for indigestion. But Mr Jardine continued to suffer severe chest pains for more than a week and was twice sent away from his GP with medication for indigestion and painkillers. On his second trip home from the doctors’ surgery Mr Jardine was seriously ill and an ambulance was called. Paramedics advised Mr Jardine he should go to hospital but allowed him to decide against getting treatment. Mr Jardine died that night from a heart attack. After a four-year battle his wife Sharon, 49, has now been awarded £100,000 by Queen Elizabeth Hospital King’s Lynn NHS Foundation Trust in an out-of-court settlement. Mrs Jardine’s solicitor Jeanette Aspinall, of Fletchers Solicitors, said: 'A number of opportunities were missed for Mr Jardine to be correctly diagnosed, but not a single medical professional he met was able to correctly identify his life-threatening condition. After a four-year battle, Sharon has been awarded £100,000 by Queen Elizabeth Hospital King¿s Lynn NHS Foundation Trust . 'It should have been clear that something was seriously wrong.' Mr Jardine fell ill at work on June 12, 2009, and was taken to Queen Elizabeth Hospital by ambulance. He was diagnosed with a musculoskeletal problem before being sent home. The next day a second ambulance was called to Mr Jardine’s home but paramedics did not admit him to hospital telling him instead to rest. Two days later Mr Jardine was still in agony and went to his GP, but again he was told he had indigestion and given some painkillers. On June 19, Mr Jardine was still in pain and went back to his GP only to be given treatment for sickness and nausea and painkiller co-codamol. Medics in Accident and Emergency at Queen Elizabeth Hospital diagnosed the pain as a muscle ache . The next day Mrs Jardine’s lawyers say he went back and was dismissed with more pills for indigestion. An ambulance had to be called after Mr Jardine was seriously unwell on his way home from the surgery, but paramedics did not admit him. He died at home on June 20 from a coronary thrombus. Sir Bruce Keogh has highlighted the need to reform emergency health services . Solicitor Ms Aspinall says the case highlights the urgent need for reform in emergency health services, as highlighted by Sir Bruce Keogh, national medical director of NHS England earlier this month. She added: 'Under the proposed ""two-tier"" system, Mr Jardine would have been taken directly to a specialist centre where a competent professional would have been able to correctly diagnose his condition and potentially save his life. 'In his review, Bruce Keogh has rightly identified the importance of fast tracking such cases to the people best equipped to make an informed choice, rather than assuming all front line professionals have the ability to make the right judgement call in all circumstances.' A Queen Elizabeth Hospital spokesman said: 'We wish to apologise to Mrs Jardine and her family and to express our deep regret for the shortcomings in her husband’s care.' An East Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We accept that Mr Jardine’s medical condition was not diagnosed properly and, therefore, accepted liability for our part in that.

George Osborne said the UK's 'hard work is paying off' and the country is now 'on the path to prosperity' Britain could be back in the black within the next five years as the budget deficit is finally eliminated, a leading City think tank predicted last night. The Government is on course to record a surplus in 2017-18 as the economic recovery pushes up tax receipts and public spending is reined in, according to the report. It would be the first surplus since 2001 and would represent a remarkable turnaround after Labour’s borrowing culminated in a record shortfall of £158billion in 2010. The report, by the research group Capital Economics, will come as a boost to George Osborne ahead of his autumn statement next week. Simon Wells, chief UK economist at HSBC, said: ‘The economy has moved from a state of despair to repair.’ The Chancellor has said that the UK’s ‘hard work is paying off’ and the country is now ‘on the path to prosperity’ following the biggest boom and bust in British history. But the Treasury last night played down talk of significant giveaways in the statement on December 5. ‘The message will be that there is still much more work to do,’ said a source close to the Chancellor. ‘That doesn’t sound like a giveaway to me.’ Capital Economics has for a long time been pessimistic about the outlook for the UK and as recently as June was expecting the economy to grow by just 0.2 per cent this year. It now expects growth of 1.5 per cent for 2013 and 2.5 per cent in 2014, and said the Government was set to borrow £164billion less than previously thought over the next five years. But analysts warned that although the deficit was falling, the national debt has soared from around £300billion at the turn of the century to more than £1.2trillion today – and is expected to top £1.6trillion in 2017. ‘Mr Osborne will present his fourth autumn statement against a dramatically improved economic backdrop,’ said Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics. ‘But the big picture is that the fiscal consolidation still has a long way to go.’ Mr Wells at HSBC said: ‘The stronger recovery means that the public finances look better. ‘The Chancellor will argue that the policy of fiscal consolidation has been vindicated. But there is still much to do.’ The Bank of England (pictured) now expects the economy to grow by 1.6 per cent this year . The Office for Budget Responsibility is expected to upgrade its growth forecasts and pencil in lower borrowing when it publishes its latest outlook alongside the statement. And the Bank of England now expects the economy to grow by 1.6 per cent this year and 2.8 per cent in 2014 – far more than the 0.6 per cent and 1.8 per cent forecast by the OBR in March. Stronger growth is expected to feed through to the public finances as receipts from VAT, income tax and stamp duty rise, and spending on out-of-work benefits falls.","Government on course to record a surplus in 2017-18 as economic recovery pushes up tax receipts and public spending is reined in, according to report .

Police are looking into the Unite union’s campaign of alleged intimidation in the Grangemouth dispute. Scotland’s Chief Constable, Sir Stephen House, stepped in following complaints about the so-called leverage strategy used by Labour’s biggest donor during the dispute with the petrochemical firm Ineos last month. During the stand-off, the Mail revealed how Unite boss Len McCluskey deployed a dirty-tricks squad to target and humiliate the firm’s executives and their families. Rat run: Unite protest on the route of Ineos boss Jim Ratcliffe's local half marathon . One director said he feared for the safety of his wife and two young children after 30 Unite protesters descended on his drive in Dunfermline with a giant inflatable rat in the school holidays. Police were called after the group told his neighbours he was ‘evil’. No one was charged. The militants’ behaviour is being examined after Tory MP Priti Patel wrote to Sir Stephen, urging police to probe whether Unite’s actions breached the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. This makes it an offence for a trade unionist to ‘use violence’ or ‘intimidate’, or watch someone’s home or workplace. Miss Patel also suggested that Unite may have breached the Public Order Act 1986, which outlaws ‘any writing, sign or other visible representation which is threatening, abusive or insulting, thereby causing that or another person harassment, alarm or distress’. Missed out: Former Falkirk Council Leader Linda Gow said she was disappointed not to make the shortlist for Labour's parliamentary candidates . The daughter of a second Ineos company boss had ‘Wanted’ posters denouncing her father posted through her front door hundreds of miles away in Hampshire. Miss Patel has also asked Hampshire police to investigate. In a letter to Miss Patel, a spokesman for Sir Stephen said: ‘I can advise that the Chief Constable is looking into the matter and will provide a response in due course.’ The Grangemouth dispute has proved embarrassing for Labour. Unite members went on strike to back Stevie Deans, the union’s convenor at the plant. Mr Deans, who was also chairman of Falkirk West Labour Party, where he became embroiled in a vote-fixing scandal, was suspended by Ineos over claims he used company time for political campaigning. The Conservative Party accused the Labour leadership of failing to get to grips with Unite’s activities. Yesterday it also emerged that the Labour councillor who blew the whistle on the claims of vote-rigging in Falkirk has been snubbed by the party. Intervened: Stephen House, Chief Constable of the Police Service of Scotland, stepped in following complaints about the strategy of Labour's biggest donor . Former Falkirk Council leader Linda Gow, who alerted the party to allegations against Unite, said she was ‘disappointed’ not to be on the final shortlist for the election of Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate for Falkirk on December 8. Last night, Miss Patel said: ‘Ed Miliband is running scared of Len McCluskey’s bruisers. ‘Instead of hiding away in internal meetings, Ed Miliband should justify why he continues to take money from a union that is under police investigation. ‘If he’s too weak to stand up to the union bully-boys, he’s too  weak to stand up for hard-working people.’ A Unite spokesman said: ‘As a former apologist for the Bahrainian police state, it comes as no surprise that Priti Patel prefers wasting police time to score cheap political points and undermine the right to peaceful protest than representing her constituents.’","Scotland’s Chief Constable, Sir Stephen House, stepped in after complaints .

BBC star Lord Sugar today called for the axe to fall on the Corporation’s ‘layers of jobsworths’. The Apprentice frontman said the BBC should axe the bureaucrats and managers who obsess with penny-pinching and instead focus on producing world-class programmes. The Labour peer used a debate in Parliament complained that the BBC was ‘heavily overstaffed’ by people constantly looking over their shoulders worrying about their critics. Star: Lord Sugar is one of the BBC's best-known figures, fronting The Apprentice with Karren Brady and Nick Hewer . The criticism from one of the most high profile personalities comes after it emerged the BBC plans to bombard viewers with ‘aggressive’ TV adverts to justify the licence fee. Director General Lord Hall revealed this week that he would be ‘less British’ about defending the £145.50 annual. But Lord Sugar warned today: ‘Some of the management and the BBC Trust are fixated with cost cutting to try to appease the critics. ‘In adopting this posture they will fall behind by taking their eye off the ball and forgetting what their real aim is, to provide high quality, innovative content and entertainment for the British public,’ he warned. ‘They need to be there at the forefront competing for content instead of being complacent and accepting that their hands are financially tied.’ In a debate in the Lords he said the BBC was ‘heavily overstaffed’ and needed a more commercial approach to its work. BBC Director General Tony Hall has announced plans to run more adverts justifying the licence fee . ‘The BBC Trust is a complete and utter waste of time,’ he told the Lords. ‘It should be disbanded.’ The Labour peer said the BBC had the technical capability to keep up with competitors but was unable to compete with the ‘ruthlessness’ of the commercial market. ‘They seem hamstrung by external critics constantly referring to the £3.6 billion of licence fee payers funds being spent correctly so consumers get value for money.’ Lord Sugar said that for the licence fee the BBC provided 10 ‘brilliant’ channels of TV, quality news coverage and a ‘magnificent’ array of radio stations - providing ‘exceptional value for money’. But he said ‘oppression’ from outside influences had created a management constantly looking over its shoulder and forced to defend itself against ‘ridiculous criticism’. Although the nation should be proud of the BBC, he added: ‘They are heavily overstaffed and there are too many jobsworths - and the organisation is not run in a manner that a commercial organisation should be.’ There was a need for a more commercial approach with a board of directors who were prepared to ‘stand up and be counted’. Lord Sugar said the Government should not be allowed to interfere in the BBC. ‘Layers of jobsworths need removing and the money saved must be thrown into research and development and programming - and the ability to bid in a competitive market for other entertainment content and talent.’ His comments came in a debate on the contribution of the broadcast media to the UK economy.","Apprentice star accuses the BBC of being obsessed with critics .

The French anarchist accused of wounding a photographer in a Paris shooting spree had been convicted of domestic violence in Britain shortly before returning to France, it can be revealed today. Abdelhakim Dekhar, who is facing charges of attempted murder in France, was convicted in January of assaulting an ex-partner in Watford, Hertfordshire. He was sentenced at St Albans . Magistrates' Court to wear an electronic bracelet, carry out community . service and follow a curfew for six months while staying at an address in Aylesbury. He was also ordered to stay away from his ex-partner, a Latvian student named as Valentina A - who he attacked in September last year - and their two boys, born in 2004 and 2006. Scroll down for video . Assaulted ex-partner: Paris 'shotgun shooter' Abdelhakim Dekhar, seen here on CCTV at the Concorde underground station, was convicted of domestic violence in Britain before returning to France . His sentence ended on July 16, 2013, after which he went to France. He lost an appeal in October and was ordered to pay £400 (480 euros/ $650) in legal fees. 'The . rejection of his appeal on October 16 and, therefore, the definitive . nature of his domestic violence conviction, may explain his decision to . stay in France,' Newspaper Liberation wrote. Dekhar, . 48, was arrested on November 21 after a major manhunt following a . shooting at Liberation, a left-wing newspaper, that left a . photographer's assistant seriously hurt, and a separate incident where . shots were fired at the headquarters of the Societe Generale bank. He . is also accused of having hijacked a car during his escape and of . having a few days earlier threatened staff with a gun at the Paris . headquarters of 24-hour television news channel BFMTV. Address: The block of flats in Ilford, Essex, where Dekhar is listed as having lived between 2000 and 2003 . Accomplice: Dekhar was jailed for four years for supplying a gun to France's infamous 'Bonnie and Clyde' murderers Florence Rey, left and Audry Maupin, right, who . murdered three policemen and a taxi driver . Earlier this week, it was reported he had gone on hunger strike in prison. Dekhar . had moved to Britain in 1998, after serving a sentence in France for . his role in a famed 'Bonnie and Clyde' style shoot-out with police in . Paris in October 1994 that left five dead. Dekhar was convicted of having bought a shotgun used in the 1994 attack by student Florence Rey and her lover Audry Maupin. Liberation . also reported that Dekhar had in 2000 married a young Turkish student, . Gamze Aras, and that the couple had lived in Ilford northeast of London. Dekhar . has refused to cooperate with police but his DNA has matched samples . found at the scene of the attacks. In letters found after the attacks, . Dekhar railed against capitalism and accused the media of being involved . in conspiracies. Dekhar fled to England in 1999 to escape surveillance by French authorities after he served four years for supplying a weapon to revolutionaries Florence Rey and Audry Maupin - nicknamed 'France's Bonnie and Clyde' - who murdered three policemen and a taxi driver. Search: This CCTV image shows the alleged shooter sitting on a bench of a tramway station in Paris . Danger: The gunman aims his weapon and fires during an attack on a French television station BFM TV . He worked in London and married a . student in Redbridge in 2000, listing his address as a small flat close . to Ilford Methodist Church. He continued to live in England, where he also worked in a restaurant until July this year. His sister Farida Dekhar-Powell still lives in the Essex commuter town of Shenfield and teaches French. She said: ‘I stopped talking to him 20 years ago. He is not part of my life and that's how it stays.’ Dekhar . was arrested in an underground car park after taking . an overdose of sleeping pills in Bois-Colombes, a Paris suburb. It . was the dramatic end to a manhunt that started when . Dekhar allegedly critically wounded a photographer at the offices of Liberation . newspaper in Paris. He is then said to have . opened fire on the offices of the Societe Generale bank in La Defense . business district of Paris, before briefly taking a motorist hostage. Intent: CCTV from inside the television station captures the moment the gunman, dressed in a black sleeveless top and carrying a large dark sack, calmly walks down the stairs towards the reception . Close range: The wanted man gets to within a few feet before firing the shotgun . Escape: The suspect, who was described as white, in his 40s and shaven-headed, fled the scene . Dekhar's DNA matched genetic prints found on the shotgun cartridges the gunman used and the car he commandeered. Police said they . found letters written by Dekhar which referred to Islamism and . conflict-ravaged Arab countries including Libya and Syria. He also attacked the media and capitalism in general, saying they were both part of a ‘fascist plot’. Dekhar . spent four years in prison for buying a gun used in the 1994 attacks . by Florence Rey, a 19-year old student, and her lover Audry Maupin, who . murdered three policemen and a taxi driver. Mr . Maupin died in the chase, while Miss Rey, a fresh-faced student from a . middle-class family, claimed Dekhar was the ‘third man’ in the ‘Bonnie . and Clyde’ killing spree. Dekhar, . nicknamed ‘Toumi’ was under surveillance at the time, because of his . links with a variety of radical groups, including would-be Islamist . terrorists. Witnesses . at the trial in 1998 described him as a mentor to the couple and . accused him of exploiting their youth to manipulate them. In . the early 1990s he was known to hang out at squats that were used by . left-wing radicals and were often under police surveillance.

A baby girl choked to death on shepherd’s pie at a private nursery, an inquest heard yesterday. Nine-month-old Millie Thompson began coughing and spluttering and her lips turned blue as she was fed her lunch. Nursery staff pulled her from her high chair and desperately carried out first aid but within an hour she was dead. Her mother Joanne told the hearing she wanted answers about her daughter’s death. Addressing the jury while clutching one of Millie’s shoes, Mrs Thompson, 28, a quantity surveyor, said: ‘All I want to know is why my perfectly healthy daughter was dropped off somewhere she was supposed to be perfectly safe and then died. ‘How she can choke on shepherd’s pie I’ll never understand. ‘All we want to know is how this happened and to make sure that this never happens to anyone else ever again.’ Millie had been at the Ramillies Hall School and Nursery in Cheadle Hulme, near Manchester, for only three days when the tragedy happened on October 23 last year. She was a confident eater and had previously been given a range of foods including cucumber and bagels, the inquest heard. She had been dropped off at the nursery by her father Dan, 40, a building inspector. But as nursery supervisor Alison Pope, who has worked at the school for . 17 years, fed her shepherd’s pie, with a drink of water between each . mouthful, she started coughing and crying, and began to turn blue. Mrs Pope shouted for help. Nursery . assistant Samantha Sloan, who was trained in paediatric first aid, . helped clear Millie’s mouth and, holding  her face down, slapped her . back. Another nursery supervisor with first . aid training took  over as Miss Sloan went to call for an ambulance. Tragedy: Joanne and Dan Thompson with their daughter Millie, who died last year after choking at a nursery . Infant: The nine-month-old girl started coughing when she was fed shepherd's pie by nursery staff . Mrs Pope denied a suggestion by the Thompsons’ lawyer that she had . turned away to talk to a colleague at the time Millie began to choke. She also denied that she had panicked. She said that Millie ‘was making noises, if she’d have had something stuck she wouldn’t have been crying or coughing’. But in a statement given after . Millie’s death, Miss Sloan said that Mrs Pope was shouting and ‘really . panicking and flapping’, the inquest heard. By the time the ambulance arrived ten . minutes later, Millie had gone into cardiac arrest and less than an . hour later she was pronounced dead at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport. yesterday her mother Joanne delivered an emotional plea to the jury asking how the tragedy last October could have happened. Nursery: The incident took place at Ramillies Hall School in Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester . Parents: Mr and Mrs Thompson with Millie, who went into cardiac arrest after choking on the food . Clutching one of her daughter's . shoes, she said: 'All we want to know is how our perfectly healthy . daughter was dropped off where we felt she was safe and did not come . home that day. 'How could she have choked on mashed potato? All we want to know is how did this happen. 'We don't want any other parent to go through this.' She told South Manchester Coroner John Pollard that it was only her daughter's third full day at the school, which had been recommended to them. Mrs Pope recalled giving her five tiny mouthfuls of shepherd's pie, with drinks of water in between each bite, before she first coughed. 'A little bit of food came out,' she said. 'I picked her up out of the chair. She started coughing more and she started going blue.' Family: The couple pictured with Millie at a celebration during her short life . Daughter: Mrs Thompson issued an emotional plea at the inquest into Millie's death . She said that within seconds she passed Millie to nursery assistant Samantha Sloan, who was trained in paediatric first aid. Mrs Pope said they tried to clear her mouth of any food but there was no obvious blockage. Giving evidence, Ms Sloan said she gave Millie five slaps on the back and a brown liquid came out and on to the floor. She said she 'instinctively knew' she had to get out whatever was stuck in her throat as the youngster continued to struggle to breathe. When she rang for an ambulance, she said the call operator told her to keep Millie alert and put her on her side in case she vomited. 'That person said to ring back if anything changed and told me the ambulance was on the way,' she said. Inquest: Joanne and Dan Thompson were pictured outside Oldham Magistrates' Court today at the inquest into their daughter's death . Healthy: Millie's mother said that she did not have any serious pre-existing health conditions . Heartbreaking: The girl's parents have vowed to find out what happened to her . In her statement, she said that at . that stage she felt 'helpless', adding: 'I could see what was happening . and could not do anything.' When Millie was being treated at the scene she said she thought Millie 'was not going to make it'. Nursery supervisor Clare Thomas held . Millie on her side in the school entrance area after the ambulance was . called and said her breathing remained shallow but her lips were no . longer blue. She kept on talking to her and Millie responded, remaining conscious until the ambulance arrived. Ms Thomas said she would have performed CPR if she felt it was needed, but added that did not know exactly what was wrong with the baby. 'I am a first aider,' she said. 'My job is to preserve life. I am not medically trained to know what the problem is.' Mr and Mrs Thompson have started Millie's Trust, a charity which offers free first-aid training for carers . Nursery supervisor Maria Royal said in her statement that Millie 'did not look right' and appeared unwell at the entrance area. She went on to say her lips were blue but Ms Thomas was taking care of the youngster and 'seemed to be coping fine'. The inquest was told that other witnesses would say Millie was limp at this point and her eyes were closed. Nursery assistant Sandra Clark witnessed Millie being cradled by Ms Thomas, and said the girls arms were limp while her lips had turned blue and her eyes were shut. In her statement she added: 'I got the impression that Millie was not going to survive.' The hearing continues, and is scheduled to last three days.","Millie Thompson was being fed mashed-up pie by staff at private nursery .

Regret: Amanda Chadwick, above, said she will have to deal with the guilt of the murder for the rest of her life . The mistress who believed her lover’s lie that his suspicious wife had died in an accident – and carried on their affair after her death – has spoken for the first time about the shattering aftermath after he was found guilty of murder. Amanda Chadwick broke down in tears as she spoke of her guilt at being duped by welder Alan Evans, who was jailed for life last week for killing his wife Louise after she confronted him about the affair. Chadwick, 30, a mother-of two, admitted that she was blinded by love for Evans. She sobbed: ‘It’s because of me that a lovely little family has been destroyed. It’s my fault. Why did she have to die? ‘I trusted him, I believed everything he told me. This is hard. I’ve spent the last year of my life living a lie. I thought Al was innocent. ‘I have lost everything. I’ve got to deal with this even though its never going to go away. ‘I’ve got to deal with the guilt for the rest of my life.’ Chadwick, who gave evidence during the trial but was not there to hear the verdict, said she could not explain why she had had the affair. She said she was lucky that Evans had not turned on her as well, saying: ‘I think it could have been me. Yes, at least I’m alive.’ She added: ‘I don’t want my children to go through any more. My son is seven and my daughter is 11. She’s taken Lou’s death very hard because she was a friend. ‘Whatever I say, nothing is going to change what people think of me.’ Chadwick’s mother Jayne said her daughter was ‘absolutely devastated’. She said: ‘She thought he  was innocent. Him being found guilty was a shock because she trusted him. Guilty: Alan Evans left, murdered his wife, Louise, left, by throwing her down the stairs after a row . ‘She has been made to look terrible in the media. It’s not the person she is. We are a really nice family. She’s my daughter. I have to protect her. She needs to protect her children.’ Chadwick’s four–month affair with Evans began after the pair met in the playground of the school she worked at as a teaching assistant. Her two children attended the school as did his daughters – twins aged six and a five-year-old. The couple began meeting regularly so their children could play together but the friendship soon escalated and they would book rooms at low-cost hotels or even share each other’s marital beds when their partners were away. Evans sent Chadwick thousands of text messages, many of a sexually explicit nature, and she sent him thousands back. Evans, who worked as a welder, claimed during . the trial his 32-year-old wife (pictured) had tripped and fallen as he . slept in the lounge on the night of July 9 last year . To disguise the affair, Evans encouraged his wife, a care worker, to make friends with Chadwick  and her husband, and the couples would go for walks together. Evans admitted to the court that his wife was suspicious. Mrs Evans, a care worker, confronted him after she discovered evidence of the text messages, and warned Chadwick that she would report her to the school. Evans successfully begged his wife of 12 years to stay with him and promised to break contact with Chadwick. He persuaded his mistress to send him texts making it look like their relationship was over. But the couple continued to plan for a life together, even talking about having children. Worcester Crown Court heard how, on July 9, Evans, 35, pushed his wife Louise, 32, down the stairs at their home and put a skipping rope next to her body to make it look like an accident. Grieving: Louise Evans mother, Judith Bollen, above, said her 'happy world' had been shattered by the murder of her daughter . He also placed a vacuum cleaner at the top of the stairs and claimed that she tripped and fell while he was asleep on the sofa in the living room of their home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire. The court heard that Evans had pushed or thrown her down the stairs after punching her four  times, then smothered her as she  lay unconscious. Three months after his wife’s death, Evans and Chadwick went on holiday to Wales as a couple to celebrate her mother’s birthday, where she introduced him to her family. The court was shown photographs of the pair cuddling together on a beach in Wales. In a victim impact statement read to the court after the verdict, Mrs Evans’s mother said she could not believe Evans had rekindled his affair with his mistress after killing his wife. Judy Bollen said: ‘How could he? I just thought, “Louise is still in a freezer at the mortuary and he  is starting a life with  that woman who hurt her so much”. ‘Louise was unhappy for the final months of her life because of them, and he was just carrying on like she meant nothing.’ She added: ‘How do we tell three little girls that their daddy murdered their mummy?’ Chadwick now lives in South Wales, after moving away from Kidderminster with her children and has split from her husband.

Inquiries carried out in the area of the murder have uncovered evidence that the victim could have been Abdullah Jan Agha . Relatives of a Royal Marine sergeant found guilty of murdering a Taliban insurgent last week are living under military guard amid fears that revealing his identity could pose a security risk. Marine A, as he was referred to throughout a court martial, is expected to be named by a judge before he is sentenced for the execution of a badly wounded enemy captive in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, two years ago. But senior military sources fear the lifting of reporting restrictions could lead to revenge attacks by Islamic radicals. Protective measures around Marine A’s family have been increased in light of the potential threat. A source close to Marine A’s family said: ‘Obviously they recognise there is an increased risk but the wider family of the Royal Marines is providing full support, which they are very happy with and grateful for. They are also appreciative of the sympathetic coverage he has received in the media.’ Marine A’s lawyers are to appeal against Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett’s verdict that the anonymity order should be lifted. The appeal is backed by Marine B and Marine C – who were cleared of the same charge – as they too face being named. Many military figures believe the anonymity order should remain in place. But last night Admiral Lord West, a former Chief of the Naval Staff, told The Mail on Sunday he thought Marine A should be named. Marine A will today attend a Remembrance Sunday service at the Colchester Military Corrective Training Centre. He is expected to remain there until December 6, when he will be sentenced and transferred to a civilian prison. Former Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Lord West, pictured with Gordon Brown in 2007, said Marine A must be named. The soldier had said: 'Obviously this doesn't go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention' Evidence: Footage captured by a camera mounted . on the helmet of a Royal Marine and played during the court martial . proceedings recorded the moment the soldier shot dead the insurgent in . an Afghan field . A foreign field: After a two-and-a-half week . trial, a seven-strong military board found Marine A guilty. His comrades - . named only as Marine B and Marine C - were cleared after nine hours of . deliberations . Recording: The footage recorded on Marine B's . helmet camera showed Marine A, a highly respected non-commissioned . officer, order his men to move the captive out of sight of cameras on a . surveillance balloon . Scene: . The prosecution said a single gun shot was fired into the heavily . injured insurgent's chest at this spot, shown in the video which has . been blocked from release in case it is used for propaganda by jihadi . websites . Audio: 'It's nothing you wouldn't do to us,' a soldier is heard saying in the recording after the shot is fired . The matter of whether Marines A, B and C – and Marines D and E against whom all charges were dropped – will be named will be decided by the Court Martial Appeal Court later this month. Yesterday, Prime Minister David Cameron pledged his support for the Royal Marines. He said: ‘I want to say a big thank you to the Royal Marines for the incredible work you have done in Afghanistan over the last decade. I believe we will be able to leave that country with our heads held high.’ A distinguished Royal Marines commander, Major General Julian Thompson, added that it was important to remember that Marine A was subject to the ‘unique pressures of war’ when he illegally shot the wounded Afghan on September 15, 2011. He said: ‘I am sad for the man who did it, in that he probably had a moment of stupidity. I feel for him as I would my own son who might do something stupid.’ Marine A was convicted after footage emerged of him shooting the insurgent at close range in the chest. Major General Julian Thompson, a Falklands War veteran, said it was important to remember Marine A had been subject to the 'unique pressures of war'. He added: 'He probably had a moment of stupidity' As the man convulsed on the ground, Marine A told him: ‘There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil, you ****. It’s nothing you wouldn’t do to us.’ He then turned to comrades and said: ‘Obviously this doesn’t go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention.’ A total of 30 British soldiers have been investigated over shooting incidents involving members of the Afghan Security Forces or insurgents since 2006. Of the 30 soldiers, marines and airmen investigated in 22 separate inquiries, only three have faced court martial and only one – Marine A – has been convicted. the figures were revealed by a Mail on Sunday Freedom of Information request.","Identity of killer soldier 'Marine A' could soon be lifted when he is sentenced .

It's the bane of drivers on country roads that can add long delays to your journey – but now ministers have pledged to speed up slow-moving tractors. The Department of Transport has put forward a proposal to raise the tractor speed limit to 25mph in a bid to make farmers and rural transport more efficient, and give a multi-million-pound boost to the economy. Ending the current 20mph limit would bring Britain into line with other countries in the EU, as well as shaving time off those frustrating delays for drivers who find themselves stuck in a slow-moving convoy of traffic behind a tractor. Tailback: The move would see farmer's rural transport become more efficient, according to ministers . In a consultation document released last week, the department argues that the current 20mph speed limit for tractors does ‘not reflect the capabilities of modern farm machinery, forcing farmers to drive unnecessarily slowly on public roads’. The productivity boost to farmers  from increasing the speed limit by 5mph has been calculated to save farmers £89.72 million a year – or more than  £1.13 billion over ten years. The figures were calculated on the basis of shorter journey times, greater fuel economy and improved productivity. Transport Minister Robert Goodwill announced a 90-day public consultation into the changes. Backing the changes to help the economy, he said: ‘It would also mean that motorists who get frustrated behind a tractor would not be travelling quite as slowly.’ Up to speed: The move would see British farmers brought in line with their European colleagues who are already able to drive at 25mph .","Department of Transport wants to raise limit from 20mph to 25mph .

Error: Marks & Spencer has been forced to recall thousands of its 2014 calendars, pictured, and diaries after getting the date of Father's Day wrong . Struggling Marks & Spencer has been forced to recall thousands of calendars and diaries after getting the date of Father’s Day wrong. The retailer, which has just reported a  9.1 per cent slump in half-year profits, blamed a supplier for the mistake that lists Father’s Day as June 22 instead of June 15. Although only ten per cent of the print-run had been delivered, the recall will do no favours for the brand as it tries to bolster its reputation. Customers who spot the embarrassing error will be refunded and given a £5 voucher, the store said. Signs put up at tills read: ‘Sorry, the date’s off! Our 2014 diaries and calendars have been printed with the wrong date for Father’s Day. If you bought one before October 25, 2013, we’ll happily exchange it or offer you a full refund.’ A member of staff in Kensington, West London, added: ‘We haven’t had many customers return theirs yet but the sign’s not been up long. 'I just feel sorry for whoever made the mistake as it’ll cost them a fortune.’ The gaffe heaps further pressure on  M&S. An autumn relaunch of its womenswear range saw Dame Helen Mirren, 68, Tracey Emin, 50, and pop star Ellie Goulding, 26, star in its Leading Ladies advertising campaign. But behind the scenes bosses were given a stern ticking off after key items were not sufficiently restocked. A heavily advertised £89 pink coat was lauded by the fashion press but sold out as soon as it hit the stores. Embarrassing: The retailer, which has just reported a 9.1 per cent slump in half-year profits, blamed a supplier for the mistake that lists Father's Day as June 22 instead of June 15 . M&S has promised to stock 40 per cent more of the items featured in its Christmas ad as a precaution. Fashion directors have also been criticised for producing poor fashion in awful colours, confusing store layout and overly crammed rails. An M&S spokesman said: ‘Unfortunately, due to a supplier print error we have temporarily withdrawn our 2014 calendars and diaries from sale.’","Marks & Spencer forced to recall thousands of 2014 calendars and diaries .

The leader of Unite, Britain's biggest union, is facing an investigation into claims his election included the balloting 160,000 'phantom' members. Voting papers were also sent to some dead former members in the election of Unite's general secretary Len McCluskey, his opponents allege. Jerry Hicks, who lost the election to Mr McCluskey, in April, this year, has called for the election to be re-run. Unite's general secretary Len McCluskey is facing a probe into claims his election included the balloting of 160,000 'phantom members' including some who had died . He said 158,000 ballot papers were sent to members no longer paying fees between December last year and January this year. According to Mr Hicks, the Unite union . return for December 31, 2012, was 1,346,414 members with up-to-state . addresses on the union's system. However, 140,000 people more than that were balloted. The Certification Office, which regulates unions, has launched an investigation into the claims, according to The Sunday Times. Mr Hicks is being represented by barrister Jody Atkinson, who previously succeeded getting a re-run a UCATT election. Mr Atkinson said: 'It appeared that Unite . had been balloting people who had left the union, most likely because . they had not paid their subscriptions. 'And it seems that ballot papers . have been sent to people who have not been members for years.' Mr Hicks received almost 80,000 votes, while Mr McCluskey won 144,570. The claims comes after accusations of attempted vote rigging by Unite in the safe Labour seat of Falkirk (pictured) He said he wants Unite's leadership 'to explain why people who weren't members of the Unite union could vote in the election of its General Secretary. So far I've been offered no explanation.' Mr Hicks added in a statement on his website: 'The leadership got arrogant about their own power. They are paid six figure sums and have lost touch with ordinary members.' Unite deny any ballots were sent out to ineligible members. A spokesman for the union said the members Mr Hicks refers to 'were in arrears' and therefore allowed to vote. A Unite spokesman said: 'Mr Hicks has already been given a response on this matter by the independent Electoral Reform Services, which acted as Returning Officer for the General Secretary election. 'The members referred to were in arrears and under rule entitled to vote in the General Secretary election.  Because they are in arrears they are not included in Unite’s declared membership figures. 'Unite is fully confident that this was a proper decision, that the election was conducted with integrity and in full conformity with the law, and that the outcome cannot be called into question. Unite has been accused of signing up members to the Labour Party if they were likely to vote for the union's candidate Karie Murphy (pictured) 'It is regrettable that Mr Hicks should seek to do so – however, Unite will cooperate fully with any inquires the Certification Officer may choose to make on the basis of his complaint.' It is the latest controversy to emerge involving Mr McCluskey and Unite in recent days. He has become embroiled in accusations Unite tried to rig the parliamentary selection process in the safe Labour seat of Falkirk. Unite, which has given Labour £8million since the last General Election, were accused of trying to rig the selection process for a parliamentary candidate but were cleared by the Labour Party in September. The union was accused of coercing members to join the Falkirk Labour Party and some people said they were signed up without their knowledge. The Sunday Times today published emails it says suggest Unite activists broke rules about the selection process. It claims Unite signed up members to the Labour Party and paid for their first year of membership if they were likely to vote for the union's candidate Karie Murphy.","Jerry Hicks says non-paying Unite members included in ballot .

A thrillseeker who has traveled the world to dive into its dingiest caves has shared stunning photographs of his favorite one yet - a 1,200-foot-deep hole in Mexico that is so deep, clouds form inside. Dave Bunnell, a 61-year-old adrenaline junky from Delaware, has traveled to 18 different countries to take on dozens of the world's dingiest pits - and his favorite is Mexico's astonishing El Sotano de las Golondrinas, also known as 'the Basement of Swallows', in San Luis Potosi. These stunning images of the cave - one of the world's most dramatic free fall pits and a natural wonder than attracts thousands of cavers each year - show the moment he and his fellow divers plunge into the cave, passing through the clouds inside. Scroll down for video . Stunning: Cave diver Dave Bunnel, 61, captured these stunning images of him diving into Mexico's El Sotano de las Golodrinas, The Basement of Swallows . Getting there: Cave divers plunge through the clouds that have gathered inside the cave and head to the bottom of the 1,200-ft-deep hole . Dave, an avid photographer, said the spectacular clouds, which form when humidity comes into contact with colder air, provide a perfect opportunity for him to take stunning pictures. He set up equipment on the cave floor below to capture the remarkable images. 'I started caving when I was 21, as part of a university outdoors club - I'd already been backpacking and rock climbing with them,' he explained. 'A couple of girls I was interested in were going caving, so I signed up and never looked back. I've since traveled all over the world, enjoying some of the most beautiful natural sights on the planet. 'It's such a different world it sometimes seems like being on another planet. So the other-worldliness of it, and that you never know what may lay around the next corner, when exploring a new cave, even a small one can give you these feelings like no other.' Breathtaking: Bunnell, who has been cave diving for 40 years, painstakingly set up cameras to capture the moment he and his teammates plunged inside . Massive: A close-up of the cave floor shows figures of the climbers gathered at its base, revealing just how large the cave is . The pit was first descended in . December of 1967 by a trio of Americans. Its total depth is 1,638ft . although the final few hundred feet accessible are only accessible . through a pit series called The Crevice. It gets its name, the Basement of Swallows, thanks to the birds that fly above its opening. Dave added: 'These caves are spectacular and it's easy to see why so many people visit them every year. 'My . other favorites include Lechuguilla in New Mexico, the caves of Mulu in . Borneo, the amazing Xe Bang Fai river caves in Laos, the blue and green . caves of France, the amazing lava tubes in Hawaii, and sea caves . anywhere but especially the California Channel Islands and New Zealand. 'By . far the best way to get into caving is to hook up with a club or grotto . as they are called in the USA. Take a beginner's oriented trip.

Tina Martin gave birth to miracle baby Tassiah by caesarian section in January after 35 weeks of pregnancy despite having three organ transplants . A woman has given birth to a 'miracle' baby after undergoing three organ transplants. Tina Martin, 43, gave birth to healthy 4lb baby Tassiah in January by caesarian section after 35 weeks of pregnancy. Doctors had told her the little girl was unlikely to survive because of her frail condition and the drugs she was taking to make sure the organs would be accepted. Mrs Martin was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes aged seven and was given two kidney transplants, donated by her mother and brother, and a pancreas transplant, from a dead donor. She was told that the birth was an 'absolute miracle' and health officials now believe that Mrs Martin is the oldest person to give birth following a kidney and pancreas transplant. Speaking to The Sunday Times, Dr Jonathan Kwan, Mrs Martin's consultant at the Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital, said: 'It is an absolute miracle that Tina managed to give birth to this little wonder, Tassiah, under the most adverse set of clinical circumstances. The odds were totally stacked against her. 'There cannot be many, if any, patients in the world who suffer from diabetic end stage kidney disease, who have a 10-year history of kidney failure treatment, who have been on dialysis and subsequently received three transplanted organs, and then managed to conceive successfully, never mind producing a healthy baby.' Mrs Martin has two previous children who were also delivered by caesarian section, though before she had triple set of transplants. The most recent operation was performed by Rachel Sturley and was complicated by the number of transplanted organs in Mrs Martin's abdomen. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that attacks the pancreas and stops the body producing insulin . When organs fail they are not removed unless they are causing medical problems. Martin, who lives in Seaton, Devon, with her husband Neil, said: 'The obstetricians really did prepare me for the worst and were quite sure that the worst would happen.' Since the birth Mrs Martin's pancreas, the third she has been given, has failed and she has been told she must wait until a year after the birth before the old one can be taken out and a new one put in. As she is a small woman, surgeons cannot implant another organ without removing a failed one as there is not enough space left. Mrs Martin has also gone blind due to her illness but remains optimistic about the future. Type 1 diabetes is an auto immune disease which usually develops in teenagers, and only affects about 10 per cent of diabetes sufferers in the UK. It occurs when the immune system attacks the cells of the pancreas, destroying the body's supply of insulin which is responsible for taking glucose into cells. Without insulin blood sugar levels can become dangerously raised, damaging blood vessels, tissues and organs. While regular blood sugar tests and injections of insulin can manage the disease, there is no cure.","Tina Martin has suffered from Type 1 diabetes since age seven .

Top Shop boss Sir Philip Green told the High Court today how he lent his fallen tycoon friend Scot Young £80,000 to help with the purchase and rent on his former family home. The 61-year-old billionaire said in a witness statement: 'Scot explained his financial position to me and explained the problems he was having and asked me if I could help which I agreed to do.' Mr Young, 51, and his estranged wife . Michelle, 49, are fighting over money at a trial in the Family Division . of the High Court in London. Philip Green told the High Court he'd lent his friend Scot Young, right, money because he was having problems . Mrs Young, who says Mr Young is worth 'a few billion at least' and that 'there was a vast fortune hidden', claims he has hidden assets and has been helped out by his rich friends. Mr Young is fighting his estranged . wife's claim for a £300million divorce settlement, claiming he has lost . his £400million fortune and is £28million in debt. He says he went into 'meltdown' in 2006, and is now penniless and bankrupt. 'I have known Mr Young for about 10 or 15 years,' Sir Philip told the judge.  'I got introduced to him. I cannot remember how or where. I sort of became a friend. 'I wasn’t in business with him. I believe my family was offered an investment [in a company].  I think we made an investment in that company.' He said he had never been involved in property deals with Mr Young and denied holding any sums of money on behalf of Mr Young. Michelle Young, 49, says her estranged husband, who is engaged to Noelle Reno, 29, is worth 'a few billion' A lawyer representing Mrs Young asked . Sir Philip what impression he had of Mr Young’s wealth prior to his . 'demise as he puts it' in 2006. 'No idea,' said Sir Philip. 'I assume . he was doing business. He was comfortable. I don’t ask people I do . business with what their banks statements are.' Sir Philip said he lent Mr Young £50,000 in September 2008 from his personal bank account to provide part of the deposit for the purchase of a house in Regents Park terrace, and a further £30,000 three months later for rent on the same property. He said the loans had not yet been repaid. As he left the court, Sir Philip handed Mrs Young's QC Rex Howling a cheque made out to himself for £50 to cover the cost of his witness statement. He told Mr. Howling: 'Give this back to your client', and Mrs Young smiled when the cheque was handed to her. The Youngs, who married in 1995 and have two grown-up daughters, are fighting over money in the High Court . Richard Caring, the billionaire owner of restaurants The Ivy and Caprice, followed Sir Philip into the witness box. He told the court he had loaned Mr. Young £50,000 to help him with his legal bills in September 2009. He said in a statement: 'The reason I lent Mr Young this money is that I have known him for many years and he explained his financial position to me and explained the problems he was having. 'I decided to help him and his family.' Under cross examination by Mr. Howling he said he had known him for about 20 years after being introduced as a close friend of a friend. He had invested some money in one of Mr.Young’s business ventures, but lost his money. Friend: Restaurateur Richard Caring told the court he had lent Mr Young £50,000 to help with legal bills . He said he had not been repaid the £50,000 but did not expect to be. The Youngs married at Chelsea Register Office in March 1995 and split up in 2006. They have two daughters, Scarlett, 20, and Sasha, 18. Mr Young is now engaged to 29-year-old model Noelle Reno, a former lover of banking heir Matthew Mellon, with whom he lives in South Kensington. Mrs Young was granted a divorce in February on the grounds of Mr Young's unreasonable behaviour but will not agree to the divorce being made absolute, allowing Mr Young to marry the younger woman, until the financial arrangements are sorted out to her satisfaction. Mr Young has been made bankrupt by the taxman over a £1.8m debt and claims to be penniless and living off of the generosity of friends. The court heard how three years ago Mr Young was ordered to pay Mrs Young £27,500 a month in maintenance, but has never paid a penny and now owes her almost £1 million. Mrs Young, who lives in Victoria, claims he has hidden assets abroad of up to £2 billion, and that he is still eating at top restaurants and visiting exclusive West End clubs. She also claims he has been seen driving a Ferrari, and is living in luxury while she struggles. Mr Young has admitted carrying round cash of £300 to £400 and receiving substantial cash gifts from 'friends' of £10,000, £7,000, and £5,000. The hearing continues with judgment due to be given next Friday.

A British diver is among four people held by police after they were caught red handed on the wreck of the Costa Concordia hunting for souvenirs. The 42-year-old man from London, who has not been named and the others, an Irish man, 35, and two South Africans, 24 and 26, were all staff of the salvage group Titan - which had been employed in the laborious operation to raise the Concordia from the seabed. Police said the men were spotted by CCTV cameras positioned around the vessel in the early hours of Saturday morning and a boat was immediately dispatched to the scene to investigate. Arrest: A British diver has been arrested after being caught aboard the Costa Concordia, pictured, allegedly hunting for souvenirs . Titan has now dismissed all four men and they have been bailed by authorities in Grosseto, Tuscany until they appear before a court at a later date accused of theft and of breaching a sealed crime zone. Lt Elisabette Spoti, of the paramilitary carabinieri police, said: 'The men were spotted by CCTV's positioned facing the Concordia and the security firm employed alerted us, and Titan as to the unauthorised presence of the four men. 'They were caught red handed with the ruck sack and the suspicion is they were trying to take items from the ship as souvenirs. They should not have been anywhere near the vessel as it is still a crime scene and as such sealed off. 'When they were held they had with them in their possession a rucksack with the Costa Concordia emblem on it. They had no permission to be on the ship and they were caught at 1.30am in the morning when no salvage operation was ongoing. Red handed: The British man, 46, and the three other men caught in the early hours of Saturday morning were all employees of Titan - the group hired to raise the ship from the seabed, pictured . Disaster: The ship capsized off the coast of Giglio Island, pictured, in 2011, killing 32 people . 'We are also carrying out checks to establish what exactly the role of the four men held was during the salvage operation.' Lt Spoti refused to say whether there were other items inside the rucksack, but added all four had been charged with theft and violating a crime scene. She said the matter was now in the hands of the prosecutor at Grosseto where their trial will be held. She added they were found by deck 8, named Portugal, of the 13 deck ship and that area has several outside cabins as well as executive staterooms - and all of them have safes inside. Another police source said: 'The men said they were just looking for a few souvenirs and that they had no intention of taking anything personal, expensive or that would be of use to the investigation but that is not the issue. It is still a crime scene.' On trial: Captain Francesco Schettino, pictured, is currently on trial accused of multiple manslaughter, causing a disaster and abandoning a ship . Titan said in a statement: 'Four employees have been dismissed after they were identified onboard the Costa Concordia without permission and in a zone that is off limits. The matter is now in the hands of the local authorities.' It is not the first time that the wreck has been targeted by thieves - three months after she ran aground divers discovered that the ship's iconic brass bell, engraved with her name and the date she was launched had been stolen. The 290 metre Costa Concordia luxury liner, carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew, struck a reef off the island of Giglio in January 2012 after captain Francesco Schettino changed course in order to carry out a sail by salute. Thirty two people died in the disaster and last month the ship was pulled upright after a laborious operation lasting more than a year. The remains of one of the two people still missing were discovered in the cruise liner. Schettino is currently on trial accused of multiple manslaughter, causing a disaster and abandoning a ship with passengers and crew still onboard. Meanwhile authorities have given permission for divers to open the hundreds of cabin safes that have now become accessible since the ship was straightened so that possessions can be reunited with passengers.","The unnamed 42-year-old man was an employee of salvage group Titan, hired to raise the Costa Concordia from the seabed .

Tragedy: Photographer Gerry Coyle, 65, who fell to his death trying to capture the perfect sunset at a mountain top at dusk . A talented photographer who had a passion for sunsets died after falling 500ft off a mountain top at dusk, an inquest heard. Gerry Coyle, 65, was trying to capture sundown at the 3,500ft peak of Mount Snowdon in Wales last October. He had set up his tripod and camera at the summit of the highest peak in England and Wales, at the end of a fortnight's photographic tour of Britain's west coast. But his inquest heard yesterday that he walked off the recognised path and fell as he tried to take a dramatic picture. His body was not discovered for six months in a deep gulley. The inquest heard climbers eventually stumbled across his abandoned tripod and camera a long way from the well used tourist path. A police helicopter was called out and officers spotted his body at the bottom of a steep ravine. John Grisedale, chairman of Llanberis mountain rescue team, said: 'It seems he had gone way off the path to get a good photo.' He said there was loose scree near the edge of the ravine and he may have fallen 500ft to his death. Father-of-two Mr Coyle, from Rugby, Warwickshire, was found in April after he vanished off the mountain in October. The retired IT engineer and member of Dunchurch Photographic Society had been on a two week photographic tour of the west coast of Britain. Photographic society member Bob Mercer said: 'He went away on his own with his camera equipment photographing sunsets and scenery down the west coast.' Trademark: Mr Coyle had a passion for photography, here is an example of his work, but an attempt to capture sundown on Snowdon led to his death, an inquest heard . Dream trip: Mr Coyle fell from the top of Mount Snowdon, in North Wales, but was not located for another six months . Gerry posted a final message on Facebook the night before scaling Mount Snowdon to capture the perfect picture. On 24 October he wrote: 'In Llanberis at the moment. Completed 1300/1500 miles. 'Intend to get to the top of Mount Snowdon tomorrow by train or bike as do not have much time. 'Tomorrow night due in Barmouth and Mawddach Estuary.' He reached the top of the mountain by narrow gauge steam train the next morning and was last seen at the summit cafe at 1pm. Talented: Gerry also loved architecture, as this photo shows, and his inquest heard he had embarked on a two week photography holiday . Stunning: This image, called Peak Crag, won Gerry Coyle acclaim in various competitions, and is an example of how he enjoyed black and white photography as well as colourful sunsets . He sent a text message to his wife Pat telling her he had arrived safely at the top of the 3560ft peak. But when Gerry failed to return to his hotel for the night a huge search and rescue mission was put into place. Caernarfon Coroners Court heard Llanberis Mountain Rescue Team, RAF Valley Mountain Rescue Team, members of Search and Rescue Dogs Association Wales were all involved in the hunt. And a helicopter from Prince William's base at RAF Valley on Anglesey was also called out but failed to find him in the days following his disappearance. North Wales coroner Nicola Jones recorded a verdict of accidental death.","Gerry Coyle, 65, fell from the 3,500ft Welsh peak last October .

Jon Byler Dann survived the EF4 tornado that struck Illinois on Sunday in the basement of his house clutching his four children and wife. He found Maggie the dog 30 hours later buried in the rubble of his home . After emerging from under the rubble of his home, a heartbroken Mr Dann posted a picture on Facebook of his obliterated house on Monday and added the message: 'We lost Maggie today.' However there was some good news for Mr Dann, his wife Rebecca Jane and four children aged eight, five, two and a half and 18 months old. After 30 hours of digging through the remains of their house a faint bark could be heard and Maggie was found - buried but very much alive. The father posted a picture of his beloved companion on Monday with the message: 'Maggie found!!!' Mr Dann told weather.com: 'I felt intense relief and elation but also just panic.

The couple and four young children lost their home in Washington but miraculously found the family dog buried beneath the rubble . Residents of Washington, a downstate town of 15,000, were left to pick up the pieces and begin recovering from the disaster. Mayor Gary Manier said authorities were keeping evacuated residents away out of concern that the remaining structures were dangerously unstable.

When President Obama came under fire Tuesday for choosing to skip the ceremony commemorating the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, a senior White House aide tweeted sarcastically that 'it didn't work schedule-wise' because his boss was too busy working to fix the Obamacare website. 'Serious question,' National Journal editorial director Ron Fournier wrote to White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer on Twitter: 'What is on his schedule that is more important than Gettysburg anniversary?' 'Oh, I don't know,' Pfeiffer snarked in reply, 'there's this whole website thing that someone suggested might destroy the Dem[ocratic] Party.' In what quickly became a Twitter free-for-all, other journalists pointed out that the president's official schedule for Tuesday didn't mention any meetings related to the Affordable Care Act. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Claws out: White House communications chief Dan Pfeiffer (L) said that Obama skipped the ceremony honoring President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address (R) because he was busy fixing healthcare.gov . The fatally flawed website has made the Obama White House a punching bag for conservatives who say the Obamacare law should be repealed or changed significantly. Its October 1 launch was marked by crashes, downtime, and embarrassing leaks of Americans' personal information. Obama told a New Orleans crowd on Nov. 8 that 'I wanted to go in and fix it myself, but I don't write code' Despite his busy schedule, the president found time on Sunday to attend a college basketball game with his daughters. Mrs. Obama's brother is the head coach for one of the teams that played. Pfeiffer attracted barbs this month for using his Twitter account to criticize a terminal cancer patient who spoke out against Obamacare. Angry Pennsylvanians directed their ire toward the president on Tuesday, condemning his apparent snub of an invitation to attend the famed 'Four score and seven years ago' commemoration. 'His dismissal of the request shows a man so detached from the duty of history, from the men who served in the White House before him, that it is unspeakable in its audacity,' Salena Zito wrote in the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. 'Four score and seven years ago': A recently-unearthed photo from November 19, 1863 actually shows President Lincoln (in the center, not wearing a top hat) at the battlefield dedication ceremony . Remembrance: A ceremony is being held at the Gettysburg National Cemetery where Union soldiers are buried, and the President will not be attending . Preparations: Ceremonies have been held for the entire year leading up to today's anniversary . Zito added that the National Park Service has no record of President Obama ever visiting the historic battlefield, she told Fox News. Instead of making the trip from the White House to the famed Civil War battlefield, Obama was scheduled to take a meeting with Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, and had a speaking engagement at an annual Wall Street Journal conference of CEOs. The Gettysburg Address has long been considered both one of the most important turning points in the Civil War and one of the greatest speeches in American history. Despite Obama's decision to skip the 150th anniversary ceremony, he regularly says he feels a particularly strong bond with President Lincoln. In his honor: Then-Senator Barack Obama chose to announce his 2008 presidential campaign in Springfield, Illinois where President Lincoln gave his famed 'House Divided' speech . Other plans: President Obama, seen with his daughters at a basketball game on Sunday, will be staying in Washington today rather than traveling to Pennsylvania for the ceremony . Obama, then a U.S. Senate freshman from Illinois – the 'Land of Lincoln – launched his 2008 presidential campaign from the state capitol of Springfield where Lincoln gave his 'House Divided' speech. He also chose to place his hand on the Lincoln Bible while taking the oath of office during both of his inaugurations . The White House has tried to downplay the significance of the president's choice to skip Tuesday's Gettysburg event. 'I think that is an enormously significant event in our history, and I think Americans will take the appropriate time to consider it, consider the speech that was delivered there,' White House press secretary Jay Carney said on October 31. In costume: An actor takes on the role of President Lincoln in Gettysburg on Monday, the night before the formal ceremony . 'But beyond that, I don't have any updates on the President's schedule.' The Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, attended in Obama's place. Obama helped to commemorate the historic day by participating in a pre-recorded compilation video that featured all of the living former presidents and a number of celebrities, including Taylor Swift, Bill Gates, Usher, and Uma Thurman, reciting the Gettysburg Address. Obama attracted a second wave of criticism when it emerged that he omitted the words 'under God' from his reading. But film producer Ken Burns later added a note to the project's website, saying that the president was asked to read from one of of the speech's few existing hand-written copies that does not include those words.","White House communications director Dan Pfeiffer snarked on Twitter that fixing Obamacare – 'this whole website thing' – took precedence .

He died from a blunt force to the head after which police arrested his parents, Tina Wimes, 44, and Floyd Wimes, 48, from South Philadelphia. The abuses suffered by the six-year-old victim were described by both the judge and the prosecutor as the worst case they have ever seen, according to CBS. The victim’s grandmother suggested the parents be forced to look at their son’s picture in their prison cells. Brutal killing: The boy died from a blunt force to the head after which police arrested his parents . Punishment: The Philadelphia prosecutor suggests the two parents should be forced to wear their child's pictures: one of him looking healthy, before they took custody at age three, and another of the boy on the coroner’s table . Philadelphia prosecutor Edward McCann said the two should instead have to wear his pictures: one of a healthy-looking Khalil before they took custody at age three, and another, the boy on the coroner’s table. ‘Everyone should know what they did over the course of, as the judge aptly said, three years, where this child really was tortured, physically tortured — deprived of food, deprived of company, kept in a cage essentially, locked away from people who loved him,’ McCann said. Police searching the couple’s . home at the time of his death found that Khalil’s bedroom door had a latch which let it be locked . from the outside and reported that the room was empty except for a . urine stained mattress on the floor. Victim: Six-year-old Khalil Wimes was beaten and starved to death by his parents after being returned to their care . Khalil’s . ‘devastated’ family, who looked after Khalil until he was two, are blaming the DHS for releasing the boy back into his parents care despite . their history of violence and drug abuse.

Khalil was put back into the care of his parents after his foster . mother Alicia Nixon lost a custody battle to adopt him, according to . sources.

Monday but he was pronounced dead at 11.16pm. His parents claimed that Khalil had fallen over in the bathroom and had seemed fine but then passed out. Doctors reported that they found both new and . old injuries all over Khalil's body and the cause of his death was . determined to be multiple blunt force trauma and malnutrition. Investigators say Khalil's scars are consistent with regular beatings with belts and cords. Horrific: Investigators say Khalil's scars are consistent with regular beatings with belts and cords .

Nixon said that she raised Khalil . for three years ‘constantly loving him and making sure he was ok’  and . that ‘his parents fought us tooth and nail until they got him back and . then they killed him.’ Murdered: Khalil's former foster mother is blaming the DHS for allowing Khalil to be returned to his abusive parents . House of horror: Khalil's family say his parents lived in 'squalor' and neighbours were shocked that the boy lived at the apartment as they never saw him . 'They gave him back to the very . people who hurt him, and now we're getting him back dead,' Nixon told . Philly.com. 'We're sick and broken and there's nothing anyone could do . or say that could give us comfort right now, except the fact that Khalil . is no longer suffering at the hands of those monsters.' The family argue that they pleaded with the DHS and the court system to protect the young boy and his sister from their parents - writing letters of appeal to the mayor, DHS, and the judge, begging for the decision to be overturned. ‘DHS . is supposed to protect the children. He was in a very safe home; he was . ripped from a safe home and taken back to squalor.

Nicholas John Miller, 22, of Jacksonville, Arkansas, who has a history of drug abuse and run-ins with local police, told authorities that people were after him . Commendation: Sheila Hart was honored by the Pulaski County Special School District on Wednesday at a special ceremony . The 911 call details the events that led to the bus being stolen. The person who called police, Karlena Lipari, was taking her child to the stop when Miller approached her, brandished a knife and demanded she take him to her vehicle. Once the bus arrived, Lepari held back four children and attempted to alert the bus driver, 51-year-old Sheila Hart, as Miller boarded the bus. 'He got on the school bus with a knife, with the bus driver,' Lipari told the dispatcher. Police were informed about the incident by the woman who had refused to give up her car when Miller demanded it and they eventually found the bus and pursued it north to Cabot. Cell phone footage of the chase, recorded by 17-year-old onlooker Kelsey Eggers, shows the bus moving along a two-lane road pursued by 10 police cars with their lights flashing.

Cabin crew trainees have reportedly hit out at the cost of training and work conditions at a company that supplies Ryanair with staff. Ireland-based Crewlink charges trainees nearly £2,000 in tuition fees for a course that will help them get work at the airline company. Staff are reportedly too afraid to speak out about their working conditions directly, because their contracts state they must not speak to the media. Trainees have criticised the cost of training and work conditions at a company that supplies Ryanair . The news comes after Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said he wanted to reform his company's culture and help lose its 'macho' image. The Irish airline promised an overhaul of its bedside manner over the next six months, in a charm offensive that runs contrary to its existing strategy. It will operate ‘quiet flights’ before 8am and after 9pm, bringing an end to repetitive adverts for scratchcards and music played over the aeroplane PA. Passengers will also be given a 24-hour grace period to change bookings. Many Ryanair cabin crew are reportedly supplied by Crewlink, which takes peopl on after they have completed six weeks of training. It offers its own training, but also accepts trainees from St James Management Services, which is based in Cirencester, Gloucestershire. The St James course costs trainees £1,650 in one payment, or £1,800 in installments. Those who choose to pay in installments have £150 taken off their salary a month to cover the cost of the course. But according to the Observer, many who go on the course are rejected during a probationary period and still have to pay the training bill. Crewlink told the paper that more than 95 per cent remain in the company’s employment after six months. But the report said St James ‘routinely’ tells trainees it will instruct a debt-collecting agency to pursue outstanding fees. Ryanair chief exec Michael O'Leary said he wanted to reform the company's culture and help lose its 'macho' image . The Crewlink contract, meanwhile, makes clear the training does not guarantee a Ryanair job. The paper says the contract explains there are no provisions for sick pay and crew must pay £30 a month for their uniforms for the first year. Crewlink employees are reported to be paid £13.39 an hour in flight pay and can be transferred between Ryanair bases with no compensation. Staff are also expected to work a number of standby days where they must be available within one hour of being called. Crewlink declined to comment on 'inaccurate claims' about its contract and told the paper staff were free to leave the company if they were unhappy with terms and conditions. A Ryanair spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We don’t use 3rd parties to train our staff. Like many other airlines, we only recruit fully trained and qualified cabin crew. ‘Once cabin crew start working for Ryanair, we pay for all their recurrent training, which is exactly what other airlines do.’","Staff reportedly too afraid to speak out about working conditions because they are forbidden from speaking to media in their contracts .

Marisa Cauchi has spoken of her anger at being omitted from former England manager Sven Goran Erriksson's memoir . A former lover of Sven Goran Eriksson says says their four-year relationship has been cruelly ignored in the ex-England football manager's memoirs. Marisa Cauchi, 41, a skip hire company director who lives in Bury, says their relationship began in 2007 after they met in a restaurant in Swinton, Greater Manchester but ended in 2011 because he was seeing numerous other women. But she says 'Sven: My Story' makes no mention of their time together and feels betrayed by the former Manchester City manager, 65. She said: 'He told me he loved me and promised we'd come out as a couple. In reality he was keeping me a secret so he could romance other women.' Ms Cauchi, who was born in Salford and has two children from previous relationships, claims the revelations in the book do not fully reflect the extent of the Swede's womanising ways. The year before she started seeing Eriksson she separated from her husband, Anthony with whom she co-owns Salford Skip Hire, after three years of marriage. She told the Sunday Mirror they would meet at an apartment in Manchester four or five times a week and he promised her that they would go public with their relationship at some point. Mrs Cauchi says Eriksson said reports he was still with his long-term lover Nancy Dell'Olio were false and he was only in contact with her because they were arguing over money. Then one day she received a text containing five women's names and phone numbers, followed by another inviting her to talk to the women, who were all allegedly seeing Eriksson. She claims she could not get hold of him to find out what was happening. He was in Mexico for a new management role and would not take her calls. They eventually patched things up and resumed seeing each other while he was manager at Notts County in the East Midlands. She admits she was in love with him and in denial over the other women. After seeing the book, tipped to be a . bestseller, contained no mention of her, she said: 'I actually feel . sorry for him because if he carries on like this he's going to end up a very lonely old man.' Neither Ms Cauchi nor Mr Goran Eriksson's representatives were available for comment. Heartbreak: She claims the pair were together for four years but ended because of his womanising ways .

Ms Alam said in a statement read to the jury of the trial: ‘We were in contact until July 2005, but it was done by landline telephone because Sven believed his telephone had been tapped.’ This came after a torrent of publicity of their affair sparked by a News of the World expose allegedly fueled by phone hacking.","Marisa Cauchi, 41, claims he first wooed her while he was Man City boss .

A very curious cat which vanished without trace two years ago has been found - 1,100 miles away. Cree Cantrell thought he would never again see three-year-old Jacque after the cat disappeared from his houseboat in Biloxi, Missouri. But Jacque spent two years on the run, reappearing mysteriously in a veterinary surgery in Denver, Colorado. Feline fantastic: Cree Cantrell has been reunited with his pet Jacque - found 1,100 miles away - after two years . Mr Cantrell recalled the moment his mother called him after the Colorado vet checked Jacque's microchip. He told Missouri's WLOX News: 'I'm like, ""What do you mean you found . Jacque? This has been two years now."" So I didn't really know what she . was talking about, but she explained to me that he was in Colorado. I . couldn't believe it. How's a cat get up there?' If Jacque had driven to Denver in a car he would have passed through five states and taken more than 20 hours. Mr Cantrell added: 'I came home from work one day and he . just wasn't there. Looked for him obviously for a long time and just . kind of gave up hope. 'I . always assumed that either he fell in the water, which he had done . before, or maybe a tourist or something walking on the beach picked him . up.'

Poppy, a two-year-old tabby from Great Yarmouth, England, stowed on board a ship bound for an oil rig and managed to travel more than 30 miles before she was found . 4. Dallas, a black cat from Petaluma, California, was discovered near-death 13 years later and was gladly taken back in by his owner - who had only been 21 when she adopted him. 5. Salem, a black cat from England's West Midlands, was found by animal welfare officers 11 years after she slipped through an open door - reappearing on Christmas Eve. The vet was able to contact Mr Cantrell after he scanned Jacque's microchip, which was the size of a grain of rice. It was a lucky find, as the pet owner said he never planned to have Jacque microchipped - he was offered the service when he took Jacque in to get neutered. The chips have helped reunite countless owners with their furry friends, and Jacque is not the only cat who has gone walkies across the country.

Challenge: His remarks came as David Cameron effectively admitted the fate of the entire North-South rail project now lay in Labour's hands . The controversial HS2 rail link took a fresh blow last night after Labour compared it with the Millennium Dome. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls made clear that Labour, if elected, would not repeat the ‘mistake’ of the Dome and waste public money on unnecessary schemes inherited from a previous Tory government. In a BBC interview about the high- speed rail project, Mr Balls was challenged over Labour’s record in adopting the Conservative-inspired Dome – now the O2 Arena –  in South-East London, and building it despite the costs soaring to £750million. Mr Balls replied: ‘The Millennium Dome was a Conservative vanity project which the Labour government should have scrapped in 1997 and didn’t. ‘It was a mistake and I think you should learn from your mistakes.’ His remarks came as David Cameron effectively admitted the fate of the entire North-South rail project now lay in Labour’s hands, saying it could not go ahead without cross-party support. Mr Balls’ intervention comes ahead of a crucial week for the ambitious scheme, with Ministers due to publish a comprehensive ‘business case’ showing HS2’s expected benefits. There is also a vital Commons vote on the Bill paving the way for HS2, with more than 30 Tory MPs expected to rebel against the idea – despite it being seen as a flagship ‘infrastructure’ plan by the Coalition. Labour, which originally proposed the idea of a North-South high-speed link, has already made it clear there is no ‘blank cheque’ for the scheme, which would take 225mph trains from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. But in the Radio 5 Live interview, the Shadow Chancellor raised fresh hurdles for the plans. He appeared to signal that even if the costs did not escalate beyond the current  estimated £50billion bill, there was no guarantee an incoming Labour government would persist with it. ‘There are two sides to this ledger,’ he said. ‘There is the cost and the benefit. And we need to know – are the costs under control? Secondly, are the benefits really there so that this would be the best way to spend that money.’ He also accused Chancellor George Osborne of appearing like a ‘cheerleader’ for the scheme regardless of the costs and benefits. Mistake: The Millennium Dome was a scheme inherited by Labour from a previous Tory government but its cost soared to £750million and was largely seen as a vanity project . Last week, Mr Cameron challenged Labour to come clean on its real intentions for HS2, saying  massive projects such as this  – which would take 20 years to complete – ‘can’t go ahead without all-party support’. The Prime Minister said that if Labour abandoned the plan, ‘they will be letting down the Midlands, they will be letting down the North’. The Mail on Sunday has learnt that Mr Cameron’s intervention came after a private meeting with Andrew Bridgen, the East Midlands Tory MP who is spearheading this week’s rebellion against the project. Mr Bridgen said he told the Prime Minister that, as with the vote on military action against Syria last month, Labour would leave him in the lurch and come out against HS2. Labour sources last night insisted that the party ‘supports HS2 in  principle’ and was a ‘critical friend’ to the project. But Labour has been challenged to explain why its MPs are not being ordered to be at Westminster on Thursday to support the HS2 Bill. They are on a ‘one-line whip’, which means they have to vote for the rail plan only if they  are at the Commons on the day.","Balls called the Millennium Dome a Tory ' vanity project' which Labour should have scrapped in 1997 .

Please hold the line: Waiting in telephone queues is ranked among the common of life's bugbears a study has found . IF you’re driven up the wall by being put on hold then you are not alone. Waiting on a helpline, junk emails and nuisance calls have topped a poll of Britain’s biggest time-wasting ‘bugbears’. Other irritants include traffic jams, waiting for a replacement bank card or a bus for more than five minutes and slow people in the queue at the till. The impatience study, produced for Barclays, surveyed 2,000 adults who were asked about their top time-wasting annoyances and most prevalent pet hates. Almost half of those surveyed said hanging on the phone while waiting for staff at a bank, doctor’s surgery or helpline to give them assistance topped their list of time-wasting bugbears. Other frustrating time-wasters were identified as having a flight delayed, being stuck at home waiting for a delivery to show up and waiting to be seen at a doctor’s or dentist’s. More than a third of respondents found waiting for a replacement bank card drove them round the bend, as well as waiting for a repair man and waiting for the tube for more than three minutes.

People up in arms over a Florida high school named after the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan are working to get the name changed. Previous attempts to rename Nathan Bedford Forrest High School, in Jacksonville, were unsuccessful, but officials have begun looking into a name change after the father of a district student started a petition and has said he will not allow his daughter to attend the school. Omotayo Richmond’s Change.org petition has well over 100,000 signatures, but the Duval County Public School district has said it will have no impact on the high school’s name. The first Grand Wizard: Nathaniel Bedford Forrest was head of the KKK from 1866 until 1869 . Mr Richmond’s daughter attend the district, the African-American told ABC News he will not allow her to set foot inside a school named after a famously notorious racist. ‘It just wouldn’t happen,’ Mr Richmond said. ‘I believe it’s outrageous that this could even be questioned by anybody… that anybody could even come to the defense of this man.’ He’s not alone, the more than 160,000 people who signed his online petition come from all over the country. ‘I am very encouraged that [people] chose to support this cause and I am humbled by that and excited for change,’ he continued. Sentiment clearly supports a change, but there is a catch. A DCPS spokesperson told ABC the district will only listen to a name change request originating from within its boundaries – where Mr Richmond lives, and that the final decision will be made by school board members. Honoring a racist: Nathaniel Bedford Forrest High School was named after the former KKK leader, but residents want that to change . A previous attempt to change the school’s name have somehow failed. Despite a 2007 Florida State College . study that received an overwhelming number of responses in favour of . changing the school’s name, the school board voted against changing the . school’s name, according to ABC. The vote had two African-Americans in favor of changing the name, but five whites voted against the idea. The city of Memphis, TN., earlier this year voted to rename a park . named after the Mr Forrest, who also was a general in the Confederate . Army during the Civil War. The KKK marched on the city, with a . local leader claiming 'the Memphis City Council is basically trying to . eradicate white people out of the history books across America.' Lance Stoll, the college professor who headed up the 2007 effort, is spearheading this one as well. He believes this time the name will change. ‘We don’t want 60 percent of the kids, black kids going to a school named for somebody who would’ve killed them and enslaved them if he had the chance,’ Mr Stoll told ABC. Over 90 per cent of respondents in just under 2,000 door to door surveys conducted by Mr Stoll’s Jacksonville Progressive Coalition have responded in favour of changing the school’s name, ABC noted. The Klan: Klan members wear ceremonial robes and carry Confederate flags, in a nod to their past, when marching in protest . A further 36 people showed up to last week’s school board meeting advocating to change the name, according to ABC. Some did speak in favour of the name remaining, arguing for Mr Forrest’s place in history. ‘Forrest, the man, and his association with the KKK is history,’ 1979 graduate Alison Barwick said, according to ABC. ‘The KKK’s function was much different in his time than it is now.’ ‘I think you’d be hard pressed to find any Southern gentleman from that era that didn’t have some association with the Klan,’ she added. Despite further arguing by Ms Barwick that the school has very little money for band and drama programs, the school board voted unanimously to move forward with the process. The drawn out plan involves gathering info from many groups, including current and former students, the PTA and many more. It is unlikely a vote will be held this year, a spokesperson told ABC.","Nathan Bedford Forrest High School, in Jacksonville, is named after the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan .

Assurance: Planning minister Nick Boles told Labrokes executives that local councils will not be able to block the development of their shops . Ministers have assured the country’s biggest bookmaker that they will clear the way for the opening of even more High Street betting shops. The Government will prevent councils from using planning powers to stop gambling firms from crowding shopping districts with new betting outlets. Betting shops have become hugely profitable thanks to the use of controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBT), which allow punters to spend up to £100 every 20 seconds. There are now more than 33,000 in Britain. The letter to the Ladbrokes firm from planning minister Nick Boles assured its executives that local authorities will not be allowed to use planning rules to stop the expansion of chains or block the development of clusters of shops. It became public following a move by Liverpool council last week to ban the FOBT terminals and complaints by betting companies that other major authorities are delaying planning applications. Possibilities for new expansion of betting chains were opened in the summer as part of a scheme to revitalise High Streets. The scheme, drawn up on the basis of a report by television presenter Mary Portas, loosens planning regulations for a two-year period. As a result retail shops can be switched to use as betting shops without needing planning approval from the council. According to a letter from Ladbrokes to ministers, the company complained of the ‘unfortunate attitude’ of some councils and of town halls ‘placing whatever obstacles they can in the way.’ Mr Boles replied, in a letter released to Labour’s shadow local government minister Hilary Benn under Freedom of Information rules, that the Government regarded blocking manoeuvres by councils as ‘a problem’. The planning minister told the gambling combine: ‘I do recognise this can be a significant problem and we are taking action to tackle it.’ The frustration of council attempts to stop new betting shops under planning rules follows the collapse of their efforts to use gambling law for the purpose. Terminal velocity: Punters can lose £100 in 20 seconds at fixed-odds betting terminals - but there can only be four per outlet . Newham council lost a legal case after it withheld a licence from the Paddy Power chain which wanted to open another betting shop in an area which already had 81, with 18 on one street. Thames Magistrates Court ruled that the firm was in line with the law and should get its licence. Mr Benn told the Guardian newspaper: ‘David Cameron claimed that he would act to protect communities but these documents show that his ministers have been doing the opposite by making it more difficult for communities to stop the proliferation of betting shops and undermining the powers used by councils to force applicants for planning permission to explain the social impact of their changes.’ The Government did not deny the thrust of Mr Boles’ letter but said it was wrong to think the new planning rules had been influence by gambling companies. A spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government said: ‘The provisions in the Growth and Infrastructure Bill were announced to Parliament three months before the department received a letter from Ladbrokes. 'To suggest the Government was somehow influenced by the betting industry is simply ridiculous and untrue.’ Last month Culture Department ministers declined to order a reduction in the high stakes allowed on FOBT machines, saying that although the ‘potential for harm’ among players using fixed odds terminals was ‘high’, it was ‘not clear how great an impact a reduction would have on gambling-related harm’. Big draw: Ladbrokes has said that FOBTs account for around 80 per cent of its turnover . Fixed-odds betting terminals arrived in Britain in 2001 and spread rapidly following Gordon Brown’s abolition of betting taxes and the 2005 Gambling Act. Leading Labour figures have now indicated they regret the liberalising of gaming in their new law. Councils warn that FOBTs are being clustered in low-income districts, where drug dealing is common and unemployed people, including youngsters, can be tempted to lose large sums of money very rapidly. Each betting shop is allowed four FOBTs, so betting firms are anxious to open more shops to plant more machines in any lucrative district. The gambling regulator, the Gambling Commission, has said each FOBT produced an average weekly profit of £825 last year, up from £760 in 2011. Ladbrokes has said that £5.9billion was staked on its fixed-odds machines from January to June last year, compared with £1.2billion for its over-the-counter bets. Campaigners say the high stakes and high speed of the machines should be limited by law, because they attract people with low incomes to risk poverty and debt, and contribute to street violence and drinking. They are also said to be popular with drug dealers, who can stuff the machines with illicit money, make safe bets which ensure they lose only a small percentage, and then cash out. As a result they get receipts which explain to police why they are walking around with large sums of cash.","Planning minister Nick Boles told Ladbrokes they were safe from councils .

Former Manchester City youth player Courtney Meppen-Walter has been freed from prison after eight months behind bars. The footballer killed a brother and sister in a car crash, but compared his prison sentence to being sidelined with an 'injury' in a letter he sent while locked up. He was jailed for 16 months in February after admitting causing the deaths of siblings Kulwant Singh, 31, and Ravel Kaur, 37, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, in a high-speed car crash. But a letter which appears to have been written by the footballer during his time in prison has emerged in which he describes his sentence as 'just like having a four month injury'. VIDEO Scroll down to watch:Courtney Meppen-Walter arrives at Manchester Crown Court . A letter apparently written by Courtney Meppen-Walter (pictured) while he was in prison has emerged in which the footballer compares his sentence to an 'injury' Letter of the law: Meppen-Walter allegedly wrote this message which boasts about being 'sexy as f***' Click here to read about Meppen-Walter being freed by mistake in July . The letter, which features incorrect spelling and grammar, reads: 'Bro You Wanna See How Skinny I have Gone look Sexy as f*** (As Usual). Gone bare skinny and been hitting the gym, think I'm going to be going into modleing with this body when I'm out f*** football HAHAHA.'(sic) The letter goes on to say: 'Yo its a minor being in here you know just like having a 4 month injury for me. Only 3 months left for me now, nice that!' The former £1,000-a-week footballer was . originally freed in July but was put back behind bars within 24 hours . after prison service bosses realised he had been released by mistake. The letter is understood to have been written in April, just over a month into his sentence and three months before his initial release. Sources close to the defender say he is now looking to find a new club in a bid to ‘get his life back on track’. But the family of the victims have criticised his release, claiming they don’t feel justice has been served. Victims: The Nissan driver, Kulwant Singh, 32, left, and his sister, front-seat passenger Ravel Kaur, 37, right, were both killed in the crash in September last year . Meppen-Walter was a former England youth captain and had been highly rated in Manchester City's academy. At the time of his initial release in July, he had served just four months of a 16-month sentence for two counts of causing death by careless driving. The Ministry of Justice recently completed an investigation into how the blunder occurred but have not made their findings public. Blackley and Broughton MP Graham Stringer has now pledged to raise the case in Parliament, saying keeping details of the error secret would hit public confidence in the justice system. Following his release last week, . Meppen-Walter, from Blackley, tweeted about watching his former . team-mates thrash Norwich 7-0 at the Etihad Stadium and about his desire . to put his prison sentence behind him. He said: 'Getting my life back on track. Been a hard year but I can finally try and move forward with my life now.' The death crash happened last September when Meppen-Walter was driving a £25,000 Mercedes Elegance CDI at nearly twice the speed limit. He had been to a shisha bar in Manchester with friends and was on his way home to get ready for a night out. Meppen-Walter was jailed for 16 months for two counts of causing death by careless driving . His friends were travelling in convoy in a VW Golf and the two cars were ‘jockeying’ around for position – accelerating and swapping lanes. Witnesses said the cars were also slowing down, possibly for speed cameras, and their driving was erratic. Meppen-Walter’s vehicle ploughed into a red Nissan Micra, killing Mr Singh and Mrs Kaur. Mr Singh had been driving his sister and her children home from a Sikh temple and was due to return to collect his wife and their two children, aged one and three. He pulled out of a side road and into the path of the Mercedes, which was travelling at 56mph in a 30mph zone. Two teenage children in the back seat suffered serious injuries and had to be cut free from the mangled wreckage, but have since made a good recovery. It emerged the double tragedy occurred five months after Meppen-Walter was caught speeding at 54mph in another 30mph zone in Bury. The teenager, from Blackley, Manchester, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving and was sentenced to 16 months behind bars and also banned from the roads for three years. The family is suing Meppen-Walter through Manchester solicitors Pannone LLP. In a statement issued by solicitor Deirdre Healy, from Pannone, Gawa Singh, the brother of Mr Singh and Ms Kaur, said: 'The sentence that Courtney Meppen-Walter has served is nothing compared to the loss that our family have suffered. It is not justice as we understand it. Two members of our family have died. It has torn our family apart and destroyed it.' An investigation into the blunder which saw Meppen-Walter originally released was completed last month. A Prison Service spokesman said: 'Releases in error are very rare and we take any incident extremely seriously. 'An incident took place on July 1, but the prisoner was returned to custody on the same day. Following an investigation, we have reviewed our systems to reduce the risk of this happening in future.' Mr Stringer has said he will write to the Ministry of Justice and speak in Parliament demanding the findings of the investigation are made public.","Courtney Meppen-Walter has been freed from prison after eight months .

The Royal British Legion had secretly flown him in from the Seychelles, where he heads the Navy’s operation to tackle piracy off the Somali coast, so he could watch his daughter sing at the Festival of Remembrance.

Still clutching her microphone, the Scottish schoolgirl ran into her father’s arms in floods of tears as he knelt down to embrace her. Speaking yesterday, his voice cracks momentarily as he recalls the reunion with his youngest daughter. ‘As I walked down the stairs on to the stage I was struggling to hold it together,' he says.

Megan, continuing with the story, says: ‘When I saw him, I fell back into Bethany and Charlotte. I thought ‘Is that really my daddy?, and then the other girls said ‘Run Megan, it’s your dad’. ‘I cried when I saw him, because I miss him so much.

Graham Cooper evaded justice for 30 years before being jailed when a victim discovered he had been chosen to run a leg in the Olympic torch relay . A paedophile who evaded justice for 30 years has finally been jailed after his victim discovered he had been chosen to run a leg in the London 2012 Olympic torch relay. The sudden fame enjoyed by Graham Cooper ‘incensed’ a woman who had suffered sex attacks at his hands as a girl from the ages of ten to 13 in the early 1980s. A previous complaint that she made about the 69-year-old was not pursued by police, but after seeing him basking in the glory of the Olympics torch relay she contacted officers again. Cooper, a grandfather from New Romney, Kent, pleaded guilty to two counts of indecent assault on a girl aged under 14 and one count of indecency with a child. A jury at Canterbury Crown Court last month convicted him of indecent assault, but cleared him of an alleged rape and two more indecent assaults. Cooper was regarded as an upstanding pillar of the small community of Aldington, where he was known for his charity work and regular attendance at church. His wife of 40 years, Sylvia, nominated him to become an Olympic torchbearer as reward for his years of working in the neighbourhood and raising money for good causes. But after he carried the torch in South Kent in July last year, his victim heard about his achievement in the media. She called police again about the abuse she suffered three decades earlier. Jailing him for three years, Judge Adele Williams said the abuse Cooper committed had a ‘profound and long-lasting’ impact on the victim who has had to undergo counselling and therapy. The judge said Cooper had a ‘total lack of insight’ over what he had done to the woman, adding: ‘She tried to complain to the police but that was not pursued. ‘But when she saw in the press that you had been chosen as an Olympic torchbearer in 2012 because of your good work and good standing in the community, she was rightly incensed and went to the police again.’ Cooper, who showed no emotion as sentence was passed, was also made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order and told to sign the sex offenders register. Both orders will last ten years.Peter Alcock, defending, asked the judge to take into account Cooper’s age, the historic nature of the offences and his health problems. Cooper's wife, Sylvia, nominated him to become an Olympic torchbearer ahead of the opening ceremony . He said an immediate jail term would be ‘more onerous’ for Cooper now than it would have been 30 years ago. Mr Alcock said Cooper had ‘lived a life with many positives’ and that good character references had been provided by community figures, including his vicar. ‘As well as the character references illustrating the many positives, there is also that he was nominated and then chosen to be a torchbearer during the Olympics, and that was a matter in the trial,’ Mr Alcock added. ‘The complainant said that was what led her to come forward. He knows the wrong he has done in those years and the quality of the understanding of his problems is a question for further work.’ Cooper had the support of his wife and many friends, some of whom attended court to see him sentenced, Mr Alcock said.","Sudden fame enjoyed by Graham Cooper 'incensed' one of his victims .

Charged: Russian Colorado Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov has been charged with third-degree assault, and could face two years prison . Violent: Evgeniya Vavrinyuk told investigators that Varlamov kicked her in the chest, knocking her down, and stomped on her chest as she lay on the ground in her apartment . Day in court: Semyon Varlamov, 25, starting goalkeeper for the Colorado Avalanche, first appeared in court earlier this month on kidnapping and assault charges . Varlamov's attorney, Jack Rotole, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. Varlamov’s girlfriend, Evgeniya Vavrinyuk, told investigators he attacked her on October 30 in her apartment. She said he knocked her down with a kick and stomped on her chest, according to an arrest affidavit. She also accused him of dragging her by her hair and telling her that he would have beaten her more if they had been in Russia, authorities said. Varlamov is free on a $5,000 bond and has been traveling and playing with the Avalanche. Since the alleged assault, Varlamov has played in eight Avalanche games. The NHL has released a statement following the charge: . 'We are aware of the decision made by the Denver District Attorney's Office today to pursue misdeamnor assault charges against Avalanche Player Semyon Varlamov. While we will continue to monitor the situation, we do not expect to take any action or have any further comment pending the resolution of those charges.'

Beauty and the 'Beast': Varlamov's on-again, off-again girlfriend Russian model Evgenia Vavrinyuk (right) accused the NHL star of dragging her by the hair, pushing her to the floor and stomping on her in a drunken rage . Vavrinyuk had been dating Varlamov on and off for a year. She described in . court how her six-foot-two, 209-pound goalie . boyfriend kicked her in the chest and stomped on her as she lay on the . ground, before he dragged her by her hair from their bedroom in the . early hours of the morning on October 30. ‘He was having fun, . he was laughing,’ said the model. ‘He has no concept of when to stop . drinking, and when he drinks he turns into an animal.’ She . pointed to her chest, arms, stomach, neck and head - places she said . she are bruised. She also said he kicked her out of the apartment, . reports The Denver Post. Vavrinyuk . admitted it wasn't the first time that her boyfriend had hurt her, but . throwing her out on the street was ‘the final straw.’ ‘She . wants to make sure he is punished for this,’ Vavrinyuk said through . Diana Senova, an interpreter and the fiancee of her attorney, Robert . Abrams. ‘[Varlamov] is . very arrogant and thinks he can get away with anything, that he can beat . her up and no one will ever know about it.’ She . said her boyfriend had beat her at least four times before in other . countries, but she had remained hopeful that he could change, as she . loved him and wanted to have children with him. She . said she broke a modeling contract in Hong Kong so she could come to . Denver to be with him ‘because he asked her to,’ Senova said. According to news reports, Varlamov and Vavrinyuk, known to her friends as ‘Evie,’ have been in a rocky relationship disrupted by breakups. Vague: John Rotole, the attorney for Colorado Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov, said his client is innocent . His agent, Paul Theofanous, said Varlamov ‘is completely innocent of all of these charges.’ Acquired . from Washington in a 2011 trade, Varlamov is 7-1 this season with a . 1.76 goals-against average. Last year, the goaltender earned $3 million. According to court documents made public on Thursday, Varlamov told Vavrinyuk in Russian that 'if this were Russia, he would have beaten her more,' Varlamov was initially also charged with second-degree kidnapping, but that charge has been dropped. A judge set his bond at $5,000 and issued a restraining order for his girlfriend. Varlamov also was given permission to travel with his team. The alleged lovers quarrel took placed on Monday at the couple’s apartment in the 1700 block of Bassett Street in Denver. Varlamov’s arrest warrant and affidavit state that the 25-year-old athlete held his girlfriend’s face to the floor, grabbed her by her arms and shook her before pushing her down to the floor. 'Her statement is that this is the most minor of the beatings she received. She's received five in all, and the last one was to unconsciousness,' said Vavrinyuk's attorney Robert Abrams. Abrams said his client spent five hours in a hospital after Monday's beating. Rocky relationship: Varlamov, pictured left in his Washington Capitals days, and Vavrinyuk (right) ‘This time Evie said to us, “That’s it, go lock him up,”’ Abrams said. ‘This girl is 5-foot-3, 100-and-nothing pounds; he’s a 6-foot-2, 210-pound professional athlete. This is a very sizable force approaching you. This is terrifying.’ Varlamov’s father, Alexander, downplayed the domestic violence case and came to his son's defense in an interview with Russia's R-Sport. 'I can only say one thing with complete responsibility: No crime has been committed whatsoever,' he stated, adding that his son has ‘no serious issues.’ It has been widely speculated that Varlamov is expected to be invited as the starting goalie for the Russian Olympic team during the Winter Games in Sochi next year. In light of his arrest, some Russian officials wasted no time accusing the United State of sabotage. Stunner: The Russian model told police in Denver that her boyfriend struck her in the chest and warned her in Russian that were they back home, he would have given her a harsher beating . State Duma deputy Igor Ananskikh, a member of the nationalist LDPR party, called Varlamov's arrest a 'sports and political move.' ‘The main goal is to suspend him from training and games so that he loses practice and misses the Olympics,’ said Ananskikh. The LDPR member has vowed to use his sway as the head of the Russian parliament's physical training and sports committee to 'influence the situation.' According to the Russian tabloid Dni.ru, Varlamov and the blonde fashion model called it quits at least once before, but the woman, who resides mostly in Russia, returned to Denver for a three-month stay and moved back in with him. In response to Varlamov's arrest, the model wrote on her Russian social media account VKontakte, which has since been deleted: 'If a man has raised his hand against a woman - he will do it again. And no amount of oaths and assurances should shake a woman's resolve.’ Rising star: Varlamov is among the NHL leaders in goals-against, wins and save percentage . She went on saying: ‘Break up with these men instead of feeling sorry for them!' According to the hockey player's father, his son's only crime was that he decided to take his girlfriend out to the movies ‘against her will,’ and she rushed to press charges against him, Russian Gazette reported. Conspiracy theory: State Duma deputy Igor Ananskikh claims that Varlamov's arrest is an act of sabotage ahead of the Winter Olympics . The Avalanche play at Dallas Friday night and Varlamov was scheduled to start. His backup, Jean-Sebastien Giguere, has been just as good in net, recording two shutouts. Varlamov is in the midst of a resurgent season under new coach Patrick Roy and a staff that includes goalie guru Francois Allaire, who once mentored Roy and Giguere. Between Roy and Allaire, they’ve restored Varlamov’s confidence a year after he allowed three goals a game. Varlamov said he credits his improvement to Allaire altering his form in goal. Just minor tweaks, he said, but wouldn’t elaborate on the specifics of what they were. Whatever was changed, it has been paying off as he’s among the NHL leaders in goals-against, wins and save percentage. After practice Wednesday, Avalanche defenseman Erik Johnson said it was ‘pretty cool to see Varly transition into an elite NHL goalie.’","Colorado Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov, 25, has been charged with third-degree assault .

A U.S. army officer who tried to escape being jailed by blaming his twin brother for a string of sex offenses in three states has pleaded guilty to the crimes. Lt Aaron Lucas initially claimed that he was being framed for trying to abduct 11 young girls and sexually assaulting three others close to his military base in Fort Carson, Colorado. Instead, he tried to blame his twin Brian Lucas with whom he shares the same DNA. But the artillery officer, who was awarded the Bronze Star for valor, has now pleaded guilty to the charges according to the El Paso County district attorney's office. Change of plea: Decorated artillery officer Lt Aaron Lucas, left, of Fort Carson, Colorado, initially blamed his twin brother Brian, right, for a series of sex offenses but has now pleaded guilty . Lucas was arrested last year in connection with a child abduction and an attempted child abduction over the summer. But detectives realized the 32-year-old matched the description of a suspect in as many as 11 attempted abductions. DNA taken from an attempted abduction in Colorado matched samples taken from crime scenes in Alabama in 2007 and Texas two years later. His lawyers were given permission by a district court judge to pursue the claim the DNA was from his twin brother Brian, who lived in both states at the time of the attacks. 'War hero': Lucas is the recipient of the Bronze Star, the fourth highest military honor in the country . But the attorney's office maintained that there was no evidence to back up that claim. Aaron Lucas' attorneys also claimed that an unidentified third man is responsible for the Colorado assaults. Ruling: A judge had ruled that Lucas's lawyers could pursue the mistaken identity claim . But the army officer will serve 20 years to life for the assaults after his legal team reached a plea agreement with prosecutors which was approved by a judge. The Colorado Springs Gazette has quoted Lucas's lawyer as saying that the mistaken identity claim was a 'legal, tactical decision'. He added: 'He loves his family. He doesn't want to create problems for them.' El Paso County prosecutors had said that the Colorado victims' ages ranged from six to nine and that they were targeted at random in Colorado Springs and nearby Fountain by a man who tried to coax them into sex with promises of money and ice cream. Prosecutors contend three girls were assaulted during the encounters. The incidents began shortly after Aaron Lucas' arrival at Fort Carson with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division. A Colorado Springs police detective, Fred Walker, has testified the assaults stopped while Aaron Lucas was deployed to Afghanistan. Lucas received . the Bronze Star, the fourth-highest honor given to members of the . military, for valor during a deployment to Afghanistan. In his four years of active duty, Lucas amassed a glowing military resume including 10 medals and awards. He was due to go on trial in January, but will now be sentenced on Friday.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 17:19 EST, 10 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:29 EST, 10 November 2013 . A husband and wife are facing federal charges for an alleged bank-robbing spree that spanned two states. The Tampa Tribune reports that FBI agents arrested 28-year-old Immanuel Lee Williams and his wife, Cara Lee, this week at their Tampa home. The two are accused of robbing 13 banks in Florida and two in Alabama. Authorities say they used disguises and notes to demand money. Immanuel and Cara Lee Williams: A husband and wife team of bank robbers has been arrested in Florida. The couple were wanted in connection worth to the robberies of 15 banks in Florida and Lousiana . Federal investigators say the . robberies took place between December 2012 and October of this year. Each of the suspects faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal . prison. Investigators . say the robberies followed a pattern. The couple allegedly used gloves, . afro-style wigs and demand notes written on yellow index cards. A 10-month investigation by the FBI that began with a December 5 heist at Chase Bank in Tampa ended a day after 28-year Immanuel Lee Williams is said to have robbed an Alabama Credit Union in Gulf Shores (see pictures from the Alabama State Register below), and three days after his wife Cara Lee Williams, 28, allegedly held up Trinity Bank in Dothan. An 18-page federal criminal complaint filed by the FBI outlines how agents matched the couple up with seven robberies that took place from December 2012 to February 2013 along with six more from August to October 2013 throughout Florida and the two in Alabama on Nov. 4 and Nov. 6. The robberies netted a total of $54,740. Robberies: It all began here, at this bank in central Florida... ...and ended here at this bank in Dothan, Alabama . In all the bank robberies, except Dothan, Williams was known to wear an afro wig or hats. In each robbery, similar notes with block lettering were passed to bank tellers. The note passed to the teller in Gulf Shores read, 'THIS IS A BANK ROBBERY! I HAVE A GUN, SO NO ALARMS & BE FAST!! GIVE ME ALL MONEY IN YOUR DRAWER! BE QUIET & FAST AND NO ONE WILL GET HURT!' Federal agents got their first break during one of two robberies on Aug. 28 at Bank of America in Auburndale, Flordiaa and MidFlorida Credit Union in Davenport, east of Tampa and each 17 miles apart. It was the one in Davenport, records show, where a nearby business’ surveillance camera captured the black male getting into a black 2011 Mercedes-Benz GLK 350. Using video requested from the Florida Department of Transportation Turnpike Authority, agents were able to pinpoint the high-end sports utility vehicle and tracked the license plate number to Cara Williams. A white Mustang that was used in an August 22 robbery in Fort Myers and captured on surveillance video was also linked to Cara Williams. Robbery in progress: Immanuel Lee Williams, 28, is allegedly seen robbing the Alabama Credit Union's in Gulf Shores . Getting away (but not for long): Immanuel Williams was able to be tracked thanks to activity through his cell phone, linking his location at certain dates to cell towers . The investigation intensified in September with physical FBI surveillance of the couple’s apartment in Tampa and their activity on September 27 when a MidFlorida Credit Union was robbed in Plant City, another city east of Tampa. According to the court document, agents were also able to track Immanuel Williams’ activity through his cell phone, linking his location at certain dates to cell towers. Public photos on Facebook were also use to identify a scar on Immanuel Williams’ left thumb that he would cover with cloth on his hand or obscure from the camera in bank surveillance video. After two bank robberies in Ocala and Bushnell, north of Tampa, netted $6,960 the couple was observed afterward in a shopping mall. Also through Facebook it was found that the couple had a baby around December 15, which was 10 days after the first bank robbery. Further investigation delved into employment activities and off days that corresponded to robberies. Cara Williams is a former resident of Alabama and her parents still live there, according to court records. On November 4 witnesses from the Dothan bank robbery describe the suspect as a white woman in disguise and the note that was used was similar to the robberies in Florida.  Handwritten in black ink with all capital letters it read: 'THIS IS A BANK ROBBERY! I HAVE A GUN SO BE QUIET & FAST & NO ONE GETS HURT! HAND ME ALL YOUR 20s, 100s, & 50s! BE FAST & NO ALARMS!!' Immanuel Lee Williams is being held without bail. A bond hearing for Cara Lee Williams is set for November 14. The couple were charged with conspiracy to obstruct, delay or affect commerce by robbery, and conspiracy to commit bank robbery, both of which can carry a maximum prison sentence of up to 20 years.","Tampa couple suspected in more than a dozen bank robberies in two states .

The Old Bailey heard that details of injuries sustained by Prince Harry on holiday were reported in the News of the World after his aide's phone was allegedly hacked . A News of the World exclusive on Prince Harry injuring himself on holiday came directly from a hacked voicemail left for his personal assistant, the Old Bailey heard today. Dr Rod Jaques left a message for the Prince's aide Helen Asprey detailing the young Royal's shoulder and foot injuries picked up while on holiday. On January 23, 2005, a story titled 'Harry gets two Nazi new injuries', concerning shoulder and foot complaints that may scupper his hopes of joining Sandhurst Military Academy appeared in the Sunday tabloid. The transcript of the hacked voicemail from the doctor was shown to the jury, going into the injury details and possible treatments. It also makes reference to a planned appointment for the Prince, on January 24, which is referenced in the NoTW story. Dr Jaques told police: 'The message was for Helen Asprey and her alone. 'It related to a patient I had recently treated.' Clive Goodman, who penned the exclusive, emailed Coulson on January 22, 2005, telling him the doctor information had been 'scammed from Helen Asprey (Harry and William's PA) so it's solid'. The court heard Ms Asprey was the victim of hundreds of hacks by Goodman and the News of the World at the end of 2005 through to the middle of 2006. She said: 'In December 2005, I became aware of problems with my voicemail service. 'Messages not previously listened to were being described as old rather than new, and the PIN number was changing and being reset regularly, sometimes several times a day.' Another royal aide, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, was also hacked repeatedly, and one of his messages was allegedly the source of a Goodman story claiming Harry had cheated on his Sandhurst exams. Goodman, who has admitted phone hacking, handed a transcript to prosecutors of a phone message from Prince Harry pleading for help with an essay on the Iranian embassy siege. A message left for Royal aide Helen Asprey, left, by Dr Rod Jaques, right, was allegedly hacked by the NoTW . The message, taken from Mr Lowther-Pinkerton's phone, said: 'I just need some inf.' 'If you have any information at all or know where to get information from, or you could send me a text or email me, any info on the siege at the Iranian Embassy, because I need to do an essay quite quickly on that. 'I've got most of the stuff but if you have any extra information or websites that you know of, please, please, please, email it to me or text me.' Another story alleged to have come from hacking was of a boozy night at the barracks involving the two Princes. When Edmondson suggests adding an extra line, Goodman replies by email: 'That's a bit too much knowledge to expose to a wider readership. 'Massively dangerous to the source.' When the newspaper turned its attention to Tom Parker Bowles, an emaill shown to the jury where Goodman told Weatherup: 'Got a mobile, getting Greg to do a few dark arts.' Weatherup replied: 'Don't know what you mean....' The trial continues. Victim: Gordan Taylor, head of the PFA, was hacked repeatedly by the News of the World who wrongly claimed he had an affair, the Old Bailey heard today . News of the World reporters wrongly assumed Professional Footballers' Association boss Gordon Taylor was having an affair with his son’s ex-girlfriend based on hacked messages, the Old Bailey heard today. Transcripts of voicemails left for the PFA chief executive were emailed between staff at the Sunday tabloid when they believed an affair was going on. In an email to news editors James Weatherup and Ian Edmondson, chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck sent voicemail transcripts and bragged: ‘This is a splash any day of the week.’ He added: ‘We know it’s happening.’ Mr Taylor was suspected by the reporters of having an affair with Joanne Armstrong, an in-house lawyer at the PFA. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the court: ‘The media were investigating an allegation that Joanne Armstrong and Gordon Taylor were having an affair.’ NotW private investigator Glenn Mulcaire had recordings of 76 voicemails from Mr Taylor’s phone in his home when he was arrested in August 2006. Phone records show he made 13 calls to Mr Taylor’s phone between February and May 2006. People who left messages that were hacked included BBC pundit Garth Crooks, Paul Gascoigne’s best friend Jimmy ‘Five Bellies’ Gardner, and colleagues at the PFA. Thurlbeck, who has admitted hacking, then drafted the story which he emailed to Edmondson on July 1, 2005. The top line read: ‘Soccer boss Gordon Taylor is having a secret affair with his son’s former girlfriend.’ Email chain: Former news editors Ian Edmondson and James Weatherup, pictured at previous hearings, are alleged to have received emails detailing information from Gordon Taylor's voicemails . Mulcaire’s notes had the details of Mr Taylor and Ms Armstrong in his notebook on a page dated May 6, 2004. The jury were shown two agreements between the News of the World and Mulcaire, using the alias Paul . Williams, agreeing not to give the Taylor information to other newspapers. Guilty: Former News of the World chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, pictured at a previous hearing, has already admitted phone hacking charges . The first was signed by Miskiw on February 4, 2005, and a similar agreement was signed by Edmondson on May 9, the court heard. Detective Constable Richard Oskiewicz said: ‘It appears to be an agreement in relation to the Gordon Taylor story, and appears to follow on to the agreement on February 24, 2005. ‘This one is dated June 24, 2005, and is by Ian Edmondson.’ On June 29, 2005, NotW reporter Ross Hindley sent a transcript of Mr Taylor’s voicemails was emailed to Thurlbeck, two days before the draft copy was sent to Edmondson. Edmondson is in the dock accused of being involved in phone hacking, along with editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, and managing editor Stuart Kuttner, in a six year phone hacking campaign at the Sunday tabloid. The alleged victims include Home Secretaries David Blunkett and Charles Clarke, murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, and glamour model Abi Titmuss. The court heard today UKip leader Nigel Farage was also a victim of Mulcaire’s, whose phone was hacked in January 2006 when he was accused of having an extra marital affair. It also emerged that Rebekah Brooks was herself a victim of 'extensive' phone hacking by Mulcaire, the court heard. The former editor's name, phone number and voicemail number was on a page in the private investigator's notebook. 'Mrs Brooks was herself the victim of extensive hacking herself was she not?', said Jonathan Laidlaw QC, acting for Brooks. DC Tim Hargreaves replied: 'She was targeted, yes.' Her . details were on a second page in the book, along with the name of News . International lawyer Tom Crone scrawled halfway down. Mr . Laidlaw told court: 'Having found those pages, it was identified to her . that she appeared to have been the victim of hacking. 'Do you know another Met officer asked whether she was prepared to be a witness for the prosecution?' DC . Hargreaves said he was unaware of this approach, and Mr Laidlaw added: . 'Not only was the fact of hacking revealed to her, but she was invited . by the police to provide a witness statement to act as a witness to . this.' Brooks' name, . then under her maiden name Wade, was also found on a page containing the . details of Sienna Miller and Jude Law, the court heard. Victim: Former News International Chief Executive Rebekah Brooks, pictured with her husband Charlie (left) today, was also a victim of 'extensive' hacking by the News of the World, the court heard . Royal editor Clive Goodman, 56, is accused with Coulson of corruption, while Brooks faces corruption charges for her time as editor of The Sun. Brooks is then accused of masterminding a cover-up with husband Charles, 50, News International head of security Mark Hanna, 50, and PA Cheryl Carter, 49, when she knew she was about to be arrested. Rebekah Brooks, of Jubilee Barn, Churchill, Chipping Norton, Coulson, of Hart Hill, Charing, Kent, Edmondson, of Blenheim Road, Raynes Park, south London, and Kuttner, of Broomhill Walk, Woodford Green, Essex, all deny of one count of conspiracy to intercept communications. Brooks also denies two counts of perverting the course of justice and two counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office. Coulson, with Clive Goodman, of Woodham Lane, Woodham, Addlestone, Surrey, also denies two counts of misconduct in a public office. Carter, of Mildmay Road, Chelmsford, Essex, Hanna, of Glynswood Road, Buckingham, Bucks, and Charles Brooks, of Jubilee Barn, Churchill, Chipping Norton all deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

A ginger cat left commuters astounded when he boarded a Victoria Line train and beat his fellow passengers to a seat. The tom travelled 10 stops, between Seven Sisters and Vauxhall, before he was eventually coaxed into a cat carrier by a Paige Jokovic, a volunteer from the nearby Battersea Dogs and Cats Home who happened to be on the same train.

Lindsey Quinlan, Battersea’s head of cattery, said: 'Oyster is very lucky to have been found on the Tube by Paige who was able to bring him to Battersea. 'We take in cats which have been found in appalling conditions in unusual places including bins and boxes, but Oyster is a healthy, happy boy who appears to have been simply making his way to central London. 'Oyster doesn’t have a microchip, so if nobody comes forward to collect him, he will be rehomed and hopefully not try to take a trip on the Tube by himself again.'

The new boss of Royal Bank of Scotland has promised to ‘obsess about customers all day every day’ in a rousing speech to his staff. Describing his ‘high level of trepidation’ at taking on one of the toughest corporate jobs in Britain, Ross McEwan acknowledged that the bank can be ‘too hard’ to do business with, and promised to ‘make it easier’ for customers to work with the bank. His comments were widely interpreted as a hint that the bank would do more to offer much-needed loans to the country’s struggling small firms - something his predecessor Stephen Hester was heavily criticised for failing to do. Promise: The new boss of RBS Ross McEwan, pictured, said he will create a bank 'known for exceptional customer service and not failure' Addressing 300 staff at the bank’s offices in London, the 56 year old New Zealander pledged to create a bank ‘known for exceptional customer service and not for failure’. He added he would repay British taxpayers for the ‘money and faith they have put in us’. ‘I’m delighted to have the role and slightly fearful of the task I’ve taken on board, which I suspect is a good thing,’ he said. ‘I look forward to being your leader as we change this organisation and refocus it so we obsess all day every day about our customers.’ Outgoing: Stephen Hester, pictured, Mr McEwan's predecessor at the state-owned bank, has been heavily criticised for failing to help small businesses . Addressing criticism of the bank’s lending record, he said: ‘We know sometimes we make it too hard for our customers to do business with us. ‘My aim is to make RBS one of the easiest banks to do business with.’ Last night MPs applauded the comments and urged Mr McEwan to ‘to turn RBS into an engine room’ for UK plc’. Mr McEwan was poached by RBS from Commonwealth Bank of Australia last Summer to run its retail bank. The retail banking credentials of the little known Kiwi meant he was regarded as a front runner to replace Hester, who was ousted in June. RBS has been mired in a string of scandals since it received a £46 billion bail-out from British taxpayers in 2008 and 2009. Earlier this year it was fined £290 million by UK and US authorities for rigging crucial Libor interest rates. So far it has been forced to put aside £2.2 billion compensation for mis-selling payment protection insurance. RBS has also been widely criticised for failing to lend enough to small businesses. Mr McEwan, who arrived at the 250 Bishopsgate offices at 7.15am yesterday, paid tribute to Hester for his ‘remarkable achievement’ in putting a bank ‘which stood on the brink of collapse’ onto a stable footing. Mr Hester has been criticised for being out of touch with the public - particularly over pay as he initally refused to give up his bonuses. Photos of him resplendent in hunting gear or jogging around Hyde Park have proved an irritation. But at his leaving dinner last week, Mr Hester showed he has sense of humour, handing a riding hat to Mr McEwan as a gift. In a bid to avoid the rows over fat cat pay that dogged his predecessor Mr McEwan has already announced that he will forfeit his annual bonus worth up to £2m illion until 2015. But he will still pocket a basic package of more than £1.3 million in 2014 and up to £3million in long term share awards which could pay out in 2017. Mr McEwan becomes the just the latest new bank boss to promise sweeping change. Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins has ordered staff to sign up to five ‘core values’ including respect and integrity as part of an overhaul of its culture. Chris Leslie, shadow treasury minister said: ‘RBS now needs to start behaving like an engine room for UK plc. The time has come to focus on supporting growth.’ end Chris Leslie, shadow treasury minister said: ‘RBS now needs to start behaving like an engine room for UK plc.

The eyes of the world will fall on Brazil over the next few years as it hosts the two greatest sporting shows on Earth. While millions of spectators and the world's press will converge on the South American country for next summer's football World Cup and the Olympics in 2016, a sporting spectacle which is taking place in Mato Grosso has attracted slightly less attention. Around 1,500 competitors are currently taking part in the 12th International Games of Indigenous People in Cuiaba this week. Tough competition: Members of the Brazilian Enawene-Awe indigenous ethnic group compete in a tug-of-war competition at the XII Games of the Indigenous People, in Cuiaba .

The games are the 12th to take place since they began in 1996 . It may not have the glitz and glamour of a major global sporting event, but the vibrant clothes worn by competitors and spectators alike are equally as colourful and the 30 athletic disciplines are taken just as seriously. From tug of war, to the Corrida de Tora (race with a trunk) and spear tossing, natives from 49 Brazilian ethnic groups and 17 other countries strive to be the best in their chosen sport. Each athlete is decked out in the traditional clothing of their people - in some of our images, the only thing that gives away the fact that it is a 21st century competition is the presence of a competitor or spectator using a camera phone to capture the action. The event is aimed at celebrating and preserving native sports. International contest: These women from the Enawenen Awe tribe are among people from 49 indigenous groups in Brazil to take part.

The remains of a former Brazilian president have been exhumed for tests almost four decades after he died to determine whether he was murdered. It has long been thought that Joao Goulart, known as Jango, died of a heart attack in exile in Argentina in 1976. But digging work to remove Mr Goulart's body from his grave in Sao Borja, Brazil, began on Wednesday morning after a Uruguayan intelligence officer claimed that he was poisoned by spies working for the country's military government. Exhumed: Joao Goulart's remains are to be examined to discover whether he died from natural causes or was poisoned . Tests: Forensic technicians stand next to the grave of former Mr Goulart before the exhumation of his remains, in Sao Borja . Mr Goulart had ruled in Brazil from 1961, but was overthrown in a military coup three years later. He initially fled to Uruguay but later moved to Argentina after he was invited by then-president Juan Peron in 1973. The progressive leader, who was known to have left-wing sympathies, died in December 1976 in Mercedes. His death came months after Peron's widow Isabel was overthrown by a military junta. No post mortem was ever carried out in either Argentina or Brazil where he was buried. Officials said he had died of a heart attack. Last resting place: Photographers take pictures of Mr Goulart's grave before digging began on Wednesday morning . Respect: A team of forensic experts, federal police and members of Brazil's Human Rights Ministry stand around the grave . But Mario Neira, who had been jailed for drug smuggling, alleged five years ago that Jango had been poisoned at the request of Brazilian military rulers. He claimed that the plan to kill Mr Goulart, codenamed Operation Condor, was a collaborative effort between governments in Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, and Chile. Neira alleged that spies swapped Mr Goulart's heart medication for tablets that triggered a cardiac arrest. Back home: The former president, known as Jango, was buried in Brazil despite fleeing the country after he was ousted in a military coup in 1964 . Guard: Policemen stand guard at the cemetary where Mr Gualago was buried . Now his claims are being investigated by Brazil's National Truth Commission. Mr Goulart's body will reportedly be taken to Brasilia for tests before an official ceremony is held as he is the only former Brazilian president to be buried with out full honours. According to the BBC, the commission said in a statement: 'Today we will open a new chapter in the tale of mystery which has surround the death 37 years ago of the former president. 'The exhumation will put an end to the anguish of his family and thousands of Brazilians who have sufficient reason to believe that his death did not occur spontaneously, as stated in the death certificate - which was issued without a prior post mortem examination.'","It had been thought that Joao Goulart had died from a heart attack .

Hundreds of thousands of Chinese students are flocking to U.S. colleges and universities, helping to drive the number of international students studying in America to record levels. Similarly, all-time high numbers of American students are studying abroad, although there are far fewer and they tend to do much shorter stints than students coming to the United States, according to a report by the Institute of International Education and the State Department's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. They say international education programs . do more than advance cultural enrichment. They also are an economic . boon to communities that host foreign students and to the students . themselves, who improve their job competitiveness. Popular: 819,644 students came to the United States to study abroad in the 2012-13 school year . Foreign students contribute about $24 billion annually to the U.S. economy and about two-thirds of them primarily pay their own way or their families do. All told, 819,644 students came to the United States to study abroad in the 2012-13 school year. The highest numbers were from China, India, South Korea, Saudi Arabia and Canada. That's a record high, with a seven per cent increase from a year earlier and 40 per cent from more than a decade ago. Despite the increases, international students make up less than four per cent of all students. There was some slowdown in the number of students coming to the United States in the years after the September 11 attacks, in part because of visa issues, but the number has since rebounded. About 237,000 of the international students were from China, a 29 per cent increase. A burgeoning middle class combined with a view that America has quality colleges and universities were factors cited as driving the demand. About one-third studied business and management once they arrived, the report said. Arrivals from the East: About 237,000 of the international students were from China . ‘Chinese students and their parents are looking for high quality education, get the importance of international education, and it's making America the No. 1 destination because we actually have the capacity to absorb international students,’ said Allan Goodman, president and CEO of the institute. The number of students from Saudi Arabia studying in the United States jumped 30 per cent, to 45,000. These students are largely funded by a Saudi government scholarship program nearly in its 10th year, the report said. The top destinations for international students were the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in Champaign, Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, New York University, and Columbia University in New York. The University of Southern California in Los Angeles is very popular with foreign students . By contrast, 283,332 U.S. students studied abroad for academic credit - a three per cent increase from a year earlier. In the past 20 years, the number of U.S. students studying abroad has tripled. But less than 10 per cent of American students study abroad during their college years. The United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, France and China were the top destinations. Attention tied to the Beijing Olympics and more classes taught in English are factors starting to drive more American students to China, Goodman said. A State Department program called 100,000 Strong, which officially started in 2010, aims to send 100,000 American students to China over a four-year period. The report found that 14,887 Americans studied in China in 2011-2012 - a two per cent increase, but that doesn't include students going to China for non-credit programs. ‘We encourage study abroad whether it's short term, long term, whether it's credit, non-credit,’ said Evan Ryan, a State Department official, on a conference call with reporters.","After China, the biggest number of foreign students came from India .

"By . Ellie Buchdahl . PUBLISHED: . 09:47 EST, 17 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:36 EST, 17 November 2013 . Scientists at the centre of the furore surrounding the death of the world's oldest-recorded animal, have hit back at claims they killed the 507-year-old clam simply to find out how old it was. The giant mollusc - nicknamed Ming because it was born at the time of the Chinese Ming Dynasty - met its demise at the hands of marine researchers, when they froze it to take back to their lab at Bangor University in 2006. Last week the researchers announced the clam was more than 100 years older than their initial 2007 estimate of 405 years old - but ended up facing a storm of consternation as reports suggested they had killed the animal while trying to find out its age. This is the only picture of Ming, believed to be the world's oldest animal at 507 years old. Not knowing the long life of the mollusc, researchers at Bangor University opened its shell for analysis, killing Ming in the process . By counting the number of rings visible on the outer shell of the mollusc, researchers calculated that Ming was an incredible 507 years old . Dr Paul Butler, a climate scientist from Bangor University, said Ming was one of many samples collected as part of a climate change research project that he was working on. He said that researchers had no idea of the animal's age when they found it on the coast of Iceland in 2006, then dealt the fatal blow by putting it in a freezer before opening it. Dr Butler said: 'This particular animal was one of about 200 that were collected live . from the Icelandic shelf in 2006.' A quahog’s shell grows a layer every summer when the water is warmer and food plentiful. By counting the number of rings visible on the inside of Ming’s shell, scientists initially thought it was around 400 years old. Ming's life came to an abrupt end seven years ago when scientists from Bangor University dredged the seabed near Iceland (pictured) as part of a study into climate change . However, after analysing the clam more closely, the experts now believe Ming, who was named after the dynasty thought to be ruling China at the time of its birth, was a century older. ‘We got it wrong the first time and maybe we were a bit hasty publishing our findings back then,’ Paul Butler, from Bangor University, told ScienceNordic. The findings mean the mollusc was born seven years after Columbus  discovered America. It lay on the ocean floor throughout historical milestones such as the English Civil War, the Enlightenment, the Industrial Revolution and two world wars. While the lifespans of different species may seem random, there is a pattern. Generally, big creatures live longer than small ones and this goes for plants as well as animals. At one end of the scale are mice and shrews, which live just a couple of years, while at the other are large animals like rhinos, hippos, giant tortoises, lions and elephants, which have life expectancies measured in decades - or even centuries. Some Galapagos tortoises, for instance, have been recorded to reach nearly 200 years. The bowhead whales have been found recently with antique harpoons embedded in their skulls dating from the 1790s. Unless these were a freak, this means that in the sea today there may be large, intelligent animals that pre-date the invention of the railway engine. Other Methuselahs include orange roughly, a Pacific fish increasingly popular as food. These cold-water fish can live to more than 150 years old, meaning that your dinner could date back to a time when Queen Victoria was still middle-aged. But there are some interesting anomalies. Humans, for instance, live longer than is to be expected for our size. Marine biologist Doris Abele believes that Ming's ability to live for centuries could be down to the creatures slow metabolism.","The clam - nicknamed Ming - was killed when it was put in a lab freezer .

Two months after an abused pit bull was found almost beaten and starved to death in Quincy, near Boston, police say they have a suspect in the case. Radoslaw Czerkawski, 32, appeared in New Britain, Connecticut, . Superior Court this afternoon and was placed into the custody of Quincy . cops following a brief hearing. Czerkawski was initially called a 'person of interest' in the case but Quincy police said after his New Britain court appearance that he will be charged with 11 counts of animal cruelty. Each count carries a maximum 5-year prison sentence if convicted. A translator was needed because Czerkawski speaks only Polish. Caught: Radoslaw Czerkawski is being held on a fugitive from justice charge in New Britain, Connecticut. Police in Massachusetts believe he could be involved with the dog abuse case . 'We sent detectives down to speak with him about his involvement with the case,' said Quincy Police Captain John Dougan. He was found at a La Quinta hotel last Wednesday morning, police said, and appeared in New Britain Superior Court earlier today to start the rendition process back to Massachusetts. The charge against Czerkawski is the first significant break in the investigation. He is set to be arraigned tomorrow in Quincy District Court on a charge of misleading a police investigation. Other charges are 'possible,' police added. Cruel: This two-year-old pit bull was found with horrific injuries . 'We have a party that’s charged with . misleading a police investigation, and we’re going to send detectives to . talk to him about their involvement with the case,' Quincy police Capt. John Dougan said this morning. Cops . have spent weeks following the trail of people who have owned the dog, . which had been given away at least once on Craigslist’s animal-adoption . pages by a woman who owned the dog last year. 'Essentially, . we have a person of interest who has knowledge of the case, and . detectives are going to be questioning this person of interest,' Dougan . said. 'Hopefully they’ll answer some questions to put the pieces of the . puzzle together.' Despite . naming Czerkawski as a person of interest in the Puppy Doe case, it's . not clear just what authorities believe his connection is to the dog. Abused: Puppy Doe weighed only 18lb and had been stabbed, burned and tortured . Police . and much of the public have been on the hunt for the suspect since the . female pit bull was found on August 31st close to a local playground. Quincy, . Massachusetts Police, the Animal Rescue League of Boston and the Office . of the District Attorney for the Norfolk District in Massachusetts have . been investigating. 'Please . be assured that these three agencies are working in concert to identify . and hold accountable the person or persons responsible for the torture . of Puppy Doe. It is highly unlikely that this level of sadistic cruelty . could be shown to one animal and not be part of a pattern involving . other animals or perhaps vulnerable people' Norfolk District Attorney . Michael Morrissey said in a statement. The two-year-old dog, found near a . Massachusetts play park, had been beaten, burned, starved and stabbed in . the eyes in what was described as 'medieval' torture . Animal . rescue workers described the injuries inflicted on the pit bull, . including a crude split to give it a forked serpent tongue, as the worst . they had ever seen. Veterinarians . at the Animal Rescue League of Boston who treated the dog said that she . was emaciated and weighed half of what would be expected for a two year . old. Sweet natured: Despite having broken bones, crushed vertebrae and other injuries, the pit bull was friendly . The dog’s tongue had been split on . purpose. She had also been burned on the nose, stabbed in the eye, and . beaten so severely that she could barely walk. The pit bull had to be . put down due to the extent of her injuries. When she was first found it was thought that she had been hit by a car, but the true nature of her injuries soon came to light. Vet . Martha Smith-Blackmore was so shocked by the extent of the abuse that . she had to walk away and give herself a break as she examined the dog's . body. 'Her joints were pulled apart like medieval times,' she said. 'She was beaten, stabbed, burned over weeks to months and maybe her whole life. And could not walk.' The . vet added: 'When I saw how vulnerable she was and I understood . immediately the duration of her suffering, my heart collapsed.' Torture: The dog's limbs had been repeatedly pulled apart . Public outrage saw a number of tips come flooding in to help the Quincy police department in tracking the perpetrator, along with thousands of dollars that had been set aside for a reward. The Animal Rescue League of Boston offered $5,000, followed by the California-based Animal Legal Defense League put up $2,000. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals offered up another $5,000, and Second Chance Rescue out of New York raised $11,000 for information. The Animal Rescue League raised also raised $35,000 additionally to be put toward the investigation of this and other animal abuse cases. The story has prompted Facebook groups that have become the sites of a tremendous outpouring of outrage and grief, and resulted in a vigil held for 'Puppy Doe.' In pain: The dog had suffered such extensive abuse that she had to be put to sleep . Horrified: Vet Martha Blackmore-Smith says she was heart broken by the extent of abuse the dog suffered . Although there was no evidence of . sexual interference, which the vet said can be seen in such abuse cases, . the dog's joints had been separated from being pulled apart repeatedly. Despite the pain and . suffering Puppy Doe had clearly experienced in her short life, staff at . the rescue center said she was sweet natured. 'Within . hours of being found she had pain medication, food and love. She . experienced some tenderness and some care at the end of her life,' Dr . Smith-Blackmore said, adding that the dog's injuries were so severe she . would have always been in pain if she hadn't been put down. As well as the burn and stab marks, the dog's vertebrae had been smashed from being hit by a baseball bat or board.","Radoslaw Czerkawski, 32, faces 11 counts of animal cruelty .

The Solicitor General who criticized Bill Clinton for having an affair with a consenting adult has written to a court in defense of a convicted child molester. Ken Starr, who sparked the Monica Lewinsky scandal with his report on the President, is among a host of celebrities and politicians to come out in support of retired teacher and sex offender Christopher Kloman. The man named as Time magazine's Person of the Year alongside Clinton in 1998 wrote to a Virginia judge, pleading to overturn the 43-year prison sentence handed down to his family friend in October. Backing: Former solicitor general Ken Starr, left, and convicted sex offender Christopher Kloman, right . High profile: Ken Starr was named Time's man of the year alongside Bill Clinton in 1998 . It was one of dozens of letters of support for the former Potomac teacher, who admitted molesting several schoolgirls under the age of 14, according to Gakwer. Alongside Starr, the judge received correspondence from former ABC news anchor Charlie Gibson, a former Laura Bush aide and a one-time GOP congressman. Many of them had sent their children to the $34,000-a-year Virginia school Kloman taught at from 1965 to 1994. When he pleaded guilty to sexually abusing several female students in the 1960s, he told the court: 'I violated their trust. I am embarrassed, horrified, and ashamed of my actions,' ABC 7 reported. One of his victims came forward in 2011 after learning that her abuser was being used as a substitute teacher at her son's school. Kloman was accused of molesting his victims, aged 12 to 14, after luring them to isolated locations under the guise of helping them with homework. Scandal: White House intern Monica Lewinsky with President Clinton . Leniency: Ken and Alice Starr's letter calls for Kloman to be given a lighter sentence . Support: Former ABC anchor Charlie Gibson, left, and congressman James K Coyne III also wrote to the judge . Sympathy: ABC anchor Gibson's letter says any punishment would be retributive rather than rehabilitative . Yet despite his victims' tearful testimony in court and Kloman's own admission of guilty, Starr and other supporters do not believe he should serve a prison sentence. In the letter sent from Starr and his wife, the couple wrote that Kloman should be spared jail because 'he took the time to chat' with their daughter. They added that he had 'made a concerted effort to correct his behavior of the past' and suggested a community sentence would be a more fitting punishment. Their sentiments were echoed by ABC news anchor Charlie Gibson, who wrote: 'Any punishment for Chris now, however, strikes me as retributive not rehabilitative.' Good behavior: Former congressman James K Coyne III highlighted Kloman's positive attributes . A letter from former GOP congressman, James K Coyne III stated that by avoiding jail Kloman could continue his good work in the community - a belief shared by Margaret Whitehead, former aide to Barbara Bush, who also believed that the child molester should be allowed to continue his 'community activism'. Ms Whitehead added that while she was 'reluctant to psychoanalyze Chris ... he has seemed as someone who has already been to prison, felt deep remorse, and was atoning'. Among Kloman's other supporters are former National Geographic editor Gilbert M Grosvenor; senior director of business affairs at Hard Rock International Rebecca L Roby; and William D Hager, a former assistant inspector general for investigations at NASA.","Ken Starr joins other political figures and celebrities supporting self-confessed molester .

Details have now emerged surrounding Marcus Arceneaux's dramatic rescue of bloodied cousin Bethany. Marcelus Arcenaux kicked in the door of the abandoned house ex-boyfriend Scott Thomas was holding her after seeing Bethany in danger. What happened next is straight out of Hollywood. In the violent confrontation that followed, Ms Arceneaux was stabbed by Mr Thomas just before he was shot dead by her cousin, CNN reported. Rescued: Marcus Arceneaux carries his niece, Bethany, to safety after she was kidnapped and stabbed in an abandoned house . Remote: Bethany Arceneaux was rescued from an abandoned house in Louisiana, close to where her kidnapper's car was found . Mr Arcenaux tracked his cousin to the abandoned house in only two days. Once there, he saw Bethany through a window - she was in grave danger. He kicked down the door as Mr Taylor began stabbing the 29-year-old mother of his child, and fired several rounds but was not sure if he hit the violent man, he told CNN. 'We kicked doors down. It was like a movie unfolding,' Miss Arceneaux's brother, Ryan, told the Advertiser. 'If we would have waited, she would have been dead.' Officers instead found Mr Taylor's body in the home later that evening and have since ruled the shooting justified. It is still under investigation by the District Attorney's Office. This wasn't the first time he had violated a restraining order protecting the previously abused woman. Ryan Arceneaux was part of a search party made up of family and friends who were helping police try to find Ms Arceneaux after Mr Thomas, the father of her two-year-old son, kidnapped her on Wednesday evening. At around noon on Friday the group were investigating an abandoned house, barely visible through the sugar cane fields surrounding it. The house, on Anderson Road, was close to where Mr Thomas had ditched his car on Wednesday night. Search party: Family and friends used off road vehicles to search remote areas shielded by sugar cane fields . Hero: Marcus Arceneaux carried his niece to safety after her horrifying ordeal . Kaylyn Alfred, another of the victim's brothers, said they heard screams for help as they entered the desolate building. As the search party confronted Mr Thomas, who was the subject of a restraining order, he allegedly began to harm Miss Arceneaux. In the tussle that followed Mr Thomas was shot and Marcus Arceneaux was able to grab and carry her to safety. 'She’s shook up, she’s sliced up, but she’s alright, Ryan said. His sister was believed to have been stabbed but is recovering in hospital and has been reunited with her son. Captain Kip Justice of the Lafayette Parish Police Department confirmed that 29-year-old father died as a result of injuries received in the confrontation. Stand off: Police use their car as a shield as they surround the house Scott Thomas was hiding in . Search party: Police creep up on the house after the victim's family helped her break free . In June Bethany Arceneaux filed a protection order against Scott Thomas, after he locked her inside their home and made threats to harm her. Thomas was barred from coming near his ex-girlfriend or son, and was ordered to stay away from her home and his child's daycare center. In the order she claimed Thomas had choked her, dragged her by her hair and 'held a knife to my throat countless times'. During the final episode before she left him she said he made threats to kill her. She . added: 'Since then Scott has been riding around my mom's house and my . work looking for me. I am afraid for me and my son's life.' Thomas abducted Miss Arceneaux as she collected her son from daycare on Wednesday, November 6. 'The . man began harming her. He [Arceneaux’s family member] did what he . needed to do to stop that aggressive behavior from Mr Thomas,' Captain . Judice said. Police, who . were also searching for the victim and were close by when shots were . fired, are now trying to piece together what happened. The . search for Ms Arceneaux began when witnesses saw Mr Thomas throw her . into a car at 5.20pm on Wednesday as she collected their son from a . daycare center. Their child was later found abandoned in the car. Ms Arceneaux had filed a protection order earlier this year against him, claiming he had locked her and their young son in the family home and threatened to kill her. The protection order had barred the violent man from coming close to his ex-girlfriend's home or son's daycare center after the threatening episode. 'After we called cops on him he grabbed our son from me and shoved him into the car,' Ms Arceneaux wrote on the order. 'He then got on his knees in front of the cops and said ""I swear to God on all my children I will kill you.' 'Since then Scott has been riding around my mom's house and my work looking for me,' she added. 'I am afraid for me and my son's life.' Hostage: Scott Thomas grabbed Bethany Arceneaux, the mother of his child, on Wednesday evening . Lafayette . Police Corporal . Paul .

From vampire facelifts to snake venom serum, it seems there's a new miracle ingredient launched every week . The latest buzzword in the beauty world is an all-natural skin smoothing secret that African women have kept secret for years - until now. Marula oil has traditionally been used by the Ovambo women in northern Namibia for generations because of its skin smoothing and moisturising properties - and now it's hitting the mainstream. Beauty buzz: Marula oil, which is hand harvested by the women of Nairobi, is hotly tipped to be the next big thing in skincare thanks to its anti-ageing properties (R) African Botanics Pure Marula Oil, Space NK, £60 . Marula oil is hand harvested by women in the villages of Southern Africa, who use it for its medicinal benefits, in particular protecting the skin and hair from the harsh, dry weather conditions. The oil is extracted from the plum-like fruit of a marula tree, which is widely regarded as the spiritual centre in villages. Whilst a number of different products are made from the fruit, it’s the oil that has given the tree its special status. The oil, which is extracted from kernels in its stones, contains four times as much Vitamin C as oranges and is packed with omega-9 fatty acid, vitamin E and flavonoids. These essential fatty acids and powerful antioxidants, particularly the high levels of oleic acid, help maintain the skin’s moisture barrier, provide long-lasting hydration and protect against environmental aggressors. Next big thing: Marula oil claims to be a multifunctional anti-ageing ingredient that hydrates, protects, and rejuvenates the skin (L) Melvita Bio-Excellence Moisturising Serum, £32 (R) Body Shop Cocoa Butter Beautifying Oil, £9, which both contain the oil . The high levels of antioxidants help maintain youthful looking skin, making the product ideal for dull, under-nourished skin and frequent travellers. 'Marula oil is a multifunctional . anti-ageing premium facial oil that hydrates, protects, and rejuvenates . the skin. Contains four times as much Vitamin C as oranges . Packed with omega 9, fatty acid and vitamin E . Great for body and hair . Can alleviate snake bite pain . 'In the day it provides protection from UV damage, environment . (pollution, exposure), and fatigue, whilst in the night the antioxidants . are at their most active in healing and repairing skin while we sleep,' said Julia Noik, a spokesperson for African Botanics, who sell marula oil-based products. Shona Wilkinson, head Nutritionist at The Nutri Centre, added: 'Marula oil has been used by women in . Africa for many years. 'The key to this oil . is that it is high in antioxidants and oleic acid. Because of the high . levels of oleic acid (Omega 9) it is absorbed really easily and . quickly. This will help provide longer lasting hydration. 'It is often . used either on its own or added to creams to provide hydration for the . prevention of fine lines'. The benefits of marula oil don’t just relate to skin and The Body Shop have joined forces with The Eudafano Women's Cooperative to help change the lives of the women who collect it. ‘The Eudafano Women’s Cooperative provides income for 1,750 women in a very marginalised area of Namibia where there are no other forms of income-earning opportunities,’ Rosie Collins, a Community Fair Trade senior buyer at The Body Shop, told The Metro. ‘Women also learn how to manage their finances, the nutritional health of their children improves and they develop an entrepreneurial attitude through selling marula juice locally and marketing Eudafano’s marula oil internationally.’ Now that's beauty with heart.","Been used by the Ovambo women in northern Namibia for generations .

The video was posted online Saturday night and it has prompted a police investigation of the Fredericksburg, Virgina, officers involved in the incident. The man, later identified as 36-year-old Lantz Day, had been a passenger in a car that had hit five parked vehicles as it sped down a street, the Free Lance-Star reports. Scroll down for video .

The probes are attached to wires that deliver more 5,000 volts of electric shock. The high voltage makes muscles to contract, usually causing the target of the Taser shock to fall to the ground and become temporarily unable to move arms or legs. Lanz can be heard screaming in pain and yelling 'Stop it! Stop it!' as he writhes in pain on the ground.

A Walmart in Canton, Ohio, has set up a canned food drive so that its own employees can afford to pay for Thanksgiving dinner. The fundraiser was revealed earlier this month when an employee snapped a picture of two plastic bins managers had set up in a break room at the store with a sign that reads, 'Please donate food items here so Associates in Need and enjoy Thanksgiving Dinner.' The image has become a lightning rod for criticism for the retail giant. Labor activists say it's proof that Walmart doesn't pay its employees nearly enough and that wages are so small that many can't even afford the holiday meals that they work to sell. Walmart has fired back, saying that the food drive at the Canton Walmart is proof that its employees stick together and support each other when they fall on hard times. Need a hand-out? This picture, which shows a food drive set up for Walmart employees at an Ohio Walmart has sparked criticism for the retail giant . At least one employee said she is grateful for the program, which helped her put Thanksgiving dinner on the table when her child support payments dried up . 'It is for associates who have had some hardships come up. Maybe their spouse lost a job,' Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg told the Cleveland Plain Dealer. 'This is part of the company's culture to rally around associates and take care of them when they face extreme hardships.' But, the picture has become a rallying cry for labor groups, including Organization United for Respect at Walmart (OUR Walmart) - which says it is planning protests and employee walk-outs for Black Friday at stores in Dayton and Cincinnati, Ohio. 'Why would a company do that?' Vanessa Ferreira, a labor organizer and former Walmart employee, told the Plain Dealer. 'The company needs to stand up and give them their 40 hours and a living wage, so they don't have to worry about whether they can afford Thanksgiving.' The sign was posted at the Walmart in Canton, Ohio - but it has energized labor leaders across the country . The labor group OUR Walmart has promised Black Friday walkouts and other protests against the retailer's wages . The company says it pays an average hourly wage of $12.87 and hour and full-time employees usually earn about $25,000 a year. However, labor activists say independent surveys of employees show the average wage is between $8 and $10 an hour - which works out to $15,000 to $20,000 a year, a figure that is below the federal poverty line for a family of four. The employee who took the photo of the food drive in the Canton Walmart told the Plain Dealer she makes almost $12 an hour, but earned only $17,000 last year because she frequently see her hours cut. Walmart says it has programs to help needy employees who find themselves in financial emergencies. It also says it is promoting 35,000 employees from part time to full time in the last quarter of 2013 alone - as part of its commitment to hiring full time employees. Erica Reed, who works at the Canton store doing the food drive, says she has benefited from the effort in previous years when she lost her child support payments when her children's father was sent to jail. 'It took a burden off me. I didn't have to worry about how I was getting my turkey to feed them Thanksgiving dinner,' she told the newspaper.","The Walmart in Canton, Ohio, set up bins in a break room and asked employees to contribute canned goods for needy employees .

A woman who dropped to a skeletal four stone battling the eating disorder anorexia has made an amazing recovery after getting a job at McDonald's. Jo Thompson, now 21, beat the life-threatening disorder after falling in love with the manager of the fast food branch when she was 17. And today, despite being told she would almost certainly be infertile for life after inflicting so much damage on her body, the couple live together with their two healthy children Zaki and Amelia. Jo Thompson, 21, battled a deadly eating disorder by getting a job at McDonald's . Finding love with partner Zoheb helped Jo overcome her illness and the couple now have two children Zaki (L) and Amelia (R) Jo, from Solihull, West Midlands, developed the mental illness aged just 11 when she began suffering from extreme anxiety and panic attacks. Within six months she had been hospitalised and at her lowest point, weighing just four stone, doctors gave her just 48-hours to live. For the next six years, Jo was so gripped by anorexia she allowed herself just water and peas to survive - and did excessive numbers of star jumps to lose more weight. But, aged 17, Jo realised that the only way she would ever recover would be to get used to seeing people eating around her - and, deciding to jump in at the deep end, applied for a job at McDonalds. Jo ended up falling for the fast food chain’s manager Zoheb Khan, 25, and together they worked at beating the disorder . Jo said: 'The turning point for me was when I was 17. After meeting up with my friends I realised I didn’t want to spent my whole life in and out of hospital. 'I got a job in McDonald’s because I wanted to show everyone that I could beat anorexia. People were shocked but I had to prove that I could beat my demons. Jo, pictured in 2004 at 12 years old, became ill when she was only 11 and battled the disease for 6 years . 'It was there that I met the love of my life Zoheb - we’d sit and have lunch together and he’d say ‘I’m not eating mine until you’ve eaten yours’. 'He helped me battle my eating disorder and I began to feel happy again.' Jo and Zoheb worked together to overcome anorexia and now have two children together - one-year-old Amelia and Zaki, aged two. She said: 'I would allow myself one glass of water before bed and lived off a couple of peas during my time in hospital. 'I would be constantly exercising often not sitting down until 11pm with the constant need to burn calories. 'Nurses would hold me down to try and prevent me from star jumping and losing any more weight . 'I was at school one day when I started to feel dizzy and people screamed ‘you’re going blue’. 'I was terrified of dying in my sleep and I would tell my mum ‘I’m going to eat and drink tomorrow I promise’ - but I was so gripped by the illness I knew deep down that I wouldn’t be able to.' However love manged to penetrate the disease and from the moment Jo met Zoheb they were inseparable. After just seven months they decided to move in together. Jo had been told by doctors that she might not be able to have children due to the damage caused by anorexia. Jo overcame her fear of food while working at McDonald's and was amazed when she first became pregnant, having been told her years of anorexia meant she would be unable to conceive . She said: 'I’d only had one period since I left hospital but one day at a football match I felt a flutter in my stomach and I just knew I was pregnant. 'I loved being pregnant as it was the first time in my life I felt it was acceptable to put weight on as I wanted to be healthy for my baby. 'Anorexia is not in control of me anymore - I have my two beautiful children to look after now so I will never let myself become ill again. 'I want my story to show people that anyone can become anorexic - it isn’t a choice girls make, it’s an illness that controls every aspect of your life. 'Zoheb still works at McDonald’s as a . manager and I have started a college course. My story shows there is a . happy ending after anorexia.' Jo says she loved being pregnant because she felt it was acceptable to put weight on as she wanted to be healthy for her babies Zaki (l) and Amelia . A spokesman for the eating disorder charity Beat said: 'Eating disorders are treatable, and recovery is possible. One very persistent myth is that no one ever really ‘gets over it’. 'We hear positive recovery stories every day here at Beat and we know that this myth simply isn’t true. People can and do make a full recovery, their health and wellbeing restored and their lives no longer dominated by fear of food.'","Jo developed anorexia age 11 and was hospitalised within 6 months .

But for teacher Jen Bramwell, 31, Cupid's arrow hit as she watched TV show, Supersize vs Superskinny. While watching an episode of the popular reality series, Ms Bramwell, at the time living in Barbados, spied 25-stone takeaway addict Chris Longley, 26 and was instantly smitten. Determined to meet him, she tracked him down on Facebook and sent him a message - and much to her delight, romance blossomed. Love: 31-year-old Jen Bramwell fell in love with her fiance Chris Longley after seeing him on the reality series . Slimmer: Chris weighed 26st before his appearance on the show but has now slimmed down to 19st . Ms Bramwell, who hails from Greenwich in London, explained: 'I had been overweight myself so I could relate to the 'supersizers'. I was a serious chocoholic growing up. 'When I graduated from university in 2003 I was a size 22. But reading a book by health expert Jason Vale changed my life. I quit chocolate and joined a gym. I lost six stone.' Nevertheless, as she reveals, her battles with her weight continued to affect her life. 'I had an ongoing fascination with other people losing weight,' she reveals, 'and as the contestants introduced themselves, Chris caught my eye. 'In a flash of inspiration I checked Chris’s surname on the credits and then typed ""Chris Longley"" into Facebook. 'Seconds later he was there in his profile photos, with Dr Christian Jessen, the doctor,' adds Ms Bramwell. Supersize vs. Superskinny: Chris (right) pictured with presenter Dr Christian Jessen and skinny Nathan Smith . Smitten: The pair hit it off after Ms Bramwell contacted Chris through Facebook after seeing the show . Help: Ms Bramwell used to be overweight (right) and has helped her new fiance lose more than seven stone . 'I typed: ""Hi Chris. I’ve just seen you on Supersize vs. Superskinny and I just wanted to say congratulations. You’ve done so well and should be really proud of yourself."" and sent it.' That message proved to be the start of an unlikely romance, as, within moments of seeing it, Chris accepted the friend request from Ms Bramwell and the pair began chatting about their weight loss experiences, the show and their lives. 'We got chatting and Chris gave me all the gossip about his TV experience, and I told him about my life in Barbados,' she remembers. 'I told him I had never contacted anyone like this before and he told me he had had a few women propositioning him since the show, but that I was ""definitely the most sane!""' Their relationship soon progressed onto daily video calls and the couple fell madly in love. In July 2012, four months after the show aired, Ms Bramwell got a job in London and IT worker Chris met her at the airport. He whisked her off for a romantic break in London before dutifully driving her back to her parent’s house in Manchester. Romantic: The pair became engaged after Chris proposed to a thrilled Ms Bramwell during a trip to Barbados . Just three months later, the couple became fed up of their long-distance relationship and Chris moved to the capital from Portsmouth. 'He told me it was worse than when I was in Barbados so I said ""let’s get a place together."" He thought it was a great idea,' remembers Ms Bramwell. 'It helped with his weight loss journey too. On Sundays we would plan our weekly meals by writing the menu out on the kitchen table. 'It was a great way of keeping track of what we were eating and being sensible with money and ingredients.' So effective did the dietary regime prove, Chris went on to lose another four stone, taking his total up to seven stone and making him the biggest loser out of anyone on the show. In April 2013, a year after the couple first began talking, Chris took Ms Bramwell on holiday to Barbados and proposed on the beach. The couple are now planning a May 2014 wedding. 'I find it amazing that before I even met Chris I knew he was the one for me,' she reveals. 'Now we have the rest of our lives to enjoy together.'","Jen Bramwell, 31, first saw fiance Chris Longley, 26, on television .

Furious parents have blasted the BBC’s new children’s series Topsy and Tim, branding it 'flabbergastingly sexist'. The new version of Topsy and Tim, which hit screens earlier this month on CBeebies, was supposed to have been updated for the 21st century. But despite dad using a tablet computer and mum spending time on her laptop, the series - inspired by the hugely popular books and animated TV show of the same name - appears to be stuck in the past. Scroll down for video . The new series of Topsy and Tim has caused controversy: L-R, Topsy (Jocelyn Macnab), Dad/Brian (Chris Hannon), Grandma Jean (Suzy Aitchison), Tim (Joshua Lester) Since the first of 60 episodes aired on November 10, thousands of parents have flocked to internet forum Mumsnet to express their opposition to the show. Most of the outrage is over the way the characters conform to gender stereotypes. One parent, who called themselves MadBannersAndCopPorn posted: 'I caught it for the first time tonight and thought it was a load of rubbish. 'I hated the boys playing on quads and girls decorating princess cupcakes too - Tim’s friend a boy, Topsy’s a girl etc .

Another parent, called DoubleLifeIsALifeOfSorts added: 'It’s flabbergastingly sexist - I was so disappointed. 'Mummy and Topsy do the washing while Tim helps daddy with the man’s work. 'Topsy is inside making cakes and Tim gets told they’re not for him and he must go outside and play with the quad bike. 'I can’t let my three-and-a-half-year-old watch it, he already thinks girls can’t do stuff that boys can.'

Some 21,900 people out of 98,400 with HIV do not know they have it, according to 2012 data from Public Health England. Almost 50 per cent of the 6,360 people newly-diagnosed with HIV in 2012 were diagnosed at a late stage, while the overall number of new cases was up one per cent on the previous year. New HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men reached an all-time high, with 3,250 cases in 2012. Some 45 per cent of new cases of HIV were among heterosexuals, accounting for 2,880 cases. Gay men remain the group most affected by HIV, followed by black African men and women. Professor Noel Gill, head of PHE's HIV department, said: ‘In the UK, people who are unaware of their infection are likely to be those most at risk of transmitting HIV to others. ‘We must increase the speed at which we're reducing the number of undiagnosed HIV infections by encouraging earlier and more frequent HIV testing, especially in those most at risk. ‘Earlier diagnosis will help reduce new HIV infections across the UK. ‘Around half of men who have sex with men recently diagnosed with HIV received their diagnosis the first time they were tested, which is a strong indication that many men who should be testing are not.’ Paul Ward, acting chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘Reducing undiagnosed HIV is now the single most important step we can take to halt the spread of infection in this country. ‘Some communities are already making headway in this. ‘Among gay men, testing rates are up, diagnoses are up, and as a result undiagnosed infection is coming down. ‘Because of community-wide initiatives like National HIV Testing Week, hundreds more people with HIV now know their status, helping them access life-saving treatments and drastically reducing the chance of them passing the virus on.

A grandmother who spent most of her life avoiding the gym has become a world-beating weightlifter with three world records to her name. Tania George, 43, smashed a world record this month when she deadlifted 200kg at the 2013 World Powerlifting Congress championships in Prague. What makes her achievement all the more remarkable is not just that it is the fourth world record she has broken this year, but that she only began competing as a powerlifter two years ago. Tania George, 43, of Manchester, has broken four world records in deadlifting since starting weightlifting in 2011 . Tania, seen right in competition at the British Powerlifting Union Womenís Masters competition in Folkestone in September had spent her life avoiding gyms until two years ago . Mrs George, of Manchester, said: 'In my early 30s I fell into the habit of joining ladies-only gyms and giving up my membership after a month or so. 'I would try the same old cardio exercises and soon it would become monotonous and boring. I really wasn’t that interested. I’d rather just sit at home on the sofa and watch TV. 'I’ve achieved so much since then - I’m really proud of myself.' Mrs George returned to the UK in 1998 after several years of living abroad. After working in a variety of sales positions she set up a sports massage service in a gym in 2005 after meeting the gym’s owner, bodybuilder Paul George, 51. The pair married in 2009. At the British Powerlifting Union Women's Masters competition (pictured) in Folkestone in September, she broke world records in her class for squat, bench press and deadlift . Mrs George said: 'I started weight training because I had idle time between massage appointments. At first I wanted simple exercises to improve my abdominal muscles. But I found I really liked it, and I was amazed at the difference it made to my physique. 'Even better, I found the weightlifting community to be lovely. Everyone was really welcoming and friendly. 'For the first time I was in an environment where people were praising and encouraging me to continue in the training I was doing, and giving me feedback about the results I was getting. It made all the difference.' Supported by her husband and her 16-year-old son and 19-year-old daughter, Mrs George was ready to try her first competition in 2011. The following year her daughter gave birth to a son - Mrs George’s first grandchild. Tania with her husband Paul George, 51, who she met when she began working at the gym he owned, at their wedding in 2009 . This year, after countless hours of training, Mrs George began breaking records. At the British Powerlifting Union Women’s Masters competition in Folkestone in September, she broke world records in her class for squat, bench press and deadlift. She went beyond her personal best by deadlifting 200k at the World Powerlifting Congress world championships in Prague in November 2013, again breaking the world record. Tania says that she wishes she had started bodybuilding earlier in her life, but that she is proud of what she has achieved . She said: 'Looking back, I’m extremely proud of my achievements. I’ve worked hard for them. 'Sometimes I wish I could have started powerlifting earlier in my life, but I believe that everything happens as it is supposed to and I have no regrets.' Mrs George has now started weight training classes exclusively for women, organised through her Facebook group at www.facebook.com/Nodumbelles, and has become a vocal advocate for her adopted sport. She said: 'Some women who powerlift have encountered negative reactions. There’s a misconception that powerlifting could only be appealing to butch or unfeminine women. 'Most of those bad reactions have unfortunately come from other women who are overweight or who are ignorant about sport. I think that kind of ignorance usually reflects failings in the people who are making the criticisms. 'When women come into the gym and ask me how they can lose weight I tell them, ‘I can help you do that if you like, but have you ever thought about becoming strong instead?’ It’s something they never think of, but most women like the idea. 'Powerlifting has given me wonderful benefits. I’m lucky to have met some amazing people and I feel great. If I can help other women achieve that, then I would like to try.'","Tania, 43, started lifting two years ago, having avoided the gym all her life .

A young mother has lost more than half her body weight after discovering that she was too fat to fit into an aeroplane seat belt. Katy Isaac's embarrassing moment came in 2006, when the 28-year-old tipped the scales at an unhealthy 22 stone. After boarding a flight to Turkey, the mother-of-two found herself unable to do up the safety strap and was forced to ask the stewardess for an extender belt usually given to pregnant women. Much better: A slimline Katy pictured at home in Welshpool. She lost an incredible 12st 5lb and is now a size 8 . Difference: Katy pictured on her 2006 honeymoon (left) and slender after losing weight in 2013 (right) Horrified, Katy, who works as a dinner lady in her home town of Welshpool in Shropshire, decided something had to be done about her weight, most of which had crept on thanks to a diet of chips and Chinese takeaways. After failing to lose weight on her own, she finally joined Slimming World 18 months ago and cut out junk food and cooking with oil. Since then, Katy, who is married to Craig, 41, has lost an incredible 12 stone 5lbs and now weighs a trim nine stone 13lbs and is a svelte size eight. 'I’d tried losing weight before but I always failed miserably because the diets I followed would leave me feeling hungry and deprived, and so I’d be miserable, too,' explains Katy. 'I was never a big person until the birth of my daughter Milly when I started living on convenience foods. Embarrassing: While en route to Turkey for her 2006 honeymoon, Katy found she was too fat for the seatbelt . All gone: Katy says the experience was so humiliating, she returned determined to lose weight . 'We would eat ready meals every day, and loads of takeaways, I loved a trip to the chippy or a Chinese meal. 'The lowest point was for my honeymoon to Turkey, I got on the plane and sat in my seat, but when I picked up the belt I realised it would not fit around my stomach. 'I tried and tried but it would not go, I realised there were people staring at me, it was so embarrassing for me. 'I had to call the stewardess, and they had to bring me an extender normally given to pregnant woman or parents who have children on their laps. I tried after that to lose the weight, but it still didn’t work. 'I’d miss my favourite foods too much, so before long I’d have thrown in the towel and be back where I started. But Slimming World was completely different to anything I’d known before.' Katy, who earlier this month was named one of . Slimming World’s slimmer of the years and met a host of stars, . including West Life star Brian McFadden, at the awards ceremony in . Birmingham, says small changes made the biggest difference. Healthier: Katy credits making small changes such as wholemeal bread in place of white for her new look . Family: Katy says her children Milly and Harvey. pictured in 2007, are benefiting from her new regime . Award: Katy was named one of Slimming World's slimmers of the year for 2013 following her diet . 'The changes I made to the way I cooked and ate were small ones, like swapping white bread for wholemeal and using low calorie spray instead of oil or butter, but they made a big difference,' she explains. 'They meant I could still enjoy all my favourites and lose weight. It was great to be able to eat the same as my family and friends instead of having to have a separate diet dinner, too, so they’ve benefited from eating more healthily without even trying.' Katy has also swapped ready meals for homemade suppers and says that she's not the only one feeling the benefits of her newly healthy lifestyle. 'I feel so much better now, and I feel better for my children. Everything we eat at home is now home-made, it means I have not only helped myself but improved my children’s lives. 'It is fantastic, my next goal is to run a half marathon, I love running now, it’s one of the things there was no way I could do 18-months-ago.'' Heather Robertson, who runs the Welshpool Slimming World group, said: 'Katy doesn’t only look great on the outside; she’s a new woman on the inside, too. 'Nowadays she’s unrecognisable from the shy, unhappy woman who walked into the group all those months ago. 'She’s happier, healthier and more confident, and her success is contagious as she’s inspired so many other people in the group.'","Katy Isaac, 28, has lost 12st 5lb and is now a slim size 8 .

More than 80 per cent of patients on some hospital wards would not want their loved ones treated there, according to the Government’s own figures. They show there are 19 wards across England where at least half of patients there last month would not recommend the care to their friends and family. The worst is Blackpool Victoria Hospital’s ward 12, which specialises in illnesses of the stomach and intestine and which none of the patients said they would recommend. No-go: Blackpool Victoria Hospital's ward 12 which no patients said they would recommend . In Swindon Great Western Hospital’s Woodpecker ward, only six of 41 patients who took part in the survey last month would be happy for loved ones to receive treatment there. The Government launched its flagship ‘friends and family’ test in April to measure levels of care and give patients and relatives more information about standards in hospitals. It can be filled in by any patient going to casualty or staying overnight on a ward and consists of a simple question: ‘How likely are you to recommend our ward/A&E department to friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment?’ Patients tick one of six boxes – extremely likely, likely, neither, unlikely, extremely unlikely or don’t know. Each hospital, A&E unit and ward is then given a score of between -100 and 100, which is the number of ‘positive’ patients minus the ‘negative’ patients. In Swindon Great Western Hospital¿s Woodpecker ward, only six of 41 patients who took part in the survey last month would be happy for loved ones to receive treatment there . Any score above 0 is regarded as good, while above 50 is seen as excellent. The latest results show the average A&E score is 50, while the average for hospital wards is 72. The test has been described as the NHS’s equivalent of ‘Tripadvisor’ – the website where the public can recommend restaurants and hotels. The public can see the scores on the NHS Choices website along with comments from other patients. The Government has told hospitals to ensure that at least 15 per cent of patients complete the surveys. But the latest monthly  figures show that in one A&E unit, at Medway Maritime Hospital, in Gillingham, Kent, just four out of the 3,547 patients who appeared last month did so.

Only six of the 3,367 patients who arrived at Milton Keynes A&E last month completed the poll – fewer than 0.2 per cent. These figures will fuel concerns that staff are handing forms only to patients they know are pleased with their care. But NHS England said response rates have steadily improved since the surveys were launched six months ago. Patients are also asked whether there is anything they would change on the ward. Hillingdon NHS Trust in West London has rolled out quietly-closing bins and dimmer lights after patients complained that it was too noisy and too bright at night. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the surveys represented ‘real patient power’ and were ‘driving hospitals to raise their game’. Hospitals with consistently low scores are referred to the Care Quality Commission.","At least half of patients would not recommend 19 wards in England .

Cara Delevigne adores them, Pixie Lott seems to have a wardrobe full of them and Cressida Bonas never seems to take hers off. But it's not the latest Givenchy must-have that has send the A-list scurrying to the shops. Instead, it's the retro scrunchie that has become the talk of Tinseltown. Despite being as dated as the shoulder pad and the leg warmer, the 80s classic, as the Observer points out, has been enthusiastically embraced by stars hoping to show off their edgy side. Retro: Pixie Lott and Selena Gomez have both been spotted out and about with their hair in a scrunchie . Favourite: Prince Harry's girl Cressida Bonas is rarely seen without a scrunchie perched atop her blonde locks . What's more, it's not just the starry set who have declared a penchant for the scrunchie - the frilly hairpiece has been spotted all over the catwalk too. In September, it appeared repeatedly on the runway, with Vivienne Westwood, Louis Vuitton and Missoni all among those embracing the look. So what's behind the scrunchie revival? Opinion is split, with some pinning it on the Olympics effect while others cite the 1980s redux that has dominated the high street in recent years. 'The scrunchie is super 1980s and slightly trashy, and bordered on the naff in the early 1990s,' hairdresser Luke Hersheson told the Observer. 'But the long ones with wire and velvet that you can make bows out of are great.' Original: Madonna shows how to work a scrunchie in her 1985 film, Desperately Seeking Susan . Avoiding the trend: Former scrunchie fan Madonna was last seen in one in 2009 - unlike Heather Mills . Another fan is milliner Charlie Le Mindu who counts Lady Gaga among devotees of his sculptural creations. 'I like the scrunchie look, but it's better for older women, or underground drag queens,' he explains. He adds: 'I like them if there are lots of them, used to create modern forms, not just something to tie your hair back.' But despite approval from Le Mindu and Hersheson, one group who won't be embracing the look is the team at fashion glossy, Harper's Bazaar. Last month, the title included an article that listed five reasons to hate the scrunchie, while calling it an 'unsophisticated accessory' and declaring that it was a fad they would be sitting out. Even Madonna, the woman who elevated scrunchie-sporting to a fine art during her Desperately Seeking Susan days doesn't appear thrilled about the renaissance of the frilly hairband, and is now rarely seen in them. So will you dare to brave the scrunchie? It seems that this is one hair trend that could prove just as divisive as it did the first time round.","Stars to embrace the retro look include Cressida Bonas and Pixie Lott .

'Scrooge': Jane Porter, Headteacher of Whitehill Primary School in Gravesend, has defended her ban on Christmas . A primary school headmistress has forbidden children as young as four from mentioning Christmas, threatening to cut their play time if they break the rule. Jane Porter has imposed a Christmas ban on all pupils and staff at Whitehill Primary School in Gravesend, Kent until December. Outraged parents say their children are being punished over something they are too young to understand. Mrs Porter claims holiday excitement has been taking hold too early and is distracting the pupils at the Kent school. She says starting Christmas celebrations too early means the true spirit of the event is lost. However, parents at Whitehill say many of the children, who are aged four and upwards, do not understand why they are not allowed to mention Christmas, and are branding Mrs Porter a 'Scrooge'. Father-of-three Robert Dalton, 31, an electrician, said: ‘I feel this is wrong and immoral. ‘Kids have Christmas rammed down their throat by TV advertising from as early as September and yet they can be punished for mentioning it at school. ‘If they are caught saying the word Christmas they stand to lose their golden time flexi playtime which is used as a reward for good work and behaviour.’ An anonymous parent added: 'How dare a headteacher threaten children with losing their golden time like this? 'She’s a Scrooge is ever there was one - all the kids are doing is talking about what they would like for Christmas or where they are going to spend the holidays.' Mrs. Porter said: ‘It has always been the case that Christmas, a Christian festival, starts on the fourth Sunday before Christmas, and that’s December 1 this year. ‘It’s always been the case at our school. It’s been like that since I started here in 1997 and it was like that before then too. ‘I would have to question why people would want it to start any earlier.’ Festivity ban: Children at Whitehill Primary School, who are aged from four and upwards, have been banned from mentioning the word Christmas or anything related to the holiday or face losing 'golden playtime' She added: ‘One of our rules is to work hard, so if the children are not working hard, talking about Christmas for instance, then they will lose their golden time. ‘That would be the case with anything not related to school - they shouldn’t be talking about David Beckham, for example. ‘If they’re talking about something they shouldn’t be, they’re not working hard. ‘We’re a school, we’re about education, not retail.’ Whitehill Primary was rated ‘good’ this year by Ofsted, which praised teachers and pupils. The report said: ‘The clear vision of the head teacher has been pivotal in improving the school. ‘Her high aspirations and focused development have been pursued with rigour and resulted in clear improvements in pupils’ progress, behaviour and the quality of teaching.’ Advent, the period of anticipation before Christmas, begins on the fourth Sunday before December 25, which this year is December 1.","Jane Porter say festive excitement is distracting the pupils .

Mystery surrounds a note inside a century-old glass vessel that was painstakingly recovered from under a flagstone at Durham Cathedral this week. The bottle contained a faded piece of paper with the names of who are believed to be three gravediggers, along with the message: 'This grave was opened on Sunday May 11th 1913.' But experts are baffled as to why the men left the note there or what it means. Mystery: Experts painstakingly recovered this century-old glass vessel from underneath Durham Cathedral but bafflement surrounds the meaning of a note that was left inside . Plot thickens: The note was believed to have been planted by three gravediggers. It said: 'This grave was opened on May 11th 1913' Bafflement: Experts have no idea of the context of the note or what the men could have meant . Cathedral archaeologist Norman Emery said: 'Whether they opened the grave deliberately or by accident is not known. 'We will now attempt to find out who the three men were and then try and find out whose grave they opened. 'They reason why they left the note may be one part of the conundrum we will never be able to solve.' Stonemason Steve Mann unearthed the remarkably well-preserved bottle while re-laying the flagstones near the tomb of the Venerable Bede in the cathedral's 12 century Galilee Chapel on Tuesday last week. The only tantalizing clue to what lay within was the words Globe Theatre, visible on the paper's letterhead. The bottle was handed over to Durham University conservator Liz Brannigan, who looked on as freelance conservator Bob Elsey gently prised the cork out under a microscope on Friday. The note was written on the back of an advert for the Globe Theatre in London, known now as the Gielgud Theatre . Mr Elsey said: 'After five minutes the cork it started to loosen.

Claim: Merseyside PCSO Pauline Harrison is suing a property firm after injuring herself while on duty . A police community support officer is seeking £5,000 compensation from a property firm after she injured her knee while investigating a burglary. Pauline Harrison, 53, was responding to a 999 call of a break-in at a derelict school when she fell over a 3ft high wooden fence. The PCSO, who serves with Merseyside Police, said she suffered ‘soft tissue damage’ to her right knee as she tried to leave the property in Birkdale, near Southport. The case will reignite controversy over the millions of pounds in compensation claims – fuelled by no-win, no-fee lawyers – made by police who are injured on duty every year. Last night Miss Harrison’s decision to sue was condemned by her own force. The incident happened in 2009 when she was called to reports of youths on the roof of four-storey Sunshine House, a former school for the blind, owned by property development firm Lightflask Ltd. Previously, yobs had lit fires in the grounds and the firm had secured the perimeter with a 6ft iron fence, except for a small wooden 3ft fence closing off a gateway at the front  of the site. In court papers, Miss Harrison alleges Lightflask Ltd was negligent because it had allowed the wooden fence to become a ‘danger and a trap to persons lawfully entering and exiting the premises’. The former dog trainer also claims the company had failed to provide or make the wooden fencing safe, failed to properly warn the PCSO about the fencing, or erect warning signs. Miss Harrison also says there was no adequate system of inspection or maintenance of the site. Derelict: Ms Harrison was attending reports of a burglary at this former school in Birkdale when she tripped . She is claiming up to £5,000 in damages, which also includes £25 travelling expenses, £14 prescription charges and £102 physiotherapy costs. Last night a spokesman for Lightflask Ltd said it was ‘concerning’ that the public could be sued by police officers and PCSOs going about their duties. Police officers have sought huge sums for controversial claims. Among them are: . WPC Fiona Clark sued for £400,000. She hurt her back lifting boxes of stationery. WPC Kelly Jones demanded £50,000 from the owner of a petrol station where she tripped on the kerb during a call-out. Detective . Inspector Brian Baker won a £7,000 payout after he claimed exposure to . cannabis fumes made him snore and caused problems in his marriage. WPC Louise McGarva sued for £500,000 after claiming she developed a fear of sirens following a riot-training exercise. PC John Franklin won £108,000. He was injured by handcuffs on a safety course. PC George Smillie was awarded an estimated £10,000 after he hurt his knee playing football on a training course. WPC Lesley O’Shea sued for £200,000 after slipping on a banana skin. ‘I don’t think people expect to be sued by somebody working in the police who claims injury in the course of their duties,’ the spokesman said. ‘Surely the nature of the job carries inherent risks. ‘In this case the claimant is a community support officer. There must be a worry that these support officers may not be trained to the level of a regular officer.’ Chief Superintendent Nikki Holland, of Merseyside Police, said Miss Harrison’s decision to make a claim ‘is not a course of action that the force would encourage or support. However, this is a private matter for the individual and the force has no direct influence over private civil claims’. Miss Harrison was unavailable for comment. Her solicitor, Jared Bailey, said it would not be appropriate to comment. The case is due to before Liverpool County Court next month. Earlier this year Home Secretary Theresa May criticised ‘frivolous’ claims being made by officers which she said were ‘not the sort of attitude’ they should exhibit. Her comments came after WPC Kelly Jones, 33, threatened to sue a garage owner in Thetford, Norfolk, after she tripped over a kerb while investigating a burglary. She later dropped her claim.","Pauline Harrison, 53, tripped over a fence outside abandoned building .

This is the astonishing moment a suspected hit-and-run driver watched passers-by desperately help a man he had knocked down before calmly fleeing the scene. Brian Day, 48, was allegedly struck by the driver of the silver Toyota Avensis on Upper Brook Street, Manchester city centre, after he stepped out into the road. The shocking image shows the driver stood idly watching as members of the public help the injured Mr Day just outside the Manchester Royal Infirmary (MRI). Struck: Police are hunting a driver, circled, who apparently left Brian Day, 48, with . serious injuries following a hit and run in Manchester city centre earlier this month. The whole incident was captured on CCTV . The driver stopped at the scene - but moments later made off before police arrived. Mr Day was taken the short distance back to the MRI with a fractured eye socket and damage to his spleen. He has since been discharged. His wife Tracey Day, 47, from Beswick, Manchester, said Mr Day, an unemployed former Royal Mail worker and father of three, was lucky to survive. She said: 'I am angry and upset. If that was a child who had been hit they might not have survived. 'I don't understand how they could get out of the car, look at him and get back in the car and drive off and leave him on the floor. 'A few of the doctors told me I am very lucky - I could have been planning his funeral' The incident happened at around 6pm on Sunday, November 3, but police have not yet tracked down the motorist. Mr Day had earlier been escorted out of the hospital for being unruly.

Security took Mr Day, who was 'heavily intoxicated', to a bus stop so he could make his way home. Five minutes later he was hit by the car. Earlier in the day, he had been picked up by an ambulance in Ancoats, Manchester. Paramedics took him to the MRI but within half an hour of his arrival security had been asked to remove Mr Day for being 'unruly', police have been told. Mrs Day added: 'I am a bit annoyed.

Shoppers could be banned from buying hair bleach, nail varnish remover and drain cleaners under new anti-terrorism proposals. The Home Office is examining ways to restrict the availability of chemicals which would-be terrorists could use to manufacture explosives. Yesterday it published proposals to inhibit the sale of chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide, which is found in home hair dyeing kits, disinfectants and fish tank cleaner, and acetone, found in nail varnish remover and used to remove popular gel nail polish. New anti-terrorism proposals would limit the sale of hydrogen peroxide, pictured, which can be used to make explosives . Under the new proposals, the public could be banned from buying them altogether, or would be required to obtain a licence before buying them.  Another suggestion is that purchasers would have to give their name and address to the retailers at the till. The plans have been published as a part of a European Union drive to limit the availability of chemicals that can be used in terrorism. Drawn up after a consultation, the Home Office proposal says: 'Further Government intervention is necessary to deter and detect terrorist acquisition of explosive precursors, and to comply with EU law.' It aims not just to prevent terrorist attacks, but to alert authorities to anyone planning such attacks. A list of chemicals whose sale would be restricted includes hydrogen peroxide, used in home bleach, fish tank cleaner, wound disinfectant, metal etching kits and swimming pool and hot tub cleaners, and nitromethane, used as fuel for model engines. Potassium chlorate and sodium chlorate, used in weedkiller and home fireworks, are on the list, which also includes acetone, used in nail varnish remover, sulphuric acid, found in drain and swimming pool cleaner, and hexamine, found in camping fuel tablets. This CCTV still shows Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, right, and Muktar Said Ibrahim buying hydrogen peroxide two dates before the 7/7 London terror attacks . The Home Office proposal says: 'In the UK and globally, explosives have been the terrorist’s weapon of choice for many years. 'Homemade explosives have been part of over 70% of UK homeland attacks since the late 1990s.  They are capable of causing mass harm and significant infrastructure damage. 'Some of the chemicals used to make the explosives used in the attacks also have legitimate uses in the home. It is important that we protect against their misuse, whilst still allowing legitimate use.' Muslim extremists behind the 7/7 terror attacks on London in 2005 used bombs made with hydrogen peroxide from hair dye.  The attacks left 52 people dead and more than 700 injured. These are among the chemicals whose sale might be restricted under new proposals from the Home Office, and their main uses: . Hydrogen peroxide: Fish tank cleaner, wound disinfectant, metal etching, cleaning and treatment, bleaching agent . Nitromethane: Model engine fuel . Nitric acid: Metal etching . Potassium chlorate: Pyrotechnics, herbicide . The proposed legislation would see restrictions on a raft of chemicals currently available on the open market .

School run road rage between two mothers ended in violence when one attacked her rival’s vehicle with a car jack. Rachael Harding, 33, and Charmaine Smith parked their cars facing one other after dropping off their children at St Kentigern’s school in Fallowfield, Manchester. Because of the parked cars on either side of the road, neither was able to get past unless one of them agreed to back down and reverse. School gates: Harding and Mrs Smith had dropped their children at St Kentigern's school in Manchester but both refused to reverse after they parked their cars facing one another - but both refused to reverse . After a brief stand-off, Harding lost her temper and began mouthing obscenities from the driver’s seat, Manchester magistrates court heard. She eventually got out of her car armed with the jack and struck Mrs Smith’s car twice, denting the bonnet both times. Harding then went to the driver’s window and lashed out again, causing minor damage. When the traffic cleared, Harding drove away but stopped briefly and spat on Mrs Smith’s windscreen and warned her ‘I’ll ******* get you’ and ‘I’m going to **** you up’. When police investigated the incident on Bethnall Drive, officers attempted to resolve it using the restorative justice process. However, this proved impossible when Harding refused to admit her role in the argument. And when the case came to court, she did not turn up for the hearing and was convicted in her absence of causing criminal damage and threatening behaviour.

Harding, of Fallowfield, turned up to be sentenced and was ordered to carry out 60 hours of unpaid work, pay £200 compensation for the car damage and another £50 for the stress caused to Mrs Smith, who was not charged in relation to the incident. Magistrates told Harding: 'These are very serious charges and you could have ended up in custody.' From the dock, Harding still continued to maintain her innocence and said she would appeal against the sentence. She added: 'I feel I have been treated in an unfair and unjust way.' Harding was unavailable for comment after the case.","Rachael Harding and Charmaine Smith parked their cars facing one another after dropping off their children but neither agreed to reverse .

Hours later, Michelle Young was £20million richer but her cheery grin had been replaced with a look of disgust. After an ‘extraordinary’ legal fight that has spanned more than six years, 65 hearings and cost millions of pounds – Mrs Young, 49, has finally won her right to a slice of her estranged husband’s fortune. Warring: Scot, left, and his estranged wife Michelle, right, pictured arriving at the High Court in London today. She has always maintained that her husband was hiding his assets . Yesterday a judge ruled that ‘fixer . for the super-rich’ Scot Young, 51, appeared to have hidden around . £45million from the court. He gave the wife £20million, despite the fact . that she told the court she needed enough money to buy a £25million . mansion in London’s exclusive Belgravia. But the judge launched a scathing . attack on the Youngs, saying he felt ‘nothing but sympathy’ for their . two children, and criticising the warring couple for failing to be . ‘child-focused’. In his ruling, Mr Justice Moor said: ‘It is undoubtedly the most difficult financial remedy case I have ever come across. ‘This case has been extraordinary even . by the standards of the most bitter matrimonial breakdowns. Extremely . serious allegations have been bandied around like confetti. ‘Some of these allegations can only be described as “wild”. The case has cost the wife millions in litigation fees. ‘In many respects this is about as bad an example of how to litigate as I have encountered.’ He finished by saying: ‘Finally, I . feel nothing but sympathy for the two children of these parties. Through . no fault of their own, their parents’ marriage broke down. ‘A marital breakdown is distressing . enough for any child, but for the divorce to then be played out in the . full glare of the media must have been absolutely appalling for them. ‘What has occurred has not been . child-focused. I truly hope that the parents will reflect on this. I . hope it does not happen to any other children.’ Speaking outside the . court, Mrs Young – who has been refusing to finalise the divorce until . the finances are resolved – said: ‘It is a disgrace. I stand by what I . said. He is worth billions. Life of luxury: Michelle Young, pictured on the runway in Barbados with Scot and their daughter after their flight on Concorde. She told the trial they went on four exotic holidays a year . I feel nothing but sympathy for the two children. This must have been absolutely appalling for them . Mr Justice Moor . ‘Many people will be watching this and . think it’s a fortune but all this order is is a piece of paper. This . isn’t over. Not for me. Not for my two daughters and not for Mr Young.’ Asked about his wife’s reaction to the ruling, Mr Young said: ‘Disgraceful? That was my wife’s quote was it? No comment.’ Mrs Young had demanded half her . husband’s assets, claiming that he was worth ‘a few billion pounds at . least’ but had hidden away his cash in a series of secret investments. He was said to have created a business . structure called ‘Project Marriage Walk’ to hide assets from his wife . as their marriage hit the rocks.

Moving on: Scot Young pictured his model and TV presenter girlfriend Noelle Reno . After employing 13 sets of lawyers and . four teams of accountants, she remains convinced that property tycoon . Mr Young’s claims of bankruptcy are ‘lies’. But handing down his ruling, Mr . Justice Moor said: ’Doing as best as I can, I find that he still has . £45million hidden from this court. ‘The wife is entitled to a lump sum of . £20million. I can see no reasons why the husband should not pay the sum . quickly – I therefore order him to pay within 28 days.’ He added: ‘I have rejected all the more fanciful allegations made against him. ‘I cannot see how he would have . complied with an order for a lump sum of £300million let alone . £400million. I hope that he will take the view that he is better off . paying the lower sum of £20million so that he can concentrate on . rebuilding his life.’ After beginning their relationship in . 1989 and having two daughters, the Youngs had bought a home in London, a . mansion in Oxfordshire,  luxurious residences around the globe and . travelled by  private jet. But after they separated in 2006 a . bitter battle for cash began. Mr Young offered his wife a £300million . settlement on 25 August 2009 – but the next year insisted that he had . suffered a financial ‘meltdown’. The court heard a further claim that . Mr Young had then suggested another offer of £27million, saying that . ‘only a greedy cow would refuse that’. By DAVID WILKES . This isn't over: Speaking outside court today Michelle Young said she was furious and branded the judgment 'disgraceful' They enjoyed a lifestyle known only by the world’s wealthiest, globe-trotting by private jet between their vast homes. Inhabiting a world few people can imagine, Scot and Michelle Young mixed in a superleague of power players. But as details of their fantastic riches were aired in court during one of Britain’s most acrimonious and colourful divorce battles, perhaps the most eyebrow-raising moment was the revelation of the largesse of Mr Young’s friends after the marriage fell apart. In a statement to the court, retail tycoon Sir Philip Green said he had loaned Mr Young £80,000 in 2008 ‘as a favour’ to help pay for a Regent’s Park flat for Mrs Young. Restaurateur Richard Caring confirmed that he loaned Mr Young £50,000 as he had known him for many years and wanted to help him through his financial difficulties. Mrs Young, 49, sensationally alleged that the two men, along with X Factor impresario Simon Cowell and the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky were involved in a conspiracy to hide her husband’s assets. Her bombshell claim to the High Court came as she pursued former property developer Mr Young for part of the billions of pounds she said he had hidden. But Mr Young, 51, said he was left penniless after the collapse of a Moscow deal that cost him his entire fortune virtually overnight. She even alleged her husband was a major shareholder with Cowell’s American Idol show, and added: ‘I am told I will never find out the truth because these people are wealthy and powerful.’ Mr Young, a former fixer to the super-rich, told the court his wife’s claims were those of a ‘fantasist’ and rejected her accusation that his friends were ‘sheltering’ his money. He had met Cowell fewer than five times and had ‘never had any business with him’, and it was ‘laughable’ that he had a secret shareholding American Idol. Mr Young claimed he had ‘probably bumped into Sir Philip in the street once and seen him outside a nightclub once’ in two years. He said he had had no income since 2006 and was living ‘with the support of friends’. Sir Philip, Mr Cowell, Mr Caring and Mr Berezovsky, who was found hanged at his Ascot mansion earlier this year, all dismissed her allegations of a conspiracy. In his ruling yesterday, the judge said that he ‘entirely and unreservedly’ accepted the evidence given to the court by Sir Philip and Mr Caring about their loans to Mr Young. Before their split, the couple lived in unimaginable luxury. They owned six mansions in Belgravia, Britain’s most exclusive postcode, and the family home was £21million Wood Perry House in Oxfordshire, described as ‘Buckingham Palace in miniature’. They also had a £3.5million beach house in Miami, a yacht in Monaco, employed a small army of servants and housekeepers, and dined in the finest restaurants. They drove fabulous cars, including two Mercedes Gullwings worth £700,000 each. Mr Young had a £70,000 watch, and said jewellery he bought for his wife’s 40th cost £150,000.","Michelle Young had demanded half her husband Scot's .

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 23:12 EST, 20 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:24 EST, 21 November 2013 . A nearly two-year investigation into the death of a 19-year-old Ohio man has concluded that an accidental, self-inflicted gunshot wound killed him - even as his family continue to suspect that it was a murder. State Attorney General Mike DeWine's office had investigated the March 2012 shooting death of Jacob Limberios and had called a grand jury to consider testimony. Authorities said Wednesday that the grand jury declined to bring charges against anyone in the case. The news comes just days after the Dr . Phil show aired an episode in which two witnesses who saw Limberios die . failed a polygraph test. Gone before his time: Ohio officials concluded that Jacob Limberios, 19, pictured here with his young daughter, died from an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound in 2012 . Witnesses: Brittany Bowers (left) and Will Lewis (right) were partying with Limberios and another friend on the night of March 12, 2012, when Jacob allegedly shot himself . Fire power: Limberios was allegedly seen scratching his head with his magnum revolver just moments before the weapon fired . The Sandusky County coroner had ruled the death a suicide but also said the teen might not have known the gun was loaded. His parents, Michael and Shannon Limberios, fought that ruling and hired their own forensic pathologist to do an autopsy. Tireless campaign: Jacob's parents, Michael and Shannon Limberios, have questioned the investigation findings, which initially concluded that their son committed suicide . He concluded the death was a homicide after the teen's body was exhumed last fall. In a statement released today by DeWine's office, the attorney general said that officials have gathered new evidence showing that Limberios ‘was likely holding the weapon at very close range when it fired accidentally without a trigger pull.’ ‘In my opinion, we won today,’ Limberios’ mother told The News Messenger. ‘We always knew it was an accident. It was not a suicide.’ DeWine went on to state that investigators found that Limberios’ gun had a faulty safety mechanism. ‘What happened on March 2, 2012, was a horrible tragedy,’ said Mr DeWine. ‘However, we believe that Jacob Limberios did not intend to kill himself. His gun can fire without a trigger pull, and that put him in mortal danger. ‘Jacob Limberios did not commit suicide,’ DeWine stated. ‘He died in a horrible accident.’ Limberios' friends Brittany Bowers and William Lewis appeared on the Dr Phil talk show, which was taped in September but broadcast Friday, to answer questions about the night of March 12, 2012, when the young father allegedly shot himself, The News Messenger reported. The pair agreed to undergo a lie detector test, which indicated that both Bowers and Lewis were deceptive when they answered 'yes' to questions about whether the 19-year-old Castania man killed himself. Shocking outcome: Bowers and Lewis submitted to a lie detector test on the Dr Phil Show, which indicated that both were deceitful when they answered that Limbers shot himself . When faced with the results of the test, Bowers turned defensive, suggesting they were invalid. ‘Jacob, why the [expletive] are you doing this to me? Why?’ Bowers said, as she looked up. ‘Thank you for making my life hell.’ In 2012, Bowers and Lewis took polygraph tests and passed, although the validity of those results has since been called into question. According to official reports, on March 12, 2012, Jacob, Lewis and another friend, Evan Neidler, gathered in Bowers' home in York Township for a party, where alcohol was served. All four fired Limberios' .357 magnum revolver in the backyard before coming inside. At around 9.30pm, Limberios allegedly took the gun and fired, striking himself in the right side of the head. Gun enthusiast: Officials concluded that Limberios' revolver had a faulty safety mechanism, which made it possible for the gun to discharge without having its trigger pulled . Reckless: Attorney General DeWine said Limberios was handling his gun in an unsafe manner . Without examining the body, a coroner concluded that the 19-year-old man, who was engaged and had a young daughter, died of a suicide. That is what was written on his death certificate that was mailed to his parents. However, Mike and Shannon Limberios were certain that one of their son's friends accidentally shot the 19-year-old. ‘We’ve made it clear from day one that we did not want to see anyone go to jail for this,’ Mrs Limberios told Dr Phil McGraw. ‘I have not changed my mind about that.’ Will Lewis insisted that he is not concealing any information from the victim’s family, and that he has been telling them the truth from ‘day one.’ Attorney General DeWine said Bowers and Lewis told police that Jacob appeared to be scratching his head with the firearm before it discharged. He added that the 19-year-old gun enthusiast 'was consistently handling this weapon in an unsafe manner.' DeWine also said the lie detector tests played no role in the investigation findings.","Jacob Limberios, 19, died from gunshot wound to the head March 12, 2012 .

Investigators told a woman who was allegedly assaulted by Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston that her life 'would be made miserable' in the 'football town' if she reported the alleged attack. The accusation was made by family members of the alleged victim on Wednesday. According to ESPN, the player's DNA has been found on the underwear of the accuser in relation to the attack which allegedly took place last year. Allegations: Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston smiled on the sidelines of a recent game but is now fighting serious claims . The quarterback has been accused of sexually assaulting the woman at an off-campus apartment in the early morning hours of Dec 7, 2012. The woman immediately contacted police and was cooperative with their investigation, said the family statement first published by the Tampa Bay Times. When the FSU player was identified as her attacker, her ‘family grew concerned that she would be targeted on campus,’ the statement continued, adding that a lawyer was retained. A detective ‘told the attorney that Tallahassee was a big football town’ and that the victim should give her allegations some thought because ‘her life will be made miserable.’ Despite the allegations being made almost a year ago, police only referred it to a court last week. ‘Everybody wants to know what's going on,’ William Meggs, state attorney for the 2nd Judicial Circuit told ESPN. ‘So do we. We're in the process of trying to figure out what's going on,’ he added. ESPN said they had seen the DNA analysis report undertaken by the Florida state crime lab. The alleged victim carried out a sex assault test at the time of the alleged incident. The presence of DNA is not an indication of sex assault but does suggest the football player had sexual relations with his accuser. Under investigation: The team have stopped the quarterback from answering questions about the assault at their press conferences . Meggs told ESPN that investigators plan to use a combination of physical evidence and testimony to determine their course of action. Officials blamed the delay on the accuser abandoning her cooperation with police in February. ‘In February 2013, the case was classified as open, but inactive, when the victim in the case broke off contact with TPD, and her attorney indicated she did not want to move forward at that time,’ a spokesperson told ESPN. Accused: Mr Winston can outrun anyone on a football field, but he hasn't yet been able to distance himself from allegations almost a year old . Winston made his customary media appearance Wednesday before Saturday’s game, but the school prohibited him from answering any questions related to the investigation, according to ESPN. He will be the starting quarterback for this weekend’s game against the University of Idaho.","Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston is accused of sexually assaulting a woman last December .

Freak accident: John Fozard, 66, was fatally cut by a broken wine glass which tore through the bin bag he was carrying . A man died in a 'freak accident' when a broken wine glass ripped through the bin bag he was carrying and severed an artery in his leg. Bus enthusiast John Fozard, 66, lived alone on Anglesey, Wales, and was unable to stem the cut he suffered as he took out his rubbish. The father-of-one was discovered lying surrounded by blood on his bathroom floor in May, after a worried next-door neighbour looked through his windows. The neighbour, Gwyndaf Rowlands, told an inquest: 'There were pools of blood everywhere, splattered over the door . and walls. I phoned for the police and paramedics.' Retired Mr Fozard, who gave up his job as a bus engineer to photograph historic vehicles full-time, suffered an inch-and-a-half cut just above the knee which severed a femoral artery. The artery is one of the largest in the human body and carries blood to the legs and feet from the heart. PC Daniel Doughty, who found Mr Fozard in the bathroom, said the bath was full of water and the carpet soaked. He added: 'It looked like he had tried to mop up his own blood. 'It would appear he was trying to do something, possibly confused. 'There was a broken wine glass recovered from a bin bag in the kitchen - it looked as though he had tried to empty the bin.' Pathologist Dr Mark Lord added: 'If he had reached emergency services on the phone they may have been able to identify a pressure point. 'But the speed with which it bled may not have given him time to reach the phone.' Bus . and train enthusiasts paid tribute to Mr Fozard, who was born in West . Yorkshire where he lived for more than 50 years before moving to the . Anglesey village of Llanerchymedd. The road where Mr Fozard lived alone in the village of Llanerchymedd on Anglesey, Wales . He had bought several buses, starting in 1975 with a South Yorkshire Albion coach which he named Cyril and drove across Britain. Later he ran a model railway firm called North Eastern Design. His friend Hugh Taylor, 68, was working with him to restore a rare Glasgow tram which is due to be displayed at the East Anglia Transport Museum. He told MailOnline: 'His knowledge will be greatly missed. He had a lot of contacts who were customers and friends. It was a real shock. 'He was very knowledgeable about every kind and type of bus and tram and trolley bus throughout the British Isles. He could identify pictures just at a glance and that was wonderful. 'It was a freak accident. He was taking rubbish out to the bin and there was some broken glass in the rubbish bag and as he was going out the shard cut him in his leg.' A tribute posted on Mr Taylor's website by Mr Fozard's son Simon said: 'Over the last few years, John enjoyed time with his new partner, Judy, and her family. They spent many happy hours walking around Anglesey and North Wales, including climbing Mount Snowdon. 'John will be remembered by many people, all of which will probably think of him in a different way. 'Undoubtedly, many will remember him for his time keeping, ""I'll be there around 12.00ish"" which could mean any time from 12.00pm to 12.59pm, and his laid back attitude. 'Others may remember him with his yellow coat on, camera round neck, photographing trains.' Coroner Dewi Pritchard-Jones, recording a verdict of accidental death, said: 'It would appear he tried to deal with the injury but failed to do so and eventually collapsed in the bathroom from the loss of blood.'","John Fozard, 66, lived alone on Anglesey, Wales and died in his bathroom .

A gravedigger has lost his job of 40 years after a photograph of him standing half-naked in a burial plot was deemed offensive and provoked outcry among local newspaper readers. Ray Loxton, 59, was pictured in his local newspaper smiling, while standing topless inside a grave on a hot summers day. He was also shielding his eyes from the sun with his hand - which some readers of the Shepton Mallet Journal, which covers his hometown in Somerset, mistook to be a cheery salute. Grave situation: Gravedigger Ray Loxton lost his job of 40 years after this picture of him in a grave was deemed offensive by local paper readers who thought he was saluting . Mr Loxton says he has now been told his services for one funeral director are no longer required because of the media attention. He said: 'It was a hot summer day in June and I was actually digging a grave for one of my old friends. 'A photographer came by and asked if it would be ok to take a picture. The sun was in my eyes so I put my hand up to stop myself being blinded. 'Some people thought I was saluting and they wrote to the local paper. 'After that I noticed I wasn’t getting any work from one of the funeral directors so I called them up and asked what was going on. 'They told me that they had found someone else because of all the attention I had in the media. 'I am very hurt, very upset. I haven’t had a cross word with them in the last 30 years. I did a good job and they never had a bad word to say about my work.' In too deep: Mr Loxton, who was digging the grave for his friend, said that no offence was intended by the picture and that he was simply stopping the bright sun from blinding him . The picture, printed in the Shepton Mallet Journal in July, was taken by photographer Jason Bryant for the 'picture of the week' section of the paper. It was viewed by more than 15,000 people both in the newspaper and online. However, one reader, Holger Harras of Evercreech, Somersert, wrote a letter of objection under the headline ‘Picture in poor taste’. It read: 'Has your photographer run out of favourite places to take photos that he has to stoop himself and prowl around cemeteries taking photos of a half naked gravedigger and calling this his ""favourite picture going down the dead men”? 'How must the grieving family feel for whose relative Ray Loxton is digging the grave, knowing that Mr Loxton has been photographed half naked and saluting in their relative’s grave. 'Isn’t there nothing more sacred than man’s and woman’s last resting place?' Mr Bryant defended the picture and said that as Mr Loxton was a 'local legend' he felt that digging the graves would make a nice newspaper feature. Interest: Photographer Jason Bryant said that as Mr Loxton was a 'local legend' he felt that grave digging would make a good newspaper feature . He said: 'Every week we have a picture of the week in the paper I work for, I had seen Ray digging graves quite often and decided to take a picture of it. 'After it was printed it sparked a bit of outrage, there was a letter complaining about it in the paper the following week. 'He’s an absolute legend. He’s a really popular guy.' Several readers also jumped to Mr Loxton’s defence. Steve Wilson, licencee of the King’s Head pub in Wells, wrote: 'Everyone has a right to be happy in their work, whether that be digging graves or delivering babies. 'What would they prefer, that Ray Loxton forces himself to cry while digging each grave and then self-flagellates with his shovel afterwards?' WJ Trotman, the funeral directors which has now stopped using Mr Loxton, declined to comment today. However, John Weir from the National Society of Independent Funeral Directors said: “Trotmans have taken a commercial decision - they are reviewing their business practices generally.”","Ray Loxton had been digging graves in Shepton Mallet for 40 years .

The amazing story of how a struggling army recruit emerged to play a key role in tracking down Saddam Hussein reads like a Hollywood movie script, and that’s exactly what Eric Maddox’s life story is soon to become. As a military interrogator in the Iraqi backwater of Tikrit, Maddox was forced to develop his own methods of getting information from the locals after the techniques he’d learned in the army failed miserably. But by going against what the military had taught him, Maddox secured the ultimate success and got the information that led U.S. troops to capture Hussein in December 2003. The story of how struggling army recruit Eric Maddox from Oklamhoma emerged as a key player in tracking down Saddam Hussein reads like a Hollywood movie script . It was all a very long way from Maddox’s inauspicious starts as a struggling new recruit some ten years before. After graduating from the University of Oklahoma in 1994, Maddox claims that a voice from God told him to become an army Airborne Ranger, even though he'd never shot a gun and was terrified of heights. ‘Every day of Ranger School, I was like, “are you sure?” - I barely passed,’ Maddox recently recalled to News9. Next he decided to become an army interrogator after someone convinced him that it would be an easy ride. In Mission: Blacklist, due out next year, Robert Pattinson will play Eric Maddox in the improbable story of how he tracked down Saddam Hussein in 2003 . Maddox said, ‘They told me, “Be an interrogator. That's the easiest one. It's eight weeks of training. You'll never have to do it. We don't have any prisoners"".' But then came the events of September 11, 2001 and everything changed. U.S. forces invaded Iraq in March 2003 and Maddox was sent to Tikrit, Hussein's hometown, to interrogate prisoners who were captured on raids by Special Forces teams. Maddox admits he failed miserably when he first started. He said: 'The really scary part was when I realized not only had I not done an interrogation but, when I started doing them, they didn't work.' Fortunately, Tikrit was considered a backwater and so he was left to develop his own technique. 'It was the best thing that happened to me because there were no expectations,' Maddox said. 'I could figure out how to get the prisoners to talk without torturing them.' Maddox soon discovered that he his technique also worked. He had a natural ability for taking tiny bits of information from hundreds of prisoners and being able to piece it together to reveal the bigger picture. He said: 'I went to the team leader and made a pitch - ""I know this sounds crazy, but I think I have a path that, if we follow, might possibly lead us to Black List No.1 [Saddam]"".' Rather than focusing on high-profile targets, Maddox spoke with bodyguards, chauffeurs and shopkeepers and slowly more of the bigger picture emerged. Then just as he was due to leave for Doha, Qatar, Maddox finally came face-to-face with his No.1 target - a personal bodyguard of Saddam. With only two hours to convince the bodyguard to talk before he had to leave for the airport, Maddox told him to 'beat on his cell' if he decided to change his mind and talk. The scene where U.S. troops captured ousted Iraqi President Hussein in December 2003, it was vital information found out by Maddox that lead to Saddam's capture . He said: 'As I'm driving to the airplane to leave the country, they told me, ""That prisoner. What did you do? He's going crazy, beating the heck out of his cell in there"".' Maddox got the prisoner to sketch a map detailing Saddam's location, which lead to his historic capture. Maddox said: 'It took me several years to come to the conclusion I wasn't going to wake up from a dream.' He now lives in Houston and continues to work for the Department of Defense. A couple of years ago he wrote a book that a movie studio immediately bought the rights to. Mission: Blacklist is currently in pre-production, with Robert Pattinson set to play Maddox. It is expected to be released next year.","Eric Maddox is the army interrogator who uncovered vital information that lead to the capture of Saddam Hussein .

A wheelchair-bound woman has managed to walk down the aisle unaided after beating a crippling spinal disease - by becoming a bodybuilder. Lisa Bradley, 28, could barely lift herself out of bed and needed 24-hour care after she was diagnosed with a rare condition which causes cysts to develop in the spinal cord. But when a series of operations and daily cocktail of drugs failed to ease her constant pain she decided on a completely new approach and struggled to the gym. Lisa Bradley, 28, overcame a crippling spinal condition, that left her in a wheelchair, to walk down the aisle . The mother-of-three worked with a personal trainer and began lifting tiny weights but was soon pulling off squats, bench presses and bicep curls as her symptoms eased. In just six months she shed a staggering 10 dress sizes - as her growing strength combated her illness. And to the delight of her family she proudly walked down the aisle on the arm of her father, Pat, as she married her partner, Derry Bradley, 34, in December last year. Mrs Bradley said: ‘It was amazing to be able to walk down the aisle - I nearly ran it. ‘I had no pain whatsoever and felt so confident. My GP is completely amazed and can’t believe the difference in me. ‘My condition got so severe, it would hurt if I sneezed or moved my toes. I needed assistance for everything, even moving in bed. Mrs Bradley has a condition - called syringomyelia - which causes cysts to develop in her spinal cord causing pain, muscle weakness and even paralysis . ‘I’ve gone from needing 24-hour care and being pushed in a wheelchair to training twice a day six times a week. ‘I no longer have any pain and have come off my medication - and it’s all down to pumping iron.’ Mrs Bradley, who is mother to Brannan, 10, Olan, three, and Allayna, two, was diagnosed with syringomyelia in 2009 after suffering years of chronic back pain and shaking in her legs. The rare disease causes cysts to grow in the spinal cord - these can eventually damage it and leave the sufferer paralysed. The condition became so severe she was confined to a wheelchair and needed 24-hour care. She piled on the pounds to become a size 22 because the condition left her unable to take any exercise . When she got engaged, she decided to try and improve her health so she started going to the gym. Starting with very small weights, she gradually built up her strength . Symptoms usually develop slowly over time and include muscle weakness, decreased sensitivity to pain, loss of reflexes, stiffness, pain and numbness. It is not known exactly what causes it but it can result from meningitis, spinal cord tumours and injuries. Mrs Bradley underwent two major spinal operations, including one to drain fluid from a cyst in her spine, but her body became frail and ballooned to a size 22 because of the lack of exercise. At the height of her illness she was . forced to endure regular painkilling injections and was on a daily . cocktail of tablets, patches and injections. Mrs Bradley says that as a result of her workouts she is no longer in pain and is able to walk again . Mrs Bradley said: 'My condition got so severe, it would hurt if I sneezed or moved my toes. I needed assistance for everything, even moving in bed' She decided to try the bodybuilding approach after agreeing to marry Mr Bradley - and now intends to keep up her training for life because it’s the only thing keeping her condition at bay. In fact, she’s so proud of her new muscles she’s entering a bodybuilding show next year. Ms Bradley, who lives in Cork, Ireland, said: ‘I have no intention of giving up, I want to continue working with my personal trainer and break even more barriers. ‘I feel like it’s saved my life. I can do everything I want with my kids and am able to get the most out of life. Before taking up bodybuilding, Mrs Bradley had to undergo two major spinal operations and she took a cocktail of drugs every day but these treatments failed to remove her pain or muscle weakness . Mrs Bradley said: 'I've gone from needing 24-hour care and being pushed in a wheelchair to training twice a day six times a week' ‘I was determined not to let my children grow up watching me in pain and unable to move.’ Mrs Bradley sought help from top personal trainer Joe Binley, who specialises in training bodybuilders on how to eat healthily and get into shape for contests. Joe, based in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, said: ‘Lisa is one of the most dedicated people I’ve dealt with. ‘She has a deep rooted determination to succeed. In a scenario when most would quit Lisa has chosen to fight.’ Syringomyelia is the development of a fluid-filled cyst in the spinal cord. As the cyst grows it can cause pain, muscle weakness and stiffness. It can also cause loss of reflexes, loss of sensitivity to pain, numbness and spinal curvature. The condition can be caused by spinal cord tumours, meningitis and spinal cord injuries. If the condition is not causing the sufferer any problems then no treatment will be required. In more severe cases, surgery is sometimes needed. Source: Mayo Clinic .","Lisa Bradley has a condition which causes cysts to grow in her spinal cord .

Drowned: Ben Morgan, 26, died while swimming after suffering cramp just six inches out of his depth, an inquest heard . A swimmer drowned in a lake after suffering cramp while just six inches out of his depth, an inquest heard. Ben Morgan, 26, who was on a Bank Holiday family day out, suddenly disappeared from view as his mother watched him in the water. Although the emergency services were called, he could not be found in the water at Llyn Syfydrin, near Aberystwyth, Wales. Police divers were called in and his body was recovered the following day, the inquest heard. Peter Brunton, the . coroner for Ceredigion, said on the balance of probabilities Ben . had died after suffering an attack of the cramp while in the water on . August 26. 'That is the only reasonable explanation. The onset would be very sudden, and incapacitating,' he said. 'He was six to eight inches out of his depth, that is all, but sufficient if unable to continue swimming.' Sergeant Sian Davies said the weather was clear and sunny on the August Bank Holiday Monday. She added that although the water was not rough, there was a strong current. Ben's mother Sarah Jane had watched her son swimming towards a grassy island and he was about 20 metres away from it when he disappeared. Search operation: A police officer stands near the water as a search operation got underway for missing Ben Morgan. His body was later recovered from the water by a dive team . Hunt: Police searched the area on Bank Holiday weekend but could not find missing Ben. His body was discovered face down in the water the following day . Lake victim: Ben, 26, is thought to have got into difficulties after suffering cramp in the water . She looked away, and when she turned back he was gone. The next day underwater search team diver PC Hefin Morgan found Ben's body face down at the bottom of the lake. Ben was 5ft 10inches tall and the water was around 6ft 2in deep in the area the body was found. In statements, Mrs Morgan, and Ben’s twin brother Daniel, said he was 'a good swimmer'. Daniel had been swimming earlier but had stopped for fear of getting cramp in his legs. A post-mortem, by Dr Huyam Abdelsalam, revealed the cause of death was drowning. The coroner ruled that the death of Ben, from Penbontrhydybeddau, near Penrhyncoch, was an accident. Andy Bakewell, manager of WiseWoods Wales sawmills where Ben was learning woodland skills, said: 'Ben joined us in September 2012. He loved the woods, and we really appreciated him.

A mother has been left devastated by a rare condition that leaves her barely able to cuddle her children. Emily Comber, 31, suffers from a rare syndrome that causes her constant pain and makes her joints ‘pop out’ up to five times a day. It means she can barely pick up her one-year-old son Reuben and has even dislocated her shoulder changing a nappy. Emily Comber (pictured with her husband, James) has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome which means the collagen in her body is weak so her joints dislocate easily and she is in constant pain . Mrs Comber suffers from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome - a genetic condition which means the collagen in her body is too weak to hold her limbs in place. The mother-of-two from Bude, Cornwall, said: ‘My ribs have popped out when I’ve been picking Reuben up out of his cot and I’ve even dislocated my wrist and thumb when changing his nappy. ‘My ribs go multiple times a day - it can be something small that sets them off like just shutting a car door. ‘It leaves me in so much pain, it’s like popping the lid on a jar, but now I’ve learned to deal with it better. It was much worse when I was younger and they didn’t know what was happening. ‘On my worst days it hurts just to breathe.’ Mrs Comber suffers from type three Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which means she suffers from joint hypermobility and has long arms and legs. Mrs Comber's joints 'pop out' up to five times a day and she has dislocated her shoulder, wrist and thumb changing her son's nappy. She is pictured with her children, Ruben, one, and Finlay, three . She has suffered from the condition since she was a child, but it is notoriously difficult to diagnose. It was only when she became pregnant with her first child, Finlay, now three, that she was diagnosed. Mrs Comber said: ‘I was in agony. I couldn’t walk. I got referred to a specialist and they were sure I had it as soon as I entered the office. ‘The situation was so bad I was bedbound for three weeks and they only rolled me once every 24 hours, but otherwise couldn’t move me until after the C-section. ‘I gave birth eight weeks early. They just had to get the baby out of me.’ Mrs Comber was diagnosed when she was pregnant with her first child, Finlay. During the pregnancy she was in so much pain she considered not having any more children but eventually decided to have Ruben (pictured) She added: ‘It’s a 50 per cent chance of passing it on to your children. We won’t know for sure until they get older, but Finlay is already showing symptoms. ‘It does worry me. I feel guilty. If either of them have got it then it’s come from me.’ Mrs Comber and her husband James, a builder, thought long and hard before having their second child after the strain it put on Mrs Comber’s body first time around. She said: ‘It did put us off having another child, but we planned everything the second time. We had a lot of special help. ‘We had Reuben four weeks early as a planned thing. We both knew what was happening at every stage of the pregnancy.’ Mrs Comber said: 'It leaves me in so much pain, it's like popping the lid on a jar, but now I've learned to deal with it better. It was much worse when I was younger and they didn't know what was happening' But since Reuben has been born the condition has presented itself in different ways and even picking the baby up out of his bed can leave her in agony. She now has a carer who helps her for 14 hours a week. She has also taken up dressage for people with disabilities and managed to walk down the aisle without her crutches. She said: ‘Originally I wanted to go away and get married somewhere where no-one could see us, but it was actually really nice. ‘I had to lean on my dad to get down the aisle and we sat for a lot of the service. Mrs Comber was so ill when she was pregnant with Finlay that she was bedbound for three weeks and he had to be delivered eight weeks early. He is pictured shortly after his birth . ‘James carried me for a lot of the day, but we were on the beach in the middle of a heat wave so it just looked normal. ‘It took me a week to recover. I’ve taken up para-dressage riding and it really helps. Along with my family it helps keep me sane. I think I would otherwise lose the plot with the high levels of pain.’ British actress Cherylee Housten, who plays Izzy Armstrong in Coronation Street, also suffers from EDS and is the ambassador for the charity Ehlers-Danlos Support UK. Lara Bloom, manager of the charity, said: ‘The condition affects the connective tissue in the body. It can cause problems with joints and internal organs. ‘The vascular form of the disease can also shorten life expectancy.’ For more information on EDS visit www.ehlers-danlos.org . Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of inherited conditions that affect collagen proteins in the body causing them to be weak. Typical features are stretchy skin, loose joints and fragile body tissues. Collagen is a building block that strengthens and supports various body tissues - it is found in tendons, ligaments, cartilage, skin, bone, blood vessels and the spine. EDS is caused by alterations in certain genes - these can be passed from parents to their children. The condition affects at least one person in every 5,000 in the UK. There are various different forms of EDS. All share some common features, such as loose joints, abnormal skin and fragile body tissues, but each form of EDS has unique characteristics too. The most severe form is Vascular EDS which causes the organs and blood vessels to be at risk of rupturing - this can be fatal. The life expectancy for people with Vascular EDS is in the 40s.

James Baines posted a picture purporting to be James Bulger's killer Jon Venables as an adult . A Twitter user who posted pictures purporting to be of James Bulger's killer Jon Venables as an adult has been given a 14-month suspended prison sentence. Security guard James Baines was handed the sentence, suspended for 15 months, at London's High Court for a flagrant contempt of court. Baines, who is from Liverpool and close to the Bulger family, will also have to pay £3,000 in costs. He admitted disobeying a January 2001 injunction binding on the whole world which prohibits the publication of any information alleging to identify the appearance, whereabouts, movements or new identities of Venables or Robert Thompson, who were convicted of the two-year-old’s murder in November 1993. It was made on the basis that the pair would face an acute risk of serious physical harm or death upon their release. The case was referred by Attorney General Dominic Grieve after Baines put images purporting to identify Venables as an adult on his Twitter profile on February 14 this year - the 20th anniversary of the crime. One image showed Venables in a school photograph as a child while below and alongside were different images of an adult male. They were accompanied by the tweet: 'Its on bbc news about the jon venables pic on twitter saying its been removed eerrm no it hasn't.' Jon Venables (left) and Robert Thompson must not be identified on the basis that the pair would face an acute risk of serious physical harm or death upon their release . The Attorney General said in a statement: 'It gives me no pleasure to bring a third case for breaching this injunction and I do so purely in the wider public interest. 'The order has been in place for many years and applies to both media organisations and individuals. The picture was posted on the 20th anniversary of Jamie Bulger's death . 'It is meant not only to protect Venables and Thompson but also those members of the public who have been incorrectly identified as being either of them.' Baines's counsel, Peter Lownds, said the tweet - posted two days after the actual anniversary of James’s death - came at a highly emotional time for the community. Baines, who attended the same school as cousins of the Bulger family, admitted that he went 'far too far'. 'He had a very strong emotional reaction to the anniversary. 'He accepts it is not an excuse for his behaviour but it is offered as some explanation for why he became involved in the very substantial social communication over Twitter and Facebook at about that time. 'He recognises and accepts that, whilst he is entitled to hold his strong views, he was completely wrong to do what he did on that day and was not entitled to take the law into his own hands.' He said the court had seen a letter from James’s father, Ralph, which was relevant to the situation and reflected discussions he had had with Baines. Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, sitting with Mr Justice Tugendhat, said that, after posting the tweet, Baines disregarded those who said he was wrong to do so and poured abuse on them. He maintained his defiant stance on Twitter and, the following month, said on Facebook that he had complete contempt for the police if they were to take action against him. He initially denied ownership of the Twitter account and, even after accepting the postings were his, said he had no knowledge of the injunction. Baines, who attended the same school as cousins of the Bulger family, admitted that he went 'far too far' 'There was an apology but it was substantially undermined by his failure to be candid with the court.' Lord Thomas said it was an extremely serious case with a number of serious aggravating features. 'He acted in flagrant breach of the Attorney General's injunction, knowing of it, and engaged himself in a determined campaign. 'He knew of the consequences and displayed an attitude to this court, the Attorney General and the police of complete contempt. 'Those who suggested he was in breach of the order were subjected to particularly unpleasant abuse. 'It also appeared that the purpose of his postings was to harm Jon Venables. 'The only conceivable mitigation was his admission two days ago that he had known all along and accepted the Attorney General's case in full.' Suspending the sentence with 'very very considerable hesitation', he said the fact that Baines was part of the Bulger family's community could not conceivably excuse his conduct, but might help to explain it.","James Baines admitted disobeying injunction which prohibits publication of information alleging to identify Jon Venables or Robert Thompson .

The decision to hire bankers from Goldman Sachs to advise on selling off Royal Mail was like giving Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs a job at Securicor, MPs claimed today. The powerful business select committee expressed astonishment that ministers did not know that Goldman Sachs was being sued for undervaluing a toy firm a decade ago. Business Secretary Vince Cable today admitted the buck stops with him for selling shares in the firm at £3.30, which have since surged to more than £5.65 today. Booming: Royal Mail revealed a doubling of profits today, as ministers and officials were grilled over the undervaluing of the firm when it was privatised last month . Goldman Sachs was a joint global co-ordinator of the float along with UBS. The two investment banks have been accused of getting the valuation ‘sizeably wrong’, with the firm priced at £3.3billion now valued at £5.6billion. Today Mr Cable was challenged on who signed off the price before the flotation last month. ‘Ultimately I did,’ he said. But MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills select committee challenged the minister and his officials over why Goldman Sachs was even involved in the process. Last month the firm agreed a $7.5million settlement over the 1999 flotation of the online toy seller eToys Inc, which it was claimed was undervalued by Goldman Sachs. Shares quadrupled in value when they began trading, but two years late the firm had gone bust. Grilling ministers and officials today, Labour MP Ann McKechin said: ‘Goldman Sachs has just settled a litigation case for £7.5m after it was accused of undervaluing an IPO. ‘Were any of you aware of this at the time when making your assessment of the share price, and if so had you taken this into account when you appointed them as one of the float co-ordinators.’ Mark Russell, chief executive of . Shareholder Executive which manages the government’s stake, admitted: . ‘To answer your question we were not aware of that.’ Committee . chairman Adrian Bailey said: ‘I find it quite astonishing that . something  that was publically available on Google should be understood . closely involved in the process. ‘From . outside I have to say that appointing Goldman Sachs on a flotation . given this court case is a bit like asking Ronnie Biggs to have an . appointment at Securicor.’ Committee chairman Adrian Bailey (left)  said it was astonishing that ministers did not know about the Goldman Sachs court case while Business Secretary Vince Cable (right) said the buck stops with him for valuing shares at £3.30 . Royal Mail shares continued to rise today after the newly-listed company posted a big jump in half-year profits. In . early trading today shares were selling at just over £5.60, some 70 per . cent higher than the £3.30 at its flotation last month. Committee chairman Adrian Bailey . With a market valuation of £5.5 billion, the company is on course to be admitted to the FTSE 100 Index in a reshuffle of the top flight next month. In its first set of results as a listed company, Royal Mail revealed operating profits nearly doubled to £283 million for the six months to September 29 from £144 million a year earlier, although figures were boosted by £95 million after a VAT credit and lower-than-expected costs of its overhaul programme. The parcels business saw sales volumes growth grind to a halt as the summer heatwave slowed online purchases, while Royal Mail also said the threat of strike action had since cost it business parcel customers in its key Christmas quarter. But the group said the recent launch of size-based pricing was offsetting the slowdown in demand and added the spate of energy bill hikes was benefiting its letter business in the second half as providers send out mailings to millions of customers. Mr Cable stuck by his previous description of the early gains as 'froth' and said the true value of the shares would not emerge for months. The minister also took issue with any suggestion that banks had acted illegally, and told the MPs that the sale was good for the taxpayer and for the future of the six day a week delivery service offered by the Royal Mail. 'This has been a very professional, well organised and successful operation,' he said.","Shares sold by government at £3.30 now worth more than £5.60 .

A woman who stabbed a man in the stomach because he told her she was 'fit' has been told to expect a lengthy prison sentence by a judge. Marie Watton, 25, was so offended when Jonathan Barras complemented her looks she stabbed him in the abdomen after sparking a violent pub brawl. The woman from Telford, Shropshire, was told to expect a 'double figure' sentence after pleading guilty to wounding with intent in Shrewsbury Crown Court. A group of Watton's friends attacked the victim in the Duke of York pub after he told her she was attractive on January 16. Barras punched one of the woman's friends amid the brawl, prompting Watton to go across the road to a friend's house to fetch a kitchen knife. When she returned, she stabbed the 27-year-old and tore through his liver, kidney and small bowel after seething: 'He is having it now'. Mr Barras required extensive medical treatment following the incident but has made a full recovery. Yesterday, Judge Robin Onions told the court: 'He said she was fit, didn't he? 'I though that was a compliment, isn't it?' Prosecuting Adam Warner said there was a 'significant degree of premeditation' to Watton's crime.

'Mr Barras punched Matty Warrender, a friend of Watton’s, hard on the nose and there was blood everywhere. 'Marie Watton saw that and immediately said ""he is having it now""'.

Plastic made from dead beetles could replace conventional environmentally damaging plastics, according to one scientist. Aagje Hoekstra uses dead darkling beetles to create biodegradable ‘insect plastic’ by melting together their shells and claims that with some research it could be one solution to reducing the amount of plastic waste dumped in landfill sites. The Dutch scientist currently uses her innovative material to craft unusual jewellery and lamps. Aagje Hoekstra uses dead darkling beetles to create biodegradable 'insect plastic' (pictured) by melting together their shells and claims it could be one solution to reducing the amount of plastic waste dumped in landfill sites . To make one small sheet of the plastic, called coleoptera, after the Greek word for beetle, Ms Hoekstra currently handpicks the shells from 2,500 dead beetles. The shells can then be moulded together to produce a piece of coleopteran 10 centimetres squared as they contain a natural plastic called chitin. Ms Hoekstra uses a chemical process to transform the chitin into chitosan, which bonds better due to a variation in the molecular composition. ‘I press these shields together with a heat press and I get the insect plastic. ‘It took me six months to develop the insect plastic what I have right now,’ she said.

A staggering 270,000 tonnes of the manmade non-biodegradable material is thrown away every year in the UK alone, which is around 15 million bottles per day. The beetle plastic is not only less wasteful as it is biodegradable, but the animals themselves are the byproduct of mealworms, which are farmed for pet food and bait and would otherwise be thrown away.

Ms Hoekstra said she was inspired by the rapid advance insects make in human consumption. ‘For that reason I started cultivate mealworms to see what other positive values insects have. ‘Mealworms are bred for the food industry, primarily for the use of animal feed, and are the larval form of the darkling beetle. ‘The beetles die three or four months after laying their eggs and are then seen as waste. I decided to research these dead beetles and found out that the beetle's shield contains a polymer called chitin, a type of natural plastic. The Dutch scientist uses the material, which took her six months to develop, to make laps and jewellery (pictured) but says she is still in the research phases . ‘I peel the dead beetles to get the shells off them.’ Ms Hoekstra said that while the insect plastic shows the recipe she uses works, she is still in the research phase. ‘I use this bioplastic for light objects and jewellery, but in future I want to use it for the non-biodegradable plastics,’ she said. ‘My next step is to research the properties of the material, so I know where I can use the material for. ‘The benefits of this material is that it's biodegradable and made of waste material. ‘My hope is that it could become a replacement for normal plastic.’ The shells from the dead beetles can be moulded together to produce a piece of coleopteran 10 centimetres squared as they contain a natural plastic called chitin .","Aagje Hoekstra uses dead darkling beetles to create biodegradable ‘insect plastic’ by melting and fusing together their shells .

If you choose to hand it in you will be given the form that entitles you to collect it after 28 days. If you don't report it to the Police, you are guilty of 'theft by finding' and can be charged. However, police cannot let finders keep unclaimed mobile phones or objects that may contain personal data, such as laptops or iPads.
